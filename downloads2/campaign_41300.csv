One was a black dial dive watch. It was my favorite, but the bezel had been ripped off somehow. The gaskets were inaccessible, irreplaceable, so I always worried water would damage it. It was a manual wind and sometimes I'd forget to wind it. </p><p>So, I went in search of an equivalent watch worn by pilots. Everything was vintage/fragile, too large, or just replicas only good for a water splash.</p><p>Not finding what I was looking for, we decided to design our own watch. </p><p>We figured we see if anyone else wanted to come along for the ride. We launched COURG in our first campaign, which backers fully funded within 3 hours.

NOTE: We've had to move Add-Ons from Indiegogo to the Backer Survey to ensure a smoother backer experience and clearer selections for you.  1. Problems. Solved.✅  Robust & Dependable vs. Vintage-Fragile     Built like a tank, with a workhorse movement rated to run twenty years before needing service.✅  Maximized Value vs. Overpriced      We cut out middlemen to maximize your value. But more than that, it means cutting out layers between us — so we can connect directly.✅   Crafted from Military-Grade Materials vs. Cheap Generic Parts      Aerospace-grade titanium, ultra-hard anti-reflective scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, super-bright luminous paint. Soft iron Faraday-Cage defeats the magnetic fields everywhere.✅  Focused Functional  vs. Jewelry       The uni-directional counterclockwise rotating diver bezel provides triple function of timer, countdown, and second time zone. Models with inner rotating bezels provide double bezel functions.✅   Essentialist Design vs. Trivial Distractions      WWII fighter pilot instrument dials and essential designs are the epitome of proven form and function. Why? We don't think watches need to be shiny, plastered with logos, cluttered with messy unnecessary text and difficult to read.✅   Integrated Date Window vs. Sloppy Date placement      Unobtrusive optimized design.✅   Automatic & Long Life vs. Hassle and charging drain       Powered by your movement and long-life batteries — instead of the pain of constant charging and the waste of frequent battery changes.  LOVE/HATE relationship with vintage watches. I inherited watches from my grandfather. One was a black dial dive watch. It was my favorite, but the bezel had been ripped off somehow. The gaskets were inaccessible, irreplaceable, so I always worried water would damage it. It was a manual wind and sometimes I'd forget to wind it. So, I went in search of an equivalent watch worn by pilots. Everything was vintage/fragile, too large, or just replicas only good for a water splash.Not finding what I was looking for, we decided to design our own watch. We figured we see if anyone else wanted to come along for the ride. We launched COURG in our first campaign, which backers fully funded within 3 hours. In all, more than 2,200 backers jumped on board.Now we're back with new pilot-diver hybrid designs, building on COURG, to further equip your missions. COURG was the first titanium automatic watch fully funded on crowdfunding. COURG was the first hybrid cockpit instrument fused with diver tools in a reasonable size for any wrist — male or female. 2. PATHFINDERS. Meet the new recruits.LIMITED EDITION — Many of the variants will not go into full production.  MISSION CRITICAL. ZERO DISTRACTION. BUT THE WATCH IS NOT THE POINT. YOU ARE.We exist to equip and encourage you to tackle your missions. We believe each one of you is called to glory -- to a life with meaning, adventure, and honor. And in turn, we believe you can bring powerful change to the world around you. Iconic WWI Trench + WWII Pilot Instruments Fused with Modern Science

Zero Distraction / High Visibility. Ultra matte black dial, zero distracting logos or other unnecessary complications. Day or night use with Superluminova lume.

Indomitable. Scratch-resistant, aerospace-grade titanium, and workhorse movements.

Triple-Function Mechanical Bezel. Stopwatch, countdown timer, second timezone.
A. We enlisted HONNRbecause HONOR is a core character trait on which we stand. We hold fast with integrity in the onslaught of cutting corners and “good enough” and instead illuminate the narrow path for those who seek.Inspired by WWII cockpit instruments and gauges.  The venerable A-13A and A-9 were military specs that served for decades as onboard nav tools in U.S. aircraft.Original A-13A Mil-Spec: HONNR + A-13A:
 
 
 A-9 Cockpit Clock: B. We enlisted SCOUTbecause we must go first, go ahead, and build the path for those who come after us, and while it’s easier to stay in the back, complain and cower -- we choose to chart the course and walk in front and share the intel.Modular. Swappable. Rare Seiko Field Master aka “Contra,” upgraded. Two Variants: A-9 and 1/ASCOUT 1/A Quartz for the little man #familieswhohike: C. We enlisted VALORbecause VALOR is courage in action. It is the powerful force and purpose driven leadership for mighty work even in the grime filled trenches of day to day slog that makes it tempting to hide and shrink back in apathy and mediocrity. Valor is service under fire. Variant: Type-EWhen you're in the trenches, you want something you can quickly read. You don't want to fumble around for a pocket watch, which was fashionable for men in the early 1900s. With the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, the U.S. military saw the need for wristwatches that could be read quickly when coordinating maneuvers.This variant is inspired by a U.S. military specification produced by Elgin National Watch Company in Illinois and issued to soldiers in World War 1. This dial (aka Black Star) was used in different style cases named after high profile generals such as Pershing, Kitchener, and Foch. As far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong), but I believe this to be the first black dialed U.S. military watch. The battle proven field-tested design went on to serve well into WW2.We slaved over the hands and numerals for the Type-E. I mean we do that with all the variants we design, of course. But because the Type-E has such a specific character to it with a legacy going back to WWI we wanted preserve and also clean it up a bit because of some strange inconsistencies in the number shapes. At the same time we wanted to capture the feel of the quirkiness of the design that so captivated me when I saw it! It was a tight balance.   The hands were a tough call. The original ones were   bold for the period, but a bit ornate and curvaceous for   my tastes. I knew they had to go, but designing the   update took a loooooong time to get the balance right   with such a strong personality to the rest of the dial.   I also wasn't sure how you all would feel about the star markers. That took a lot of refining to get to the right size where it wasn't garish, but still felt distinctly like stars and not like blurry dots. The other design conundrum was the Elgin eagle logo. It's part of the distinctive look of the original and even though I want zero logos, I also felt like I should have preserved that one just because of its DNA.VALOR Type-E DLC:Updating the eagle and shield took a ridiculous number of iterations, but I'm glad we kept at it and stayed true to our guiding design principles and kept the eagle and shield etched black on black. Variant: Model 11aka MoD W.W.W. (British Ministry of Defense Watch, Wrist, Waterproof). In WW2, the MoD created a military specification for black-dialed watches that were accurate, waterproof, and shatterproof. These had seconds subdials.Instead of looking in the civilian market, the MoD accepted designs from 12 Swiss manufacturers. These 12 different designs are called the Dirty Dozen today by collectors. A successor design from the W.W.W. post-WW2 was a new spec called 6B/346 Mk.11 created by the British RAF with pilots and navigators specifically in mind to use in ""astro-navigation purposes."" Hence, this spec was also called the ""Navigator's"".   VALOR Model 11: VALOR OFFSET With Seconds SubdialIt's a quirky design that probably does not have mass appeal. I really wanted a subdial seconds, but none of the movement calibers also had a 4PM crown. There was one movement that was close, but then the crown was at 4:30 and I just couldn't take it being misaligned like that. It's one of those things once you see it you can't unsee it then it always just feels wrong and off. Now, the VALOR Offset, runs a Swiss Sellita SW-260 movement.VALOR Model 11 Offset:I even went as far as consulting with a watchmaker about having a custom caliber built to move the seconds wheel, but the gearing would have made the movement unacceptably thick. In the end, the best I could do for now is an offset dial. There is a historically practical precedent for the offset and particularly with trench watches and ""drivers watches"", this layout provided a more direct read. I also had this one built a CuSn8 crown because the first watch I received from my grandfather had a crown where the chrome had been worn off and I always enjoyed that patina.PLAYVALOR Type-E Offset VALOR BLACK STAROriginal WWI Trench Watch in TitaniumUltra limited custom project to install original WWI Elgin Black Star trench watch movement and enamel dial in an upgraded titanium case with sapphire and legit water resistance.You'll join us to help make critical design decisions. We might even be convinced to make these with an exhibition case back.Each watch will be uniquely serial numbered and made to order and American built.Elgin Black Star original dials and movements:Elgin original 15 Jewel movement, circa WW1:We're also going to machine a titanium or bronze cage to suspend the movement inside the case. D. And you remember COURG. We re-enlisted COURAGE because it is what pushes us out into the deep — and where our truest most powerful journeys begin. And now, more than ever we must choose the right and often difficult, sometimes unpopular decisions, even when we know the going will get tough and fear conspires to paralyze.BEYOND THE SUPERSIZERotating Inner Bezel Adds Fourth Function.We fielded many requests for a larger version of the original COURG (39mm). But we weren't just going to supersize the design.There had to be a reason. And I realized that with the additional dial real estate, we could add an inner rotating bezel. This functions as a tracker for a second time zone, and keeps the outer bezel free for other timing operations.COURG.42 A-11 | Type-A | GCT Variant: Type-AThe German aircraft ministry developed designs for their WWII pilots, called B-Uhren -- short for Beobachtungs-uhren (""Observation Watch""). and is often referred to as a Type A or flieger. The Luftwaffe owned these watches, and the pilots were forced to return them after each mission. These were 55mm!  Variant: A-11WW2 American fighter pilots strapped to their wrists and helped lead to the Allies' victory. The U.S. military contracted multiple American watch companies to build these watches and called this specification A-11. Variant: GCTI always admired the WW2 GCT pocket watches used by U.S. Air Force bomber navigators. But I'd never regularly use a pocket watch and a marriage watch would still be too large and delicate for my liking. Now, with more dial real estate I wanted to see if we could deliver a GCT. To me the GCT design is the U.S. answer to the German Type-B.PLAY  3. BUCKLE DOWN, STRAP INABOVE STANDARD BALLISTIC NYLON G10/NATO MIL-STRAP: BLACK 20/22MMFEATURES
Exclusive titanium hardware
Solid buckle construction with no spring bar failure point
Quick dry
Machine washable
This is an upgraded ballistic nylon material with a tighter weave that provides added flexibility and comfort, while preserving the rugged trustworthy dependability.Fact Check: This strap design is often referred to as a NATO strap, but the original name was G10. The British Military of Defense first issued spec G1098, and soldiers requisitioned their own from the quartermaster with the easier to remember G10. Now you know.The secondary strap prevents the watch case from sliding around and secures the watch where you want it on your wrist. And if one spring bar on the watch were ever to fail, this strap provides backup so your watch doesn't fall off the strap.Did you know? DuPont originally designed ballistic nylon during World War 2 to provide lightweight defense for pilots’ and airmen flak jackets to protect against metal shards or debris from inbound munitions. The researchers developed an exceptionally tight weave, typically basket pattern in 2×2. The thread pattern produces durable construction and limited stretch in all directions. 4. DESIGN PARAMETERS HAND DRAWN DIALS.The dials we design are all hand drawn. No off-the-shelf fonts. ""In reality, only a small and decreasing number of watchmakers go to the trouble of creating custom lettering for their dials. More often, watch brands use off-the-rack fonts that are squished and squeezed onto the dial's limited real estate. You just can't get the same kind of character and unique number forms from generic computerized fonts. "" That's why Wonder Woman Grace, co-founder, aka design maven, aka CFO, aka prime minister of crew, spent months poring over historical documents and photos investigating the proportions, shapes, angles, x-heights, spacing to get each number just right. What you see in the prototypes is a result of that hard work. But she's not done yet.Before we hit production, she'll make one last round of refinements to each and every dial to ensure each number, shape, and dial are up to her exacting standards. FLASHBACK TO PROTOTYPES 5.

<p><strong>Far-Infrared Heating</strong> is a new innovative technology that safely emits gentle heat through long-length infrared waves. These slow, steady waves are not only powerful and penetrating, but also <strong>therapeutic and health-enhancing.</strong></p>
<p>It’s the same technology used in infrared saunas. The low energy infrared heat waves imitate the <strong>warmth of the sun or the heat from a hug</strong>. The waves penetrate more deeply and gently radiate past your skin to flood your body with warmth. It’s safer, gentler and more powerful than typical forms of heat emission.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581976436/pdtfeltlhv7uaeolsvfw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The deep wave heat reaches down through your muscle tissue and opens up your blood vessels. This helps<strong> improve blood circulation and flow</strong>, which naturally warms up your own body.</p>
<p><strong>More blood flow means more nutrients</strong> get delivered faster, aiding in muscle and body recovery. The improved blood circulation also helps increase immune system response and strengthens your body’s immune function.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581976506/gefo4em6pbmt3ghbfpqg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Deep wave heat has also shown to help increase serotonin levels, which may improve your overall mood. It can help relax your muscles and your body, as well as improve metabolism.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581976600/tpfgrhwlw9n916ckag72.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lastly, far infrared heat therapy <strong>may help relieve pain, cramps and discomfort</strong> in the body. The penetrating heat relaxes your body and may help alleviate pain or discomfort that may be too deep to reach. </p>

The G1 Graphene Jacket is the first of its kind. It uses new Far-Infrared Heating Technology and is lined with the Nobel-Prize Winning Nano-Material, Graphene, to heat up to 160°F in 10 seconds!
 

G1 combines the two technologies with a 100% water-resistant shell, 15 pockets, a classic design, and other versatile multi-functional features to create the ultimate heated jacket.

Far-Infrared Heating is a new innovative technology that safely emits gentle heat through long-length infrared waves. These slow, steady waves are not only powerful and penetrating, but also therapeutic and health-enhancing.
It’s the same technology used in infrared saunas. The low energy infrared heat waves imitate the warmth of the sun or the heat from a hug. The waves penetrate more deeply and gently radiate past your skin to flood your body with warmth. It’s safer, gentler and more powerful than typical forms of heat emission.

The deep wave heat reaches down through your muscle tissue and opens up your blood vessels. This helps improve blood circulation and flow, which naturally warms up your own body.
More blood flow means more nutrients get delivered faster, aiding in muscle and body recovery. The improved blood circulation also helps increase immune system response and strengthens your body’s immune function.
Deep wave heat has also shown to help increase serotonin levels, which may improve your overall mood. It can help relax your muscles and your body, as well as improve metabolism.

Lastly, far infrared heat therapy may help relieve pain, cramps and discomfort in the body. The penetrating heat relaxes your body and may help alleviate pain or discomfort that may be too deep to reach.

<p><strong>Newton-Rider, the bicycle helmet like no other</strong></p>
<p>We believe the urban youth, embracing mobility and freedom of transport when at the same time refuses to compromise on design and style, need a bicycle helmet that is exactly this... </p>
<ul>
<li>Sleek </li>
<li>Thin</li>
<li>Semi-soft</li>
<li>Foldable</li>
<li>Built in chip for incentivised riding</li>
<li>Comply to EN1078 and CPSC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The helmet</strong></p>
<p>The Newton-Rider helmet folds like no other into 75mm and is easily stored in your bag and with a simple tap it communicates with any provider that might incentivise riding with our helmet. And last but not least we believe that riding with a helmet finally looks sleek and quite Instagrammable.</p>
<p><strong>The team</strong></p>
<p>We started the Newton-Rider project in early 2019 and are a professional and experienced core team of three. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-b%C3%BCnger-21942822/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel Bünger</a>, German with a Masters Degree in Engineering specialising in Bio and Nano technologies, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilmarschall/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wil Marschall</a>, New Zealander based in the UK and an Industrial Designer and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulrik-jensen-7170b949/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ulrik Jensen</a>, Danish and Concept Designer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606895388/pdcgmrj8lcziyktthvoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>The team</i></p>
<p>We set high goals because we like to challenge and to push boundaries. Nothing has really changed in the way bicycle helmets are manufactured over the last 10-15 years. Helmets are still a hard, polystyrene hat, that for sure makes you safe when riding but are rather bulky and uncomfortable to wear and honestly, they do not make you look a lot prettier either.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606895517/xt118yrshkipwsh03qiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>The complex multi layered helmet construction of only 16 mm was an interesting challenge for us</i></p>
<p><strong>We decided to try challenge the norm with science and engineering</strong></p>
<p>The Newton-Rider helmet is made with sophisticated calculated compounds of Visco-Elastic and Non-Newtonian materials, the clever engineering and innovative design that makes the helmet not only comply to EN 1078 and CPSC safety standards when only 16 mm thin, but renders the helmet as a never yet seen, semi-soft and flexible helmet for comfort and style. Compared to traditionally made helmets that are completely rigid and require a thickness of 30-35 mm to comply to the same standards, we believe it is rather impressive what we have achieved.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606895663/acdqhhy7agczlmcovxxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Another advantage by the Newton-Rider helmet design is that in the event of a crash, afterward it is not unsafe to continue to ride with, it is still as good as new, unlike a traditionally built polystyrene helmet that has to be discarded after any impact.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606895774/z2ssz1qcsuusfdafnvj6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Comparison of characteristics and properties between polystyrene (EPS) and the Newton-Rider material</i></p>
<p><strong>The thing about fit and comfort</strong></p>
<p>We all know how it feels riding with a polystyrene helmet - not really that comfortable. No two heads have the exact same form and shape which is why traditionally helmets come with a variety of foam pads to place inside to somehow try to make the helmet fit. </p>
<p>The Newton-Rider Helmet innovative IP protected design principles are not yet seen in the industry and makes the helmet fit any adult skull shape and circumference between 57cm and 60cm in a comfortable way. Thanks to their unique pad concept together with an elastic and flexible liner that adjusts to the head size and shape.</p>

<p><strong>Always with me</strong></p>
<p>Urban youth of today not only rides their owned bicycles but has embraced new modalities when it comes to their everyday transporting needs. The wave of e-scooters for sustainable transporting, the last mile to and from workplace etc, calls for a helmet that is also foldable to always have it with you. The estimated weight of the helmet is 450-470g</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606896168/kdbnqluw5izqrdzluhlz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>A helmet to always have with you</i></p>
<p><strong>Hey it's 2020</strong></p>
<p>“We also wanted to make the helmet kind of IoT 'ish. We have embedded in the helmet a highly sophisticated NFC chip, that together with our proprietary software API and if embedded in scooter apps, can make operators create incentives for riding with helmet</p>
<p>The entire development of the backend system and the API we have outsourced to Shape , Copenhagen, an award winning software company with 100+ developers doing advanced apps and backend systems for international clients. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606896289/ivqwdwyftwpui3dvfsjs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Built in NFC chip for incentivised riding</i></p>
<p><strong> Incentivised riding with helmet</strong></p>
<p>With our API integrated in micromobility providers apps they can create incentives and offers to users in specific areas if they see a fit. This can be reduced unlocks, bonus rides, special offers etc.</p>
<p>Our software is even planned to also handle theft and many other cool features. In fact our highly sophisticated chip and backend system essentially creates an individual URL for each helmet.</p>
<p><strong>There is nothing like the future</strong></p>
<p>All in all, the Newton-Rider helmet, we believe, is in many ways how a helmet should look like and what the urban youth will expect from a modern stylish bicycle helmet of today. </p>

<p>Estimated shipping costs for EU and UK backers: EUR 9.00 /1 helmet  EUR 15.00 /2 helmets</p>
<p>*UK Tax and VAT, TBA</p>
<p>At given time nobody knows how the tax situation will develop in regard to the UK leaving effectively the EU after 31.12.2020. We will notify UK backers and present a solution when facts are known.  </p>
<p>We also ship to the US and Canada, currently estimated along Q1 2020.</p>
<p>Estimated shipping costs for US/Canada backers: USD 11,-/1 helmet USD 18,- /2 helmets</p>
<p>Prices do not include taxes and VAT for US/Canada backers. This will be subject to the laws and regulations in US and Canada and will be calculated and paid for before we ship the helmets out to you.</p>
<p>We also ship to rest of world albeit these perks has a slightly higher shipping cost added</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Newton-Rider team consists of highly skilled members and we have been working on this project for a long time before we could comfortably launch this Kickstarter campaign. The high goals we set out when we started Newton-Rider has since been tested and improved many times to ensure we can deliver on our promises. The newton-Rider helmet is truly different than all other helmets on the market today and thus we had to invent completely new ways of manufacturing a bicycle helmet. However we are in a good place and have known our manufacturing partners for nearly 10 years. We are confident to deliver a Newton-Rider helmet that is like no other simply because we have done our homework in advance. But we are also realistic. Unexpected things can happen no matter how well plans have been made. We all have experienced how a virus can change the world. Should anything occur that will have influence of our promises we are still professionals and will deal with it in a way that our backers can feel confident about.</p>

Thin
Semi-soft
Foldable
Built in chip for incentivised riding
Comply to EN1078 and CPSC

The helmet
The Newton-Rider helmet folds like no other into 75mm and is easily stored in your bag and with a simple tap it communicates with any provider that might incentivise riding with our helmet. And last but not least we believe that riding with a helmet finally looks sleek and quite Instagrammable.
The team
We started the Newton-Rider project in early 2019 and are a professional and experienced core team of three. Daniel Bünger, German with a Masters Degree in Engineering specialising in Bio and Nano technologies, Wil Marschall, New Zealander based in the UK and an Industrial Designer and Ulrik Jensen, Danish and Concept Designer.

The team
We set high goals because we like to challenge and to push boundaries. Nothing has really changed in the way bicycle helmets are manufactured over the last 10-15 years. Helmets are still a hard, polystyrene hat, that for sure makes you safe when riding but are rather bulky and uncomfortable to wear and honestly, they do not make you look a lot prettier either.

The complex multi layered helmet construction of only 16 mm was an interesting challenge for us
We decided to try challenge the norm with science and engineering
The Newton-Rider helmet is made with sophisticated calculated compounds of Visco-Elastic and Non-Newtonian materials, the clever engineering and innovative design that makes the helmet not only comply to EN 1078 and CPSC safety standards when only 16 mm thin, but renders the helmet as a never yet seen, semi-soft and flexible helmet for comfort and style. Compared to traditionally made helmets that are completely rigid and require a thickness of 30-35 mm to comply to the same standards, we believe it is rather impressive what we have achieved.

Another advantage by the Newton-Rider helmet design is that in the event of a crash, afterward it is not unsafe to continue to ride with, it is still as good as new, unlike a traditionally built polystyrene helmet that has to be discarded after any impact.

Comparison of characteristics and properties between polystyrene (EPS) and the Newton-Rider material
The thing about fit and comfort
We all know how it feels riding with a polystyrene helmet - not really that comfortable. No two heads have the exact same form and shape which is why traditionally helmets come with a variety of foam pads to place inside to somehow try to make the helmet fit. 
The Newton-Rider Helmet innovative IP protected design principles are not yet seen in the industry and makes the helmet fit any adult skull shape and circumference between 57cm and 60cm in a comfortable way. Thanks to their unique pad concept together with an elastic and flexible liner that adjusts to the head size and shape.


Our IP protected  flexible design for fit and comfort


Always with me
Urban youth of today not only rides their owned bicycles but has embraced new modalities when it comes to their everyday transporting needs. The wave of e-scooters for sustainable transporting, the last mile to and from workplace etc, calls for a helmet that is also foldable to always have it with you. The estimated weight of the helmet is 450-470g

A helmet to always have with you
Hey it's 2020
“We also wanted to make the helmet kind of IoT 'ish. We have embedded in the helmet a highly sophisticated NFC chip, that together with our proprietary software API and if embedded in scooter apps, can make operators create incentives for riding with helmet
The entire development of the backend system and the API we have outsourced to Shape , Copenhagen, an award winning software company with 100+ developers doing advanced apps and backend systems for international clients. 

Built in NFC chip for incentivised riding
 Incentivised riding with helmet
With our API integrated in micromobility providers apps they can create incentives and offers to users in specific areas if they see a fit. This can be reduced unlocks, bonus rides, special offers etc.
Our software is even planned to also handle theft and many other cool features. In fact our highly sophisticated chip and backend system essentially creates an individual URL for each helmet.
There is nothing like the future
All in all, the Newton-Rider helmet, we believe, is in many ways how a helmet should look like and what the urban youth will expect from a modern stylish bicycle helmet of today. 


 


Newton-Rider is backed by Innovation Fund
Newton-Rider is since 2019 backed by the state funded Danish Innovation Fund because of our innovative concept and engineering.
 The project is in an advanced state and we comfortably estimate shipment to take place  in early Q1 2021 for European backers and late Q1 2021 for North American backers.

Mould part for mass production
You can now become one of the first in the world to ride with the helmet, that of course will comply to the European standard for bicycle helmets, EN 1078 and the North American standard CPSC.

Take action
Back us now in this limited window to show you are committed to personal safety and freedom of transport in a sustainable way. 
SHIPPING & TAXES
We ship the Newton-Rider helmet to all EU countries without any extra taxes or VAT. 
Estimated shipping costs for EU and UK backers: EUR 9.00 /1 helmet  EUR 15.00 /2 helmets
*UK Tax and VAT, TBA
At given time nobody knows how the tax situation will develop in regard to the UK leaving effectively the EU after 31.12.2020. We will notify UK backers and present a solution when facts are known.  
We also ship to the US and Canada, currently estimated along Q1 2020.
Estimated shipping costs for US/Canada backers: USD 11,-/1 helmet USD 18,- /2 helmets
Prices do not include taxes and VAT for US/Canada backers. This will be subject to the laws and regulations in US and Canada and will be calculated and paid for before we ship the helmets out to you.
We also ship to rest of world albeit these perks has a slightly higher shipping cost added
Risks and challenges
The Newton-Rider team consists of highly skilled members and we have been working on this project for a long time before we could comfortably launch this Kickstarter campaign. The high goals we set out when we started Newton-Rider has since been tested and improved many times to ensure we can deliver on our promises. The newton-Rider helmet is truly different than all other helmets on the market today and thus we had to invent completely new ways of manufacturing a bicycle helmet. However we are in a good place and have known our manufacturing partners for nearly 10 years. We are confident to deliver a Newton-Rider helmet that is like no other simply because we have done our homework in advance. But we are also realistic. Unexpected things can happen no matter how well plans have been made. We all have experienced how a virus can change the world. Should anything occur that will have influence of our promises we are still professionals and will deal with it in a way that our backers can feel confident about.",9.0,2,"2 Campaigns

Clocks were invented for this purpose. The first clock was created thousands of years ago. There were various types of clock, including sundial, clepsydra, hourglass and others.     Since then, the evolution of clock has continued and brought to us the first wristwatch. Every year there emerge dozens of new models of wirstwatch, but the operating principle has not changed.    We live in a new progressive millennium; everything around us progresses and develops. In our opinion, clock design should be both technically innovative and fashionable. Watches demonstrating that humanity does not stand still. These are the watches we bring into life.            On the Internet there were talks about a new generation of watches; however, they were just mere talks and nothing specific. Here we offer you the opportunity to see them and become a piece of history by supporting development of Ritot; be the one that boosts the tech world evolution. We are talking about the generation of wristwatches, which project the dial onto your wrist.              Stretch Goals          Featured In                                                                                    Notifications      Ritot will help you to stay on top of things with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts.

The watch doesn't have any buttons, except of one touch sensitive button, with what you can manipulate the projection - run a mechanism of temporary (10 sec) or permanent projection.      Currently we don’t have a fully working prototype, the photos in campaign are computer renderings of what we envision the device to look like.       The watch is set up and charged on a specially developed base that comes with the watch.                This base allows you to:•  Change the projection color in one click. There are more than 20 colors available. •  Charge the watch using wireless technology.•  Choose 24 or 12 hour time display mode.•  Change the position of projection for your left and right hand.•  In addition, the base is equipped with an alarm clock.                We want to take a moment to tell you the story behind RitotCurrently Ritot is based in Ukraine with a US San Francisco office. The company was founded by Michael Medvid. The idea of Ritot Watch came to Michael 6 months ago. After a lot of work with designing together with Andrew the idea became a beautiful concept. With support of Oleg the technology was tested and passed a lot of consultations with different developers and manufacturers to make sure that we can bring this concept into a real working product. Since we understood that people like Ritot Watch, we have moved to the next stage of development.Estimate development time    We need your help to develop Ritot and start mass production. Then Ritot will come to reality. You'll be the first to receive Ritot at a price significantly less than future retail price. We hope that you like the Ritot and will be happy to answer your questions and suggestions.    Prototypes: Currently we don’t have a fully working prototype, the photos in campaign are computer renderings of what we envision the device to look like. Our watches are based on a new projection technology that has proven itself. Our task is to bring our model the closest to the technical ideal. We will do our best to achieve this. You will be able to monitor and even control all production stages and give your suggestions to the first working prototypes.
    Production:  We use advanced technology of high quality that has already been tested and developed by many other companies. The whole production process is monitored at the highest level by well-known professionals in their field.

    Delivery time: We understand the whole seriousness of our work, and we understand that our terms of production and date of perk delivery may change. We will cover all stages of production, so you will be informed of the course of work and the date of delivery. Please support us and make these watches a reality. Thank you!
    Warranty period of the watch: 1 year. In case of any problems, send your watch to us for repair or replacement. Note that we incur all shipping costs.    Upon successful completion of the campaign, follow the updates section on this page and on our website. In addition, we will contact you to clarify all issues, including delivery, model and size of the watch after the campaign. In the future, we plan to assess the functionality of our website and add personal accounts so you can easily edit your delivery.    FAQ 1. What if the size of watches does not fit my hand?   You can send us the watch back and we will change it for another size for free.2. If I order more that 1 Ritot Watch, how many base chargers will I receive?  Each Ritot Watch includes base charger. So if you ordered 3 Ritot Watches, you will get 3 base chargers.3. Does Ritot work with my phone?  We are planning to work with a lot of phones. Currently we can say that Ritot will work with iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Also we are working on compatibility with other platforms. 4. How can I choose model, size and color of my watch?   We will send out a survey after the end of campaign.     Thank you!We would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any assistance in the realization of our project. Please share our project thgrough Facebook and Twitter, we will be happy for any help!If you have any questions or you just want to say hello, be sure to contact us at info@ritot.comFor Press Inquiries contact press@ritot.com

It all started years ago when I (Leo) excitedly began work as a wildland firefighter. It was my career path and I went into training for fire suppression. The long days were hard, but on the rides back to camp we were greeted by the locals and thanked for coming in to save their towns from the burning fires. Even in such a fulfilling environment, the repetitive work of lifting equipment and carrying heavy packs took a toll on my back, to the point where resting against the sharp edges of a rock felt better than the pain. Though I found satisfaction in my work, the worry and fear of a potential back injury made me rethink firefighting as a career. I couldn’t risk a back injury.</p><p>I went to design school and took with me my experience as inspiration and started interviews with other first responders like myself.

Can I workout in it? - Yes.Check your posture right now.Back pain at any level is almost universally attributed to our posture. How are you moving? Even with the knowledge of great posture, it is difficult to maintain it while focusing on a task and after our back has fatigued. The Dorsum™ Exospine effortlessly supports your back, follows your movement, and reminds you to maintain great posture.The quick pace of life is rapidly increasing the risk of back pain and injury. Having the right support that enables solid movement mechanics can reduce the risk of back pain. Modern life is creating jobs that force us to move faster and work longer. All of these demands put extra stress on our shoulders, lower back muscles, and spine. 80% of adults experience back pain at some point in their lives. Here’s where the Dorsum™ Exospine comes in, supporting your lower back without restricting movement.The most common injuries happen from overuse of our bodies, which are the leading cause of repetitive motion strains. Repetitive motion puts enormous strain on your lower back, which can, in turn, lead to permanent injuries.Many back alignment products in the market serve different purposes and do not have a significant impact reducing back injuries. The Dorsum™ Exospine exists in a new space we call Flexible Support, focused on prevention rather than rehabilitation.The Dorsum™ Exospine is focused on postural support and muscular activation. It is not trying to limit the body’s movement; rather, the Exospine encourages it to move properly throughout repetitive movements.In the market, there are few functional back supports designed for movement. There are posture reminders that are recommended for a short amount of use and back braces that are uncomfortable and restrict movement. The Dorsum™ Exospine is used for better posture while doing sustained repetitive movement.The Dorsum™ Exospine is for those doing work that requires “hinge” movements. “Hinge” movement jobs are jobs/activities that require bending over and lifting movements that can cause an individual’s back to severely fatigued. The Dorsum Exospine is there to promote muscular activation so that posture can be maintained and overuse injuries limited.Use it at work, at home, and while doing recreational activities that require repetitive bending of the lower back and shoulders.The Dorsum™ Exospine is for:Anyone that does repetitive movements as part of their daily activity. It is comfortable, functional, and it limits injury. To support the lower back, we envisioned a device that can be both flexible, yet supportive, and from that vision, we created the Dorsum™ Exospine. It’s exactly as the name describes; a flexible exospine back support that enhances your posture and reminds you to keep your back in the right position and avoid pain.Start by turning the thumb screw and pulling the top portion upward to your size of Small, Medium, or Large. Then turn the screw back to a tight position.From the back, open the tab in the bottom of the pocket to insert the spine component all the way inside the sleeve, and close the tab to secure it in place. The exospine is designed to fit different size torsos of Small, Medium, and Large. Put on the shoulder straps around your arms.Close and tighten the waist belt around your hips.Locate the chest straps and pull outward to feel the support, while closing the straps at the bottom of your chest.As you move, the Dorsum™ Exospine reminds you to correct your posture without much effort. It’s comfortable and can be worn over and under clothing.  We used a thermoplastic polymer, a very light and flexible material so it bends and moves with you to support your everyday movements.Using a 3D air mesh around the sides with a power mesh in the center, all specific fabrics that maximize airflow to keep you comfortable.The support has a positive feedback loop and 3 points of contact on the spine: the upper, middle, and lower regions of the back.The positive feedback loop that our brains create relies on multiple factors. If something feels good and you are rewarded for it, your brain will encourage you to seek out that feeling. The same can be said of the body. When it feels supported it will seek out the feeling to protect itself. When wearing the Dorsum™ Exospine your body is constantly reminded of proper movement and postural function. So when you take the product off, your body will “remember” to some extent those postural cues and be able to move and stabilize more properly without the product on, teaching you what better posture feels like.The number 1 benefitFrom everything the Dorsum™ Exospine can do, it does the best job at reminding you to have proper posture and movement throughout an activity. It does this on what is called a positive feedback loop. It reminds you to stay within the correct posture to activate your proper muscles when lifting/moving, and maintain proper postural/ergonomic techniques so injury is less likely to occur. When you feel something encouraging you to move properly, you’ll be more likely to do it and are much more likely to avoid injury.The Dorsum™ Exospine supports your lower back and upper back to stabilize your spine. It does not restrict movement, allowing you to activate your core muscle groups, and move freely. It provides all-day comfort to complete an entire day’s work. Effortlessly reminds you to correct your posture so you can focus on doing the task at hand. Maximizes airflow so you can comfortably wear it under or over clothing. It is adjustable to Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge sizes.Fast drying and moisture-absorbing elastic bands to keep your skin dry.  The spine component is removable for easy cleaning and the garment is easily washable. Washable and machine drying safe. We are a passionate team with a mission to create better products that improve people’s health. It all started years ago when I (Leo) excitedly began work as a wildland firefighter. It was my career path and I went into training for fire suppression. The long days were hard, but on the rides back to camp we were greeted by the locals and thanked for coming in to save their towns from the burning fires. Even in such a fulfilling environment, the repetitive work of lifting equipment and carrying heavy packs took a toll on my back, to the point where resting against the sharp edges of a rock felt better than the pain. Though I found satisfaction in my work, the worry and fear of a potential back injury made me rethink firefighting as a career. I couldn’t risk a back injury.I went to design school and took with me my experience as inspiration and started interviews with other first responders like myself. In conducting the interviews, I could feel the passion of heroic men and women for saving lives, and when I got to the hard questions, I could hear in their voices how a simple back injury crushed their dreams by preventing them from serving others. The more interviews I did, the more I saw the global problem caused by back pain. The courage of first responders to dive into danger to save a life inspired me to dive into creating my company to solve a problem for them, and that marked the beginning of prototyping a vertical flexible back support that years later would become the Dorsum™ Exospine.After designing outdoor products and health care devices, and receiving design awards from the earlier concepts, I also kept receiving emails from first responders from all over the world telling me they wanted to go back to work and my prototype could help them.I built a team passionate for helping others and shaped Dorsum into the company it is today, making products that will limit career-ending injuries.Our first prototypes were designed to be worn over clothing, but they proved to be too hot and bulky.We reduced the weight and added ventilation using athletic compression fabrics and air meshes for a more breathable and comfortable support.Explored designs to best align the upper back in the correct position.We started 3D printing and looked at more ways to reduce material and size but still maintaining the right amount of support.We made it even more flexible, stronger, and easier to use.We conducted several rounds of fit tests to select the best design that would add the most comfort & support.We put it to the test under intensive training exercises doing repetitive motion activities requiring fast bending, twisting, and turning of the torso and spine. Several rounds of sweat tests helped us discover the areas that needed more ventilation.Back pain can end careers and dramatically change lives for the worse, and we want to help fix that.We created the Dorsum™ Exospine as an answer to the many stories of career-ending back injuries we have heard and as a way of honoring and showing gratitude to the courageous first responders who participated in our tests. The Dorsum™ Exospine will have a major impact on improving people’s lives and we hope you will join us in our effort to make a difference in back health.We have many people to thank, many people who have shared their stories of back pain, given feedback, and participated in our product testing.

UW- UNDER WATER, the blue sea, a magnificent gift bestowed by heaven. The mysterious sea and marine life motivate us to design. I hope our design could bring youthe same feeling we have – a sense of tranquility, a place to breath in the crazy messyreality, a 24/7 sanctuary on the wrist with practical function. The Aequorea is inspired by Jellyfish, an awe-inspiring and intriguing creature. It epitomizes the definition of  ""Life Fighter “, built as the perfect tool for every situation all year round. The design of Aequorea echoes jellyfish. You could spot the shape of jellyfish over theentire watch including the luminous crown, the three-dimensional texture of the dial, thebezel shape, and the unique curved case back. Inspiration of Glowing Jellyfish 

 
 

The bezel illustrates the silhouette of a jellyfish. It also comes with a one-way rotatable
function and diving recording function. 
 

 
 

 
  We used different models of Superluminova according to various dial combinations(including BG W9, C5, C7 and light blue, etc.). The noteworthy one would have to beUO01-Jelly dial, which carries a luminous effect of BGW9 on the entire face. This woulddefinitely be the most extraordinary combo. Superluminova glows are filled evenly on the narrow pits and top of the crown body,which looks like a luminous jellyfish in the dark.  The processing of filling in the luminous light is all done by handcraft which requires extensive concentration and huge efforts. The technical drawing of the crown The Dial is specially designed as a multi-layer structure. The upper dial and the lowerdial are coated with different colors to make the whole design more stereoscopic andpopping while in the luminous state. Dial's side is formed with a three-dimensional texture.  Multi-layer dial The texture of jellyfish Aequorea is powered by the Seiko NH35A movement.  Seiko is one of the mostrespected and horologically important watch companies in the world. The NH series ofmovements can be found in many legendary Seiko dive watches and is widely used bywatch brands as it is affordable with good reliability. The NH35A is a dependableworkhorse movement that provides a good balance between budget, performance, andreliability. The case back of the domed shape is very special. It is embedded with a jellyfishillustration with the corroded texture to give more depth to the design.Unique case back inspired by the shape of jellyfish 
 
 

Ratchet Buckle Clasp is an ideal Wetsuit watch band buckle. The ratchet theory
extension mechanism strikes a perfect balance of both convenience and
safety. Aequorea watch bracelet is an extraordinary well-made 316L stainless steel
watch band. Each link is constructed of 1 round edge solid 316L stainless steel units
with pressure pins. Length adjustment is simple and easy via flexible screw details. The
watch band is a heavy and durable replacement which is hard to found in the
aftermarket watch band market and is perfect for your diving watches.
 

 
 

Perfect for Dive Quality + DesignWe build quality and innovative watches at an affordable cost.Money doesn’t buy respect or real appreciation. A timepiece worth respect and praisedoesn’t necessarily cost a fortune. Not many watches found in the market pay muchattention to details. However, our watches are not ordinary watch.

Criteria that truewatch collectors really appreciate, value and focus.  The perfect ratio and size of 42mm diameter are suitable for most people's wrist sizes.The 316L stainless steel material makes the watch more durable and can accompanyyou with many years to come.

</div></div>","We all have different knees and needs, so why is that all kneepads are the same? E-Knee is a new way to get just the right amount of pressure with the help of Artificial Intelligence, micro-airbags and customizable compression.

The benefits of knee compression:
When you’re walking, hiking or working out, your knees are under stress and pressure, which is why they need support.They’re also good for technique and positioning. The compression provides better lateral hold, supporting your patella and joints, stabilizing you as you squat, run, or hike.
 


  
When the gyroscope detects powerful motion, the built-in ARM chip will tell the micro compressors to pressurize airbags based on different levels of pressure and motion, all in real-time. E-Knee gives dynamic support where and when you need it.
 
 
E-Knee detects different levels of air pressure based on initial tightness and saves the data for the next time.  Three preloaded profiles offer the right support in any situation: rest (sitting down), low-intensity (jogging for example), and high-intensity (basketball for example).Once the gyroscope detects a different activity level, it changes modes within three seconds and instantly inflates or deflates the airbags, which solves the headache issue of regular knee pads that are often too tight or too loose. 
 

E-Knee offers the right fit regardless of your build. The breathable fabric stretches around your leg without restricting your motion while staying firmly in place.

At Revelot we have always been passionate about supercars and early this year we begun to think about how we can create our version of a supercar watch.With passion in racing and Motorsport, over the past few months we have been deliberating an idea of infusing a supercar’s soul into a wrist watch. Let us introduce you to the Revelot R9 Veloce Launch Edition. A watch made for racing enthusiasts that want to extend their love and passion for supercars into a timepiece. To give the watch a touch of luxury, the Genta inspired case shape and form compliments the overall supercar characteristics. Gérald Genta (1931-2011) created some of the most iconic models in the watch world notably the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak. From the sapphire glass to the movement, the Revelot R9 Veloce is designed with 7 layers of intricately crafted dials and parts that gives depth and attitude to the watch. Average fashion watches only have 1-3 layers.Beginning with exterior of the R9 Veloce, we decided to fuse Aluminum, Carbon fiber, Steel and rubber to embody the racing spirit of supercar engineering. We use surgical grade stainless steel coupled with an Aluminum bezel for its durability. The dashboard and speedometer of a supercar plays a major part in R9's design inspiration. The sub-dials and big date window mimics the dashboard of a supercar. Giving clear, precise and vital information to the owner while embodying the racing spirit. The first turbocharged production car engine was used in 1962 on the Oldsmobile Jetfire and the rest was history. With that inspiration, we designed a turbine shaped seconds plate at 6 o’clock position that rotates every second. A Supercar cannot be a supercar without carbon fiber, hence, we have integrated genuine carbon fiber materials onto the watch's case back for the final super touch. This feature is exclusively only for the R9 Veloce Launch Edition on Indiegogo. Under the hood lies the renowned Japanese Miyota Quartz Chronograph engine known for its reliability, durability and superior precision in timekeeping for decades. The Chronograph has a 1/20 sec stop watch feature which is an important element in race watches. Second to diamonds, sapphire crystal glass is added to the watch with a tint of anti-reflective technology guaranteeing clarity, durability and scratch-resistance. The watch is compliant with the 10 ATM waterproof standards which means you can take the watch for a swim. Suitable for all occasions, whether its rain or shine. Rubber is also a material that goes hand in hand with racing. The R9 Veloce strap is made with silicone for maximum comfort and durability. Just like a racing tyre, maximizing traction along your journey on the asphalt. WHAT ABOUT LUME? YES.  We always try to keep our products at a fair price for everyone. We have spent the past 3 years in developing sustainable strategies to offer high quality yet affordable products. To achieve this, we sell to you directly from trustable online platforms. For instance, the Revelot’s official website or third-parties site like Kickstarter & Indiegogo.

It is also home to the South Pole–Aitken Basin (South Pole–Aitken Basin), the largest, oldest and deepest crater on the moon. Who knows what else this mysterious land is home to.Some private space companies of the United States are planning to join hands with the government to land on the moon again in 2022 conducting research and development with rockets, lunar surface probes, and manned vehicles.Hopefully by all the rocket science, we would finally be able to find out what is out there one day.    The design of “Lunar Crater “is inspired by the spacecraft of the moon landing program.You can easily see the streamlined design from the watch case, buckle and case back lens which assembles the most attractive design of the spacecraft - its streamlined diagonal mesh skylight.       The center of Dial is inlaid with a 21MM-aluminum-made-3D moon. With Swiss Superluminova luminous coating surface, the moon shine vividly and bright. In darkness, you can read the time through the moon's light height and the shadow position of watch hands.

 
 
 
 
Moon Walker II VS Mars Mission


We once had a very popular design- Mars Mission. This is a comparison of Moon Walker II's luminous intensity with the previous Mars Mission, as the green luminous powder will have a stronger luminosity than red, so it shows that the Moon Walker II will have a greater luminous intensity.
*Test environment: Charged 1 minute under 20 Watt 3000K bulb.
 
 


Derived from the criss-crossing star trails and star positions of Skymap, the luminous indicators are put at different heights from 1 to 12 o'clock to create the scattered moondust effect. The index of the Dial ring is made solid creating a sense that the whole watch is about to take off from the ground.
 
 
 
 
Meteorite from outerspace is used in the lower layer of the dial. This meteorite is we used Muonionalusta in Sweden, an extremely rare material which landed on the earth after a long journey in the outerspace for 4.3 billion years. After professional cut and chemical protective coating, each dial is inlaid with a 0.3mm thick meteorite piece at the bottom. The meteorite has a unique and natural Weidmann pattern with a unique background to make it more appealing and iconic. It echoes the moon in the center with the craters surface.   Inspired by the spacecraft of the moon landing program, the crown of Lunar Crater has an innovative and irregular shape. It requires an extreme planning and production process to achieve the straight and sharp fine details. With all the fine details, it allows a more accurate time adjustments of the watch rotation.    Our iconic curved hands design is adopted in Lunar Crater – the perfect match for the 3D moon. The arc design makes the hands walk smoothly around the moon. With such bending hands, it enhances the difficulty to assembly the watch. We have to be extremely careful and cautious so the hand tubes would not get across with each. It is a true masterpiece. The hands of the watch are deliberately made hollow without adding any luminous effect so they would not block the moonlight behind while the shining moon could help with the time reading.    The double dome sapphire crystal on Lunar Crater demonstrates the streamline aesthetic. 3 layer of anti-reflection plating is added on the bottom of the sapphire crystal to make the surface look clearer and brighter.   The Movement employs the long reliable Japanese SII NH70A, with 21,600 bph. vibrations, Geneva Waves on Rotor and a power reserve of more than 35 hours.  All contributes to achieve accurate time display.   With CNC cutting process, the buckle has a unique design demonstrating a strong sense of architectural aesthetics.     The structure of this case is highly complex. A CNC-cut cover is tailor-made to wrap the main case.

 
 
 
 
 

 

The leather strap uses two materials. One is the Italian Crazy Horse leather, rough, wild and unrestrained, while the other one is the Italian cracked belt. The belt has a unique pattern and echoes the texture of the meteorite on the surface. The straps are equipped with quick-release spring bars, allowing users to quickly remove the straps and replace them without any tools.    It comes with a vivid 30mm-moon model and a cubic stand. Users could put it on the stage for decoration and appreciate the moon any time they want. HOW IT WORKS    As always, packaging plays an important in our story telling. To further extend the theme, the box is made of paper with rock pattern. The box is inlaid with three-dimensional MW characters, in matt black which brings this Lunar Cater a visual shock.    From concept to product development, from product development to final visual preparation, the entire campaign took more than 6 months. The complexity of the case and the surface is a real headache for the whole team. We could only finalize the appearance after 2 prototyping.        As a creator who has completed 8 campaigns, we are particularly confident in time control. Our previous backers have been very satisfied with our timely delivery.  Shipping method: We insist on using a more expensive courier service to ensure that backers receive the watch faster and more safely.2-year warranty: We provide a 2-year warranty, so that users do not have to worry about the maintenance of this complex watch.Excellent customer service: Supporters who have pledged our projects will know that we have always been the-easy-to-reach creator. We will keep responding and aid promptly.  We have 8 successful crowdfunding projects in a row with promising shipments on schedule record. Thanks to all the fans support, we could continue the creation path and passion to explore more innovative design.  The concept of space is always a key element in our design. We have already come to the 4th watch in the collection.

That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and help reduce single use plastic bag consumption. This time we’re also stepping up our tree planting efforts further. For each bag we sell we’ll plant one mangrove tree with the Eden Reforestation Project. Mangrove trees are one of the most effective tools against climate change, and stores ten times more carbon than land based tree species. Mangroves take the carbon out of the air and bind it to the ground, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. One single mangrove tree can store around 1750lbs (800kg) in its 40 year lifespan.  As an added bonus they prevent soil erosion and help sustain coastal ecosystems.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Commitment to excellence</strong></h3><p>We're committed to creating high-quality products that you'll love.

Here are all the designs you can choose from.See our FAQ for info on sizes etc. For our add-on bags, you can add these to your order in the check-out. You need to buy at least one patterned Nanobag 3.0 to be able to add it to your order.Testimonials from Nanobag 2.0 backers.     
The Nanobag 3.0 can easily carry 66lbs (30kgs).
 
The Nanobag 3.0 even fits in a small pouch. No folding needed. We’ll plant one tree per bag We're committed to making you a climate positive product. That means that we give more back to the planet than we take. We consider our bags environmentally conscious, as they contain less materials than other bags in their category and help reduce single use plastic bag consumption. This time we’re also stepping up our tree planting efforts further. For each bag we sell we’ll plant one mangrove tree with the Eden Reforestation Project. Mangrove trees are one of the most effective tools against climate change, and stores ten times more carbon than land based tree species. Mangroves take the carbon out of the air and bind it to the ground, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. One single mangrove tree can store around 1750lbs (800kg) in its 40 year lifespan.  As an added bonus they prevent soil erosion and help sustain coastal ecosystems. Commitment to excellenceWe're committed to creating high-quality products that you'll love. The bags are made with premium custom made fabrics and we've put in place a thorough quality-control and testing process to make sure you receive a great final product. We guarantee that your bags will be of excellent quality. ShippingWe offer FREE International registered shipping to backers pledging for 4 bags and above. All parcels will be shipped with tracked air mail. The team:Tiptop Things are a group of friends working together to infuse everyday items with premium quality and cutting edge technology. Nanobag 3.0 is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, and you might have seen our earlier Nanobag and Air Deck campaigns. Our mission is to make quality premium products that you will love. Why do we need your support?We can't do this without you. The funds we raise here will go towards producing our custom made fabric, printing and stitching the bags as well as logistics. Our Kickstarter backers will be the first to have the Nanobag 3.0.   Moon, River, Ocean, Ice Sheet, Astronaut - Credit: NASA",9.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p>Sanding, sawing, painting, spraying, varnishing… These activities release a huge amount of particulate matter and toxic fumes that are inhaled and absorbed by the body, leading to many health issues. Ordinary masks are a hassle: they give you sores, they fog up your glasses or protective goggles, they are bulky and heavy, they dramatically reduce the air flow and, even worse, most don't offer the necessary protection.</p>

<p><strong>Maasc </strong>has great advantages for this types of work. The silicone seal prevents inward leakages. That means that all the air you are breathing actually goes through the filter. The dedicated exhaust valves, in addition to the seal, prevents glasses and goggles from fogging up. And the BreatheEase™ active fan system pulls air in, making breathing seamless, ideal for works that requires physical activity. To top all these features you can still count on the top-grade filtration performance.</p>

<p>Wildfires are becoming more common and stronger. They are a significant menace for people all around the world, from the US to Australia, from Indonesia to Brazil. Wildfires are dangerous not only because they destroy everything on their way. The smoke they produce fills the air with particulate matter, which are extremely hazardous for your health. This smoke can spread through thousands of miles and even affect areas in different continents. It is something out of our control that we must protect ourselves against. The majority of masks are unsuited for this type of menace, and will let you breathe polluted air through gaps between the face and the mask.</p>

<p>When we think of air pollution, densely populated areas and heavy industries usually come to mind. But the situations we are exposed to are more common than you think.</p>
<p><strong>Maasc</strong> can help you in high-risk areas. By providing top-grade filtration and a soft-touch seal, it guarantees that the air that you are inhaling is rid of harmful substances and particles.</p>

<p>Air pollution can seriously affect you on two different fronts: small particles and toxic gases. These pollutants affect your body differently. While small particles can penetrate your circulatory system and organs, substances present in toxic gases can interfere with the dynamic of your body cells. The presence of such elements in the circulatory system provokes a chronic state of inflammation in body tissues.</p>

After numerous iterations we developed the least bulky &amp; lightweight powered respirator using flame resistant, sturdy, and soft-touch material. The material used is flame-resistant, which means it can even be momentarily exposed to direct fire with no risk of combustion. The silicone seal and straps are also resistant to high temperature and provide comfortable use, with equally distributed pressure through the soft seal. The seal itself was a big and worthy challenge, resulting in a really comfortable and sealed fit. Replaceable filters without plastic around account for part of the environmental concern. The embarked electronics enables smart capability to automatically alert you when to replace the filter based upon your environment and the usage of Maasc. The use of protected circuit Li-ion batteries against over charge, over discharge, short circuit and overheating and also replaceable was desirable since they are safer and easier to recycle. In compliance with the JEITA guideline (Japanese guideline for lithium batteries) the batteries charging mode is only allowed between 0°C and 45°C ambient temperature, again to increase your safety. All the fastenings are removable as to separate each individual part for correct disposal at the end of the product cycle. The hidden button avoids the use of cables inside the mask, making it safer and sturdier. The magnetic USB cable permits free movements without danger of being caught up.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622828033/ilq3ivcxrgo4tds0bdp0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1a6113_27bba0e8d354400eaf5655408a868116~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Most of Powered Air Purifying Respirators are equipped with large units of filter | fan | batteries that are attached at your belt or in a backpack.

Its frames and buckles are made of sturdy and high-density flame-retardant ABS &amp; PC. The seal and neckstraps are made of CE LFGB food-grade silicone. These materials can resist extreme temperature and are classified V-0 according to the UL94 standard. As such, they resist high temperatures without leaking toxic chemicals. Our product is also modular, which mean you can easily replace parts if you need, granting it a long-lasting life cycle. The undergoing certification process creates more durability tests that would help us better estimate the product life cycle of Maasc. Overall, our target is to provide a respirator with a life cycle of at least 5 years.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p><p>Maasc is reusable. You can replace the particulates filters and/or the gas filters without the need of any tool. We made sure there is no plastic rim around the filters, better for the environment. Also, the filtering media surface is optimized and you recycle less material compared to a disposable mask that needs about three times more filtering media to operate. As Maasc has a smart function to automatically alert you when your filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, you only recycle filters when it is required – no more, no less. We decided to equip Maasc with protected rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries only. They are the safest on the market and are easy to procure. It is also easy to replace and recycle them. No one want to recycle a device with Lithium batteries inside! All the fastenings designed for Maasc are removable as to separate each individual part for correct disposal at the end of the product life.</p><p> </p><h3>Our roadmap</h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622828094/itpx6oukzegh06ierx01.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622893291/s3zbwdgjncbjth5lgjea.png"" src=""""/></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623073241/qgkua3ty55grpocurxyi.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Maasc was founded 3 years ago by José and Adel.

We love to have the right gear for the job. Although we are optimistic and believe in a future where we don’t need to wear masks anymore in daily life, we would always need good respirators to work in dusty places, and face hazards of mother nature.
 

 

 
Sanding, sawing, painting, spraying, varnishing… These activities release a huge amount of particulate matter and toxic fumes that are inhaled and absorbed by the body, leading to many health issues. Ordinary masks are a hassle: they give you sores, they fog up your glasses or protective goggles, they are bulky and heavy, they dramatically reduce the air flow and, even worse, most don't offer the necessary protection.
 

 
 
 

 
Maasc has great advantages for this types of work. The silicone seal prevents inward leakages. That means that all the air you are breathing actually goes through the filter. The dedicated exhaust valves, in addition to the seal, prevents glasses and goggles from fogging up. And the BreatheEase™ active fan system pulls air in, making breathing seamless, ideal for works that requires physical activity. To top all these features you can still count on the top-grade filtration performance.
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

 
Wildfires are becoming more common and stronger. They are a significant menace for people all around the world, from the US to Australia, from Indonesia to Brazil. Wildfires are dangerous not only because they destroy everything on their way. The smoke they produce fills the air with particulate matter, which are extremely hazardous for your health. This smoke can spread through thousands of miles and even affect areas in different continents. It is something out of our control that we must protect ourselves against. The majority of masks are unsuited for this type of menace, and will let you breathe polluted air through gaps between the face and the mask.
 
If you live in an area prone to wildfires and its devastating consequences, having Maasc comes in handy as an actual safety equipment for you and your family!
 

 
When we think of air pollution, densely populated areas and heavy industries usually come to mind. But the situations we are exposed to are more common than you think.
Maasc can help you in high-risk areas. By providing top-grade filtration and a soft-touch seal, it guarantees that the air that you are inhaling is rid of harmful substances and particles.
 


 
Air pollution can seriously affect you on two different fronts: small particles and toxic gases. These pollutants affect your body differently. While small particles can penetrate your circulatory system and organs, substances present in toxic gases can interfere with the dynamic of your body cells. The presence of such elements in the circulatory system provokes a chronic state of inflammation in body tissues.

We do believe that above all, the breathing experience has to be the best for you to wear your gear for long hours and be happy to repeat the experience the next day...and the day after, else it is just a gadget!    We are currently running pre-certification tests to assess the indicators of safety and filtering efficiency. The results are promising! With your support, we want to certify Maasc for the top-level CE EN12942:1998 harmonized standard.  A constant challenge during the development of Maasc was the tough safety and environmental guidelines we followed to ensure the product is safe and ready to be used even in heavy-duty situations.From day one, we have been serious about creating a Personal Protective Equipment company. Our mission is to deliver the safest, most comfortable and affordable powered respirator to enable mass adoption. The current top-grade respirators price point often forces people to use the less adapted solution to their needs, and we find that unacceptable. Comfort is not the first concern of masks manufacturers. With your comfort in mind, we have been developing Maasc for more than 3 years. We could have launched it last year during the “mask hype period” but we were just not ready.  Your safety is our “raison d’être”. After numerous iterations we developed the least bulky & lightweight powered respirator using flame resistant, sturdy, and soft-touch material. The material used is flame-resistant, which means it can even be momentarily exposed to direct fire with no risk of combustion. The silicone seal and straps are also resistant to high temperature and provide comfortable use, with equally distributed pressure through the soft seal. The seal itself was a big and worthy challenge, resulting in a really comfortable and sealed fit. Replaceable filters without plastic around account for part of the environmental concern. The embarked electronics enables smart capability to automatically alert you when to replace the filter based upon your environment and the usage of Maasc. The use of protected circuit Li-ion batteries against over charge, over discharge, short circuit and overheating and also replaceable was desirable since they are safer and easier to recycle. In compliance with the JEITA guideline (Japanese guideline for lithium batteries) the batteries charging mode is only allowed between 0°C and 45°C ambient temperature, again to increase your safety. All the fastenings are removable as to separate each individual part for correct disposal at the end of the product cycle. The hidden button avoids the use of cables inside the mask, making it safer and sturdier. The magnetic USB cable permits free movements without danger of being caught up.    Most of Powered Air Purifying Respirators are equipped with large units of filter | fan | batteries that are attached at your belt or in a backpack. Well this is good for industrial activities but not to go out for our everyday life.Maasc is designed to solve that! Environmental commitments Long-lasting designMaasc is made with highly durable materials. Its frames and buckles are made of sturdy and high-density flame-retardant ABS & PC. The seal and neckstraps are made of CE LFGB food-grade silicone. These materials can resist extreme temperature and are classified V-0 according to the UL94 standard. As such, they resist high temperatures without leaking toxic chemicals. Our product is also modular, which mean you can easily replace parts if you need, granting it a long-lasting life cycle. The undergoing certification process creates more durability tests that would help us better estimate the product life cycle of Maasc. Overall, our target is to provide a respirator with a life cycle of at least 5 years. Reusability and recyclabilityMaasc is reusable. You can replace the particulates filters and/or the gas filters without the need of any tool. We made sure there is no plastic rim around the filters, better for the environment. Also, the filtering media surface is optimized and you recycle less material compared to a disposable mask that needs about three times more filtering media to operate. As Maasc has a smart function to automatically alert you when your filter is clogged and needs to be replaced, you only recycle filters when it is required – no more, no less. We decided to equip Maasc with protected rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries only. They are the safest on the market and are easy to procure. It is also easy to replace and recycle them. No one want to recycle a device with Lithium batteries inside! All the fastenings designed for Maasc are removable as to separate each individual part for correct disposal at the end of the product life. Our roadmap     Maasc was founded 3 years ago by José and Adel. We both worked for more than 20+ years in tech-industries. During our trips to Asia and Middle East we suffered firsthand from terrible air quality. We decided to take matters into our own hands, drawing on our expertise to develop a personal powered respirator that solves the issues found in existing products. Coming from the Smart Home and Security industry we first thought that adding smart features to masks would be the right thing to do. After years listening to people facing similar problems we came to the conclusion that our device is to be comfortable for prolonged hours and daily usage. Smart features are essential to improve the safety of the wearer.Without a talented team we could not go that far. We are lucky to collaborate with a multidisciplinary, talented, and international team of engineers, designers, and business developers.  Maasc and its partners are constantly developing and improving the product. A recent development is an implementation, with the support of R&D MIT, of more efficient and miniaturized particles and dust sensors. EIT RawMaterials has also been instrumental in developing and implementing motion sensors aided by AI to detect and alert early signs of fatigue of the Maasc’s wearer (funded by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, a body of the European Union for innovation). These developments are already being considered in the future developments of Maasc to enable it to be used in new environments and applications.",56.0,0,"1 Campaign

As we developed quartz, automatic, digital, etc. watches, we were not satisfied with the battery life that quartz watches had.There is always a possibility of the battery dying in battery-powered wristwatches (Regardless of the date of purchase). And exchanging your battery every single time the battery runs out, is not healthy for the environment. We focused on the fact that we need an alternative to be able to use a watch every day, conveniently, and without worrying about the battery running out.  Solar-powered watches have been loved for a while. They are not only more eco-friendly than ordinary battery-powered watches, but they are available to use semi-permanently with sunlight. MUHAN INC has started developing the Scorpion Solar Watch in 2017 to increase the design and quality at a reasonable price. The first product was released in 2018, and the Scorpion Solar Watch V3 was finally released in 2021.   

 
  We gave in a lot of time and effort to release the highest quality wristwatch at an affordable price. The SP3357 VS was built with titanium, Swiss-made Luminous, and sapphire glass. Even though it is equipped with chronograph functions, the SP3357 V3 is less expensive than other watches out in the market.  Unlike quartz watches or automatics from other companies, Solar Watch V3 is powered by charging with light. It works by turning solar power or light into electricity, and the remaining electricity is stored in the secondary battery for later use. Since there’s no need to purchase a replacement battery, it’s convenient and efficient.Charging just for 2 minutes under the light enables immediate usage and keeps it operating all-day-long. You can use it for 90 days with a full charge, and charging with periodic exposure to light allows for semi-permanent use. (Performance may decline if the battery discharges too often, so frequent charging is a must.)   The SP3357, developed with MUHAN INC’s technology, has a substantially low margin of time error than other automatic wristwatches. When comparing side by side with other pricy quartz wristwatches, the SP3357 shows an equivalent or an even lower margin of time error. At the same time, showing the best durability.  Titanium is incredibly durable and doesn’t rust. It has the merits of longer usage than other metal materials. Due to difficulties in processing, it’s mostly used for high-end products only, and is also utilized in artificial joints (as a ‘human-friendly’ material). Aside from the watch body, 5-grade titanium has been applied to all parts of the: bezel, case, band, back, button, crown, and buckle. It weighs just half that of a standard metal watch, and is widely used in spacecraft, airplanes, and golf shafts too. The matt silver color also features a unique shade that only titanium can produce. 191g (0.42lb) << >> 97g (0.21lb)    Titanium's Alluring Deep Charcoal ColorThe exterior of the titanium watch similar to gunmetal evokes a modern and future-oriented sentiment and appears like a stainless steel watch of a slightly dark color. Also, the bezel part gilt with gloss strikes a special and sophisticated harmony with the gun gray color and is equipped with the functional aspect of complementing scratches as well.The titanium metal band in a deep charcoal color unique to titanium displays different hues depending on the viewing angle and lighting, and its robust charm and exceptional tone will allow you to sense varying appeals.  Scorpion Solar Watch V3 Scratch TestThe glass is made from Sapphire Dome Crystal, that has a greater hardness than mineral glass, preventing scratches even over prolonged use. (You’ve probably never seen a watch that’s scratch-free- even after being ran over by a car wheel or being scraped hard by a sharp object). The exceptional light penetrability also clearly displays markings and the second & minute hands. It emits light in the state of absorbs light, not self-illumination.The Swiss luminous feature is available on the minute and hour hands, and on the dail Swiss luminescence has been specially used to upgrade brightness, continuity, and readability. After the watch absorbs plenty of light, you can easily check the time in the dark indoors or at night. The luminescence doesn’t last permanently and fades away slowly.    The Scorpion Solar Watch V3 is equipped with a 50m 5 level air pressure waterproof technology. When the crown is completely locked in, we were able to confirm that there would be no issues at all if the user takes a light shower or goes for a swim. But, you have to make sure to dry your watch thoroughly before controlling the crown or its buttons.              SHINY WITH MATT BAND The wide part on the center of the band is glossy, and the narrow parts on the sides are matt.The models: SP3357M-BU, SP3357M-WH, SP3357M-BK utilize this type of band. MATT BAND Whole sections of the band are matt. The SP3357M-GY model utilizes this band.        Note that you may also need to pay sales tax or VAT, depending on where you live. ​Check with your country’s policies as these rates vary. We cannot be held liable for any additional customs charges that may occur in your location.     MUHAN INC has designed, developed, and distributed wristwatches for 9 years from 2012 to 2021. Scorpion Solar Watch V3 newly released based on the evaluations and advice from supporters backing with great interest has been even more perfected than previous Scorpion Solar Watch products.As of now, a 1-year inspection has been conducted with finished products and not the prototypes, and they are waiting to be produced in the factory. Once the campaign wraps up in success, manufacturing will start the right next day. Everything has been prepared to complete the delivery after 2 months, including the shipping time.We ask for much interest and support from the backers. 2018 - 2019 Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair     Warranty Period: movement warranty (3 years) / 1-time battery warranty (7 years)

There aren't any bad or tier 2 cases in BEHRENS ORIGINAL. All of our cases are the top tier ones which are more than 220% of the cost of normal watch cases.</p><p>In order to make it more sharper and smoother, the watch case is manufactured independently into 3 parts- the two lugs; and the body itself, so as to polish them independently. It then gives out a new level of polishing and exquisiteness than a normal case. Such costly production methods could only be found in luxury watch production.</p><p>The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertically brushed on the lugs, and circular brush on the back. And for this time, we redesigned the dome-shaped sapphire crystal in order to have its smooth and clear curve.</p><p>Although these production methods are long and costly, and sometimes it is unnoticeable until you have a closer look, we aim to give you the best, attractive, durable, and elegant watch cases.</p><p>*Every watch is individually numbered.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616603463/fdv54zk7tj3dgvcf23tk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616603475/xkga8luvbrknj7sy2eb6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616603487/pb8bfs8o2ko7hyz1q8gs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>SLIM WATCH - 7.9MM MECHANICAL WATCH</strong></p><p>Slim appearance is the iconic design element of Behrens Original.

Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for daily wear.</p><p>Dome-shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.3mm dome-shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome-shaped sapphire.

We have a rotary engine module - THE ROTARY, a wandering hour module -  THE SPACESHIP, and a moon phase module - THE MOONPHASE. They were huge successes and you can hardly find a microbrand having a complete unique module watch at this price point. And this time we would like to play with the multi-layer dial to give out a stunning mystery-appearance to the watch. A GROUP OF WATCH ENTHUSIASTSBEHRENS is an independent watch brand formed by a group of watch-lovers from Hong Kong, Germany, British, and Mainland; from which our focus is to turn our design concepts and philosophy into real products via our own manufacturing and production facilities. With our own engineering team and high-tech machinery, we are capable of producing all the parts that we designed and developed based on the modifications that we worked on each mechanical movement. From which our traits are to construct mechanical modules that offer additional complications to the existing movement in order to build our unique timepieces. We have a rotary engine module like THE ROTARY, a wandering hour like THE SPACESHIP, a moon phase module like THE MOONPHASE.With a group of designers and engineers working perfectly, interesting ideas and developments popping up every day! Be sure to follow us so you won’t miss any upcoming models!Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/behrenswatchesInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/behrenswatchesWe want our watches to be well-made and with a high-end quality, which has been acknowledged and proven by 800+ backers and customers all over the world. We are being discussed on many forums and groups organised by watch lovers.Our four successful Kickstarter campaigns:THE MOONPHASE: LINK HERETHE ALL-ROUND: LINK HERETHE SPACESHIP: LINK HERETHE MOONLIGHT: LINK HERE  THE MULTI-LAYER DIAL AND THE MYSTERY HOUROur goal is to make a huge time-telling module together with our signature diamond cutting reflective index. A doughnut-like hour disc rotates mysteriously underneath a spaceship-like structure is what we want to achieve. The huge time-telling module is driven by a set of secret gears combined with unique bearings we invented -- to greatly reduce the turning force and increase the stability of the whole module. We also want it to be futuristic, thus we punched through the hour disc with a CNC machine and filled some of them with lume. The diamond cutting reflective index together with the Swiss Super-LumiNova®is like a futuristic space station in operation.The whole module is covered by a triangle structure which is made from an alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel-plated with platinum/black. It is processed with CNC and handcrafted polishing. With the 45-degree minute marks printed onto it, the triangle structure is rich in detail with a sense of futurism.*Swiss Super-LumiNova® BGW9 is used for numerals, which emits a Blue-Green glow in the dark and looks white in daylight.*More about Swiss Super-LumiNova® BGW9https://luciusatelier.com/blogs/news/learn-about-the-swiss-super-luminova-bgw9-lume  HOW TO TELL THE TIME?The hour disc rotates 2 cycles per day, with a pointer located at the bottom of the watch to indicate the current hour. The triangle minute hand is placed in the centre. One angle of which is filled with Swiss Super-LumiNova® and is the pointer of the minute hand. You can easily tell the time with the 45-degree marks printed onto the triangle structure. DIAMOND CUTTING REFLECTIVE INDEXWe innovated a new method of index making, the Diamond Cutting Index, in THE MOONPHASE as well as THE ALL-ROUND. It is world-known and loved by many Behrens Original fans. We insist on putting it onto THE STELLAR. The index is cut by a diamond cutter 20 times in two directions; thus the surface of the index is a complex oblique. To give the dial a luxurious touch, light is our major resource. With light reflected on the index’s glossy surface from different angles, a rainbow(chrome) color is created. We believe such a natural phenomenon will attract many of you. MULTI-POLISHING CASE 220% MORE COSTThe excellent case design is one of the significant symbols of our watches. It is also widely loved by 800+ BEHRENS ORIGINAL customers. This time, we decided to provide the highest standard case we can get for you all.The premium watch case we used on THE STELLAR is exactly the same as we use on the premium standard on THE SPACESHIP. There aren't any bad or tier 2 cases in BEHRENS ORIGINAL. All of our cases are the top tier ones which are more than 220% of the cost of normal watch cases.In order to make it more sharper and smoother, the watch case is manufactured independently into 3 parts- the two lugs; and the body itself, so as to polish them independently. It then gives out a new level of polishing and exquisiteness than a normal case. Such costly production methods could only be found in luxury watch production.The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertically brushed on the lugs, and circular brush on the back. And for this time, we redesigned the dome-shaped sapphire crystal in order to have its smooth and clear curve.Although these production methods are long and costly, and sometimes it is unnoticeable until you have a closer look, we aim to give you the best, attractive, durable, and elegant watch cases.*Every watch is individually numbered. SLIM WATCH - 7.9MM MECHANICAL WATCHSlim appearance is the iconic design element of Behrens Original. Our slim design is adored by 800+ Behrens Original backers and supporters.In order to have a nice mechanical watch with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality redesigned dome-shaped sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 7.9mm, exclusively the dome-shaped sapphire. With the dome-shaped sapphire, the total height is only 12.3mm.Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words that can fully describe the hardship we had in the process, but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly into making this unique yet slim mechanical watch. OUR MOVEMENT - MIYOTA 9015We modify the huge time-telling module from Miyota 9015.Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors. Our factory has more than 15 years of experience in the Swiss and Japanese movement watchmaking and watch modification.This time we selected the Miyota 9015 for our movement, which is well-known for its slimness, reliability, and stability. This Japan movement functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 24 jewels, 42-hour power reserve, automatic winding, and a sweep second movement. With a movement of the height of 3.9mm and 26mm overall diameter, it is super slim. Combining both thin body and functionality, this movement is only used in high-class watches. Although the price of this movement is very high, we persist to provide the best we can.*the first sample comes out 9 months before to test the reliability and stability. It is running very great for months. SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL ONLY - 4.3MM THICKFor producing luxurious watches, we persist to use only sapphire crystal for both sides of the watches. Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the Mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for daily wear.Dome-shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.3mm dome-shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome-shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time-consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome-shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low. ACCURACY - 7 DAYS, T0, T24 TESTSWatch modification and movement tuning are our central focus. As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.The testing procedure lasts 7 daysDay 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up, and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24), the movement is tested again in the five positions.Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only.We need to ensure the watches are adequate in every situation. We then on-wrist tested the sample watches for more than 9 months before we started our Kickstarter campaign. The stableness of BEHRENS ORIGINAL watches is highly guaranteed. ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP -  INTERCHANGEABLE CATCHWe are all perfectionists, we see the pairing of the best leather strap and BEHRENS watches is an obligation. We provide a high quality fine crafted Italian calf leather strap as usual to give you the most comfortable and pleasant wearing experience.

We saw a need for a face mask that not only covers your face, but allows you to add a sense of personal taste, fashion and inspiration to your outfit. ZenMoon Masks are a breath of fresh air, a reminder to breathe and to trust that everything is as it should be. The symbols and designs are beautiful, subtle and perfect for those looking for a more sophisticated way to present themselves in public.    The Fibonacci Spiral is one of the oldest known symbols. It is a powerful yet spiritual symbol, connecting us to Nature, our Earth and the Galaxy. Our Life Force Energy, known as Kundalini, is a Spiral that flows from the base of our spine. It represents God/Goddess, Life, Energy and Evolving Journey.   The Spiral is found in human physiology, animals, plants and minerals in nature as well as weather patterns. This sacred symbol reminds us of our ever evolving journey in life.The Spirals in our designs are clockwise - sending energy out, and counterclockwise – bringing energy in.    The mandala is a diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically; a time-microcosm of the universe. It can also represent wholeness and a model for the organizational structure of life itself, a cosmic diagram that shows the relation to the infinite and the world that extends beyond our minds and bodies.  Mandalas may be employed for focusing attention and establishing a sacred space as an aid to meditation.   Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions.   The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles is often considered sacred.    The Fibonacci Spiral connects us to Nature, our Earth and the Galaxy. This sacred symbol reminds us of our ever evolving journey in life. The mandala is a diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically; a time-microcosm of the universe.   Merging these two designs brings together Nature and our Earth with the organizational structure of life itself.    Vision, Self Expression, Spirituality, Awakening, Integrity, Freedom, Guidance, Protection & Watchfulness are all represented by the peacock.   In Greco-Roman mythology, the Peacock tail has the “eyes” of the stars. In Hinduism, the Peacock is associated with Lakshmi who represents patience, kindness and luck.    A connection to several of the most important sacred symbols. While the sun represents the masculine, strength, and power, the moon finds balance with the feminine, calmness, and nurturing.  The 3rd eye gazes inward towards the self as it connects to universal awareness, and the Fibonacci spiral represents the life force energy and eternal sign of the creative and organizing principles of the universe.    We are a woman-owned design and production company with more than 25 years of experience. We have brought products to life, from concept to design to manufacturing, for some of the biggest companies across the globe. Now, we are bringing products we believe in directly to you! We value living an inspired, mindful, and compassionate life, and our goal is to deliver that inspiration to your doorstep through beautifully-crafted face masks.   Here’s a quick look at the structure and quality of our Masks.",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

  Our team placed great emphasis on the product design to make it an elegant alternative to carrying cumbersome bottles of hand sanitizer.        With SprayCare™ you can disinfect any surface with ease. The sanitizing liquid can be directed onto any surface or into the palm of your hand. An LED indicator illuminates when it is time to recharge SprayCare so that you are never left unprotected.     SprayCare™ uses one of the latest generation atomizers to electronically spray the disinfectant at the touch of a button.      Our atomizer dispenses droplets of sanitizer that produces superior coverage. The result is an effective and economical use of the disinfectant.  Common sprayers are less practical to sanitize common-use objects primarily because the nozzles produce large drops of the dispensed liquid. These larger drops result in uneven application of the disinfectant and leaves some areas unclean.          SprayCare™ has the capacity to provide more than 40 applications of disinfectant, and each application runs for a total of 3 seconds. With SprayCare you will be protected throughout the entirety of your day.   SprayCare™ has been optimized to work with liquid hand sanitizers. Gels or liquids with higher density than liquid hand sanitizer can damage the device and should not be used.

<p><strong>THE INSPIRATION:</strong></p>
<p>My dad passed his love of wristwatches to my older brother and I. My dad and older brother, being Nigerian with an innate appreciation of style, taught me that a good watch went hand in hand with dressing up and looking good. The first watch that I remember getting was a Timex. My dad got my siblings and I one each. I treasured mine and fell in love with what a good watch stood for; style, affordability, durability and a chance to show off your personality. When I could buy my own watches, I couldn't afford high end luxury so settled for lower quality, ‘cheap &amp; cheerful’. I realised early that a lot of affordable watches are made from low quality materials, using cheap engine movements, glass, poor straps, all aimed at minimising costs and making huge profits. Over time, the materials fall apart, fail to function and the watch stops working. For any watch maker, brand honesty and integrity should be your key components.  As a watch enthusiast, I was annoyed that some manufacturers would short-change buyers. I thought to myself, there must a better way, a win win for both watchmaker and customer. And so my journey and research into watch making began. Afterwards, armed with a number of years’ insight and appreciation of the whole process and the industry, I was inspired to do something different; make really affordable watches that were stylish and good quality. This feat was made possible by myself and a small, dedicated team, who also share my passion and vision. We have worked (and will continue to do so) tirelessly for the past two and a half years, designing and redesigning the ‘ideal’ everyday affordable wristwatch. And we achieved it without using substandard materials, made with precision and specifications that set us apart. My first collection, the <strong>Inspire Chronograph Collection</strong>, is made up of just that. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624875380/yd8s1nn0irwlblplpioz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IDEA BEHIND NAME KALOSDIAL:</strong></p>
<p>The word <strong>‘Kalos’</strong> is Greek and means; beautiful, noble, good. For me this was apt and described my brand to a tee, “something beautiful” inside and out. Our dials, being an integral part of our watches, tick this box a 100%. You are drawn immediately to the craftmanship that has gone into making them appeal to anyone with a good eye for fashion. And when it comes to what makes our watches tick, the engine movement is the most vital part and I made sure ours is supported and made of good quality specifications. The Inspired Chronograph Collection is powered by the Miyota 0S21 Japan movement, a proven and accurate engine movement with a battery life of up to 5 years and accuracy of +/-20 second per month. This ensures a seamless transition of time telling from your watch.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624871851/ksg4qcwdo5uizytapq8f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>                                                                               </p>
<p><strong>THE VISION FOR KALOSDIAL WRISTWATCHES:</strong></p>
<p>Coming from<b> </b>a developing country means I appreciate that quality usually comes at a very high price.  More often than not, we ‘import’ these items. We put a high value on brands made elsewhere. My question then and my quest now is; why shouldn’t I or anyone be able to buy a good quality watch at an affordable price? And why can’t I create a brand that does just that? My vision comes from an idea that is fueled by hard work and integrity. I want Kalosdial watches to stand shoulder to shoulder with other brands, evolving over time to capture hearts and the market at the same time. This is my vision, a brand that lets you define your style and own it whilst being affordable and still ticking all the boxes when it comes to quality. <strong>A good product should never be judged by where it originates from, but by the quality and standards that have gone into making it and, most notably, meeting customer expectations.</strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624872131/ewsn6njwt935oowhumpl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER:</strong></p>
<p>With your support, Kalosdial watches can change the narrative. By backing my brand and pre-ordering a Kalosdial watch, you will be supporting my vision of creating watches that are; affordable, stylish timepieces that anyone would be proud to own.</p>
<p>I am in this for the long haul, the plan is to plough back and invest in the brand as I listen to the customer and the market. I want to build on what I have done and break barriers going forward with funds raised on Indiegogo. As a start-up, we have current limitations to how far we can go with our product line. The watch casings used for our founders’ collection launch might be generic but they are of high quality. And we have extended this focus to making sure the most important things meet high quality requirements. Our engine movement, parts and specifications attest to this and it is the design and finishing of each watch that makes our brand unique. The funds I raise here will ensure I have a strong foundation to produce the whole Inspire Chronograph Collection as well as help put in motion, the creation and production of my next collection of mecaquartz and automatic in-house watch designs, all of which are currently already on the drawing board. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624874512/unjvwkn5j9qbbo7rbp9g.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>THE INSPIRE CHRONOGRAPH COLLECTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Inspire Chronograph consist of six watch designs; each has its essence. We say <strong>""Be Bold, Live free"" </strong>with any of our watches for those daring to be different and express their style differently. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Marvos Gold Chronograph:</strong>  Manages to capture a balance of looking sleek yet simple. It's that simplicity that portrays class and tells a lot about the wearer's personality. <strong>'Marvos'</strong> is Greek and means Black. Black and Gold are always associated with style and class. Marvos Gold Chrono captures this.</li>
<li>
<strong>Allure Rose Gold Chronograph:</strong> Rose gold never looked so good until now. It accentuates a woman's confidence, beauty and intelligence all wrapped around her wrist.</li>
<li>
<strong>Machismo Steel Chronograph:</strong>  Is all about confidence, strength and speaks true to its name.</li>
<li>
<strong>Midnight Blue Chronograph:</strong> There's almost something quite serene about it, with its beautiful shade of blue and sunray polish. A design that can be worn at anytime, its laid back appearance and its portrayal of calmness will surely get you noticed.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Onyx Elite Chronograph:</strong> Like its counterpart, the Marvos Gold Chrono. The Onyx Elite Chrono is associated with style and class with its unique appeal.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Intrepid Luxe Chronograph:</strong> It is for those quintessential people who are adventurous and know precisely what they want when making a bold fashion statement. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625475621/a9p6rd00iv0sacnrna0s.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR SPECIFICATIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Our specifications set us apart from other brands because we only used quality parts for our watches, not focusing entirely on profit margins but on customer experience and satisfaction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625478675/bdmz6ns3ofcf1gcfafrv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</strong></p>
<p>Kalosdial wristwatches, we are building around integrity and honesty. Whenever there is a delay or change at every step of production, we will promptly inform our customers about it through our established communication channels. We would be as direct and open about it as reasonably practicable. Another challenge we may encounter is spreading the word about Kalosdial wristwatches and getting more people on Indiegogo to invest their weight of support in us by pre-ordering our wristwatches. That is why we are appealing to family, friends, and other social media influencers to spread the word massively around and build the Kalosdial Trybe. Our manufacturers are very experienced in the wristwatch industry, and we have built strong working relationships with them, especially when it comes to quality standards. We have also perfected our shipping strategy to ensure all our customers receive their watches in time and good condition.</p>

<p><strong>Oludele Adefowope- Founder of Kalosdial wristwatches</strong></p>
</div></div>","THE INSPIRATION:
My dad passed his love of wristwatches to my older brother and I. My dad and older brother, being Nigerian with an innate appreciation of style, taught me that a good watch went hand in hand with dressing up and looking good. The first watch that I remember getting was a Timex. My dad got my siblings and I one each. I treasured mine and fell in love with what a good watch stood for; style, affordability, durability and a chance to show off your personality. When I could buy my own watches, I couldn't afford high end luxury so settled for lower quality, ‘cheap & cheerful’. I realised early that a lot of affordable watches are made from low quality materials, using cheap engine movements, glass, poor straps, all aimed at minimising costs and making huge profits. Over time, the materials fall apart, fail to function and the watch stops working. For any watch maker, brand honesty and integrity should be your key components.  As a watch enthusiast, I was annoyed that some manufacturers would short-change buyers. I thought to myself, there must a better way, a win win for both watchmaker and customer. And so my journey and research into watch making began. Afterwards, armed with a number of years’ insight and appreciation of the whole process and the industry, I was inspired to do something different; make really affordable watches that were stylish and good quality. This feat was made possible by myself and a small, dedicated team, who also share my passion and vision. We have worked (and will continue to do so) tirelessly for the past two and a half years, designing and redesigning the ‘ideal’ everyday affordable wristwatch. And we achieved it without using substandard materials, made with precision and specifications that set us apart. My first collection, the Inspire Chronograph Collection, is made up of just that. 
 
THE IDEA BEHIND NAME KALOSDIAL:
The word ‘Kalos’ is Greek and means; beautiful, noble, good. For me this was apt and described my brand to a tee, “something beautiful” inside and out. Our dials, being an integral part of our watches, tick this box a 100%. You are drawn immediately to the craftmanship that has gone into making them appeal to anyone with a good eye for fashion. And when it comes to what makes our watches tick, the engine movement is the most vital part and I made sure ours is supported and made of good quality specifications. The Inspired Chronograph Collection is powered by the Miyota 0S21 Japan movement, a proven and accurate engine movement with a battery life of up to 5 years and accuracy of +/-20 second per month. This ensures a seamless transition of time telling from your watch.  
                                                                               
THE VISION FOR KALOSDIAL WRISTWATCHES:
Coming from a developing country means I appreciate that quality usually comes at a very high price.  More often than not, we ‘import’ these items. We put a high value on brands made elsewhere. My question then and my quest now is; why shouldn’t I or anyone be able to buy a good quality watch at an affordable price? And why can’t I create a brand that does just that? My vision comes from an idea that is fueled by hard work and integrity. I want Kalosdial watches to stand shoulder to shoulder with other brands, evolving over time to capture hearts and the market at the same time. This is my vision, a brand that lets you define your style and own it whilst being affordable and still ticking all the boxes when it comes to quality. A good product should never be judged by where it originates from, but by the quality and standards that have gone into making it and, most notably, meeting customer expectations. 
 
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER:
With your support, Kalosdial watches can change the narrative. By backing my brand and pre-ordering a Kalosdial watch, you will be supporting my vision of creating watches that are; affordable, stylish timepieces that anyone would be proud to own.
I am in this for the long haul, the plan is to plough back and invest in the brand as I listen to the customer and the market. I want to build on what I have done and break barriers going forward with funds raised on Indiegogo. As a start-up, we have current limitations to how far we can go with our product line. The watch casings used for our founders’ collection launch might be generic but they are of high quality. And we have extended this focus to making sure the most important things meet high quality requirements. Our engine movement, parts and specifications attest to this and it is the design and finishing of each watch that makes our brand unique. The funds I raise here will ensure I have a strong foundation to produce the whole Inspire Chronograph Collection as well as help put in motion, the creation and production of my next collection of mecaquartz and automatic in-house watch designs, all of which are currently already on the drawing board. 
 

THE INSPIRE CHRONOGRAPH COLLECTION:
The Inspire Chronograph consist of six watch designs; each has its essence. We say ""Be Bold, Live free"" with any of our watches for those daring to be different and express their style differently. 


The Marvos Gold Chronograph:  Manages to capture a balance of looking sleek yet simple. It's that simplicity that portrays class and tells a lot about the wearer's personality. 'Marvos' is Greek and means Black. Black and Gold are always associated with style and class. Marvos Gold Chrono captures this.

Allure Rose Gold Chronograph: Rose gold never looked so good until now. It accentuates a woman's confidence, beauty and intelligence all wrapped around her wrist.

Machismo Steel Chronograph:  Is all about confidence, strength and speaks true to its name.

Midnight Blue Chronograph: There's almost something quite serene about it, with its beautiful shade of blue and sunray polish. A design that can be worn at anytime, its laid back appearance and its portrayal of calmness will surely get you noticed.

The Onyx Elite Chronograph: Like its counterpart, the Marvos Gold Chrono. The Onyx Elite Chrono is associated with style and class with its unique appeal.

The Intrepid Luxe Chronograph: It is for those quintessential people who are adventurous and know precisely what they want when making a bold fashion statement. 


 
OUR SPECIFICATIONS:
Our specifications set us apart from other brands because we only used quality parts for our watches, not focusing entirely on profit margins but on customer experience and satisfaction.

 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES:
Kalosdial wristwatches, we are building around integrity and honesty. Whenever there is a delay or change at every step of production, we will promptly inform our customers about it through our established communication channels. We would be as direct and open about it as reasonably practicable. Another challenge we may encounter is spreading the word about Kalosdial wristwatches and getting more people on Indiegogo to invest their weight of support in us by pre-ordering our wristwatches. That is why we are appealing to family, friends, and other social media influencers to spread the word massively around and build the Kalosdial Trybe. Our manufacturers are very experienced in the wristwatch industry, and we have built strong working relationships with them, especially when it comes to quality standards. We have also perfected our shipping strategy to ensure all our customers receive their watches in time and good condition.

 
ALL ABOUT PERFECTION:
We are deliberate with our choices. One is to maintain product integrity for the Kalosdial brand sustainably. Our goal for durability and quality is to rank among the bankable assets of our customers. We have studied our prototypes closely and seen there is still room for improvement. We have made specific visible changes.Consequently, the final production of our watches will be a little higher in quality and more appealing in appearance than the prototypes we have been showcasing. Giving our esteemed customers a better experience and more personal touch with our watches. Here are such significant changes:
●      Slight increase in size for Logo and brand name on the dials of all our watches;
●      Illuminous dial Bartons/hour and minute hands for - Onyx Elite Chronograph, Midnight Blue Chronograph and Intrepid Luxe Chronograph.
●      White stamped ‘Eko Inspired’ silver Logo/brand name instead of black for Midnight Blue Chronograph  and Intrepid Luxe Chronograph for better visibility.
●      Upgraded to 10 ATM Water Resistant instead of 5 ATM Water Resistant for all watch designs.

This allows each style to be worn for so many different occasions. </p><p><strong>A LITTLE HISTORY:</strong></p><p>Our founder and creative director, Cori Michelle Atamer, grew up in Wyoming where fashion and trends were not always top of mind. However, that did not stop her from developing her individual style by wearing colorful prints, flowy fabrics, or whatever she felt suitable for the occasion. This turned many heads and she soon realized that many of the outfits she had in her closet were not fitted for everyday wear. Eventually she moved to LA where she found fashion in everything and her personal style was more accepted. She eventually started a job in the digital marketing industry, where the dress code was open and a little more lenient. While this allowed for more opportunity to wear the pieces in her closet that did not get as much love, there were still many more revealing pieces that were only appropriate for LA’s nightlife.

We are different because not only do we provide the option to show as much or as little leg as you want, but we also let you choose how much or little bust. This allows each style to be worn for so many different occasions. A LITTLE HISTORY:Our founder and creative director, Cori Michelle Atamer, grew up in Wyoming where fashion and trends were not always top of mind. However, that did not stop her from developing her individual style by wearing colorful prints, flowy fabrics, or whatever she felt suitable for the occasion. This turned many heads and she soon realized that many of the outfits she had in her closet were not fitted for everyday wear. Eventually she moved to LA where she found fashion in everything and her personal style was more accepted. She eventually started a job in the digital marketing industry, where the dress code was open and a little more lenient. While this allowed for more opportunity to wear the pieces in her closet that did not get as much love, there were still many more revealing pieces that were only appropriate for LA’s nightlife. That is when she came up with the idea for her brand to design styles that are not only sexy but have the option to wear for a more modest occasion, such as the workplace or family gatherings.WHAT MAKES CORI MICHELLE DIFFERENT?CORI MICHELLE brings innovative dresses, skirts, tops, and jumpsuits with design details:Design patent pending XO Cami that is worn with its accompanying dress or top to provide bust coverage and the illusion that it is one piece. The XO Cami comes with the style and is not sold separately. This gives these styles 3x ways to wear them: Cami with dress/top for a more modest look, just the dress or top for a sexier look, or the cami by itself. Dresses and skirts that have buttons from waist to hem that can be buttoned up for a more conservative look or unbuttoned to show more leg. Skirts or dresses that have buttons up to the waistline will be sewn together 6-7” down so that there is no gaping around the midsection when standing or sitting. 
Skirts and dresses that meet or exceed fingertip length so that they are appropriate for the office. The skirt also stays in place so you aren’t constantly tugging at the fabric and readjusting throughout the day.
Dresses, jumpsuits, and skirts will always have pockets when the style allows.
 Jumpsuits are designed with taller women in mind. The crotch is dropped 2-3"" compared to many of the jumpsuits out there which allow taller women to wear them comfortably and still look great on those that are shorter. Thoughtful zipper placement for ease of getting out of the garment quickly. SIZING:Did you know most women do not know how to properly measure themselves for the style they are purchasing and end up with the wrong size?Our sizing reflects real women’s bodies and recommendations are given specific to each piece. We will let you know if you size should be matched with a waist measurement over a bust measurement, for example.Cori Michelle will be available in sizes:XS | S | M | L | XL ECO-CONSCIOUS PACKAGING:Our customers will be delighted when receiving their packages. Our packaging is beautifully minimalist in design and created from eco-conscious materials.Our styles are packed in 100% compostable bags, which can be disposed of at home or commercially.No plastics are used to ship our products to customers.By wearing CORI MICHELLE, you will be the chicest person in the room, while also helping the environment. PRODUCTION:Cori Michelle is proudly made in the US and chooses locally sourced manufacturers.This brings positive change to the fashion industry, by taking a stance against the manipulation of less developed countries where workers are treated poorly. When you buy from me, you are helping the industry move the in the right direction.Our manufacturers follow all CAL/OSHA health and safety requirements and ensure that our garment workers enjoy safe and ethical working conditions while earning a fair wage.

<p>A door left ajar, a front gate not properly shut, or a literal window of opportunity. A few seconds of confusion before the panic starts to settle in: “Where is Fido? How long has he been gone? And how will we find him?”</p>
<p><strong>Findster Home</strong> is the answer to these questions and much more! It lets you and your family monitor your pets’ location and activity whenever you want, wherever you are - making sure you’re prepared for any escape attempts and allowing you to react immediately and decisively. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150111/ew6cd6fp6brwtufy6ehk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> Here’s how <strong>Findster Home</strong> will improve your life - and protect your pets’!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150162/kjfbdn0139hdqxart7rm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150243/ac5csun0uplawjabsrgc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We’re pet lovers first and foremost, and developed Findster to be the answer to a real-life problem: a way to track Aquiles, a strong-willed dog who just wouldn’t quit escaping. Every pet tracker available requires a contract and monthly fees, so we focused on creating a definitive solution that avoided this.</p>
<p><strong>Findster Home</strong> is independent from the cellular infrastructure, so there are no forced contracts or monthly fees for using it. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in New York, Alaska, or Japan - as long as you have an internet connection, you’ll be able to use Findster Home without any problems, and without any monthly costs. Pay once, use it forever!</p>
<p>Also, since it does not depend on the cellular infrastructure, <strong>Findster Home</strong> can be setup anywhere in the world without restrictions... And you can be sure it’ll work a treat!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150347/blbalsw7s8seywqfoi0u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Findster Home</strong> continuously tracks your pets’ location using the most precise GPS technology. Their position is accurately displayed in real-time on the map, which you and your loved ones can access at any time and anywhere via the Findster App.</p>
<p>At work, on holiday, or even in other countries - wherever you may be, as long as you have an Internet connection, you’ll be able to keep tabs on your furry friends back home. Who said you can’t be in two places at once?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150373/h37fgnsvpegkwafscnvk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But how can you know if your pet is safe and sound without constantly checking their location? That’s easy: by creating a <strong>virtual fence</strong> around your home! These are entirely customizable, so you can define them as you see fit: if you live in the suburbs and your cat is welcome to visit the neighbors’ yards, you can define a larger virtual fence and be notified if he leaves the neighborhood instead. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150402/tw65trxjd4lmnjggtlor.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When a pet escapes or is otherwise missing, time is of the essence. Whenever a fence is breached, you’ll receive an immediate alert on your phone - via text message and the Findster App - so you can act swiftly and bring your four-legged friends back to safety. Other family members will be simultaneously warned, so whoever’s closest can jump into action.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150419/zdv6pm3hxmjud2kxcp1v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> We don’t always have our phones at hand when we’re at home. Even when that is the case, they’re often on “Silent” mode, which could stop us from noticing an important alert. Because of this, <strong>Findster Home</strong> includes a loudspeaker and will audibly notify you of any alerts so you don’t miss vital information.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150445/ssr3bct59tqpekpqzcdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> Let’s say your buddy is a true escape artist who carefully carries out a master plan to break out. The Findster App includes a Radar which will guide you right to their location, so you won’t have to guess which of their favorite spots they went to! They’ll be the ones left guessing how you managed to figure it out so quickly...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150475/zqr7rb9z6kmm6ovoaaxq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> Assuring our pets’ well-being is a full-time job, which involves much more than keeping track of their whereabouts. <strong>Findster Home</strong> monitors their activity levels throughout the day, so you can know if they’re getting the perfect amounts of exercise and rest. The App will notify you when things could be better, helping you assure your pets are living their best life!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150497/jzo67rqjguxdasabafbi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> When it comes to our pets, we always want to be in the loop. With <strong>Findster Home</strong>, you’ll be able to view a heat map compiling the places where they’ve been spending the most time, plus how much they've walked and at which times of day they were most active. You'll be able to better understand your pets' habits - and if they have a new favorite spot, you’ll be sure to find out!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150523/bnl0mr7sbwtdmvvo3e7e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our pets are the heart of our families, and we think about them even when we’re not around. <strong>Findster Home</strong> makes keeping your peace of mind way easier: let’s say your daughter lives 5 miles away from you - she’ll still be able to track Mr. Tail-wagger and make sure he’s safe and sound.<br/>Please note that your data is strictly confidential and only authorized persons can access it! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150549/yupfbzfy6frlfcnkwnyr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Findster Home</strong> lets you monitor up to 3 pets at once, maintaining the same level of protection and effectiveness. The more the merrier!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150572/ewtvk09evl2nd1wzmdjr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each <strong>Findster Home</strong> consists of a Basestation, to be placed within your home, and one or more Pet Modules, attached to the pets’ collar. Each pet’s location and activity information can be accessed using the Findster App on your phone!</p>
<p>We designed <strong>Findster Home</strong> to be more than family-friendly - it’s family-focused. It’s easy to setup and use, the App is super user-friendly, and we have the best Support Team on hand to help you with any trouble you may encounter. We’re here for you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150625/m9yxrixcselkevdhgaqr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> The Pet Modules are lightweight, sturdy and waterproof. They’re rechargeable via USB (the charger is included in each kit), and can be securely attached to any collar using the included strap attachment mechanism</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150701/tullhwjuzevhm369zdw5.jpg"" src=""""/>.</p>
<p> So how come <strong>Findster Home</strong> does not depend on the cellular infrastructure (and why does this matter)? The answer is our exclusive <strong>MAZE communication technology</strong>. It allows the Pet Module and the Basestation to communicate wirelessly in a range of up to 6 miles (~10 km) without requiring a cellular connection to send the GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>The data is then sent to the cloud via your home Wi-Fi, and you can access it anywhere with your phone's own 4G connection.</p>
<p>Therefore, Findster is free from mobile network carriers. <strong>No carrier = No contract = No monthly fees!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576150730/tqgwsn7tsswefutb01kd.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because <strong>Findster Home</strong> allows the detailed monitoring of your pets’ activity, we looked into how we could build on this, in order to let you take advantage of these health monitoring capabilities with ease and convenience.</p>
<p>Introducing Findster Care! It combines intensive data collection and analysis by AI with the irreplaceable expertise of human Vets, to provide you the best way of taking care of your pet.</p>
<p>With Findster Care, you’ll have access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A real Vet available 24/7 to answer any pet-related questions you may have, at your convenience;</li>
<li>Meaningful, tailored insights on your pets’ health and behavior, based on the activity recorded by the Pet module;</li>
<li>Early detection of possible health-related issues, through continuous monitoring of your buddies’ evolution over time;</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the good news is that this optional service is already available within the Findster App.</p>
<p>The GREAT news is that every <strong>Findster Home</strong> perk includes a 12-month Findster Care subscription, completely free of charge! </p>

<p>We’ve been working on Findster since 2014. In fact, you may recall the Findster name from our previous campaign for Findster Duo, the first GPS Pet Tracker without monthly fees. That was three years ago - the campaign was successfully funded by 1700 backers from over 50 countries, and we went on to develop, manufacture, and deliver the product. We continually listened to our backers’ feedback and made available updates for both the modules and the App on a regular basis, as a result.</p>

</div></div>","A door left ajar, a front gate not properly shut, or a literal window of opportunity. A few seconds of confusion before the panic starts to settle in: “Where is Fido? How long has he been gone? And how will we find him?”
Findster Home is the answer to these questions and much more! It lets you and your family monitor your pets’ location and activity whenever you want, wherever you are - making sure you’re prepared for any escape attempts and allowing you to react immediately and decisively. 


 Here’s how Findster Home will improve your life - and protect your pets’!


We’re pet lovers first and foremost, and developed Findster to be the answer to a real-life problem: a way to track Aquiles, a strong-willed dog who just wouldn’t quit escaping. Every pet tracker available requires a contract and monthly fees, so we focused on creating a definitive solution that avoided this.
Findster Home is independent from the cellular infrastructure, so there are no forced contracts or monthly fees for using it. It doesn’t matter whether you’re in New York, Alaska, or Japan - as long as you have an internet connection, you’ll be able to use Findster Home without any problems, and without any monthly costs. Pay once, use it forever!
Also, since it does not depend on the cellular infrastructure, Findster Home can be setup anywhere in the world without restrictions... And you can be sure it’ll work a treat!

Findster Home continuously tracks your pets’ location using the most precise GPS technology. Their position is accurately displayed in real-time on the map, which you and your loved ones can access at any time and anywhere via the Findster App.
At work, on holiday, or even in other countries - wherever you may be, as long as you have an Internet connection, you’ll be able to keep tabs on your furry friends back home. Who said you can’t be in two places at once?

But how can you know if your pet is safe and sound without constantly checking their location? That’s easy: by creating a virtual fence around your home! These are entirely customizable, so you can define them as you see fit: if you live in the suburbs and your cat is welcome to visit the neighbors’ yards, you can define a larger virtual fence and be notified if he leaves the neighborhood instead. 

When a pet escapes or is otherwise missing, time is of the essence. Whenever a fence is breached, you’ll receive an immediate alert on your phone - via text message and the Findster App - so you can act swiftly and bring your four-legged friends back to safety. Other family members will be simultaneously warned, so whoever’s closest can jump into action.

 We don’t always have our phones at hand when we’re at home. Even when that is the case, they’re often on “Silent” mode, which could stop us from noticing an important alert. Because of this, Findster Home includes a loudspeaker and will audibly notify you of any alerts so you don’t miss vital information.

 Let’s say your buddy is a true escape artist who carefully carries out a master plan to break out. The Findster App includes a Radar which will guide you right to their location, so you won’t have to guess which of their favorite spots they went to! They’ll be the ones left guessing how you managed to figure it out so quickly...

 Assuring our pets’ well-being is a full-time job, which involves much more than keeping track of their whereabouts. Findster Home monitors their activity levels throughout the day, so you can know if they’re getting the perfect amounts of exercise and rest. The App will notify you when things could be better, helping you assure your pets are living their best life!

 When it comes to our pets, we always want to be in the loop. With Findster Home, you’ll be able to view a heat map compiling the places where they’ve been spending the most time, plus how much they've walked and at which times of day they were most active. You'll be able to better understand your pets' habits - and if they have a new favorite spot, you’ll be sure to find out!

Our pets are the heart of our families, and we think about them even when we’re not around. Findster Home makes keeping your peace of mind way easier: let’s say your daughter lives 5 miles away from you - she’ll still be able to track Mr. Tail-wagger and make sure he’s safe and sound.Please note that your data is strictly confidential and only authorized persons can access it! 

Findster Home lets you monitor up to 3 pets at once, maintaining the same level of protection and effectiveness. The more the merrier!

Each Findster Home consists of a Basestation, to be placed within your home, and one or more Pet Modules, attached to the pets’ collar. Each pet’s location and activity information can be accessed using the Findster App on your phone!
We designed Findster Home to be more than family-friendly - it’s family-focused. It’s easy to setup and use, the App is super user-friendly, and we have the best Support Team on hand to help you with any trouble you may encounter. We’re here for you!

 The Pet Modules are lightweight, sturdy and waterproof. They’re rechargeable via USB (the charger is included in each kit), and can be securely attached to any collar using the included strap attachment mechanism
.
 So how come Findster Home does not depend on the cellular infrastructure (and why does this matter)? The answer is our exclusive MAZE communication technology. It allows the Pet Module and the Basestation to communicate wirelessly in a range of up to 6 miles (~10 km) without requiring a cellular connection to send the GPS coordinates.
The data is then sent to the cloud via your home Wi-Fi, and you can access it anywhere with your phone's own 4G connection.
Therefore, Findster is free from mobile network carriers. No carrier = No contract = No monthly fees!

 
Because Findster Home allows the detailed monitoring of your pets’ activity, we looked into how we could build on this, in order to let you take advantage of these health monitoring capabilities with ease and convenience.
Introducing Findster Care! It combines intensive data collection and analysis by AI with the irreplaceable expertise of human Vets, to provide you the best way of taking care of your pet.
With Findster Care, you’ll have access to:

A real Vet available 24/7 to answer any pet-related questions you may have, at your convenience;
Meaningful, tailored insights on your pets’ health and behavior, based on the activity recorded by the Pet module;
Early detection of possible health-related issues, through continuous monitoring of your buddies’ evolution over time;

So, the good news is that this optional service is already available within the Findster App.
The GREAT news is that every Findster Home perk includes a 12-month Findster Care subscription, completely free of charge! 


We’ve been working on Findster since 2014. In fact, you may recall the Findster name from our previous campaign for Findster Duo, the first GPS Pet Tracker without monthly fees. That was three years ago - the campaign was successfully funded by 1700 backers from over 50 countries, and we went on to develop, manufacture, and deliver the product. We continually listened to our backers’ feedback and made available updates for both the modules and the App on a regular basis, as a result.
Since then, we’ve launched our own Online Store and joined Amazon in several markets. Findster Duo is currently used by thousands of people in over 80 countries!

So why did we decide to launch Findster Home on Kickstarter?
On our previous campaign, after we delivered everyone’s orders, we closely monitored the constant feedback and suggestions we received. Thanks to the invaluable feedback from the community, we were able to improve Findster Duo considerably - it went from great to almost perfect!
We feel these two products complement each other: while Findster Duo, our existing solution, is ideal for outdoor adventures, Findster Home, as the name implies, lets you keep track of your buddies while they’re home or on walks around your neighborhood. So what better way to launch it than replicating the process?

</ul><h2>Environmental commitments</h2><h3>Long-lasting design</h3><p>Babies will continue to be born, hence there may be a continuing demand for baby clothes, and possibly of the same bamboo bodysuit design in different color and style assortments seasonally. Bamboo fabric is soft and cuddly but inherently a strong and long lasting material, hence we expect our baby garments to meet and/or surpass the acceptable life cycle of the garment (government standard is at least up to 50 washes). With proper care, our Bamboo garment will look as good as new and can be worn by a new baby sibling or passed forward to another baby.</p><h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3><p>Bamboo fabric is eco-friendly and one of the most sustainable fabric one can have. It is in fact organic and bio-degradable. Bamboo garments are worn for a long time and typically not thrown out, instead may even be donated, hence maybe in use for many years.</p><h3>Sustainable materials</h3><p>Bamboo is said to be one of the most sustainable resources in the world. Bamboo grows abundantly in tropical countries and needs very little water to grow. Bamboo is incredibly easy to grow and matures very quickly, hence can easily be made available for many end uses. The production of bamboo fiber can be made in methods that are not harmful to the environment.</p><h3>Environmentally friendly factories</h3><p>Our factories are accredit by third party independent inspection companies to meet the requirements of top European and USA retailers. The factory we used are specializing on children's wear production and meets all the regulatory CPSC children's safety standards.</p><p> </p><h1>PLEASE FOLLOW, SHARE, AND HELP US GROW</h1><p>You can help us grow and get the word out when you follow our campaign, and when you share our campaign with others directly from Indiegogo by clicking the social media icons below the funding progress bar towards the top of the campaign page.

Easy on you, easy on baby.Thank you to all of our supporters who have helped us all along the way!Like a busy bee, we're at it again! We've made some improvements to our original award-winning, patent-pending baby bodysuit design for overall improved quality, appearance, and performance. Plus, we introduce some new arrivals to our product line.Improvements we made to our original design:
Changed the fabric to a softer, more flexible cotton/spandex blend
Added a soft elastic sewn inside the binding of the leg seam
Modified the stitch along the back seam to allow more flexibility
Modified the logo placement to allow for custom printed graphics on the outfit
Improved the edge stitching of the closure to make it softer
New product arrivals for fall 2021 / spring 2022:
Bamboo baby bodysuit with long sleeves
Bamboo rompers in both long sleeves and short sleeves
Winter-weight romper in quilted cotton
Eco-friendly baby feeding accessories
New gift-box sets
New color/pattern options
In addition to the improvements to our original design, with this campaign, we're launching a new line of bodysuits and rompers made of luxuriously-super-soft bamboo viscose fabric that is durable, safer, and more comfortable on gentle baby skin. Plus, we've created a new winter-weight romper in quilted-cotton fabric. Plus + plus... we added some eco-friendly baby feeding accessories.IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR ORIGINAL DESIGNThe original fabric was 100% cotton. We upgraded to a 95% Cotton / 5% Spandex blend for improved comfort, and stretch-ability of the fabric.Elastic sewn inside the binding of the leg seamThe original leg seams only had a regular binding. The new design has a clear and soft elastic sewn inside the binding, which makes the leg opening more flexible with a better, snug fit. Bartack stitching on the hook-and-loop (Velcro®) closure & branded tag
We added bartack stitching to the edges of the Velcro® closure to prevent the hooks of the hook-and-loop closure (Velcro®**) from scratching the baby’s skin.
The original brand logo was a vinyl heat-transfer print on the back of the garment. We had moved that to the front panel of the garment in the second version. The improvement we will make here is a sewn-on brand label made of soft woven fabric with a printed logo, sewn into the side seam. This will allow for larger custom printing options on front panel (See example below).
 *** Custom art prints (by World Art by Jason Juranek) ***We replaced the logo at the waistline with a sewn in logo. The chest panel can now be used for Custom Prints and Designs. This particular print graphic is licensed artwork from our dear friend, Jason Juranek, at World Art by Jason Juranek, in our Mom & Baby - Marine Life Collection. Flexible stitching along the back seamThe seam on the back panel was originally constructed with top-stitched seam and was not very flexible or stretchy. The new design will utilize a Flatlock cover stitch along the back seam to allow the seam threads to stretch with the fabric.INNOVATIVE, AWARD WINNING DESIGNOur innovative design is an improvement on the ""Onesie*"", which has been around for many years. Our design has been nominated, and received multiple awards from several baby product organizations and groups, including JPMA, Baby Maternity Magazine, and Creative Child Magazine.
Front waist opening for convenient access to the diaper
Whisper quiet hook and loop fastener
Moisture resistant inside lining

EZ-On BaBeez™ is compliant with US government safety requirements (CPSC).

The Inventor, Creator, and CEO of EZ-On BaBeez™...“Necessity is the Mother of Invention.” My name is Julieta Recometa, the founder and inventor of the EZ-On BaBeez™. I am a wife, mother of 3, and a doting grandmother of 5 grandchildren. My professional career of 35 years included extensive travel and working experience with domestic and overseas manufacturers as trade partners for USA retail companies. Specialties: Apparel private label brand design development with QA, sourcing, production, and technical design expertise in sweater knits, cut and sew knits, fashion accessories, intimate apparel, woven tops and bottoms apparel for women's, men's, children, and home textiles.“Having recently retired, I began to enjoy time with family and 5 beautiful grandchildren. While I loved looking after the grandchildren, changing their diapers was my least favorite. As I’m sure it is for most new moms, dads, babysitters, and daycare personnel.""The snap closures were always located at the crotch area, making it a struggle to open and close. Unbuttoning the onesie at the bottom, while carefully removing the diaper was always messy and cumbersome. Due to this, the baby would inevitably start to cry.""If that was a problem for me, I thought it had to be a problem for all new moms, dads, and other grandparents. That was the 'AHA!' moment! There had to be a better way. I decided to put my work experience to good use!” – Julieta RecometaGiving BackEZ-On BaBeez™ commits to giving back, or paying it forward, to donate 10% of our profits to a Children's Charities, other charitable organizations or hospitals.Recipients of donations from EZ-On BaBeez™

Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designBabies will continue to be born, hence there may be a continuing demand for baby clothes, and possibly of the same bamboo bodysuit design in different color and style assortments seasonally. Bamboo fabric is soft and cuddly but inherently a strong and long lasting material, hence we expect our baby garments to meet and/or surpass the acceptable life cycle of the garment (government standard is at least up to 50 washes). With proper care, our Bamboo garment will look as good as new and can be worn by a new baby sibling or passed forward to another baby.Reusability and recyclabilityBamboo fabric is eco-friendly and one of the most sustainable fabric one can have. It is in fact organic and bio-degradable. Bamboo garments are worn for a long time and typically not thrown out, instead may even be donated, hence maybe in use for many years.Sustainable materialsBamboo is said to be one of the most sustainable resources in the world. Bamboo grows abundantly in tropical countries and needs very little water to grow. Bamboo is incredibly easy to grow and matures very quickly, hence can easily be made available for many end uses. The production of bamboo fiber can be made in methods that are not harmful to the environment.Environmentally friendly factoriesOur factories are accredit by third party independent inspection companies to meet the requirements of top European and USA retailers. The factory we used are specializing on children's wear production and meets all the regulatory CPSC children's safety standards. PLEASE FOLLOW, SHARE, AND HELP US GROWYou can help us grow and get the word out when you follow our campaign, and when you share our campaign with others directly from Indiegogo by clicking the social media icons below the funding progress bar towards the top of the campaign page.

<h3><strong>What is the 1-Z and why does the world need it?</strong></h3>
<div>Well, as two Hollywood Costumers with over 30-years of experience (combined), <strong>we</strong> know a lot about wearing coveralls. We've practically lived in them. Yup, that's how we know that most onesies make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to pee. How can that be, <strong>we</strong> all gotta pee?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, that's not all <strong>we</strong> know. Fitting people in all shapes and sizes for costumes means we know A LOT about the world's beautiful array of body types, <u>and</u> how to flatter those figures that traditional workwear designs seem to, well, ignore. </div>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE 1-Z™ with ZIPPERS FOR DAYS!

The world’s only functional onesie with
Patent-pending WhizTech™ easy-zip technology, revolutionizing workwear for when you have to go. 
 




What is the 1-Z and why does the world need it?
Well, as two Hollywood Costumers with over 30-years of experience (combined), we know a lot about wearing coveralls. We've practically lived in them. Yup, that's how we know that most onesies make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to pee. How can that be, we all gotta pee?
 
But, that's not all we know. Fitting people in all shapes and sizes for costumes means we know A LOT about the world's beautiful array of body types, and how to flatter those figures that traditional workwear designs seem to, well, ignore. 
 

Being a worker bee shouldn’t mean holding your pee, or exposing your nee-nee’s, while you sit with your pants below your knees. Being a film crew member, craftsperson, builder, equestrian, artist, planter, maker, shaker, or good old jumpsuit-enthusiast shouldn't mean feeling frumpy, or looking like you came out of a prison movie. 
TADAAAAA!!!
The 1Z is here to make your days doing all the things that much better and brighter.

With the 1-Z... onesie woes are a thing of the past.
 
 


 
 

The Future Has Arrived

And... you've seen all the future movies, what's everyone wearing?
Jeans and t-shirts?
No...they don't have time for that, they're in the future. Who has time to think about clothes that match in the future? 
After over a decade of wearing an assortment of onesies, jumpsuits, rompers, flight suits, mechanic suits, and other random gems found at surplus stores, we reached a pinnacle and decided it was time to develop our own!
We created the 1-Z™ coverall with patent-pending WhizTech™ zipper technology that is not only functional, we think it’s pretty snazzy too.

Our designs combine form and utility for a onesie that works with you, not against you. 

Did we mention POCKETS?
Why do you want one?  Because you'll look GREAT and feel great in our design...and oh yeah...POCKETS!  All the pockets (hands clapping)!

Designed for living large or small! The 1Z is EZ PZ! We gotchu COVERED...now you can think about ALL the incredible things that you can do with your free time. It's effortlessly cool. Free up your mind. Unzip from behind...well technically the side, buuut you get what we're sayin.

Waistline

It's WIZZARDLY, you can take a WIZ in a WHIZZ...WAHOO!

<p>The feather-light waterproof shell keeps you dry and protected — whether you’re under the streetlights or above the tree line.

</div></div>","You know how it goes: you have a closet full of jackets for every occasion. Windbreakers, rain shells, big down parkas for the worst of winter. But whichever one you roll with just doesn’t cut it once you’re out the door. What if one jacket was all you needed to stay warm and perfectly dry in all conditions? Using technology originally developed for NASA spacecraft to deliver advanced warmth in a performance silhouette, OROS brings you the Gemini - ultra thin, crazy warm, this is the science of versatility.




The Gemini Jacket replaces a closet full of gear — freeing up physical and mental space to pursue what’s important — your next adventure. The modular Gemini system consists of a protective shell and insulating vest. You can wear the shell and vest separately or combined for ultimate warmth and weather protection.


The feather-light waterproof shell keeps you dry and protected — whether you’re under the streetlights or above the tree line. Technical and versatile, the Gemini shell can be worn alone in warmer months, or combined with the vest to become the ultimate winter jacket — minus the excessive layers and restricted movement.

The performance vest is lined with our advanced SOLARCORE® insulation, guaranteed to keep you warm in the most punishing depths of winter. The vest is the insulation engine that powers the entire 3-in-1 system. Utilizing OROS’ advanced technology, the vest can be worn on its own to deliver targeted insulation for high output activities like cycling and trail running.


OROS transformed Aerogel, NASA’s most advanced insulation, into SOLARCORE® - the most efficient performance insulation ever created. 

Our proprietary SOLARCORE® insulation outperforms over 200 leading insulations in thermal conductivity test ASTM C518. 

We developed SOLARCORE® to eliminate the need for excessive layering. The Gemini Jacket replaces a closet full of gear — freeing up physical and mental space to pursue what’s important — your next adventure. 

 

1. Shell for protection without the insulation
If the weather takes a turn for the worse, the Gemini waterproof shell will provide superior protection from the elements — blocking wind, keeping  you dry, and most importantly, keeping you moving. 
2. Vest for warmth in motion3. Layered for changing conditions
When the weather keeps tossing curveballs your way, The Gemini gives you the ability to quickly adapt to your surroundings, no matter what the world throws at you! Layer up or down to optimize your warmth-to-protection ratio.4. Fully integrated for ultimate protectionWhen the mercury drops, flip the vest inside-out to secure the vest and shell, using the conveniently color coded snaps, to create a hybrid system perfect for moving through the coldest climates. 
City and mountains — snow days and summer showers. By designing against two extremes, OROS crafted the Gemini to handle everything in between. The Gemini modular system will take you wherever you need to go. Together or individually, it's the perfect system for:
• Running • Hiking • Cycling • Trail Running •Skiing
• Snowshoe • Travel • Rain Jacket • Dog Walking • Exploring

An Exclusive Design Only Available On Indiegogo
 
Space tech is in our DNA, and this limited-edition jacket is where new beyonds begin. 

We’re excited to offer this space design exclusively to our Kickstarter backers. This jacket features an exclusive colorway and detailing of the NASA Gemini mission.



In addition to the Indiegogo exclusive space jacket, we are offering the Gemini Jacket in 3 men's and two women's colorways so you can choose the Gemini that reflects your personal style.",37.0,4,"3 Campaigns

More importantly, they are designed to last.With your help, we can turn the tide on our damaging consumer culture, one swimsuit at a time. Pre-order your ELLE NAGE swimwear today and together we can ensure a more promising future.   The earth’s oceans are the unhappy home to around 165 million tons of plastic waste.Our throwaway culture has been fuelled by fast-fashion ~ customer demand for new clothes, next-day delivered ~ which results in incredible rates of over-production and textile waste. Much of which ends up in landfill sites and then in oceans.  At ELLE NAGE, we want to show that there is another way to do things: BUY LESS, LOVE MORE.     On a mission to change how swimwear can be made, bought and worn, we started to question ~ how can we re-condition ourselves to revert to quality over quantity, and manufacture our products without damaging the environment?      With your help, we want to create stylish swimwear using ECONYL, a high-performance yarn created from industrial and ocean plastic waste, such as discarded fishing nets. ECONYL regenerated nylon has the same quality and performance as brand new nylon and can be recycled infinite times, forming a closed loop. As well as being a solution for waste, ECONYL reduces the global warming impact of nylon by 90%, compared with the manufacturing of virgin nylon from oil.   Vibrant colours and bold prints are fundamental to the ELLE NAGE aesthetic. We want our pieces to brighten the day of the women wearing them. Because, let’s face it, after the past year, everyone deserves to feel uplifted.   It is crucial that our pieces not only look amazing but feel amazing too. We have spent months and months working on the perfect fit; from double lining to contouring, every element has been carefully considered.    R E V I V R E – to live againAllow yourself to be reborn: reborn after a year of hibernation and reborn with a fresh perspective of what is important ~ now more than ever. You will come alive again in our pieces that are, themselves, reborn from waste and given new life.   Andie is sporty and boyish with a feminine twist. With many tricks up her sleeve, she can be whatever you want her to be; an animal print, a timeless spot, tied in a knot for boyish charm, or a bow for a prettier look. She is a good choice for all bust sizes, as her crop top shape and double-lined fabric provide good support for bigger busts. Her solid cream reversible interior offers a cleaner, more minimal aesthetic.   Quietly confident, Ayla is the dependable friend you’ll want to keep by your side; she’s consistently cool, calm and collected. With 2-ways-to-wear, she will get you through any situation. Her triangle shape is a good choice for both small and big busts as the gathered fit provides room for give. Her gingham is a reliable, timeless choice and embodies the essence of summer, while her reversible mango interior looks great against both tanned and paler skin.   Always the loudest in the room, Ada is a classic piece with an unexpected twist. Her happy concoction of colour exudes vibrance and passion, and her asymmetry is unpredictable. Her double-lined fabric will support you in all the right areas, and her contoured shape will celebrate your curves. Her reversible interior is the opposite colourway, offering a prettier look with the majority in pink. Conformist from the front, yet flirtatious from the back, Ada plays with your senses and is not afraid to stand out from the crowd.   One classy lady, Amelie oozes understated chic and timelessness. Her classic 90’s square neck and bold monochrome print is fit for any occasion, whether at the beach, the pool, or paired with shorts for roaming the city streets. Her adjustable straps are a great choice for longer body shapes, and her double-lined fabric and contoured fit will support you in all the right places. Her reversible interior is the opposite colourway, offering a fresh summery look.     At ELLE NAGE we make your swimwear to last, meaning you can show off your swimwear year, after year, (after year).  However, we recognise that the wear and tear of wearing something you love so much can take its toll. So your swimwear comes with a free ‘Repair Kit’ made from the authentic off-cuts of the fabric, so that if your swimwear ever gets damaged, you can use your patch to repair it yourself. Now your swimwear that is designed to last, lasts even longer.   One of our brand priorities is to come up with a plan for end-of-life, so that when the time comes, you will be able to send your swimwear back to us to be reborn again, in return for a discount off your next order.  Sustainability is about preserving the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.From start to finish and back again, the full cycle of our products must cause as little harm as possible. We are always looking to learn and improve our practice as we strive towards being as sustainable as possible.     Part of working towards sustainability is partnering with our wonderful supplier in Bali. They employ people from local communities, embrace sustainable practices and donate $0.10 USD per piece to a range of charities. These include The ZeroWaste Centre, that helps to clean up the world’s oceans, and Bali Wise, which empowers marginalised Indonesian women through access to education. They have also donated to SOS Indonesia to help feed those in need due to COVID-19.    Our Market Research survey showed that 74% of women struggled to find swimwear that ticked all the right boxes. That’s where we come in. We provide women with the ease of style, sustainability, quality, fit and unparalleled attention to detail…all in one place. With us, you can say goodbye to pre-holiday panic-buying. ELLE NAGE is your reliable friend that is here to stay.Shopping ethically is hard, so we made it easy. We are here to bridge the gap between the over-priced brands and the fast fashion market, rendering sustainability more attainable and affordable.By choosing ELLE NAGE you are giving plastic waste a purpose and contributing to positive change.What’s not to love?  The name ELLE NAGE (meaning she swims in French) is indicative of the over-riding inspiration for the brand: our women. We celebrate all female bodies, and aim to represent relatable reality through raw, stripped-back beauty.We believe that every woman should feel amazing in swimwear.

Millions of us took to streets to safeguard Hong Kong’s autonomy and protest against abuse of police powers. Many have been arrested and tortured; a lot suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and physical injuries.Despite an uphill battle, we will not stop pursuing justice. Designed by DDDDDHK and produced by Project R, this creative campaign is a way to express our causes in daily life.  We hope to bring these products to the international community as a token for our culture diplomacy. 抗爭與日常Live Our Fight抗爭來到今天，有些地方已不能明顯表達心跡，但民主思想及意志並不會隨著噤聲改變。JTHK系列以隱喻設計為主調，無論你在香港或者外地，都可以安全及隨心所慾地將其「穿入生活」，表達你的堅持。這不單是一件衣服，更是香港人之間的共鳴。當你見到其他人穿起同一件衫，縱陌路卻有份同路感，你、我、他、她不再孤單。你的日常參與，便是同行的支持與見證。In this very challenging time, our voice may not be heard, but we refuse to give up. Through this series of designer products, we seek to reignite the hope and solidarity of Hongkongers. We are telling the world our fight must go on till the dawn.  This series comprises three beautiful designs on high quality hoodies and T-shirts. Each design carries a metaphor for a memory or spirit of the Hong Kong movement. The metaphoric design concept conveys our messages in a subtle way, making anyone (in or outside Hong Kong) feel safe and comfortable to wear them in daily life. So please “put on” our story and connect them to all walks of life. JTHKJTHK，代表 JAPAN、TAIWAN、HONG KONG 三地緊密合作。產品皆由日本設計、台灣製造、香港統籌策劃而成，經過不斷磨合，互相補位，成就了這個結合三地黃圈的突破性項目。Designed in Japan, made in Taiwan and executed in Hong Kong (hence aka “JTHK”), this project is an unprecedented collaboration of Hongkongers all over the world. Together, this group of talented, young and energetic Hongkongers have delivered great work to make this project possible. 全球流行World Trending過去一年多，香港人留下不少民主足印， 一直在國際社會得到普遍認同。我們希望透過此項目把香港人的不屈精神轉化成文化輸出，引起各界持續關注，讓香港的故事繼續流行全球，當中少不了穿上JTHK的你，化身為人肉文宣，一齊傳播信念！Hongkongers are fighting on the free world’s forefront against tyrannous powers. We hope the free world stands by us in pursuit of universal values (justice, freedom and democracy). By putting on these hoodies and T-shirts, you will help us tell our stories to the world. Please let our voice enlighten freedom fighters in every corner of the globe that they are not alone, and we share their struggles. 港日相連Japan x Hong Kong三款設計揉合港日兩地語言及文化，把日本元素加進香港事件中，用日本語言說出香港一年多來的傷痕和一直堅守的精神。在港日兩地語言文化互融下，帶出連成一線的共同感。All the three designs incorporated languages and cultures of Japan and Hong Kong. By including Japanese elements into the stories, the designs carry interconnections of the two and speak stories of the pain and persistence of Hongkongers in the past year. 八組能引起香港人共鳴的日本片仮名音節，即使不能發出聲響，心中吶喊依然。喻意如水抗爭，有形若無形。在時代的洪流中，仍可於日常生活上讓掙扎長存藏於若隱若現間。The pronunciation of this set of eight Japanese katakana can resonate collective voices among Hong Kong protestors (chat with a Hongkonger to find out.) Named after our shared motto, “BE WATER” is a metaphor which means adapting to changing circumstances just like water. This design echoes how Hongkongers keep transforming and find ways to voice out even under oppression.延伸閱讀 (Read more):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana 靈感來自港日標誌性山峰，獅子山背靠富士山令兩地的心意和精神連成一線。In SOUL, the paired Mt. Fuji and the Lion Rock reflect the connection between Japan and Hong Kong, despite thousands of miles apart. 如題「明就明」，便不作解釋了。*我們會在你支持這版本後告訴你箇中意思。ROUTE contains subtexts that only HongKongers and those who follow the protests would understand. Some knowledge of Japanese is useful too. This edition is a great way to start conversations with other people in the community.*We will send you the meaning of the design once you contribute to this perk. HOODIES 背後Behind the HoodHoodies背後其實喑隱藏玄機，戴上帽的一刻會揭露一條繡有「HONGKONGER」的直幡，形態顯然勾起同路人的集體回憶，彰顯我們的心聲及自我認同。設計如港人般靈活變通，隨心戴上，隨機脫下。帽形亦比市面 HOODIES 稍大，能全面包裹頭部。Another great feature of the hoodies is the hidden stripe with embroidery of the text “HONGKONGER” under the hood. The design concept is from the multi-storey tall vertical banner Hongkongers often display on our mother mountain, Lion Rock, as a form of protest. The action represents the Hongkongers’ aspirations and sense of identity. The stripe can be seen when the hood is lifted and hidden when the latter off. The way it is designed is also an embodiment of our Be Water spirit.  The hood is slightly bigger than standard hoods, creating a full coverage of the wearer’s head. 產品詳情Product Details 日本設計．台灣製造．香港營運Designed in Japan. Produced in Taiwan. Operated in Hong Kong產品全由日本團隊DDDDDHK設計，團隊為在日港人發起，身體力行以設計及拍攝和後製表達對香港支持。JTHK 一切用料及剪裁均跟市面速成製品不同，布料、網版、縫紉等全由台灣生產及人手印製，顏料亦採用高韌度的日本製品。整個產品策劃經多方考量及與廠商協調下訂造，絕對不是罐頭貨。此外，銷售、協商、客服、宣傳、運輸、溝通等主要由香港 PROJECT R 年輕人團隊合作而成，當中佔多數是剛畢業或在學青年。These products are designed by DDDDDHK, an initiative started by Japan-based Hongkongers. DDDDDHK strives to show their support to the movement in Hong Kong through their creatives. The materials and cutting of the JTHK series are different from those of the fast-moving fashion market. They are manufactured with high quality cotton fabrics and meticulously printed in Taiwan. The raw materials, including fabrics, printing screens and sewing materials, are sourced in Taiwan and the high-tough pigments for printing from Japan. The entire production plan was done with close collaboration of various parties. The execution, ranging from factory and material selection, sales, customer services, marketing to logistics, are accomplished by a group of young and diligent team of Project R who are mostly students and fresh-graduates. 全球黃圈．文宣全球Global Yellow Economic Circle.

Outside that regime, Hongkongers and anyone in the globe are able to produce beautiful products with sustainability and high quality.  千鳥花基金Recovery Fund你的懲罰，不止換來一件貨品，亦能協助有需要的人重獲新生，繼續找尋自由生活。我們會將部分收益撥捐千鳥花基金，基金主要支援全球有需要香港人，讓他們有機會得到心理治療，盡快從 PTSD 及其他情緒困擾中走出陰霾。This project is simple but meaningful.

The campaign was even listed on Indiegogo as a “Fashion-forward Finds Highlights” and “Trending Campaign.” Unfortunately, due to the change in political circumstances, the campaign did not proceed to the production stage.縱然面對重重困難，念念不忘，必有迴響，DDDDDHK 夥拍 PROJECT R 重新推出，為的是更完備的架構，成就更完美的產品，祈望大家能一起與我們克服困難。Despite difficulties, Project R reached out for partnership with DDDDDHK and relaunched the campaign with a better campaign structure and product quality.是次合作在用料上均使用台灣及日本製原料，加上由台灣師傅逐件細心印刷，與普通量產型產品不同，每件貨品均通過在台年輕人悉心挑選及溝通而成，加上海外運輸方面也積極使用海外公司，因此成本價頗高。In this collaboration, all the products were printed by hand individually with high-quality raw materials from Taiwan and Japan. Unlike other mass-produced apparel, the entire production process of JTHK products was carefully planned by an energetic group of Hongkongers all over the world including Taiwan. To refuse influence from the authoritarian regime, we use foreign shippers and couriers to handle our orders.  This new operation model may have increased our costs and pushed up the product prices. That said, we are free from the undue influence of suppliers controlled by the authoritarian regime.  因應 COVID-19 持續肆虐全球，在可見將來運輸上也受到一定延誤，甚至面臨高成本運輸。但我們會盡力把貨品送到客人手上，請大家耐心等候。Due to the COVID-19 situation, overseas shipments might possibly experience significant delay and bear a higher delivery fee. But we will try our best to make it to your door. 展望ForecastJTHK 並非單靠我們，亦需要有你這位同路人的支持，才能達成以上目標。我們希望透過與不同團體合作、透過銷售，找出更多志同道合的同路人，讓一切在買賣中成熟，推出更多產品，擴大黃色經濟圈實力。同時，提升香港年輕人競爭力，協助外國戰線，並支援更多需要情緒支援的香港人。讓我們共同努力，以不同方式繼續支持香港。We can never achieve our goal without your support. As our brand evolves, we hope to network with like minds and collaborate with other groups and individuals. We look forward to creating more products to enlarge our economic ecosystem and raise the market competitiveness of Hongkongers. We will also provide more help to Hongkongers who suffer from mental health issues. 香港人は諦めない！2019年、多くの香港人は正義、自由と民主のために、警察の暴力に抵抗し、全てをかけて戦いました。逮捕して虐待され、怪我をしたりPTSDを発症したりした人が多数います。苦しい戦いが続きますが、香港人は正義を求めることを諦めません。DDDDDHKがデザインし、Project Rが生産したTシャツとパーカーを通して、香港人が自由を求める声を届けたいと考えています。 戦いと日常今は自由に意見を口にすることができない時代ですが、私たちは諦めません。Tシャツを通じて、香港人の結束と希望を取り戻したいのです。私たちのメッセージはデザインに隠されています。だから、どこでも安心して着ることができます。着ることで香港人を応援してください。 JTHKJTHKは日本（Japan）、台湾（Taiwan）と香港（Hong Kong）の絆を意味します。全ての製品は日本でデザイン、台湾で生産され、プロジェクトを実行するのが香港です。全世界の香港人が協力するという前例のないプロジェクトなのです。若くてエネルギッシュで、才能のある香港人たちによって初めて可能になりました。 全球流行World Trendingこの一年、香港人は自由世界の最前線で暴政と戦い、民主のために少なくないことを成し遂げました。私たちは正義、自由、民主を求める香港人の不屈の精神を、文化として世界へ届けたい。JTHKを着て、私たちの声を他の人々に伝え、香港人を応援してください。 Japan x Hong Kong3つのデザインには、日本と香港の言葉と文化が融合しています。日本の文字で香港の苦しみと精神的な粘り強さを表し、香港と日本の一体感を出しました。 BE WATERこのカタカナの塊りは香港デモ者たちの心に響き、彼らに共鳴をもたらす言葉である。「BE WATER」とは、水のように環境に応じて自由自在に形を変えることを意味する。このデザインは正に香港人の「水になれ」精神に沿って、様々な制限や抑圧の下に己の声を上げようとするものである。 SOUL富士山と香港のシンボルである獅子山のデザインは、日本と香港の心を重ねることを表現しています。  ROUTE文字通り、わかる人にはわかるということです。＊ご注文したお客様に限り、そのデザインに隠されたメッセージを説明します。 パーカーついてHoodies背後其實喑隱藏玄機，戴上帽的一刻會揭露一條繡有「HONGKONGER」的直幡，形態顯然勾起同路人的集體回憶，彰顯我們的心聲及自我認同。設計如港人般靈活變通，隨心戴上，隨機脫下。帽形亦比市面 HOODIES 稍大，能全面包裹頭部。パーカーのフードを被る時、「HONGKONGER」という文字が見えます。後ろの「HONGKONGER」を隠すか見せるかは自由自在で、「水になれ」というモットーの活用の一つとなります。 製品情報 
日本設計、台湾生産、香港運営
在日香港人団体DDDDDHKがデザインします。JTHKの素材はファストファッション用と違って、全部台湾で生産します。顔料は日本の顔料を使用します。営業、生産、カスタマーサービス、宣伝、物流などはほとんどを新卒や学生のPROJOECT Rが担当します。 黄色経済圏を作り、世界中に声を届けよう香港人は抗議活動のほか、色々な形で戦っています。「黄色経済圏」はその一つです。黄色経済圏とは「デモ支持」を表明しているサービスを利用しようというキャンペーン。今回の生産を通じて、国際的な規模にまで拡大するのです。私たちの目標は、このキャンペーンによって、独裁国家を経由しない供給チェーンを作ることができるのを世界中に見せることです。独裁国家を経由しなくても、品質が良いものを楽しむことができるということです。 千鳥花基金Recovery Fund商品を購入することで、支払ったお金の一部は千鳥草基金に寄付されます。千鳥草基金は、デモによってメンタルヘルスの不調の病気を患った人への支援を行います。   海外で戦う若者を応援せよ抗議活動により、経済的に苦しくなったり、住所を失ったり、自立しなければならなくなった若者が多くいます。PROJECT Rは彼らを雇用する形で、自立できるように支援します。香港人の思いが世界中に届き、「黄色経済圏」ができるように、ご協力をお願いします。興味・関心がある方は、ご遠慮なく相談してください。Project R email：cs@renaissancehk.comDDDDDHK email：hello@dddddhk.com PROJECT RのR はルネサンス（RENAISSANCE）というフランス語で、「再生」「復活」を意味します。PROJECT Rは世界中に進出し、香港人の経済圏を作ることを目指しています。香港人のブランドを作り、香港人を雇用することにより、彼らが自立できるように支援します。2019年以降、香港人は世界中に民主と自由を守る決意を示しました。DDDDDHKは日本における香港人組織として、香港人のデザイン、商品などを輸出し、香港人の最も重要な価値観を表します。また、デモを支持する企業にデザインや、ブランド作りのサービスを提供しています。Since 2019, HongKongers have demonstrated their determination on defending democracy and freedom internationally.

The reason why the gentlemen did this was that one day whilst he was driving back home and waiting in the heavy traffic, he saw a homeless person eating his own (or someone/something else's) excretion due to extreme poverty. After seeing this horrific image the gentleman was not able to sleep or live with himself especially working in an industry where a huge amount of food is wasted.</p><p>Kevin's family is originally from South India and therefore resonated with this story as he too has seen many homeless people in India begging for food during his travels and wanted to do something to change this.

Our mission is to provide 1M meals by 2025 and provide feeding options to our customers in over 100 countries (we currently offer 5 countries). Example of a product page on the ETAN website which asks the customer who they want to feed for every item they purchaseWe have 3 core pillars to our brand:Ethical - We ensure to only work with ethical factories meaning that workers are paid and treated fairly and work in a safe environment with regular breaks.Sustainability - We are committed to being sustainable as possible from the fabrics we use (check out our Sustainwear range which is growing very quickly) to distributing orders to customers where we have removed all unnecessary plastic packaging and now using sugar cane mailer bags. We also promote and educate our customers on our social channels about recycling and up-cycling and we are constantly looking for ways to be more sustainable.Charity - We donate money from every order to various charities to help us achieve our goal of feeding those in need. Our aim is to eventually open up our own ETAN Soup Kitchens around the world.ETAN Women's Ribbed Seamless SetWhat do customers think about ETAN?Examples of customer reviews. More can be found hereHow was ETAN created?The founder, Kevin Patrick came across an article of a gentleman in India who gave up his well-paid job working in a 5* hotel as a catering manager to feed and look after the homeless people of his home town with his own money. The reason why the gentlemen did this was that one day whilst he was driving back home and waiting in the heavy traffic, he saw a homeless person eating his own (or someone/something else's) excretion due to extreme poverty. After seeing this horrific image the gentleman was not able to sleep or live with himself especially working in an industry where a huge amount of food is wasted.Kevin's family is originally from South India and therefore resonated with this story as he too has seen many homeless people in India begging for food during his travels and wanted to do something to change this. This saddening but uplifting story gave Kevin the inspiration and drive to create ETAN Apparel.How do you feed people in need?For every item sold we donate money directly to 3 charities (depending on who is being fed):Brixton Soup Kitchen - 8 people in need in London with a hot meal eachAkshay Patra Foundation - 1 person in India for a whole monthPenny Appeal - 5 people in need with a hot meal each either in Yemen, Nigeria or EthiopiaPS. Even if you don't back us, please donate to one of these amazing charitiesETAN Organic Hoodie (Vegan certified and made from organic cotton and recycled polyester)Why do you need the funding?We need your help to grow and to feed more people in need in a fashionable way. We look forward to rewarding our backers with our limited edition Signature T-shirts & Hoodies and welcoming them to the ETAN family (which will feed people in need too)! With the funds we not only want to increase our brand awareness campaigns and educate the market on the hunger crisis but we would also like to launch more ethically manufactured, sustainable fashionable products such as: Examples of  Vegan approved (by Peta) and ethically manufactured activewear products that we would love to launch to give our customers more choice and as a result feeding more people in need around the worldWhat are the items being offered as rewards?We are super excited to be able to offer our backers with a brand new product that will be even more special as every item will have a number on the piece of clothing making it a Limited Edition item and the number will refer too which backer they are i.e. if they are the first, their piece of clothing will have a 1 on it (small and discreet) but it will truly be one off a kind! The Signature Collection is going to be our best selling range as it brings beautiful quality with ethical manufacturing and sustainable fabrics finished with new additions such as:- ETAN Neckline- ETAN side tab- ETAN embroidered patch will be added to the clothing which will say - This item fed people in need #FeedwithFashionWe hope these additions will create a very premium looking product that we hope to roll out to our entire range as we keep growing.The T-shirts will be made from Organic Cotton & Elastane with ETAN printed in the centre chest and the Hoodies will be made from Organic Cotton with ETAN embroidered in the centre chest.

I personally design all products and communicate with the factories daily. My former job was in Senior Management for Universal Group overseeing the 600 worker sample room for COACH handbags. My handbag manufacturing experience allows me to control the whole quality assurance for the grappaSac bag.</p><p>Our team of artisans and factories are my ex-colleagues who have been working together for 20+ years for global fashion brands. We create high-quality, low-impact, long-lasting products. We carefully work together to reduce waste, chemicals, and plastics that endanger our planet’s ecosystems. Our timeless basics are designed to last—so making the right choice by the planet can be as simple as putting on grappaSac. </p><p>I have completed the course at University of Cambridge, UK - Business and Climate Change: Towards Net Zero Emission.  </p><p>I’ve gained so much from the course. It’s not just about developing my own knowledge on climate change and a low carbon transition, but implementing a way in which I can influence others to bring necessary change to meet our net zero goals. </p><p>No single individual can bring about positive climate change effectively. I have designed my own personal action plan to achieve as much influence as possible. </p><p>I would like to invite you all on the decarbonisation journey to make a change. Together. For our future.

My Dad sent me to learn all about ISO9000 Quality Management Systems and I became the Head of Delegation, Management Representative for the factory.</p><p>Following on from this I moved over to work for an IPO handbag factory, which allowed me to explore the handbag world on a much larger scale. The first client I worked for was Vera Wang (SVVW), then Avon, Tory Burch…and scores of other luxury fashion brands. Finally, my last employed position was overseeing the 600 worker sample room for COACH handbags in a Universal Group handbag factory.</p><p>Emerging from this period of COVID-19, my husband and I have built iFarmaissance brands @ifarmbrands together. Our focus has evolved to environmental, economic and social impacts and a sense of social responsibility now drives most of our decision making.</p><p>These are few photos of me in front of a sewing machine back in 2003 and a photo of me in March this year sourcing deadstock fabrics in Hong Kong.

Environmentally friendly, non-toxic, with no odour, zero water, no synthetic or polluting oils and no ecosystem impact. Made in Italy.Certified Organic Cotton - our dust bag is made from certified organic cotton. It is better for the planet. Instead of toxic pesticides, organic farming uses crop rotation, cover crops and organic fertilizers to create rich life-supporting soil. Pesticides have a bad habit of poisoning groundwater, streams, and rivers, which endangers the people and wildlife that rely on those sources. By replacing dangerous chemicals with natural alternatives and old-school agriculture techniques, farmers are spared dangerous levels of exposure.Recycled Polyester - our lining is recycled polyester from used water bottles.Media CoverageClick to read more...Hi, I am Jennifer Gardner, the founder of iFarmaissance. grappaSac is designed in Perth, Australia and sourced from Hong Kong. I personally design all products and communicate with the factories daily. My former job was in Senior Management for Universal Group overseeing the 600 worker sample room for COACH handbags. My handbag manufacturing experience allows me to control the whole quality assurance for the grappaSac bag.Our team of artisans and factories are my ex-colleagues who have been working together for 20+ years for global fashion brands. We create high-quality, low-impact, long-lasting products. We carefully work together to reduce waste, chemicals, and plastics that endanger our planet’s ecosystems. Our timeless basics are designed to last—so making the right choice by the planet can be as simple as putting on grappaSac. I have completed the course at University of Cambridge, UK - Business and Climate Change: Towards Net Zero Emission.  I’ve gained so much from the course. It’s not just about developing my own knowledge on climate change and a low carbon transition, but implementing a way in which I can influence others to bring necessary change to meet our net zero goals. No single individual can bring about positive climate change effectively. I have designed my own personal action plan to achieve as much influence as possible. I would like to invite you all on the decarbonisation journey to make a change. Together. For our future. Because it’s that future that’s ours to shape and design.My backgroundThrowback over 3 decades.I entered the handbag industry when I was 18, just after finishing my school college, back in 1988.I learned sewing in the 12 worker sample room of my dad’s handbag factory as a starting point, then making bag patterns, sourcing materials, trims and hardware, production, quality control/ assurance, logistics, exporting and attending many, many trade shows all over the world.Over the next 15 years, my dad’s factory developed from 100 workers to 600 workers and we found that we needed to develop professional management skills. My Dad sent me to learn all about ISO9000 Quality Management Systems and I became the Head of Delegation, Management Representative for the factory.Following on from this I moved over to work for an IPO handbag factory, which allowed me to explore the handbag world on a much larger scale. The first client I worked for was Vera Wang (SVVW), then Avon, Tory Burch…and scores of other luxury fashion brands. Finally, my last employed position was overseeing the 600 worker sample room for COACH handbags in a Universal Group handbag factory.Emerging from this period of COVID-19, my husband and I have built iFarmaissance brands @ifarmbrands together. Our focus has evolved to environmental, economic and social impacts and a sense of social responsibility now drives most of our decision making.These are few photos of me in front of a sewing machine back in 2003 and a photo of me in March this year sourcing deadstock fabrics in Hong Kong. This is the journey I have been on since 1988, thank you for joining me and I look forward to sharing many special new moments with you in the future….Brazil is the birth place of our niece, Victoria Campelo, our Brand Ambassador. Join us in our reforestation initiative for her birth place.ONE TREE PLANTED is a non-profit organization focused on global reforestation. As an environmental charity, they're on a mission to make it simple for anyone to help the environment by planting trees!For every grappaSac supported we are committing to give back to the environment, create a healthier climate, protect biodiversity and help reforestation worldwide.And the donation will be in your name as an everlasting show of appreciation for your support.Our niece, Victoria Campelo""Bird Tree"" Logo InspirationThe inspiration for our logo was “biodiversity“ – that a single tree can represent a complex ecosystem of birds, insects and other species. We love too that there is a freedom to the movement of the birds that we all have the choice to learn and explore and contribute as part of nature.“Biodiversity starts in the distant past and it points toward the future” – Frans LantingThe diversity of nature surrounds us and relies upon us to protect it, but in the end we rely on nature for our survival. It is a reminder that together we can make environmental choices that lift our spirits and - are also good for the Planet…Our StoryiFarmaissance is a family story, a generational desire to connect farming and fashion and sustainability. The family has a long history of farming in Albany, West Australia and everyone loves the farm life.Jennifer, the founder, is an award winning product creator of the Knirps X1 case, a German Heritage brand which was granted 4 international product design awards in 2003.Her life has been dedicated to the handbag Industry and she has been recognized by Global Luxury Brands for her contribution. She brought the concept of “Farm to Closet” to her husband Gary, a Chartered Accountant and sustainable business consultant in Australia and Asia.Their shared inspiration begins in the harmony of nature. The farming of traditional products that can be ethically sourced – a balance between responsibly sourced natural fibres and innovative bio-materials to make an environmental impact and change for the future.Together, they created the iFarmaissance brand, a name derived from (I)nnovation related to (Farm)ing and Ren(aissance), a rebirth of the traditions and soul of fashion.The design vision for GrappaSac is a combination of environmental responsibility and aesthetics. You feel good and confident to have it, and you are proud of your contribution to positive climate change.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

They're full of useful and a few unnecessary features.</p><p>I was tired of carrying beautiful yet heavy bags with thin straps that dug into my shoulders as I juggled between work, home, kids, and occasional yoga classes. In other words, my bag needed to have a laptop, iPad, notebook, sunglasses, make-up, wallet, keys, lunch, a water bottle, snacks for kids, and yoga clothes at all times! Furthermore, with my busy schedule, I needed to quickly retrieve the correct items from my bag — all from one big black hole. Sound familiar?</p><p>According to a prominent usability researcher, Anya Meyerowitz, a woman spends close to 162 days searching for things in her bag. If this wasn't enough, what happens when we have to search for our keys in the dark? We use our phone light to get the keys, but then…no charge, right? Phew, now that's another problem that we have. Late nights out, long outdoor work, or a situation where we can't charge our phone. Hmm...so we carry a 'power bank'. But then we forget the power bank as it’s charging on the desk. The list goes on and on and on. And, I was a living testament to that research.</p><p>My company was created out of my desire to create the perfect bag that serves the purpose of being comfortable, stylish, and high on the usability-factor. Being a designer by profession and having spent years in the fashion industry — both in Italy and India — I refused to let fashion run over functionality and finally decided to take the matter in my own hands. This was the genesis of NALPHI, a company where we believe that a woman’s bag should be beautiful AND practical.

NALPHI only uses the highest-grade materials to ensure long-lasting longevity, durability, and quality.Clever in every way, this smart, luxury leather tote is the handbag you’ve always wanted.NALPHI uses patented technology to automatically illuminate the interior of your bag when opened — making it easier to find what you need. The built-in InnerGlow LED light turns on the moment you open your bag and turns off after a few seconds.No need to find a switch or hold up a flashlight, Inner Glow will flood your interior with light exactly when you need it, without hassle or frustration. Never fumble inside your bag again. NALPHI is made from genuine full-grain, natural pigment leather — the same leather used by Europe’s most prestigious luxury houses.This incredible leather is the highest grade possible and boasts exceptional durability, lifespan, and texture. It is what separates the average bag from top-of-the-line luxury products.Top to bottom, NALPHI is made exclusively with this luxury-grade, full-grain leather, giving it unprecedented quality for its price.NALPHI eliminates the markup found in most luxury brands without compromising on materials or design. We do this by cutting out the middleman, selling direct to you, and only offering fair prices. Our leather is premium-sourced and highest quality. Our technology is dialed in. Our design is detailed and styled to exquisite taste.We've done 2 years of extensive User Experience & Usability research before designing. This is why our bag is so different from other bags on the market. We also believe in paying what is right to our employees, and for our materials. This means you get the best quality for the best price in full conscience.NALPHI is equipped with special JustRight utility spaces for everything you need in your bag. From bottles to keys, keep your everyday items organized and quickly accessible no matter what.The non-spill bottle loop keeps your water bottle secured inside your bag and easily accessible.The detachable key loop makes sure your keys are always available within hands reach. The cosmetics pouch neatly stores all your makeup needs —keeping them consolidated and ready to go at a moment’s notice.Scratch-proof pockets protect your phone and sunglasses from your other items in your bag. No more surprise scratches on your screens and lenses!NALPHI is also big enough to easily fit a MacBook Air or iPad Pro. You can even comfortably accommodate in a 13” MacBook Pro!The SecureMe warning system automatically sounds an alarm if any unexpected visitors peek into your bag. Simply switch it on when you want to secure your bag. If anyone opens the bag, NALPHI will detect it and alert you via a chirping alarm. The sound will also help ward away any potential pickpockets.Keep your phone and mobile devices charged with EverPower, NALPHI’s 5,000mAh power bank. A two-way USB-C port allows you to charge EverPower, as well as any USB-C enabled devices, while a USB-C to USB-A adapter port lets you charge earlier-generation devices.To recharge the EverPower power bank, simply plug the USB-C charging cable, with its own LED indicator, into the USB-C port. When the power bank is fully charged, the indicator changes color to let you know that it’s ready.NALPHI features a comfortable design. Wide shoulder straps distribute the pressure on your shoulders, while lightweight materials make sure you don’t have any extra weight from the bag itself.Carry your bag all day long without a problem. NALPHI is designed to give you a seamless, and comfortable experience inside and out.Wear it on your shoulder, or turn it into a beautiful backpack.NALPHI includes ForeverFresh perfume pods that are easily removable and replaceable. The pods hide in a tiny concealed compartment inside the bag, so they stay out of your way. If you ever need to remove them, simply slide them out.Enjoy fresh scents every time you open your bag.NALPHI uses two mechanisms to keep your belongings secure — high-end zippers and magnetic closures.The zippers slide smoothly to open and close your bag, providing full closure with ease. The premium leather tags let you easily pull the zippers while giving a splash of color to the bag.Magnetic closures let you quickly, easily, and securely access your bag without hassle. The magnetic closures connect with both your InnerGlow light and the SecureMe system, activating them upon opening. They also serve as a secondary, no-thought, automatic seal — that way you can access what you need quickly.Protective bottom rivets keep the bottom of your bag safe from dust and wear.Whether you’re a full-time mom, advancing your career, jet-setting to exotic locations, or doing it all at once, your bag should be the last thing you have to worry about.NALPHI SmartBags are designed to be as dedicated and beautiful as you are.In material, design, technology, and process, NALPHI excels across the spectrum. Enjoy premium quality, premium precision, and premium caliber with every corner and feature.Hello, my name is Naina and I am the Founder & Creator of NALPHI, a company with a mission to create high-end luxury bags that balances style, comfort, and usability.As a professional and a mother, I understand the problems that women face when choosing bags that are meant for work, then end up becoming a rucksack. They're full of useful and a few unnecessary features.I was tired of carrying beautiful yet heavy bags with thin straps that dug into my shoulders as I juggled between work, home, kids, and occasional yoga classes. In other words, my bag needed to have a laptop, iPad, notebook, sunglasses, make-up, wallet, keys, lunch, a water bottle, snacks for kids, and yoga clothes at all times! Furthermore, with my busy schedule, I needed to quickly retrieve the correct items from my bag — all from one big black hole. Sound familiar?According to a prominent usability researcher, Anya Meyerowitz, a woman spends close to 162 days searching for things in her bag. If this wasn't enough, what happens when we have to search for our keys in the dark? We use our phone light to get the keys, but then…no charge, right? Phew, now that's another problem that we have. Late nights out, long outdoor work, or a situation where we can't charge our phone. Hmm...so we carry a 'power bank'. But then we forget the power bank as it’s charging on the desk. The list goes on and on and on. And, I was a living testament to that research.My company was created out of my desire to create the perfect bag that serves the purpose of being comfortable, stylish, and high on the usability-factor. Being a designer by profession and having spent years in the fashion industry — both in Italy and India — I refused to let fashion run over functionality and finally decided to take the matter in my own hands. This was the genesis of NALPHI, a company where we believe that a woman’s bag should be beautiful AND practical. So, we designed a beautiful bag made with the finest quality leather that solves the most critical and common problems faced by a busy, modern woman.Our logo, the dolphin, defines us the best — a harmony between elegance and intelligence. This is our aim. We will continue to listen to all the challenges you face and continue to create beautiful products.",72.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Designer</h3>
<p>Leo is a young but really talented designer. He started to design clothes at the age of 17 . He created his first streetwear brand with a friend. However it wasn't enough for him and he dreamt bigger. He really wants to create more than just clothes. He wants to make a lifestyle. He spent 1 year in a Design School and one other year in the famous fashion school in Paris: ESMOD. After that, he started to develop Deleo and created the first pieces of the brand. He wanted to develop a real lifestyle in Paris: he went out with his friends total look Deleo. He went to clubs or good restaurants to promote the new brand. He started to make the brand famous and created the first part of his new marketing strategy: Pop up stores. His vision is similar to a Music artist. He wants to create a community and make pop up tours &amp; make parties. However before that he needed to know if his pieces were pleasant. He had his first fashion show during a Parisian fashion week contest. He won the Public Prize with 90% votes. The story in the making... </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We know people like our product. At present we are available exclusively in France. Now we wanted to develop the brand, produce the collection and have a pop up store. We need 100 000 euros for that. We estimate the cost of the production at 40 000 euros. We would like to keep the production in France or maybe in Europe because it's really important for us to retain the best quality and share the French fashion know-how. We really like to work on details like our designer's vision and it's important to be able to do that. Our strategy is based on the Pop up store. For that we need to develop a decor for our Pop up. We estimate that at 20 000 euros. We need to rent places too. It will cost 15 000 euros. The last part of our plan is communication. We really need to create partnerships with influencers and do a big advertisement campaign to make the brand more famous. this is one of the most important issues. We need to pay for shooting, models, influencers, magazines and Events. This will create the lifestyle of Deleo and make the brand different. We want to have events in Paris, Saint Tropez and Cannes to promote the Pop up store the following day. If you make us bigger than we expect, we will come to make your city crazy with a Deleo tour in the USA or in Japan. We want to change the idea of the luxury brand being too calm and boring. Our goal is to make a luxury brand more cool and modern. It's time to change the luxe with the new Deleo Lifestyle.</p>

<p>To help us to develop our brand we propose to you to obtain our new pieces from our last fashion show early. Be careful, it is limited. This access allows you to buy pieces of our collection even if you do not reside in France.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Today LVMH and other big Fashion groups have the monopoly of the fashion world. In 2021, it's time to remake a new fashion and luxury brand independent and more modern. After the Coronavirus, the world needs to have fun. Paris is an incredible city where you can have fun while enjoying the pleasures of luxury. Parisian youths have fun, you should too. Make Deleo the brand that will revolutionize the codes of luxury. Help us to share the lifestyle. Be part of the Deleo lifestyle. </span></p>

<p>It's also important to keep and continue the French know-how and continue to develop new styles in Paris. Our designer has done everything in his workshop until now. We want to sell French design, French quality and ethnic products. It's necessary for us to confront fast fashion and fight for all those who are exploited. </p>

The Designer
Leo is a young but really talented designer. He started to design clothes at the age of 17 . He created his first streetwear brand with a friend. However it wasn't enough for him and he dreamt bigger. He really wants to create more than just clothes. He wants to make a lifestyle. He spent 1 year in a Design School and one other year in the famous fashion school in Paris: ESMOD. After that, he started to develop Deleo and created the first pieces of the brand. He wanted to develop a real lifestyle in Paris: he went out with his friends total look Deleo. He went to clubs or good restaurants to promote the new brand. He started to make the brand famous and created the first part of his new marketing strategy: Pop up stores. His vision is similar to a Music artist. He wants to create a community and make pop up tours & make parties. However before that he needed to know if his pieces were pleasant. He had his first fashion show during a Parisian fashion week contest. He won the Public Prize with 90% votes. The story in the making... 




What We Need & What You Get
We know people like our product. At present we are available exclusively in France. Now we wanted to develop the brand, produce the collection and have a pop up store. We need 100 000 euros for that. We estimate the cost of the production at 40 000 euros. We would like to keep the production in France or maybe in Europe because it's really important for us to retain the best quality and share the French fashion know-how. We really like to work on details like our designer's vision and it's important to be able to do that. Our strategy is based on the Pop up store. For that we need to develop a decor for our Pop up. We estimate that at 20 000 euros. We need to rent places too. It will cost 15 000 euros. The last part of our plan is communication. We really need to create partnerships with influencers and do a big advertisement campaign to make the brand more famous. this is one of the most important issues. We need to pay for shooting, models, influencers, magazines and Events. This will create the lifestyle of Deleo and make the brand different. We want to have events in Paris, Saint Tropez and Cannes to promote the Pop up store the following day. If you make us bigger than we expect, we will come to make your city crazy with a Deleo tour in the USA or in Japan. We want to change the idea of the luxury brand being too calm and boring. Our goal is to make a luxury brand more cool and modern. It's time to change the luxe with the new Deleo Lifestyle.

To help us to develop our brand we propose to you to obtain our new pieces from our last fashion show early. Be careful, it is limited. This access allows you to buy pieces of our collection even if you do not reside in France.

 



The Impact
Today LVMH and other big Fashion groups have the monopoly of the fashion world. In 2021, it's time to remake a new fashion and luxury brand independent and more modern. After the Coronavirus, the world needs to have fun. Paris is an incredible city where you can have fun while enjoying the pleasures of luxury. Parisian youths have fun, you should too. Make Deleo the brand that will revolutionize the codes of luxury. Help us to share the lifestyle. Be part of the Deleo lifestyle. 



It's also important to keep and continue the French know-how and continue to develop new styles in Paris. Our designer has done everything in his workshop until now. We want to sell French design, French quality and ethnic products. It's necessary for us to confront fast fashion and fight for all those who are exploited.

<h3>The Impact on the planet</h3>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>We are a Zero waste sustainable brand, to minimise our impact on the planet we choose a circular production, to not generate unwanted items we decided to make only what is really needed, the life of our products start with our customers order. Our ethical business model blends ecological integrity with fairness to all the persons involved in the production process. Everything is designed to last and lovingly handmade in our London studio. We work tirelessly to test the durability and performance of every product.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>
<p>All our fabric waste is reused to create Zero Waste accessories and stamp our labels. We offer repairs, when possible, and we will take back the products when they will reach the autumn of their life and transform them into a new textile using the technique of quilting. We work hard on keeping our products away from landfill. We only use compostable Eco-friendly packaging made from recycled materials</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p>
<p>All our products are 100% Plastic-free and Biodegradable. We source our fabric form a BCI certified UK mill. Our creations are made by 100% cotton, coated with a vegan wax that makes it water repellent. For linings we use dead stock natural fabrics. The buttons are made by Corozo nut, also known as ''Vegetable Ivory''.</p>
<p><strong>Environmentally friendly production</strong></p>
<p>There are no factories involved in our production process: everything is handmade on-demand in our London studio. Sustainability policy and transparency is key when we choose our suppliers. They are all UK based: this is fundamental to reduce as much as we can our carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Our on-demand order system helps us drastically reduce our carbon footprint. Once an order is ready we ship it directly to the final customer without using any intermediaries. We communicate clearly with all our customers and offer made-to-measure options, to avoid disappointment with sizes and therefore minimising exchanges and returns.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have years of experience in the fashion industry, in both manufacturing and sales. We believe we will be able to successfully fulfil all the orders once the campaign ends. However, this is our first crowdfunding campaign and there may be unexpected challenges down the road. In these difficult times we understand that Coronavirus might have a potential impact on manufacturing and delivery. It’s difficult to know how the situation will evolve, and as of April 2021, our UK suppliers are working with reduced staff and the fabric production it will take longer than in normal times, but we put that in account. We do not rely on factories, everything is handmade in house by skilful seamstresses, but delays are still possible. Transparency is our priority, and our backers will be the first to know if anything changes in our delivery timeline. We are perfectionists!!! What you are seeing are prototypes, so expect the final product to be more polished and of supreme quality.</p>

Long-lasting design
We are a Zero waste sustainable brand, to minimise our impact on the planet we choose a circular production, to not generate unwanted items we decided to make only what is really needed, the life of our products start with our customers order. Our ethical business model blends ecological integrity with fairness to all the persons involved in the production process. Everything is designed to last and lovingly handmade in our London studio. We work tirelessly to test the durability and performance of every product.
Reusability and recyclability
All our fabric waste is reused to create Zero Waste accessories and stamp our labels. We offer repairs, when possible, and we will take back the products when they will reach the autumn of their life and transform them into a new textile using the technique of quilting. We work hard on keeping our products away from landfill. We only use compostable Eco-friendly packaging made from recycled materials

It is created to support the natural gait, to protect big toes, to give comfort and confidence. The Heart has 4 patent pending features:
Shape – protecting the big toes
A deeper heel cup with Auxetic foam
Insole with Auxetic foam
Outsole with Auxetic structure
 We have changed the pointed shape because it damages the big toes.Big toes are essential to us if we would like to walk, jump, run, dance etc.A deeper heel cup is to stabilize your feet in high heels so you don’t slide down.Auxetic is the main technology we use in our high heels because according to researches it performs and absorbs better than other commercial products.Auxetic has a negative Poisson's ratio property which makes a material go either hard or flexible when it is exposed to pressure.In other words Auxetic foam will absorb the pressure from the balls of the foot and Auxetic structure will spread the material when there is pressure and back again, when the pressure are gone. Just like the movement of the natural gait.    High heels need to fit your feet perfectly in order to walk properly. However, finding a pair of high heels that fit your feet is very hard, because it varies from brands to brands. Furthermore if your feet are different from a standard size.Have you ever tried a pair of high heels that are too tight at width? And thought that the solution for this problem is to choose a size bigger – does it help – no!The length becomes big and makes you swoop in high heels.It matters to us that you have a perfect pair of high heels because a good fitting gives a better comfort.It will increase your confidence and power to conquer the World.This is only exclusive for all Indiegogo backers as thank you for helping us get started!    We truly believe that The Heart will make a difference for a hardworking woman.However, we need 100 women to help us to bring The Heart to life.The money we are funding will create our first production orders of shoes, including all the tooling, molds and components that these complex designs need across custom made shoes.If we reach our goal, we will create the online training program, so you will get a sustainable solution for wearing high heels. In fact we are the only shoes brand in the World, that provides this service. Without your help, women on heels repeat the vicious circle and nothing will change for our children and the present high heels will continue to damage their feet- generation after generation.We need to stop this!Please help us to change this sad fact for femininity.    Everyone needs essential black comfort heels in their closet. Especially if you use it as workwear. They go with everything and make anything look great, so you don’t need to worry about the aftermath.We got your back.Our first collection contains The Heart in 2 different heights – 50mm & 70mm in black leather.If the goal stretches we will reward you with different heel types, leathers and colors which will be available for all of you to pick.

Besides particular bunions surgery, women in the USA spent an average USD 123 on comfort solutions.       The CreatorHi beautiful soul, my name is Lam Pham.I have 10 years’ experience in the fashion industry and I am the inventor of high-tech high heels, The Heart.

<h3>Pulse Athletic Apparel is the first heart based fitness brand. Designed for utmost comfort, durability, and breathability for high intensity athletic activities anywhere from marathon running and HIIT workouts to day to day tasks, like working from home. Pulse was founded based on intention, driving an inclusive community and emphasizing affordability without compromising quality. We believe that you should spend money on experiences, not stuff, but here’s the stuff that let’s you experience life. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>At the baseline, Pulse Athletic Apparel is a Chicago based fitness startup working to make high-quality activewear more affordable and accessible. Because you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your bank account for your well-being. </p>
<p>We live our lives through meaningful actions. Pulse’s mission is to build an authentic community and encourage that community to be intentional with their actions. We want to help people find what empowers them to push through. Running, lifting, yoga, dance — whatever it is that gets their bodies moving and hearts racing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618099029/q4glwdxd3pjnlkn3ahwp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want Pulse Athletic Apparel to be everyone’s go-to for affordable, inclusive activewear. But we also hope to be a source of empowerment, a community that encourages people to Pulse Forward.</p>
<p>Any revenue we make from sales goes directly back into the business, and we’ve been lucky to have a group of people who donate their time and energy to helping us grow.</p>
<p>We’re a small team but a bigger family. Our exec board is our founder &amp; CEO and Chief Content Officer. We’ve got dedicated brand ambassadors and energetic interns who believe in us and our vision. They’re really the driving force behind it all.</p>
<p>In the last few months, we’ve been able to grow through influencer collaborations and non-profit partnerships. Some of Pulse's designs have been represented by doctors, dancers, health coaches, fitness gurus, and more. We partnered with the American Heart Association in February for American Heart Month, and it has paved the way for partnerships we currently have in the works.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618098125/zibaur7ugb17xeagshd7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Increased funding would help make more of these partnerships possible, increase product development to include a greater variation in size inclusivity and begin integration of hydration monitors with a technology component. At the end of the day, we want to grow our communities and give back to the ones that served us. We also want to expand our reach, provide more inclusive sizing options, and work with manufacturers to create more Pulse activewear exclusives.</p>
<p>Above are a few of the designs we have been able to create and get into the market, We are excited to share below, some designs we have been working on to get produced. With our sets, we emphasize compression, durability, and breathability. Let Pulse take care of quality and comfort, so you can take care of your health and wellbeing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
<p>Let's Break it down:</p>

<p>Karishma Bali runs a full marathon every year.</p>
<p>Since 2016, running has been her source of peace and power. Karishma credits running as being “pivotal” in her personal and professional development. It’s how she centers herself when life gets a little too dynamic, and it’s how she finds clarity when her businesses call for next steps. Running motivates Karishma to continue to find her passions and cultivate them.</p>
<p>As an avid runner, Karishma knows how important quality activewear is, but she also knows it doesn’t have to break the bank. She created Pulse Athletic Apparel to help make comfortable, luxury activewear affordable and accessible, so others can find and cultivate their passions too.</p>

<p><strong>Submitting Information</strong></p>
<p>Once our project is successfully funded, we’ll be able to send you a form to collect information (e.g., identification, shipping addresses, sizes).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shipping Costs</strong></p>
<p>Shipping for all international orders outside of the USA will be $20USD.  Please include this amount in your Kickstarter pledge when you're submitting the pledge. The average number of days for shipping may vary based upon origin and destination.  Also, please bear in mind any duty or taxes on import into your country will be your responsibility, so please be aware of those potential costs.</p>
<p><strong>Returns</strong></p>
<p>We understand navigating sizing can be difficult when supporting a new brand, we will do exchange your item if needed. As our brand drives afforability at the forefront, our margins are really tight we will have to charge you for the freight shipping cost of any returns.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a new fitness start up, brand awareness is always difficult to navigate. We launched in the summer of 2020, right in the middle of a pandemic. We've been overwhelmed with the community we’ve already managed to build. One of our challenges is continuing to grow that community. But we believe staying true to ourselves helps people not only believe in our products but the movement we stand for. In addition, we work very closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to ensure our pieces are at high caliber in quality and delivered in a timely manner. The most common risk would be production delays in manufacturing. While we maintain continuous communication with all aspects of our team- design, production, and logistics- there is a slight possibility of a delay. We ensure updates at each stage to keep you fully informed. Breaking through the ""glass ceiling"" in a competitive market is something we are overcoming by constantly tweaking our strategies, research and development, and marketing. Supporting Pulse isn't only supporting a brand. It’s supporting our entrepreneurial journey as well. We’re new at this, but we’re relentlessly working and we’re committed. We know our passion will overcome the learning curve.</p>

We want to help people find what empowers them to push through. Running, lifting, yoga, dance — whatever it is that gets their bodies moving and hearts racing.

We want Pulse Athletic Apparel to be everyone’s go-to for affordable, inclusive activewear. But we also hope to be a source of empowerment, a community that encourages people to Pulse Forward.
Any revenue we make from sales goes directly back into the business, and we’ve been lucky to have a group of people who donate their time and energy to helping us grow.
We’re a small team but a bigger family. Our exec board is our founder & CEO and Chief Content Officer. We’ve got dedicated brand ambassadors and energetic interns who believe in us and our vision. They’re really the driving force behind it all.
In the last few months, we’ve been able to grow through influencer collaborations and non-profit partnerships. Some of Pulse's designs have been represented by doctors, dancers, health coaches, fitness gurus, and more. We partnered with the American Heart Association in February for American Heart Month, and it has paved the way for partnerships we currently have in the works.
 

Increased funding would help make more of these partnerships possible, increase product development to include a greater variation in size inclusivity and begin integration of hydration monitors with a technology component. At the end of the day, we want to grow our communities and give back to the ones that served us. We also want to expand our reach, provide more inclusive sizing options, and work with manufacturers to create more Pulse activewear exclusives.
Above are a few of the designs we have been able to create and get into the market, We are excited to share below, some designs we have been working on to get produced. With our sets, we emphasize compression, durability, and breathability. Let Pulse take care of quality and comfort, so you can take care of your health and wellbeing.

$10000 for product development, size variation and inclusivity, and content creation

Meet the founder. 


 
Karishma Bali runs a full marathon every year.
Since 2016, running has been her source of peace and power. Karishma credits running as being “pivotal” in her personal and professional development. It’s how she centers herself when life gets a little too dynamic, and it’s how she finds clarity when her businesses call for next steps. Running motivates Karishma to continue to find her passions and cultivate them.
As an avid runner, Karishma knows how important quality activewear is, but she also knows it doesn’t have to break the bank. She created Pulse Athletic Apparel to help make comfortable, luxury activewear affordable and accessible, so others can find and cultivate their passions too.

Submitting Information
Once our project is successfully funded, we’ll be able to send you a form to collect information (e.g., identification, shipping addresses, sizes).
 
Shipping Costs
Shipping for all international orders outside of the USA will be $20USD.  Please include this amount in your Kickstarter pledge when you're submitting the pledge. The average number of days for shipping may vary based upon origin and destination.  Also, please bear in mind any duty or taxes on import into your country will be your responsibility, so please be aware of those potential costs.
Returns
We understand navigating sizing can be difficult when supporting a new brand, we will do exchange your item if needed. As our brand drives afforability at the forefront, our margins are really tight we will have to charge you for the freight shipping cost of any returns.
 

Risks & Challenges
As a new fitness start up, brand awareness is always difficult to navigate. We launched in the summer of 2020, right in the middle of a pandemic. We've been overwhelmed with the community we’ve already managed to build. One of our challenges is continuing to grow that community. But we believe staying true to ourselves helps people not only believe in our products but the movement we stand for. In addition, we work very closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to ensure our pieces are at high caliber in quality and delivered in a timely manner. The most common risk would be production delays in manufacturing. While we maintain continuous communication with all aspects of our team- design, production, and logistics- there is a slight possibility of a delay. We ensure updates at each stage to keep you fully informed. Breaking through the ""glass ceiling"" in a competitive market is something we are overcoming by constantly tweaking our strategies, research and development, and marketing. Supporting Pulse isn't only supporting a brand. It’s supporting our entrepreneurial journey as well. We’re new at this, but we’re relentlessly working and we’re committed. We know our passion will overcome the learning curve.

Cyxus- lightweight, stylish and super portable- we are getting closer to our ideal.Flawless materials, luxury American design, and HEV-Absorb technologies for lenses come together in the distinguished and versatile Cyxus eyeglasses. It's more than a simple pair of glasses, it's your day-to-day essential eyeglasses pair and it does things other eyewear can't.Our team has developed this photochromic general use sunglass that we would love to bring to market with the assistance of Indiegogo.The Photochromic lens is irradiated by ultraviolet rays and short-wave visible light in the sun, the color becomes darker, and the light transmittance decreases; the light transmittance of the lens increases indoors or in the dark, and the color fades and brightens. The Photochromic glasses can adjust the light transmittance through the color change of the lens so that the human eyes can adapt to the changes of the ambient light, reduce visual fatigue, and protect the eyes.Many drivers often wear a pair of sunglasses when driving. When driving in the sun or snow, sunglasses can protect the eyes from the long-term irritation of strong light. However, when the car suddenly drove from the light to the dark, wearing black glasses became a burden instead. It is too inconvenient to wear it for a while and pick it up for a while. Is there any good way to relieve the driver's distress? Yes, you should wear color-changing glasses. In the sun, it is a pair of black sunglasses, with dark glass lenses blocking the dazzling light. In a softly lit room, it becomes the same as ordinary glasses, transparent and colorless.We have a variety of lenses for you to choose from, including anti-blue light lenses, sleep lenses, and anti-fog lenses.As our screening time has increased, we will receive more Blu-rays.Blue Light is the range of the visible light spectrum that has a short wavelength. Artificial blue light from computer screens, phones, tablets, and LEDs can be highly harmful, especially because we use these devices on a daily basis and for long periods of time.The harm of blue light to the human body are: eyestrain, dry eyes, red eyes, eye fatigue, headaches, neck pain, reduction of melatonin production and change of sleeping cycles (circadian rhythms).TR90 Polymer Material Sustainable eyeglass frames made in TR90, from recycled material.TR90 is a kind of polymer material with memory. It is the most popular ultra-light frame material in the world. It can reduce the burden on the bridge of the nose and ears and is suitable for everyone.It has the characteristics of super toughness, impact resistance, high-temperature resistance, low friction coefficient, etc., which can effectively prevent damage to the eyes and face caused by the fracture and friction of the frame during exercise. Because of its specific molecular structure, it has good chemical resistance and is not easy to deform, melt and burn in high-temperature environments.TR90 material does not release chemical residues and meets European requirements for food-grade materials.The main function of Photochromic glasses is to absorb ultraviolet rays, thereby protecting eyesight. The damage of ultraviolet rays to the human eye is Omni-directional. It can cause abnormal proliferation of the eye conjunctiva, damage to the corneal protein and lipids, cortical cataracts in the lens, etc. It can also easily cause keratitis and macular degeneration. Nowadays, the high-altitude ozone layer is getting thinner, and the ultraviolet light content in sunlight is constantly rising, and the damage to human eyes is much greater than before. Therefore, Photochromic Lenes can reduce eye damage. Wearing Photochromic glasses indoors is no different from ordinary glasses. Therefore, wearing a pair of color-changing glasses in environments such as snow walking, scorching sun, driving, etc. can always protect your eyes.Difficulty in falling asleep and poor sleep quality are common problems of modern people. People usually choose to take sleeping pills or melatonin to relieve sleep problems, but the side effects are very serious. Phototherapy is a physical therapy method that uses light-emitting devices to generate light of different wavelengths and intensities to stimulate autonomic nerves and brainstem network structure, regulate blood circulation and endocrine function, regulate menstrual cycles, and improve symptoms. Light stimulates the retina through visual signals, acts on the visual light receptors of non-cone cells and non-rod cells, and regulates the function of the pineal gland through the non-sensory conduction pathway of the optic nerve. The anatomical basis of this pathway has been confirmed to be the same as that of the optic chiasm. The endogenous biological clock in the upper nucleus triggers the rhythmic secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, which results in a stationary state during the day and increased synthesis at night. Melatonin acts on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other parts to induce sleep, thereby improving sleep. How about Cyxus anti-fog lens?An anti-fog lens is a kind of special lens that can prevent fog.

 This is due to the exposure to more bacteria and germs than normal in your daily life.We don't want you to suffer - we want you to enjoy your travels!That is why CleanseBot can sanitize and disinfect all hotel surfaces AND UV-C light helps prevent the spread of airborne viruses. In fact, the CleanseBot was tested by an independent third party showing how it killed 99.99% of E.coli! 
 
 
  The areas with the most germs and bacteria include light switches and television remotes in addition to the bedspread. In one study out of the University of Houston, researchers tested 19 surfaces in hotel rooms for bacteria and found that main room light switches had an average of 112.7 colony-forming units of bacteria per cubic centimeter. MSNBC reports in a study of hospital cleanliness that a top limit of only FIVE colony-forming bacteria per cubic centimeter is recommended for maximum cleanliness.Even discounting the need for hospital-like cleanliness - these numbers are staggering. 
 
 
  CleanseBot is the world's ONLY smart travel robot designed with YOU in mind.CleanseBot is a smart robot with artificial intelligence and 18 sensors built in. It uses FOUR UV-C lamps to blast away 99.99% of germs and bacteria on ANY SURFACE.But most importantly, on your hotel bed.Hotels are notorious for germs and bacteria and you don't want to worry about that when you're traveling - whether you are traveling for work or for fun!Just set the CleanseBot down on the bed, turn it on for either 30 or 60 minutes, and go about your day while it sanitizes and disinfects your bed sheets and blankets!Not only does CleanseBot kill germs, bacteria, and dust mites, but UV-C light has been proven in many studies to actually help prevent the spread of airborne viruses, too. CleanseBot is the ONLY thing like this in the world!  
 
  See How BBC Talked About Us 
 
 
  
 
   Your bed is your sanctuary. When you rest, you want the best quality sleep and to not worry about germs, mold, bacteria, or dust mites.   
 
 
The CleanseBot will never get stuck in the bed or fall off of a bed. The CleanseBot has 18 smart AI sensors to keep the robot going. 
CleanseBot is the world’s first robot which focuses on sensors specifically for materials and fabrics and not simply hardwood or flat surfaces. 
The CleanseBot Team has tested the CleanseBot on more than 40 different types of materials and fabrics for sheets and blankets, as well as testing different sizes and shapes of beds, in order to gather and analyze all data and create the best AI and sensors.
The CleanseBot wheels are patent-pending technology which can run over any surface. No other technology like this exists.
 
 
 Remove the handle cover and simply place the CleanseBot underneath the blanket on any bed and press the power button once for a 30-minute run and twice for 60 minutes. The CleanseBot will use its four UV-C lights to clean in both directions at the same time! Sanitize and disinfect your sheets and blankets simultaneously. The CleanseBot has 18 sensors and smart mapping technology, so it will never fall off the bed or get stuck.  For the top of the blanket, put the CleanseBot on top of the comforter and turn it on to let it continue sanitizing. It will automatically sense there is nothing above it and only use the lights facing downward. With patented wheel technology, the CleanseBot can climb over any lumps and bumps in blankets and mattresses!  
 
 
 To sanitize and disinfect any surface, place the handle cover on the CleanseBot and pick it up to clean with ease! It will only use the bottom UV-C lights so your eyes will be protected, and with no mess and no chemicals, it is safe to use around pets and children!    Sanitize hotel pillowcases, toilet seats, light switches, bathroom fixtures, TV remotes, and more in Handheld Mode.    In your home, you can use CleanseBot to sanitize toys for your children and pets, disinfect messy areas, and sanitize devices like cell phones, keyboards, tablets, and the interior of cars.   
 
 
 For Power Bank Mode, use the USB-C port to power any device.We have partnered with the Panasonic battery factory to bring you exclusive access to some of the world’s most advanced battery technology. We have integrated Li-ion cells and power management systems into the CleanseBot hardware to give you a handy portable charger with a 3700 mAh battery to charge all of your devices at lightning speed while you’re on the go.Panasonic is the world's leader in portable power, and by integrating their leading Li-ion cells and power management systems into Cleansebot's hardware, playtime extends to almost TWICE that of a standard battery. The CleanseBot fits easily into all backpacks and every suitcase! It’s only slightly bigger than a cell phone and almost as smart!  
 
 
We have tested the CleanseBot with an independent third-party testing center, the Guang Zhou Institute of Microbiology and the Guangzhou Testing Center of Industrial Microbiology.
The test run is called the Sterilization and Disinfection Equipment Disinfection Efficacy Appraisal Test and analyzed the efficacy of the CleanseBot on E. coli 8099.
The tests were run using the CleanseBot and recorded at UV-C strength of 1500 mu w/cm2 and UV-C wavelength of 254 nm.
The test results show that with only 30 seconds of exposure of UV-C light on the E. coli bacteria, the killing rate was greater than 99.99%. This proves how effective the CleanseBot is!

While various masks on the market offered protection from larger particles such as sand and pollen, very few masks effectively filtered smaller particles such as bacteria and PM2.5. This was how the idea to create a wearable, air purification system came to mind.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">After months of research and development, the team created ATMOBLUE, launching an initial prototype in Asia. The feedback was incredible. ATMOBLUE received rave reviews, publications and awards. Today, building on top of their initial success and prototype, the team behind ATMOBLUE is ready to introduce a new and improved version to the world!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Significant upgrades have been made to ATMOBLUE including new and improved batteries, in-built mask controls, upgraded long-lasting HEPA filters (150 hours of use time), as well as a newly designed and patented head strap. In addition to these upgrades, ATMOBLUE has been updated to fit within FCC and UL standards and is currently undergoing certification reviews for US and global sales. ATMOBLUE is currently RoHS, SRCC and QCQ, certified. By funding this campaign, you will be first in line for ATMOBLUE.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">At this time, you may only purchase ATMOBLUE via our crowdfunding campaign. Please avoid third party websites and sales links as they are fraudulent. Unfortunately this is quite common with successful campaigns.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">For additional questions such as investment and distribution inquiries feel free to contact us at support@atmoblue.com or directly to our campaign inbox.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We look forward to this journey and can’t wait to get ATMOBLUE into your hands! </p><p> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">FEATURES</h1><p> </p><div data-id=""28498149""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587581768/wuvtq9agwob8df4h5baw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3><span>Replaceable H13 HEPA Filters</span></h3><p> </p><ul>

 OUR STORY In 2016, while living abroad, the creators of ATMOBLUE experienced hazardous air levels for the first time. While various masks on the market offered protection from larger particles such as sand and pollen, very few masks effectively filtered smaller particles such as bacteria and PM2.5. This was how the idea to create a wearable, air purification system came to mind.After months of research and development, the team created ATMOBLUE, launching an initial prototype in Asia. The feedback was incredible. ATMOBLUE received rave reviews, publications and awards. Today, building on top of their initial success and prototype, the team behind ATMOBLUE is ready to introduce a new and improved version to the world!Significant upgrades have been made to ATMOBLUE including new and improved batteries, in-built mask controls, upgraded long-lasting HEPA filters (150 hours of use time), as well as a newly designed and patented head strap. In addition to these upgrades, ATMOBLUE has been updated to fit within FCC and UL standards and is currently undergoing certification reviews for US and global sales. ATMOBLUE is currently RoHS, SRCC and QCQ, certified. By funding this campaign, you will be first in line for ATMOBLUE.At this time, you may only purchase ATMOBLUE via our crowdfunding campaign. Please avoid third party websites and sales links as they are fraudulent. Unfortunately this is quite common with successful campaigns.For additional questions such as investment and distribution inquiries feel free to contact us at support@atmoblue.com or directly to our campaign inbox.We look forward to this journey and can’t wait to get ATMOBLUE into your hands!  FEATURES  Replaceable H13 HEPA Filters 
Blocks 99.97% of air particulates 
Average use time is 150 hours
High Quality, Multi-Fold design
Traditional filters are flat and are quickly consumed. Our unique filters are made of up meticulous folds, compressing the flat surface area of two 9.5 squared inch sheets, into two compact filter blocks which slide right into your mask  
N95 < N99 < H13 HEPA Filters
You may have heard the term N95. This simply means 95% of air particles are being captured. At the higher end of the spectrum, N99 (99%) masks are offered for more industrial applications such as painting or waste cleanup. Moving one step further ATMOBLUE's, H13 HEPA filters block 99.97% of particles which are 0.3 microns in diameter or larger. To give you a bit of context, one strand of human hair is about 75 microns across!Our high-end H13 HEPA filters use melt-blown, nonwoven fabrics, to block harmful chemicals, bacteria, viruses, pollen, pollutants, smoke, micro-dust, odor and more   Innovative Air Flow Technology
Dual, high-speed, centrifugal fans continuously supply filtered air to create a refreshing breathing environment.
Three airflow control settings. Users adjust speeds as needed
Positive Air Pressure allows users to breath effortlessly with zero resistance.
The term positive airflow means excess air or “positive air” being pushed into the mask and out through its vents. Because of this solution positive air pushes out exhaled air increasing the overall effectiveness of the mask by removing unwanted bacteria from the breathing zone. Designed for the most extreme conditions ATMOBLUE’s multiple airflow settings allow users to switch between light mode, when sitting idle on the train or a car, to high strength when jogging through the city or on the job.Depending on your use, such as fan speed, your rechargeable ATMOBLUE system runs continuously from 3 – 5 hours. When battery life is running low a red indication light notifies users when to recharge. Simply plug into any USB port until your indicator light turns white again.   Lightweight silicone sealDermatologically friendly silicone creates a soft but airtight seal keeping good air in and bad air out. ATOMBLUE wont leave marks on your face after each use and can be worn with glasses without fogging up vision.ATMOBLUE’s fresh air system combined with our unique silicon solution give users a truly enjoyable breathing experience. That means, no nasty scent or moist fabric touching your face.Designed to fits various face sizes.Our unique silicon seal was designed with users in mind. We compiled data of over 1000 individuals faces and created a unique solution which adapts to various sized faces. ATMOBLUE's soft, lightweight silicone seal contours around users faces leaving enough room for movement and flexibility.     Patented head strapOur patented head strap system allows users to move about comfortably in any direction. If you’ve ever worn a mask you know how frustrating head straps can be as they cause unnecessary pressure behind your ears or simply fall off your head when moving around.With our unique strap-channel design, the continuous head-strap flows through the mask, around your neck and head, creating a full range of continuous motion.Designed with athletes in mind we used high-quality,  flexible, materials allowing for a stretch when using your mobile device or looking around your periphery.

We promise that the first dispatch of orders will be on 10th of September.Thank you for your support!SHENZHEN WATCH & CLOCK QUALITY TEST CENTRE（Founded in 2004,, is one of the most authoritative watch quality inspection organization of China. Meanwhile it’s the first of third party testing organization which owns CNAS and CMA certifications in China.）The ELITE passed the standards of the QB/T 1249-2013<Mechanical Watches>, including 14 quality inspections(Usage reliability、Power reserve、Daily rate、Water resistance test、Cosmetics、Tension resistance.. etc). Test result:Superior Quality Men have always been fascinated by the mechanism working behind the finished product. For this time, we wish to design and create a dress watch that satisfy this pursue of mechanic aesthetics on your wrist while being a perfect fit for the professional elite. This mechanical watch is different. Behind the classic legible dial, you will find the micro-mechanical structure that not only presents the watch with an exquisite delicate appearance but also way less bulky unlike sports and divers watches. The watch aims to present you as a sophisticated specialist at work. Its scratch and wear resistant features along with the stable movement are to help you conquer any occasions. Why is The Elite worth adding to your collection?Is there a micro-rotor watch in your watch collection? Now it’s time to move on! The Elite, with unique movement shape, is distinctive to the mechanical watches you carried. When you open your watchbox and see this watch - it will certainly stand out amongst the rest. The reason of it’s rarity is that processing a micro-rotor movement needs high technology and precision work. The ordinary automatic mechanical movement separates the rotor while the micro-rotor is integrated with other parts of the movement. This technique requires to maintain the aesthetics and stability while reducing some parts of the movement which makes it extra demanding in terms of the internal design and precision of the watch.None collectors don’t want to have such an one-of-a-kind watch in his watch box! It's time to own something different!  At a price of 199 US dollars, we offer the same or even better high-quality materials-sapphire crystal, sturdy stainless steel case, exquisite and stable movement as our competitors, so we believe that we have defeated all of the competitors in this category of watches. And all boderry watches come with a full two-year-warranty.  The dress watch is also our daily tool watch.Before designing, we think that a dress watch should be:
Automatic Mechanical Watch(Saves the trouble of manual winding);
Light-weight and Comfortable to Wear;
Legible Indication;
Wear and Scratch Resistance;
Stability and Accuracy;
  What makes THE ELITE excel in this field? Micro-rotor MovementThe Elite uses a reliable customized Hangzhou AAA-class self-winding 5000B mechanical movement with 30 jewels. It does not need battery to achieve a long-lasting and stable performance. The natural movement of swinging the watch can be converted into energy and powers the watch and enable the watch to store up to 42 hours of energy. You can also manually wind the watch by turning the crown. Quality InspectionFor producing a dress watch, the absolute accuracy is the key on our inspection checklist. Before assembling the watch, we strictly supervise the quality of each part of the components through thorough testings with high standards.We ensure that the accuracy of the watch maintained at -20~+20 sec/day. Unlike regular quality check, we test the watch in 5 more positions to make sure that the watch meets the standard in any situation. Sapphire CrystalSmooth, curvaceous and incredibly sturdy, the watch that you have always imagine. The glass surfaces on the front and back of the watch are made of sapphire crystal with rigidity second to diamond and with excellent scratch resistant. Watch CaseTo increase the durability while maintaining a solid structure, The Elite uses sturdy stainless steel shell. The case is sandblasted to soften all edges and through mold opening, perforation, scouring, sanding and polishing, over 100 procedures were performed on the whole to provide this durable case. Watch DialWhen designing, we wish to maintain the functionality and readability of the watch. This unique floating digital pin took us 3 months to be the final choice. Paired with slender, soft-curved willow hands, the dial looks exceedingly elegant as a whole. Watch BandThe strap is made of cowhide leather and hand-made. The shiny high-quality cowhide ensures that the strap is soft, durable and will not easily peel off. (it will become softer as it is used more often) 50m Water-resistantThe splashes and rain will not stop the watch running. The Elite is 5ATM standard waterproof.How are we going to make this watch?Each piece of The Elite watch is assembled by the masters at our company with their exquisite and skillful craftsmanship who have been working in this field for over 15 years. SHIPPING

<p>Better Athletics is a startup, functional athleisure brand for those who demand common-sense options. With your backing, we aim to offer sustainable products with a commitment to function, fit, comfort, and performance.</p>
<p>Our signature product the versatile 6-in-1 athletic short that features the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wear them as swim trunks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear them as gym shorts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear them linerless</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear them with a compression short liner</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear them with a mid-length liner</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear them with a legging liner</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This patent-pending concept is unlike anything currently available for sale in the athleisure market. The standard shorts feature a detachable compression short liner that can be removed and reattached based on the wearer’s preferences, intended activities, weather conditions, or desired level of support and personal comfort. Insertable liners can be purchased separately and offer the wearer the ability to switch their liner out for a different length and/or design.</p>

<p>And with this signature product, Better Athletics is the first-ever and only functional athleisure brand.</p>
<p>Our main objective over the coming years is to disrupt the athletic wear industry, by developing better athleisure that offers a range of functional benefits to consumers. </p>

<p>We believe in being better and doing better. We’re driven by a constant desire to improve ourselves and uplift others.</p>
<p><strong>The three ""I""s that make us better:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Integrity.</strong> Live purposefully, authentically and strive to be a better version of yourself. We believe in being honest, just, and transparent with colleagues, customers, and the broader community even when it feels difficult. We hold ourselves to “better” standards. </p>
<p><strong>Ingenuity.</strong> We are passionate lifelong learners committed to finding innovative solutions to common challenges. We strive to be better and bring unique thought to the table every day.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusivity. </strong>We believe in being part of a community where all voices and backgrounds are welcome. No one should ever feel left out based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or religion. We depend on these differences to enable us to think differently and offer a better, more informed product. </p>

<p>The outer shell of the swim trunks/athletic shorts features comfortable 4-way-stretch polyester material made from upcycled plastic bottles.

<p>Unlike the uncomfortable mesh netting liners that typically come permanently attached to swim trunks, we'll offer a breathable nylon/spandex blend compression short liner that is simple to zip in and out.

</div></div>","Better Athletics is a startup, functional athleisure brand for those who demand common-sense options. With your backing, we aim to offer sustainable products with a commitment to function, fit, comfort, and performance.
Our signature product the versatile 6-in-1 athletic short that features the following options:

Wear them as swim trunks
Wear them as gym shorts
Wear them linerless
Wear them with a compression short liner
Wear them with a mid-length liner
Wear them with a legging liner

This patent-pending concept is unlike anything currently available for sale in the athleisure market. The standard shorts feature a detachable compression short liner that can be removed and reattached based on the wearer’s preferences, intended activities, weather conditions, or desired level of support and personal comfort. Insertable liners can be purchased separately and offer the wearer the ability to switch their liner out for a different length and/or design.

And with this signature product, Better Athletics is the first-ever and only functional athleisure brand.
Our main objective over the coming years is to disrupt the athletic wear industry, by developing better athleisure that offers a range of functional benefits to consumers. 

We believe in being better and doing better. We’re driven by a constant desire to improve ourselves and uplift others.
The three ""I""s that make us better:
Integrity. Live purposefully, authentically and strive to be a better version of yourself. We believe in being honest, just, and transparent with colleagues, customers, and the broader community even when it feels difficult. We hold ourselves to “better” standards. 
Ingenuity. We are passionate lifelong learners committed to finding innovative solutions to common challenges. We strive to be better and bring unique thought to the table every day.
Inclusivity. We believe in being part of a community where all voices and backgrounds are welcome. No one should ever feel left out based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or religion. We depend on these differences to enable us to think differently and offer a better, more informed product. 

We strive to offer functional athleisure with options that meet the diverse and evolving needs of our consumers. 

The outer shell of the swim trunks/athletic shorts features comfortable 4-way-stretch polyester material made from upcycled plastic bottles. There will be various pockets and storage compartments on the outer shell and a zip fly. The shorts will be made available in 5"", 7"", and 9"" inseam options.

Unlike the uncomfortable mesh netting liners that typically come permanently attached to swim trunks, we'll offer a breathable nylon/spandex blend compression short liner that is simple to zip in and out. Our liner will feature a hidden pocket large enough to fit a smartphone, a horizontal fly opening, and a separating and supporting pouch for the male privates. 


 
Depending on your preferences and activity for the day, you'll have the ability to leave the liner in or zip it out by lifting the zipper cover flap and unzipping the invisible zipper that spans the inside circumference of the waistband. 

Wearers will also be the option of switching the liners out for different lengths, depending on style preference and functional needs. 

Why purchase two different pairs of shorts, when you can wear the same pair of great shorts six different ways? 
Any true athleisure enthusiast knows, there are many scenarios in which you might leave a liner in or take it out - Better Athletics puts the power of choice into your hands. 
Keep the liner in for:•    Heavy-duty sport activity•    Moisture management to wick sweat away•    Keeps things cool, comfortable, and dry•    Prevents infection and chafing. •    Liners are built to provide enough support and compression for men so they don't need a jockstrap.•    Reduced muscle fatigue•    Strain prevention•    Lower risk of muscle soreness•    Improved perceived exertion•    Increased power & better jumping ability•    Better muscle oxygenation•    Comfort preference•    Improved strength recovery (after lifting weights)•    Groin support•    Cold day

<h2><strong>The amazing properties of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt listed above  are borne from 2 equally important components: </strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599294183/rkcgcz7f5hnogbdhaddq.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> AND</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599295561/mmtuu6urm92qqaivsfbp.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<h2>Endothermic Cooling: Its just science. </h2>
<p>Almost every “cooling shirt” out there works by the same principle: evaporation. Sweat is wicked away from the body to the outside, and the wind evaporates it, thus cooling the wearer.</p>
<p>But we wanted something better. Something that works beyond evaporative cooling, even in high humidity or low wind environments where evaporative cooling doesn't work. </p>
<p>Enter Xylitol, an all-natural sweetener sugar alcohol found in some fruits, white birch and corn. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599295700/ijqnowseijmvpfivlgom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You've most likely added xylitol to your coffee or experienced the fresh cool feeling of it in toothpaste or gum.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you put xylitol in water. Keep your eye on the thermometer readout. </p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3c_YbDGVTh8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>The temperature drops!! This is called an endothermic (heat absorbing) reaction. The reaction draws heat from the surroundings, thus lowering the temperature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>So:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599296106/xqvlsgqletg3ssibd7bp.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Wouldn't it be amazing to put this natural compound onto a shirt so that when you sweat, the water in your sweat reacts with the xylitol in an endothermic reaction to make you feel cooler? </p>
<p>This is exactly what we have done with the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Infused in the fabric itself is xylitol, which absorbs heat from the wearer's skin in an endothermic reaction caused by the water in your very own sweat (Perspiractive™ technology). So the hotter and sweatier you get, the cooler your shirt feels.</p>
<h2>**Caution about xylitol and dogs/cats</h2>
<p>Each year, there are more than 200,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S., many of them caused by household substances that are perfectly harmless to you and I. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won’t hurt our beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog/cat poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis like supplements, mouthwash, tooth paste, gum, chocolate, and peanut butter.  Xylitol is one of those items that is perfectly safe for humans but that can be very poisonous for dogs and cats.  Consumption of xylitol by dogs and cats can result in undesired symptoms ranging from mild hypoglycemia to liver failure and death. Many large companies that sell millions of shirts a year use xylitol in their apparel as a cooling agent. And although I am not aware of a single case in which apparel containing xylitol has sickened a dog or cat, be sure to be mindful that this shirt contains xylitol as a cooling agent. For your information, the most comprehensive list I've ever seen on items containing xylitol can be seen here (<a href=""https://info.peeva.co/blog/products-that-contain-the-toxic-xylitol-ingredient"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://info.peeva.co/blog/products-that-contai...</a>). I' have also applied to put my product and company on this list. Pets give us so much, especially during this pandemic. Please keep them safe.</p>
<h2>Revolutionary smart-release micro-vesicle delivery system.</h2>
<p>The real technology of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt comes from multi-layered micro-vesicles (microscopic sized balls containing multiple oil and water phases) that are able to sense the level of moisture from the body based on the environment, and act accordingly to cool you.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599296394/ahq0fwjnapil4izsuawe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Micro-vesicles have an oil phase containing ""water-hating"" molecules like squalane, and a water phase with water loving molecules like the cooling xylitol. </p>
<p> When the fabric is dried and is made into garments this water layer becomes dehydrated and the xylitol is inactive. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599314740/eakzolri1revmqaaxjdy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, when the wearer starts to sweat the water layers rehydrate and then the  xylitol dissolves and is released and the cooling reaction begins. The cooling sensation occurs only where the sweat or moisture is. After some time, the wearer will start to cool down and should stop sweating. As the garment dries out, the reaction stops and goes back to the dehydrated state again.</p>
<p>This process can be seen in the movie below.</p>
<div>

<h2>Sweat-activated Perspiractive™ fabric with real endothermic cooling</h2>
<p>The thermographs below show a clear difference in shirt temperature before and after hard exercise where xylitol is present, when the water in the wearer's sweat reacts with the xylitol  in a cooling endothermic reaction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599315019/gcrdrfw08v6gjdvasejx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Removal of the shirt after hard exercise also shows that the cooling is not just limited to the shirt fabric, the body is cooler as well.</p>
<p>To measure the amount of cooling generated by the micro-vesicle technology, the temperature of the fabric was measured after adding water. The results shown in the graph indicate that the initial temperature was as much as 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) lower than untreated fabric before washing.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599315083/isfnyio3avvowql4bre2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Due to the slow-release properties of this technology, the cooling effect was retained; the xylitol decreased the temperature of the fabric by 3.5 degrees C (6.3 degrees F) even after 50 washes. </p>
<h2>Cooling regardless of external conditions</h2>
<p>Because the surrounding heat is consumed in the endothermic reaction, the feeling of the fabric against the skin is cool, regardless of whether or not there is any outside wind. So you even get cooling under conditions in which evaporative cooling shirts don’t work, such as high humidity, indoors, or when there is little wind.</p>
<h2>Xylitol--a truly amazing natural compound</h2>
<p>In addition to its cooling effect, Xylitol has numerous other beneficial effects which have been shown in the scientific literature, including:</p>
<p>Functions as a natural antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral.</p>
<p>Has high moisture retention</p>
<p>Stimulates the production of collagen to counter the effects of aging</p>
<p>Increases bone volume and bone mineral content, protecting against osteoporosis</p>
<p>And its completely non-toxic and safe. Not only has it been consumed by humans for the last 50 years in fruits, chewing gum, candies, mints, and oral care products, it is also used to treat middle ear infections in young children.</p>
<h2>Skin protective function</h2>
<p>Additional components in the micro-vesicles shown earlier include squalane, a hydrogenated form of a moisturizer produced naturally by your own skin cells in the skin lipid layer but that declines with normal aging. It is commonly extracted from plants such as olives.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599315293/lidoosaxmp8xz0gg2k01.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Squalane reduces inflammation and keeps the skin hydrated and fresh. Boosting hydration can help your skin appear more vibrant and healthier, while its antioxidant effect also decrease skin damage and free radicals which can accelerate the aging process. Regular use can also boost collagen production, resulting in firmer skin.</p>
<p>And <strong>Silk Protein</strong>, a natural protein obtained from natural silk noils (fibers, fibroin) from the cocoon of the silk worm. This produces excellent moisture binding properties &amp; a silky smooth feel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599315413/kzpz8tdodhe4fu1tadh8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Cool Human® perspiractive™ fabric: Comfort through moisture retention and release</h2>
<p>Just as with the control of ""smart"" cooling based on the environment, the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt offers ""smart"" moisture management via these same micro-vesicles. </p>
<p><strong>Moisture retention when its dry</strong></p>
<p>In a dry environment, the water phase is dehydrated. As moisture is released from the skin in the form of sweat, the micro-vesicle absorbs it and becomes rehydrated. The increased humidity of the garment allows for increased comfort. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599316061/xksotst8q06wg5pw9qye.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When humidity between the skin and the fabric increases to excess due to exercise or sweating, the micelle structure becomes saturated. Because the outermost layer of the micelle is hydrophobic (water-hating), it repels the excess moisture and pushes it out of the fabric.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599316148/zsqbeqtbifely7qvfnn5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>FABRIC PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY </h2>
<p>Impressive as it is, the finishing technology of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt that gives the shirt its amazing cooling and moisture management properties is only half the story. The fabric production technology is just as important. </p>
<h2>TACTEL® </h2>
<p>The Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt  is made with TACTEL®, also known as the ""cotton alternative."" </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599316370/mdbtcybwpcjet5lot2qh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>”TACTEL® garments are softer and lighter than most other fabrics and feel very comfortable next to the skin. In fact, the name TACTEL® is derived from “tacto,” which is Latin for “touch.""  </p>
<p> </p>

A ""Tribrid"" T-shirt/undershirt/base layer with built-in ""smart"" cooling powered by nature.
 
Awe-inspiring features of Cool Human® Fabric Technology

 

 
The amazing properties of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt listed above  are borne from 2 equally important components: 

 AND

Endothermic Cooling: Its just science. 
Almost every “cooling shirt” out there works by the same principle: evaporation. Sweat is wicked away from the body to the outside, and the wind evaporates it, thus cooling the wearer.
But we wanted something better. Something that works beyond evaporative cooling, even in high humidity or low wind environments where evaporative cooling doesn't work. 
Enter Xylitol, an all-natural sweetener sugar alcohol found in some fruits, white birch and corn. 

You've most likely added xylitol to your coffee or experienced the fresh cool feeling of it in toothpaste or gum.
This is what happens when you put xylitol in water. Keep your eye on the thermometer readout. 



 

The temperature drops!! This is called an endothermic (heat absorbing) reaction. The reaction draws heat from the surroundings, thus lowering the temperature.
So:


Wouldn't it be amazing to put this natural compound onto a shirt so that when you sweat, the water in your sweat reacts with the xylitol in an endothermic reaction to make you feel cooler? 
This is exactly what we have done with the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt.
How does it work?
Infused in the fabric itself is xylitol, which absorbs heat from the wearer's skin in an endothermic reaction caused by the water in your very own sweat (Perspiractive™ technology). So the hotter and sweatier you get, the cooler your shirt feels.
**Caution about xylitol and dogs/cats
Each year, there are more than 200,000 cases of pet poisoning in the U.S., many of them caused by household substances that are perfectly harmless to you and I. But just because something is safe for people doesn't mean it won’t hurt our beloved pets. Some of the most dangerous dog/cat poisons are foods and medications we take on a daily basis like supplements, mouthwash, tooth paste, gum, chocolate, and peanut butter.  Xylitol is one of those items that is perfectly safe for humans but that can be very poisonous for dogs and cats.  Consumption of xylitol by dogs and cats can result in undesired symptoms ranging from mild hypoglycemia to liver failure and death. Many large companies that sell millions of shirts a year use xylitol in their apparel as a cooling agent. And although I am not aware of a single case in which apparel containing xylitol has sickened a dog or cat, be sure to be mindful that this shirt contains xylitol as a cooling agent. For your information, the most comprehensive list I've ever seen on items containing xylitol can be seen here (https://info.peeva.co/blog/products-that-contai...). I' have also applied to put my product and company on this list. Pets give us so much, especially during this pandemic. Please keep them safe.
Revolutionary smart-release micro-vesicle delivery system.
The real technology of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt comes from multi-layered micro-vesicles (microscopic sized balls containing multiple oil and water phases) that are able to sense the level of moisture from the body based on the environment, and act accordingly to cool you.  

Micro-vesicles have an oil phase containing ""water-hating"" molecules like squalane, and a water phase with water loving molecules like the cooling xylitol. 
 When the fabric is dried and is made into garments this water layer becomes dehydrated and the xylitol is inactive. 

However, when the wearer starts to sweat the water layers rehydrate and then the  xylitol dissolves and is released and the cooling reaction begins. The cooling sensation occurs only where the sweat or moisture is. After some time, the wearer will start to cool down and should stop sweating. As the garment dries out, the reaction stops and goes back to the dehydrated state again.
This process can be seen in the movie below.




 

 

 

 
Sweat-activated Perspiractive™ fabric with real endothermic cooling
The thermographs below show a clear difference in shirt temperature before and after hard exercise where xylitol is present, when the water in the wearer's sweat reacts with the xylitol  in a cooling endothermic reaction.

Removal of the shirt after hard exercise also shows that the cooling is not just limited to the shirt fabric, the body is cooler as well.
To measure the amount of cooling generated by the micro-vesicle technology, the temperature of the fabric was measured after adding water. The results shown in the graph indicate that the initial temperature was as much as 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) lower than untreated fabric before washing.  

Due to the slow-release properties of this technology, the cooling effect was retained; the xylitol decreased the temperature of the fabric by 3.5 degrees C (6.3 degrees F) even after 50 washes. 
Cooling regardless of external conditions
Because the surrounding heat is consumed in the endothermic reaction, the feeling of the fabric against the skin is cool, regardless of whether or not there is any outside wind. So you even get cooling under conditions in which evaporative cooling shirts don’t work, such as high humidity, indoors, or when there is little wind.
Xylitol--a truly amazing natural compound
In addition to its cooling effect, Xylitol has numerous other beneficial effects which have been shown in the scientific literature, including:
Functions as a natural antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral.
Has high moisture retention
Stimulates the production of collagen to counter the effects of aging
Increases bone volume and bone mineral content, protecting against osteoporosis
And its completely non-toxic and safe. Not only has it been consumed by humans for the last 50 years in fruits, chewing gum, candies, mints, and oral care products, it is also used to treat middle ear infections in young children.
Skin protective function
Additional components in the micro-vesicles shown earlier include squalane, a hydrogenated form of a moisturizer produced naturally by your own skin cells in the skin lipid layer but that declines with normal aging. It is commonly extracted from plants such as olives.

Squalane reduces inflammation and keeps the skin hydrated and fresh. Boosting hydration can help your skin appear more vibrant and healthier, while its antioxidant effect also decrease skin damage and free radicals which can accelerate the aging process. Regular use can also boost collagen production, resulting in firmer skin.
And Silk Protein, a natural protein obtained from natural silk noils (fibers, fibroin) from the cocoon of the silk worm. This produces excellent moisture binding properties & a silky smooth feel.

Cool Human® perspiractive™ fabric: Comfort through moisture retention and release
Just as with the control of ""smart"" cooling based on the environment, the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt offers ""smart"" moisture management via these same micro-vesicles. 
Moisture retention when its dry
In a dry environment, the water phase is dehydrated. As moisture is released from the skin in the form of sweat, the micro-vesicle absorbs it and becomes rehydrated. The increased humidity of the garment allows for increased comfort. 

When humidity between the skin and the fabric increases to excess due to exercise or sweating, the micelle structure becomes saturated. Because the outermost layer of the micelle is hydrophobic (water-hating), it repels the excess moisture and pushes it out of the fabric.

FABRIC PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY 
Impressive as it is, the finishing technology of the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt that gives the shirt its amazing cooling and moisture management properties is only half the story. The fabric production technology is just as important. 
TACTEL® 
The Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt  is made with TACTEL®, also known as the ""cotton alternative."" 

”TACTEL® garments are softer and lighter than most other fabrics and feel very comfortable next to the skin. In fact, the name TACTEL® is derived from “tacto,” which is Latin for “touch.""  
 
TACTEL® is absorbed much more quickly than cotton and spreads out over the fabric much more, which allows for the faster drying. In fact, TACTEL® dries 8 times faster than cotton. TACTEL® is also three times stronger than natural fabrics such as cotton. This ensures enhanced durability and comfort that exceeds natural materials. The Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt offers 4-way stretch to ensure ease of motion. Due to the extreme stretchiness of the fabric, for freedom of body movement, the Cool Human® Endothermic Cooling Shirt can be worn loose or tight one size down based on the preference of the wearer. Super-high 50 gauge weaveGauge is simply the number of needles per unit of length.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Voice activated technology is growing more and more everyday but often times it's not easily accessible unless you happen to be near a device capable of it.  Something as simple as answering a phone can be difficult if your hands are full.  In addition, wearing earbuds all the time is not ideal for most people since they block your hearing and don't always look fashionable.  For our first product, we have created convenience and accessibility to voice services anytime you need while also keeping your arms, ears and hands free. </p>

</div></div>","Aloha! A pair of plant-based sneakers designed explicitly for a sockless and eco-conscious lifestyle.  Thanks to TREE fiber, the natural properties of quick drying, breathable, and odor resistant are able to perform on LONOs and translate directly to our feet.Simplify your life! The perfect pair for going to yoga, ball games, training, hikes and more. If the gyms and studios are closed, simply slip into these comfortable sockless sneakers and begin your home workout. Get in and get moving!
 
You can also take it easy with these comfortable sockless shoes. Walk the dogs, run some errands, take a stroll, relax, and enjoy. 


TREE FIBER dries 3x faster than merino wool in the same conditions, making it the ultimate material to fight against sweat. As a matter of fact, we've been making shoes all wrong with polyester. It's like putting your feet in plastic bags - no wonder they stink!

The same goes for water-proof sneakers, they are chemical coating and plastic membrane that suffocate your feet. Whereas LONO is determined in keeping things natural. The key feature of anti-bacterial power from tree fiber prevents foul smell after drying.  So get wet, get dry, and get going!

    
LONO is determined in making the transition from man-made material to organic, biodegradable materials. Our goal is to reduce waste and pollution while translating sustainable resources into shoes with remarkable functionality.

 
The use of animal by-products such as wool and leather is a big NO-NO for LONO.
 


Our amazing TREE fiber is produced from tree bark originating in a sustainably managed forest certified by the FSC. The non-toxic solvent used in the process has a remarkable 99% recovery rate, keeping the cycle self-sustainable. 


Why would you want to step in a crude oil puddle, the main ingredient in regular EVA insoles? Here we replace it with a cleaner and greener choice of plant-based oil without sacrificing support and comfort, which Castorfoam provides.

Poppin' and bouncin' with our Popcorn sole, in partnership with BLOOM USA to create a performance foam out of algae as a replacement for plastic and petrochemical based recipe.

We work with Tree-Nation, who've been planting trees since 2006—over 5 million trees! The ultimate goal is to fight and raise awareness of climate change. For every pair of LONO you back, a tree will be planted with growth updates.

Use the orbs to track your activities in all three domains simultaneously.</i></p><p>This pattern is quite a challenge, but very rewarding. DayDisc’s orbs can stack in the same slot, so don’t worry if your goals overlap – this can create some pretty cool shapes and dynamics!</p><p><strong>Reminder Orb: </strong></p><p><i>Pick an Orb to live on your fridge, or desk lamp, or somewhere handy and visible. It will remind you of your daily goal whenever you see it.</i></p><p>Bonus: you can also use it to remind yourself of meetings, appointments, or deadlines, by pre-positioning in the appropriate groove, eg. 4pm = groove 4.

Well, it's what you get when you cross an antique Yugoslavian clockmaker’s tool, the irresistible attraction of magnetism and a holistic worldview.  They promised us The Cloud, and we got fog. Quantify yourselves, they said, then they sold our data. Instead of progress, we got crapification. Instead of liberation, we got surveillance.Our devices used to be clever, not 'smart', and our tools used to be physical objects, not applications. And things were made to last. Were we more human then?Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the inescapability of the digital world? Or stupefied by a constant barrage of (mostly useless) information? If too much modern tech is messing with your mind and bothering your balance, we developed DayDisc for you.   We have ventured into forgotten realms of the past on an archaeological and philosophical journey. We wanted to rediscover how our ancestors were so capable before screens, wifi, and AI.  And we've brought something useful back to the future:  DayDisc is the fruit of our labour - a necklace that’s also a new kind of activity tracker.It’s radically simple, and amazingly effective. It tracks only what really matters to you, using simple and timeless analogue technology.Hidden magnets firmly hold the tracking orbs which you manually move around the disc to keep track of your completed activities.The DayDisc Challenge is simple, achievable and rewarding: just take 12 opportunities to work toward your goals, every day. By counting only what truly counts, it keeps you focused and clearly shows your investment in yourself, rapidly helping you form the habits that boost your wellbeing.Don’t take our word for it. We’ve shared DayDiscs with a small group of trailblazers, scattered around the planet, and they've shared their experiences:   It's time for the analogue tech revival! DayDisc is already changing lives, and it changed ours, and we're pretty sure it can change yours too.So, if being an early-adopter in a grassroots global eco-wellness movement sounds exciting, please consider making a pledge to our campaign now.  What makes personal development so challenging?The concept of self improvement is pretty straightforward. You already know the key steps to  successful change. Intent. Focus. Consistency. All that jazz.And in recent years, technology companies have developed all kinds of complicated gadgets - the 'Wearables', that were supposed to make it all easier.Only, they don’t. Why?  The trouble is that, far from aiding focus, these devices are specifically designed to distract. By manipulating the reward centres of our brain, they develop a stranglehold on your attention span. This creates a vicious cycle that makes it harder than ever to reach your goals. And by forcing us to adapt to how they work, they erode our autonomy and ingenuity.  Besides, giving a third party access to your most personal information in this way is a pretty big deal. Can you trust its accuracy? And can you trust the company not to sell it, or get hacked? Smart devices don’t last that long either. They’re part of a cycle of planned obsolescence, designed to be made redundant by a slicker, ‘smarter’ version after a year or two.After immersing ourselves in online reviews, it became clear that many users of digital activity trackers or ‘wearables’ have unsatisfying experiences with them.Surely there’s got to be a better way?  Of course there is! That’s why we’ve developed DayDisc.A special kind of tracker that focuses on what attracts you, not what distracts you.Using just the fundamental forces of magnetism and willpower, DayDisc converts your best intentions into impressive outcomes. Engage in a personal daily ritual with your DayDisc, and you’ll quickly develop the productive habits that you set your mind to. Designate specific, significant activities that will upgrade your lifestyle, as you might with a coach, and use your DayDisc to count and track them.   No software - you are the operating system. No battery - you are the power source.DayDisc is a striking, gender-fluid talisman specially engineered for self-development. Intuitive and reliable, it uses principles of design and of psychology to build up the positive feedback loops that lead to lasting change. By making it easy to begin and sustain new and improved patterns of behaviour, DayDisc ensures you invest time in yourself.Daydisc is grounded and ergonomic, positive not pushy. It motivates you to achieve your own personal daily revolution, with the action of moving the tracking orb around the dial with a magnetic 'click' giving you discreet multi-sensorial feedback on your progress.Every morning, set your intention to complete 12 repetitions of an action in one day. And DayDisc will keep you on track.  *there are no prescribed uses of DayDisc. The list of possible uses is only limited by the imagination. We look forward to hearing about the way people will use theirs.  How you use your time determines almost everything about you: your personality, the state of your health, your beliefs and opinions, skills and talents – you name it.We are always becoming what we can be. This means change is inevitable, let's make it for the better... So get started with DayDisc, and take charge of your change today.  Studies have shown that approximately 80% of New Year’s resolutions fail! So clearly, we need better ways to stay motivated - new approaches are needed for your journey towards achieving long-term goals and resolutions.First, it’s important to think a bit more carefully about your goal. To give yourself the best chance of success, goals should be:Simple but significantTrackable so you can monitor your progressRealistic and relevantTimebound so you can get regularBut getting feedback on your performance and progress is important too, as part of breaking your goals down into achievable chunks. There are loads of great books available on habit formation, but it always boils down to the habit loop:DayDisc is designed to help you close the loop and thrive.  There are loads of different ways you can use the magnetic tracking orbs that come with each DayDisc, but these three patterns have worked particularly well for us and our founding community of users:The Focus Orb: Use your favourite colour Orb to track the transformation of a single intention into a single habit. Pick one thing you want to do more often. Aim to complete 12 repetitions of that particular activity each day. Each time you manage it, move your orb to the next slot on your DayDisc.Congratulations! That’s one orbit. A simple, clear, effective way to begin and sustain positive change.Mind, Body, and Spirit Orbs: Choose three Orbs and assign them to different types of activities. For example, you could use one for something Mind related, one that’s Body focused, and another that’s Spirit centric. Use the orbs to track your activities in all three domains simultaneously.This pattern is quite a challenge, but very rewarding. DayDisc’s orbs can stack in the same slot, so don’t worry if your goals overlap – this can create some pretty cool shapes and dynamics!Reminder Orb: Pick an Orb to live on your fridge, or desk lamp, or somewhere handy and visible. It will remind you of your daily goal whenever you see it.Bonus: you can also use it to remind yourself of meetings, appointments, or deadlines, by pre-positioning in the appropriate groove, eg. 4pm = groove 4. (Use this in conjunction with another pattern)We’re also looking forward to hearing about patterns we haven’t discovered yet, so please experiment, have fun and let us know what you come up with in the comments!  Timeless construction. Timely functionality.We designed DayDisc to pay homage to the eternal values of beauty and usefulness. It represents the Sun, and abides by principles of Sacred Geometry. DayDisc’s proportions are determined by the Golden Ratio.  The radial design is due to DayDisc’s original archetype as a watchmaker’s tool. But rather than making clocks, this is a tool that creates time. The partitioning of the circle into twelve is an ancient method of segmenting time. Look at the Zodiac for example. Babylonian philosopher-priests used a base-12 counting system for a practical reason: it offers more whole fractions, making it easier to divide and subdivide.  This means that, with DayDisc’s twelve grooves, you can easily break down your progress throughout the day into sets and subsets. The circuit can be split into ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅙, giving you an easy, versatile way to plan and track your activities.  With DayDisc, your information isn’t uploaded anywhere. It stays where it’s needed most: with you. This makes it intrinsically stable, reliable, and sustainable. And with multiple orbs to play with, it’s also pretty versatile.  Each DayDisc comes with a commitment card.DayDisc is based on the polar opposite of planned obsolescence – something we like to call planned permanescence. Like the pyramids, or Stonehenge, or buried treasure. Planned permanescence makes for maximally sustainable objects.  “It has to work forever.”That was a key underlying principle in DayDisc’s development. You pledge once for DayDisc, and it lasts forever, delivering a lifetime of value and more. It doesn’t get much more sustainable than that.DayDiscs are guaranteed for the lifetime of your bloodline. Pretty much the only way to invalidate the warranty is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom.We would be honoured if you took your DayDisc to your grave, or considered it an heirloom object to be kept in the family. Just a quick occasional polish will always restore its full shine.  Wellness is huge now, and a growing market with lots of serious research in the field of behavioural studies and psychology to explain what makes us tick, and keeps us ticking healthily.We have gone deep into the literature during the design of DayDisc to make sure it follows proven psychological formats that will help you to improve your daily life and overall wellbeing.DayDisc’s Western influences include the science of behaviour modification, Skinner operant conditioning, Cognitive Behavioural Theory, and many coaching schemes.But many of us in the West are missing out on the benefits of a holistic worldview that understands the universe and ourselves as manifestations of a single subtle energetic being.A lot of healing and harmony can be found in becoming sensitive to our true nature. And the technological obsession of western culture often distances us from the simplicity of this truth.  DayDisc signifies a return to respect for the intrinsic properties of things. Circles are cyclic. Magnets are magnetic. Metals are strong. And we are active beings. These elements combine to create a vortex in the Aether which will empower your life.To find that missing piece, we looked back, and to the East.   “F***ing magnets, how do they work?” Miracles - Insane Clown PosseWho doesn't love magnets? A mysterious attractive force... And super useful, right?From the first compass 3000 years ago in China to the Large Hadron Collider, people love putting magnets to ingenious uses. But we had to check they were safe!Magnets are considered safe by the US National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and magnetic therapy devices are actually in rising demand due to the impressive results and benefits users have obtained.Neodymium magnets like ours have been shown to increase microcirculation, and are increasingly being used to treat chronic pain syndrome, arthritis, wound healing, insomnia, headaches, and several other illnesses.  The torus is the fundamental form of balanced energy flow.

<h3>About Us and Our Story</h3>
<p>Black &amp; Cremè is a re-education, sustainable, and eco-awareness boutique. People, land, and fibre are at the core of our boutique. We are here to align fashion back with the Earth. Black &amp; Cremè collaborates with small businesses, designers, and manufacturers who have taken steps toward aligning with the people, land, and fibre. Black &amp; Cremè represents the connection to the Motherland Africa, the soil, people all over the Earth with different complexions, the texture of fabrics, the colors of cloth, and the Melanin that flows through our Soul. Our eco-fashion, vegan bags, and sustainable accessories are a combination of neutral, trendy, chic, sexy, classy, and glamorous styles. Our items are timeless that will leave your closet and jewelry box with memories that last a lifetime. Each item you see on our boutique has been sourced and curated consciously with love.</p>
<p>Black &amp; Creme was created from a desire to see scholarly research combined with sustainable fashion.  Our CEO noticed that there was not a space for Black-owned businesses to express their love that is connected to the people, land, and fibre. As a result, she used her PhD research, love for fashion, and her Spirituality to birth Black &amp; Creme.  It is a reminder that the fashion, bags, shoes, and jewelry we wear are interconnected to everything on Earth and the Cosmos.</p>

<h4>Growing roses out of concrete</h4><div>The Made in Goma Project by DRC ApeParel (<a href=""http://www.drcapeparel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.DRCApeParel.com</a>) aims to foster the passion for creative entrepreneurship in apparel production by educating youth at the Yole!Africa (<a href=""http://www.yoleafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.YoleAfrica.org</a>) community center on the skills needed to start-up and run a sustainable screen printing production business. An emphasis will be focused on collaborating and building strategic partnerships in the local community as well as abroad with other visual artists, seamstresses, accessory and apparel designers, to produce a lifestyle business model around products that will be ""Made in Goma.""<br/>
</div><div>
<span>Goma, located in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is currently a city affected by one the deadliest conflicts since World War II, with over 6 million dead and millions more people forcefully displaced. In this context, civil services (including schools) are often shut down, leaving young people without education, and with few choices. Yole!Africa, a cultural center founded by acclaimed Congolese filmmaker and activist Petna Ndaliko and located in Goma, DRCongo provides youth the space, skills, and alternative education necessary to thrive despite the conflict in the region. </span><br/>
</div><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430767896/ts4gpi7frguclbbsrxzd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are not doing anything new, just doing what we feel is right. The youth, whom we like to call the ""Divine Righteous Children"" or ""DRChildren"" are the motivation behind everything we do at DRC ApeParel. The DRChildren are the future and the future is happening now. Together, you, us, the DRChildren and our strategic partners can cultivate even more beautiful roses coming out of a worn-torn concrete of east part of DRCongo. </span><br/></p><p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">The project, a multi-stop international tour, will teach local Goma youth the art of screen printing, create an apparel production collaboration with local Goma artisans and result in a full-length documentary capturing the project’s year-long development, where the youth-made and local-artisan collaboration products will be marketed and sold. The tour will also serve the purpose of being the marketing and branding engine to spread the word far and wide of the products being ""Made in Goma"", to create a demand and ensure the sustainability of the project. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430768821/ebk8pwdp4m6rvpou8wla.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>With your extra-extra support, after reaching our initial goal of equipping a professional compact screen print studio at Yole!Africa, we will unlock our stretch goals, which will allow us to implement the full scale business model that which will put project on a great position to be able to sustain itself in Goma for years to come.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The opportunities are wide open for you to be involved in making this happen with us. Your contribution to this project both financially and with your heart, believing in our mission and purpose, will give us the tools we need to make this a reality.

<h4>A Creative Director with a creative vision</h4>
<p>For two decades filmmaker, creative director and first generation Congolese-American, Eric Ndelo has made it his life’s mission to spread international awareness of the Beauty and the Crisis in the Congo.</p>

<h3>Thank You</h3>
<h4>Our work is made possible thanks to you</h4>Thank you for taking the time to learn about our Made In Goma Project, Indiegogo campaign. When you give to this campaign, you become a part of our collective network. We need your voice. We must stand together to carry out this mission of a sustainable economic environment for Goma. Congo Strong! Global Citizens Unite!</div>","The Cause
Growing roses out of concreteThe Made in Goma Project by DRC ApeParel (www.DRCApeParel.com) aims to foster the passion for creative entrepreneurship in apparel production by educating youth at the Yole!Africa (www.YoleAfrica.org) community center on the skills needed to start-up and run a sustainable screen printing production business. An emphasis will be focused on collaborating and building strategic partnerships in the local community as well as abroad with other visual artists, seamstresses, accessory and apparel designers, to produce a lifestyle business model around products that will be ""Made in Goma.""

Goma, located in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is currently a city affected by one the deadliest conflicts since World War II, with over 6 million dead and millions more people forcefully displaced. In this context, civil services (including schools) are often shut down, leaving young people without education, and with few choices. Yole!Africa, a cultural center founded by acclaimed Congolese filmmaker and activist Petna Ndaliko and located in Goma, DRCongo provides youth the space, skills, and alternative education necessary to thrive despite the conflict in the region. 
We are not doing anything new, just doing what we feel is right. The youth, whom we like to call the ""Divine Righteous Children"" or ""DRChildren"" are the motivation behind everything we do at DRC ApeParel. The DRChildren are the future and the future is happening now. Together, you, us, the DRChildren and our strategic partners can cultivate even more beautiful roses coming out of a worn-torn concrete of east part of DRCongo. The project, a multi-stop international tour, will teach local Goma youth the art of screen printing, create an apparel production collaboration with local Goma artisans and result in a full-length documentary capturing the project’s year-long development, where the youth-made and local-artisan collaboration products will be marketed and sold. The tour will also serve the purpose of being the marketing and branding engine to spread the word far and wide of the products being ""Made in Goma"", to create a demand and ensure the sustainability of the project. 
With your extra-extra support, after reaching our initial goal of equipping a professional compact screen print studio at Yole!Africa, we will unlock our stretch goals, which will allow us to implement the full scale business model that which will put project on a great position to be able to sustain itself in Goma for years to come.The opportunities are wide open for you to be involved in making this happen with us. Your contribution to this project both financially and with your heart, believing in our mission and purpose, will give us the tools we need to make this a reality. Jump on board and be a part of the dopeness that's being ""Made in Goma"". Global Citizens Unite!The Story 
A Creative Director with a creative vision
For two decades filmmaker, creative director and first generation Congolese-American, Eric Ndelo has made it his life’s mission to spread international awareness of the Beauty and the Crisis in the Congo.
After seeing apparel design as a more practical and efficient outlet for bringing his native culture to the forefront, Ndelo put filmmaking aside and started DRC ApeParel, Ltd. (www.DRCApeParel.com), an African streetwear and lifestyle brand, born in the U.S.A. and inspired by the love, art, and heritage of the Congo and the African Diaspora.
Now, Ndelo is returning to his filmmaking roots as DRC ApeParel travels throughout the US and abroad, capturing the global streetwear lifestyle and his company’s year-long effort to establish itself in the Congo as a resource partner for entrepreneurial growth amongst the youth and artisans. With Yole!Africa celebrating its 15 year anniversary this year, the organization has set the foundation and paved a way for the youth to alternatively and creatively reshape their future. This ground work has tilled the soil in Goma, making it easier for us at DRC ApeParel to plant our roots and be a part of Yole's growing movement of empowering the youth, by contributing our passion for entrepreneurship, apparel production and international cross-cultural exchange.This July, Ndelo and associates will travel to Goma, DRCongo for YOLE!AFRICA's 10th Annual Salaam Kivu International Film Festival (SKIFF) (www.salaamkivu.org) where he, for the second time, will lead a screen printing workshop, along with some of the outstanding youth that excelled in the previous year's workshop. We will teach additional skills this year by enhancing the curriculum to include: artwork design, color separation, film output, screen making, entrepreneurship, collaboration, marketing and branding.

I really liked this idea and I decided to bring it to life! I think many of us find this idea very useful, because not everyone has the  money for a plastic surgery. But who needs them anymore? With this bra you will look your best without any effort and it's very easy to use and comfortable!!

   How it works?


The structure is made of stainless steel and adapted to every curve of your body! Bra can be filled for those who have small breasts and no filled for those who just want to emphasize the shape of the breasts! The internal coating consists of a thin layer of silicone that will support your breasts! As you can see it's pretty simle! And you will be gorgeous in any attire!
Look at this photo!

    What we asking about?
Money is needed for the of a place to work,tenancy and equipment.
At the moment we are working on developing an online store for users who want to by them online!

<h3><b><u>Who are we?</u></b></h3>
<p>WatchForChange was founded by a group of friends wanting to collaborate in our skills and talents. Having found entrepreneurial success in the past, we knew we could focus our efforts to build great businesses — but questioned how meaningful our success would be if we were the only ones impacted. We knew we could do more with our passions. Together, we decided to rally around causes that we cared about, so we can help to make a real difference to those who need it most.</p>
<p>So, a year ago, we connected around an idea to design a stylish watch that we’d feel proud to wear — and could become a symbol that brings people closer together by creating positive change in the world. </p>

<p>We believe that fashion should be affordable to everyone. We
believe everyone should be able to wear quality product without paying a
premium price. We were frustrated by the traditional retail model, which is
dominated by mass-manufacturer and high end brand who charge a premium price,
as most of this brands artificially inflate prices and invest heavily in
marketing to create an illusion of high quality. At the end of the day, what
you are paying for is the label and not the product itself. Given our desire to
want the finest quality we are under the impression that we get what we pay
for. This is the illusion that the fashion industry has created. We started
TAILOR CRAFT CLOTHING to provide high quality apparel directly to consumers at
wholesale prices thru our website. Since there is no middle man all our
products are shipped directly to our customers at wholesale price.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1222794/files/20150215035130-itag_direc.jpg?1424001090"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our great team have people with backgrounds in fashion
