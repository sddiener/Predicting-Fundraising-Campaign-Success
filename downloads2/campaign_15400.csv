<h3>Thanks for visiting my page! Read more to find out what this page is all about.</h3>
<p>My name is Lilyana. I'm a seven-year-old artist that is passionate about a school I visited not too long ago. The challenge? The school costs money and my parents can't afford it right now, so we've created a page to help me raise money to attend this alternative-based learning art school. </p>
<p>The school is named <i>Cascadia</i> .</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>After I visited Cascadia, I suddenly became the most excited about school than I've ever been. It just feels like the right place for me. My parents understand my personality, my creative nature, and are willing to help me get there...to Cascadia!</span></p>
<p>I don't learn in a strict and structured environment. Creativity is my gift, and I want to nurture that, and this school will help me in that pursuit. </p>
<p>My favorite things to do in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw</li>
<li>Paint</li>
<li>Create Characters with Clay</li>
<li>Sing</li>
<li>Dance</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you contribute to this campaign, a few of the options are me gifting you one of my drawings, which I think you'll love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, my parent's can't afford this school. That's the challenge that I want to help them overcome with this campaign. Cascadia will cost $10,000. It will be a little more with fees, but if we can get $10,000, then we'll be super happy and able to pay the tuition costs.</p>
<p>We'll be bringing a lot of perks, too! Perks from me. Perks from my mom's home business. And perks from my dad's home business. This is another way for my parents and I to give back to you and the community. You'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art from Me (it's cool art, too)</li>
<li>Signed copies of my dad's books or your name in a future book (my dad's a Science Fiction author)</li>
<li>Essential Oil Care Package from my mom (my mom's an essential oil educator with doTERRA)</li>
<li>A personal numerology reading from my parents (they do that on the side, too)</li>
<li>Or all of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>All the money we receive will go directly to my (Lilyana's) education.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>You can share this page too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your intention and support matters. Thank you so much.</p>

<p>In June 2017, Luis Caracinha begun a creative process for a Live Act that was presented in September that year in Festival F, a music festival in the Portuguese town of Faro. For this concept, the creative/composer was inspired by the expansion of the Universe to create a plot that introduce the audience to a fictional character lost in the void, a meteor. This sets the parallelism with the Universe and the humankind that, gradually expands, moving further away from everything. During 7 acts, 7 themes, the viewer is driven in a travel that starts in a permanent isolated state. After crossing with other celestial body, our main character ir forced to change its path and pushed to dive into this ""new thing"". On a way to collide with this giant, ""Dissolve or collide?"" is the question that prevail and the question that invite us to unveil the end. </p>
<p>Although the main medium of expression on this project is marked by the musicality from the band members, this is a conceptual project, that works in a collaborative way, with people from different backgrounds. You can find musicians, designers, photographers, filmmakers, technicians and software engineers on this project - like the amount of combining elements in the Universe - turning it more complex and refined. Musically, the band members come from different backgrounds giving other meanings and textures to the work of the composer. That's why they create this amazing symbiosis of styles that you can hear on Riding a Meteor music.</p>
<p>Our team has been producing a documentary leading by Luís Luz (Director) that will explain the concept, the creative process and the story of the band on their first year and an half - September 2017 to March 2019. This documentary has a script and storyboard that intent to live record a concert on an iconic location related to this concept.

<p>We would like to record this concert in the region of Meteora (Greece) and somehow catch the spirit of the mythical concert ""Pink Floyd live at Pompei"" witch is a great reference for us and for those who like this musical environment.</p>
<p><strong>In order to do so, we need to take the group, the instruments and the production team to Greece for one week between May and July 2019.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Riding a Meteor is an extraordinary metaphor about human life and the band has now reached to a point where it yearns to ""dissolve or collide"" with new audiences.

O festivalu
Nekoliko mjeseci nakon opsade počele su pripreme međunarodnog muzičkog festivala a već u ljeto 1997. godine, prvi Jazz Fest se desio Sarajevu. Dvije decenije kasnije, Jazz Fest Sarajevo je najstariji muzički festival u Bosni i Hercegovini i po općoj ocjeni jedan od najznačajnijih međunarodnih kulturnih događaja u zemlji. Već godinama postavlja standarde kada su u pitanju produkcija i program.

Iako u svom nazivu ima odrednicu jazz, Jazz Fest Sarajevo promovira različite muzike bez obzira na žanr, porijeklo ili socijalni background; promovira ideju različitog i drugačijeg, ideju muzike neovisno o žanru kojem pripada.

Jazz Fest Sarajevo je jedna od nekolicine kulturnih organizacija u Bosni i Hercegovini koje su uspjele sačuvati političku nezavisnost i ne biti platformom za političku promociju.
Tri najteže godine za Jazz Fest Sarajevo počinju u decembru 2015. godine zahvaljujući politički motiviranim odlukama i retroaktivnom ukidanju sredstava, nakon uspješno održanog 19. izdanja festivala. Od tada se suočavamo sa poteškoćama koje ozbiljno prijete budućnosti festivala, ali odlučujemo napraviti 20., 21. i 22. festival.
Posljednja tri festivala u imenu imaju XX – dvije nepoznanice predstavljaju nepoznanicu kada je u pitanju finansiranje i nepoznanicu kada su u pitanju prostori u kojima će se festival održavati, s obzirom na ozbiljan infrastrukturni problem u Bosni i Hercegovini – u Sarajevu u proteklih 25 godina nije napravljen niti jedan prostor za muziku a prostori pogodni za koncertne sadržaje u pravilu su dati na upravljanje nedovoljno stručnim licima.

Nakon 22 godine rada, više ne računamo na političare koji su uzrokovali ovakvu situaciju da stvari učine boljim, ali možemo računati na sebe i na našu publiku, muzičare i ljude koji vjeruju u moć dobre muzike naspram moći loše politike. Zato, trebamo vašu pomoć.
Pred nama su brojna izdanja festivala i brojni koncerti koje tek treba realizirati, ali nemamo puno vremena, podržite nas u našoj akciji, jer samo zajedno možemo napraviti 23. Jazz Fest. Svaka pomoć pa i ona najmanja veliki je korak na putu ka našem konačnom cilju.


Jazz Fest Sarajevo šest godina je organizirao regionalni edukativni program Music Meeting kroz koji je prošlo više od 300 mladih muzičara iz Bosne i Hercegovine, Slovenije, Hrvatske, Srbije, Makedonije i Crne Gore.

We want to grow this festival organically into <strong>the most talked-about horror event of the year</strong> and the only way to do that is with happy delegates and backers.</p><p>The first money we get in will go towards fulfilling our perks. If, for some reason, we can't fulfil any of your perks (and barring war or natural disasters we can't see how that could happen), we'll refund you IN FULL for the missing perk - guaranteed.</p><p>The next tranche of funding will go towards buying (in conjunction with Sighisoara Council) a <strong>full-sized cinema screen</strong>.

In return we're giving you the chance to pick up some amazing once-in-a-deathtime rewards!Over the past two years we’ve shown around 150 new vampire films; showcased dozens of vampire novels and short stories; held scores of talks from respected researchers of the vampire genre and history as part of the Vampire Academic Conference; gone on loads of fascinating trips to Dracula’s fortresses across the region; held dozens of vampire-themed parties and given all festival delegates a bloody fangtastic time! Dare to join us?In 2018, we aim to make the festival even bigger and even better – but we can’t do it without your support. We’re looking to raise £6,666 through crowdfunding to make this already legendary festival in a bucket-list location (now featured in the Lonely Planet's Culture Trails) into the most talked-about horror event of the year. We want to be able to bring the biggest stars of the vampire genre - from actors to authors to bands - to the festival to share their love of the the fanged fiends; we want the best facilities for showing our amazing films, including VR-headsets for 360 screenings in the spooky gothic graveyard…; we want to put on the most spectacular vampire-themed parties you’ve ever seen (silent disco in the mist-shrouded main square as the bells strike midnight, anyone?).We also want to feature vampire art, including exhibitions of film and book poster art and original pieces and introduce vampire games into the festival, from board games to table top RPGs to live RPGs to video games.A Bucket List Location for a Trip of a Deathtime!
The medieval citadel of Sighisoara - the birthplace of the real Vlad Dracula - is truly something darkly magical; it's everything you've ever imagined Transylvania to be. Not only that, it's got loads of great hotels, bars, nightclubs and restaurants with truly excellent food, beer and wine (and homemade chocolate...) and they're amazing value for money.We're deep in the land of Dracula and we're putting on a range of tours to Vlad's fortresses in the region, including the terrifying Bran Castle, the lair of Bram Stoker's vampire count (garlic and holy water are provided).Getting to the festival is easy, with international airports in Bucharest, Sibiu or Cluj. We'll even pick you up from Bucharest and give you a VIP guided vamp-tour all the way to your luxury hotel in Sighisoara, stopping at Dracula's (empty) grave at Snagov Monastery, the stunning Peles Castle and Vlad's main HQ in Brasov on the way.
    ProgrammeThis is not just a film festival, although great new (and classic) vampire films are at the heart of it.We also have the amazing and fascinating Vampire Academic Conference running across the festival, featuring talks from the best minds in horror, gothic studies and folklore from across the world. The VAC is curated by double Bram Stoker Award-Winning author and poet Mike Arnzen (check out his book 'Grave Markings'), and author of the Jane True vampire series, Nicole Peeler, both from Seton Hill University (USA), along with Edinburgh Napier University (UK). This year's theme has a touch of Buffy about it: 'From Carmilla to Drusilla: Vampires Across Popular Culture'. The Keynote speaker will be New York Times bestselling author of Buffy The Vampire Slayer (not to mention his many other vampire novels, including the stunning Shadow Saga), Christopher Golden.Christopher will also be contributing to the 'Stories From the Grave' literary strand, curated by the author of the 'Blood Omen' saga, Katie Ruth Davies. They'll be joined by fellow NYT bestselling writer Tim Lebbon who's written one of the best novelisations you'll read in '30 Days of Night'. He's currently got one of his most nerve-shredding novels - 'The Silence' - in production as a major movie. And then there's British Fantasy Award nominated author Rio Youers. The novel 'Everdead' is just one of his many vampire works while his latest, 'Forgotten Girl' was inspired by the idea of a vampire who feeds on memories rather than blood...We're also very proud to announce the screening of the truly terrifying new movie 'Crucible of the Vampire', starring Neil Morrissey, Katie Goldfinch and Florence Cady. It's a Gothic vampire thriller which draws influences from classic British horror from the 1950’s and 1960's alongside modern Korean and Japanese psychological horror. You can watch the trailer here.We'll also be screening dozens of short films and features in our atmospheric cinema in the catacombs beneath the ancient citadel. These will be announced soon.There will also be opportunities to go on vampire-themed tours of Transylvania and lots and lots of parties, including the famous Vampire Ball. We're also putting together an awesome line-up for some live (or rather undead) gigs as part of the 'Children of the Night' music strand. And, of course, anyone contributing to the crowdfunding campaign will get an invite to the Vampfest Stakeholder's Party as our thank you for getting involved.Our Exclusive Vampfest PerksThere are loads of great vampire-themed perks to be had for those brave enough to get them. They include some that are true bucket-list opportunities, such as sleeping in a luxury coffin in one of the catacombs under Dracula's hometown or partying through the night at Dracula's castle. You can't just rock up to Romania and do this yourself. The castle is closed after dark to the public - but they're opening it to a limited number of delegates from Vampfest.If you can't get to Transylvania this year, don't despair - there are many perks you can get sent to your home, including the Vampfest Stakeholder T-shirt range. Visit anywhere in Romania and you'll be able to buy a Dracula-themed T-shirt - but not like ours. We boast a range of completely original designs coupled with some of the most enduring vampire quotes from popular culture - and you can only get them by being a Vampfest Stakeholder.Where will the money go..?We should first tell you where the money will NOT go - into our pockets. Everything we make on this crowdfunding campaign will be put back into Vampfest. Our approach from day one of this festival was to guarantee everyone who attends the most awesome time. We feel we've done that over the first two years and we're going to make sure of that again this year. We want to grow this festival organically into the most talked-about horror event of the year and the only way to do that is with happy delegates and backers.The first money we get in will go towards fulfilling our perks. If, for some reason, we can't fulfil any of your perks (and barring war or natural disasters we can't see how that could happen), we'll refund you IN FULL for the missing perk - guaranteed.The next tranche of funding will go towards buying (in conjunction with Sighisoara Council) a full-sized cinema screen. Not only will this make a massive difference to our festival films, it will also give the people of Sighisoara their first full-sized cinema screen to use throughout the year (we should say here that a vitally important part of our approach is to ensure that local people and businesses benefit directly from Vampfest - our festival is not one that will suck the lifeblood from local legends and reap all of the benefits in another country).Phase three of the funding will go towards flying out a Hollywood A-list vampire actor. We can't name this actor yet, but they've agreed to come for no fee. However, we're insisting on covering their expenses. Phase four will only come into play if we exceed our target. If so, we'll pay for some legendary rock bands to play the 'Children of the Night' strand of the festival (we have two bands lined up and ready to come), alongside the amazing dance troupe Microbis and their mesmerising and bloody stage show 'Damnatul'.And if we get onto phase five, we'll be asking YOU for suggestions of where to spend the money. Marketing? Mid-year pop-up one-day Vampfests in your country? Putting on our own live RPG in the deserted streets of the citadel after dark? Outdoor screenings of vampire classic movies? Vampwire - a zipwire from the graveyard into town? Adding a 'Stake & Garlic' vampire-themed food strand (anyone fancy a Vampie?)?

<p>""A child cannot become what he cannot see""</p>
<p>At MG Camps, we have worked for over 20 years with children and teens from different parts of our country. These children, for the most part, are kids that have enough. Enough for their families to be able to afford a private camp program or they are children whose parents or guardians work at companies where their benefits include a camp program. Either way, they are privileged, because most of them have the space where they can learn and nourish important values through fun activities and games. </p>
<p>This inspires and motivates us, because we are able to offer a possibility where we can help in the growth of the children who enjoy the camp experiences we deliver. This contribution  is different from what they receive at home, school, in their society or town. It helps their character develop, helps them form civic values and skills for coexistence. It also helps their creativity and ability to dream of a better reality, and gives them tools for life. </p>
<p>For a few years now, we have put into practice a program in one of our nearby communities, San Vicente, where we were able to give over 100 children one awesome day of camp every year. This is a rural community with few resources where there is a small school that is attended by children between 4 and 16 years old.  </p>
<p>Now we want to contribute and give more. We have the dream of expanding this experience to more underprivileged children around the country. This year we are aiming to reach 1,000 children to give them the opportunity of creating skills, and civic values and principles, through camp. Specifically, we will be working with communities around Caracas.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. With 15,000 USD we will be able to bring the camp experience and their benefits for these 1,000 children. For us this is a flexible goal, we will be working with less or more kids depending on how much we collect.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IS THE LIMINAL?</strong></h2>
<p><i>A space for artists to meet artists - Learn through play, critical thinking and sensitive making.</i></p>
<p>THE LIMINAL is a transversal venue for the arts: a space for learning through play, critical thinking and sensitive making, and residency for local, national and global artists to encounter.</p>
<p>We believe essential to devote all our emotions and compromise with opening up conversations and facilitating necessary actions upon the contemporary arts field. This is why, while creating together, we want to enhance new ways of approaching culture and paths for having it look back at us. We intend to do it by fostering and enforcing dynamics for freely exchanging ideas and desires among diverse creative bodies and minds—from scratch and from within: hoping for the new to sprout organically and with great resilience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT DOES THE LIMINAL OFFER?</strong></h2>
<p><u>All year round,</u></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Co-working and col.lab space</strong> for artists and individuals alike based in Valencia or passing through. The Liminal coworking area embraces not only visual artists but also designers, architects, writers and (we do hope!) a diverse and extensive etcetera. Instead of a regular coworking, we believe in and aim to build a place for genuine encounter, where conversation opens up and flows, leading to unexpected friendships and successful collaborations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Art education workshops in four different languages</strong>: Spanish, Valencian, English and French, for small groups of children and adults (6 to 8 students). We present four different formats: quarterly, monthly, weekend-intensive and project-based — according to your needs and expectations. Fully using our library, and implementing great illusion and the eagerness to enjoy our time together, we base our classes on carefully selected artists’ books and the most playful aspects of art-making for you to have a blast!</li>
<li>
<strong>Bookstore with a thoughtfully built selection of artists’ books</strong> and other experimental book forms, from independent publishing companies worldwide: Les Figues Press (Los Angeles: Teresa Carmody + Vanessa Place &amp; Kim Calder + Evan Kleekamp), Naranja Librería &amp; Editorial (Santiago de Chile: Sebastián Arancibia + Sebastián Barrante) and Candor Arts (Chicago: Matt Austin + Melanie Teresa Bohrer). Additionally, we plan to generate a yearly publication collecting and reflecting on the projects developed by our artists, students and invited professionals, which will be launched by The Liminal and (we are very fortunate!) edited and produced by Candor Arts.</li>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><strong>Artist-talks, seminars and symposiums</strong> from specialists in the cultural field, local and global: visual artists, literaries, curators, architects, designers and other essential actors of the creative world.</span></li>
<li><strong>Projection, meeting and conference-room rentals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>When it is best for you,</span></u></p>
<ul>

<h2><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>Hi, I'm María!</i> </strong>— I am an illustrator and visual communicator. Through my work I study strategies for building identities while traveling or living in other places, the same way the artists we’ll host here at THE LIMINAL will have a space where to explore new ways of thinking, making and relating to each other.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>Hi, I'm Pablo!</i> </strong>—<strong> </strong>I am a visual artist and poet. Through my work I delve into issues of intimacy, translation and communication, while I navigate spaces like THE LIMINAL: venues encompassing transformation and defined by the convergence of diverse individuals, places and times.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>And we are THE LIMINAL!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>WHY NOW?</b></h2>
<p>We met a couple years ago in Valencia and we realized that the city was already experiencing a great change after the economic crisis. We left in the darkest years and we can see and say that Valencia is now going through a sweeter moment of its history. We have been projecting THE LIMINAL since crossing paths back in 2016, where we already imagined a transversal space—a space where to offer what we learned in our university years, what we lived and learned abroad, and where we can create from within, while still growing and integrating new visions and methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>WHY ARE WE CROWDFUNDING WITH INDIEGOGO?</b></h2>
<p>We have recently rented a very special space that we are now refurbishing with much care and love. We have also reached professional agreements with several publishing houses worldwide that we introduce in our video (Los Angeles, Santiago de Chile and Chicago) as well as with visual artists and other cultural agents based in Valencia, who will offer mentoring to our resident artists and guests as well as other resources of management and production. <strong>However, we still need a big capital injection to finalize the refurbishment, build proper and durable installations, purchase suitable furniture and give ourselves the financial boost to keep promoting our activity until the project spreads enough to continue with our own means. Because all the above, we cannot imagine THE LIMINAL without your support!</strong></p>

WHAT IS THE LIMINAL?
A space for artists to meet artists - Learn through play, critical thinking and sensitive making.
THE LIMINAL is a transversal venue for the arts: a space for learning through play, critical thinking and sensitive making, and residency for local, national and global artists to encounter.
We believe essential to devote all our emotions and compromise with opening up conversations and facilitating necessary actions upon the contemporary arts field. This is why, while creating together, we want to enhance new ways of approaching culture and paths for having it look back at us. We intend to do it by fostering and enforcing dynamics for freely exchanging ideas and desires among diverse creative bodies and minds—from scratch and from within: hoping for the new to sprout organically and with great resilience.
 
WHAT DOES THE LIMINAL OFFER?
All year round,


Co-working and col.lab space for artists and individuals alike based in Valencia or passing through. The Liminal coworking area embraces not only visual artists but also designers, architects, writers and (we do hope!) a diverse and extensive etcetera. Instead of a regular coworking, we believe in and aim to build a place for genuine encounter, where conversation opens up and flows, leading to unexpected friendships and successful collaborations.

Art education workshops in four different languages: Spanish, Valencian, English and French, for small groups of children and adults (6 to 8 students). We present four different formats: quarterly, monthly, weekend-intensive and project-based — according to your needs and expectations. Fully using our library, and implementing great illusion and the eagerness to enjoy our time together, we base our classes on carefully selected artists’ books and the most playful aspects of art-making for you to have a blast!

Bookstore with a thoughtfully built selection of artists’ books and other experimental book forms, from independent publishing companies worldwide: Les Figues Press (Los Angeles: Teresa Carmody + Vanessa Place & Kim Calder + Evan Kleekamp), Naranja Librería & Editorial (Santiago de Chile: Sebastián Arancibia + Sebastián Barrante) and Candor Arts (Chicago: Matt Austin + Melanie Teresa Bohrer). Additionally, we plan to generate a yearly publication collecting and reflecting on the projects developed by our artists, students and invited professionals, which will be launched by The Liminal and (we are very fortunate!) edited and produced by Candor Arts.
Artist-talks, seminars and symposiums from specialists in the cultural field, local and global: visual artists, literaries, curators, architects, designers and other essential actors of the creative world.
Projection, meeting and conference-room rentals.

 
When it is best for you,


Artist-in-Residence program in Valencia dedicated to the full realization of a project (project-based): from 2 months to one year duration. We support the ideation and envisioning, and back you in the different production processes holding hands with Momentolux (Luciana Cesari + Fernando Cortiglia - wonderful creatives and individuals), a local visual laboratory located just a 10-min walk away from our headquarters, within the vibrant neighborhood of Russafa. Subsequently, we develop together and in collaboration with other cultural agents of the city: artists, curators, administrators, etc. the curatorship and exhibition of your work (welcoming all disciplines) in a cultural institution, which could be both in Valencia and in other national and worldwide cities, depending on the nature of the project itself.*

Reading residencies: once a year (October/November). 2-week to one month stays with full access to our library of carefully selected artists’ books and other unusual formats, and the best part: all the time for you to read what you wish with unlimited access to all our resources. Reading residencies are developed in collaboration with Candor Arts, publishing company based in Chicago run by our friends Matt Austin and Melanie Teresa Bohrer, founders of this beautiful initiative and hosts of the Spring Reading Residency. ¿Would you like to enjoy a reading exchange Chicago-Valencia?

You have numerous titles to chose from, World (Heavyweight Championships), a couple of Intercontinental Championships, TV championships, Women’s championships and company champions and even in recent years we’ve been introduced to an Universal title, US Championship, North American Championship, and several UK Championships. All stemming from the big companies, but yet I find myself slightly dissatisfied.The titles themselves are great ideas and the people who hold them are equally as great. But I notice, something is missing. All my years as a wrestling fan and seeing title after title defended. Whole continents! Whole Nations are represented through these titles whether its Japan, the US, or the UK.  Yet, I never feel represented in these titles. Sometimes I feel absent in these big title matches. I know for a fact I am not the only one either. Are we not a wrestling fans too? Shouldn't I feel apart of these “transactions” if you will? The answer is yes.So to help fix that our team created the, Pan African World Diaspora Wrestling Championship.Why because why not?As stated a portion of wrestling fans often don’t feel represented or included in titles stated before.For the Appreciation of Black wrestling and wrestlers.To show you WE are here too!Most importantly, For the culture!We would like to run a tournament for the title. So we are asking for a donation to help run the TOURNAMENT dedicated to the title and Black wrestling JULY 2019. We will NEED to rent a Ring, Venue, Sound Equipment, and Pay for the talent(Wrestlers, Refs, Ring Announcers). We've GUESSTIMATED $3,000 for it all not including possible licensing.",0.0,1,"2 Campaigns

The Impact

This is the fourth year of the conference and we know that it changes the lives our participants, staff, and volunteers.
Within my three years of attending the Formation Conference, along with helping to plan and work with the girls the past two years, it has had a tremendous impact on my morals. I was taught about my history, how to tell my stories and especially how to advocate for myself and other black and brown women. I always feel privileged to be apart of these groups of women helping young ladies and was grateful to get the opportunity to learn from these women while in high school. --Nia, Junior at North Carolina Central University
The Formation Conference allowed me to be a part of a community of strong black girls where I felt accepted for who I am. I felt loved and met a lot of people who uplifted me and some who I will stay friends with for a long time. There wasn’t any cattiness or cliques, I could talk to everyone and have a great time. --Nona, Junior in high school

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Cortina Jenelle Caldwell, and I am Founder &amp; Creative Director of <a href=""http://www.theadeproject.org/ittakesavillage"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Artists Designing Evolution (adé PROJECT)</strong></a>. Formed in 2018, and incubated over a lifetime - Artists Designing Evolution (adé PROJECT) is a grassroots cooperative comprised of a youth leadership team, a collective of contractors, an advisory council, and community organizations/institutions that come together to work cooperatively on projects, programs, and initiatives that have the flexibility to be responsive while leveraging an impact that will be long-term, and sustainable for the communities involved. Those working alongside adé PROJECT seek to transform the region through creative facilitation, entrepreneurship, service, storytelling, and/or training + education as a strategic response to the current conditions of gentrification, policing, violence, invisibility, and erasure in our communities. adé PROJECT ultimately seeks to achieve self-sufficiency, and build capacity for individuals and communities of color. </p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, adé PROJECT has served 119 youth; hired 35 artists of color; worked with 38 cooperators (i.e. universities, institutions, community groups); provided 25 creative facilitation sessions on racial equity, culture, education, cooperatives and community organizing; curated 11 panels; catalyzed and installed 4 public art projects; hosted 5 art exhibits; produced 13 major community events while supporting 58 events across the United States; and injected $99, 820 into the local (WNC) economy through grants, individual contributions, and project management contracts. In that time, <a href=""http://www.theadeproject.org/coops-kindred"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>we have earned the trust and recognition Government Alliance on Race &amp; Equity, Race Forward: Center for Social Innovation, National Guild for Community Arts Education, Alternate ROOTS, Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation,  and many others</strong></a>! We cannot stop now. What we have learned in this first year is that we have a product/service that is needed and wanted by our community, and that this is just the beginning. </p>
<p>We need YOUR help! As a grassroots cooperative, we believe in and know the power of the people, and would love to make this support a major part of our story and how we move forward. We are dreaming big, and imagining what it feel like to be fully support, as if money was no matter of our concern. As artists, we often have to envision a thing before we can bring it into life so we hope you will take the visionary stance with us and help us manifest our wildest dreams and continue to root down and sustain up!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We have created 8 levels of perks and depending on how much you're able to give, you will receive (branded, swaggalicious) things ranging from: signed throwback event poster, mug, throw pillows, <a href=""http://www.theadeproject.org/manifesto"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>adé PROJECT Manifesto poster</strong></a>, custom-made memorial nameplate to be installed at community center, VIP entry to gratitude gala in 2020, acknowledgement in podcast, print publication, film and/or product placement at community events, and much more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For all funds and support raised, we will invest across our five areas of core work, and take our prototype and impact with community to the next level. Our major goal is $500,000 to be FULLY funded, however, raising as little as $30,000 will still make an impact. If we should not reach our full goal, we will decide as a cooperative whether to invest in one area of core work, or to distribute funds evenly and scale up that way :: </p>
<p><strong>STORYTELLING</strong> | Reclaim the narrative and challenge the oppression of Black, brown, youth, women-identified, and LGBTQ voice by filming, printing, publishing, podcasting, and narrating our own stories to find healing through truth, and connection to culture. <strong>Fully funded at $50,000. </strong></p>
<p><strong>CREATIVE FACILITATION</strong> | Develop and sustain a pipeline for cultivating community facilitators to bring in the voices, perspectives, and experiences of the most marginalized into spaces where reform and reconciliation is needed and their whole selves can be welcomed. <strong>Fully funded at $30,000.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SERVICE</strong> | Investing in the future of our communities, and planet by prioritizing our relationship to land and youth through land-based projects, learning, training that can lead to alternative solutions for those facing barriers to food access, housing, and transportation, etc. The rural and/or urban site will serve as a campus for adé PROJECT, housing other cooperatives, hosting gatherings and community events, and housing maker spaces: visual arts, craft, media + print, culinary, and healing arts. <strong>Fully funded at $250,000.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ENTREPRENEURSHIP </strong>| Provide community-led trainings on business, entrepreneurship and professional development that center solidarity economy, equity and collective action. Fully <strong>funded at $95,000.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TRAINING + EDUCATION</strong> | Subsidize professional support services, consultation, and certifications that will allow artists, leaders, and communities of color to develop and sustain a strategic plan that will ultimately guide toward self-sufficiency, sustainability, and greater support. <strong>Fully funded at $75,000.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Presently I am most looking forward to the work of adé PROJECT continuing onward, and being fully funded and supported by our local, and global community, and more specifically your support would allow the organization to acquire a needed space/central locale for the youth programs, community events, trainings, resources, and cultural artifacts that have grown exponentially in the past year and become a part of the core fabric of the organizational culture of adé PROJECT. Ultimately, I hope and believe that we can continue to leverage resources to those who most need it; create jobs and economic opportunities for the greater collective; and continuing to experience the power and beauty of humanity by centering creative inquiry, artistic expression, and equity rooted in care and connection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest growth/opportunity/struggle in this area is that the work and change is both slow in the sense that it can only move at the speed of relationships, and trust. And change is also fast in the sense that it is pressing, and urgent. The true struggle lies in seeing what hasn’t been working in how we’ve been doing business, and set up our education system, and constructed our communities while knowing the alternative will take some time to form and grow. As a grassroots cooperative working with artists, facilitators, community leaders, students, educators, business owners + entrepreneurs and many other community groups we can really dig into our strengths and bring our best work and highest potential to the table as we work alongside others. Although giving is a risk, we hope that our local, regional and global impact allows you to take a chance on us!</p>

In fact one does not need much in order to live a happy and fulfilled life here in Africa and elsewhere.Omutukuvu is not only about the people here, the children and the purity of their souls. It is about humanity, self healing, self progress and the implementation of moral codes encouraging people to act selflessly by helping and serving others without expecting anything back in return. To act and think responsible for oneself and others.Where we are,  building and improving local infrastructure as well as living conditions can be a lifetime commitment and requires not just money but the willingness to sacrifice. The great advantage we see in this project is the close collaboration with the local leaders and members of the communities as they are able to identify the real needs of the people so that funds will be used more genuinely to benefit those who are in need.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Send Lifted to Japan</h3>
<p>Only 3% of the less than 1% Christian population that exists in Japan utilizes creative media as a means to share the gospel and draw people to their churches. Why is this so in a media driven and technology advancing country? Many churches are understaffed and are getting older. Pastors don't have enough resources and time to invest in any type of intentional branding or marketing campaigns. The best message ever told (the gospel) and the greatest product ever offered (salvation in Jesus Christ) is becoming increasingly irrelevant and forgotten to a younger generation. That’s where we come in.</p>

<p>Hi! We’re Lifted Creative Studio, a growing network of like-minded creatives based in Honolulu, Hawaii that provides a centralized solution for brands and organizations as an independent studio. We’re partnering with Japan Mission, an amazing interdenominational organization that has been “Called to Serve” many of Japan’s 7,800 churches; most of which have attendance of fewer than 30 people. Because congregations are small, pastors are in need of assistance with literature, audio-visual materials and evangelistic programs.</p>

<p>We’re passionate about creativity and its ability to bring people together as well as contribute towards a larger cultural good. The most effective media is media that actually connect people and connects with people. We have our sights set on Japan to begin a work that hasn’t been done before. We want to share the value of creative media done this way to churches in Kansai over the course of two weeks in June to help them grow and reach a wider audience in intentional and meaningful ways.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi! I’m Andrew Reinhard. You might know me from the excavation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_video_game_burial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atari Burial Ground</a> and the documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew8j62WaZ7Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Atari: Game Over</i></a>.  You might have heard about “<a href=""http://archaeogaming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">archaeogaming</a>”, which is the archaeology in and of video games. I’m finishing my PhD in digital archaeology and heritage at the University or York and I need your help. Actually an entire civilization needs your help to preserve its digital heritage.</p>
<p>Imagine joining a community and finding a place in the wilderness to call your own, spending time, money, and resources to build a home, a farm, or a small business. And then imagine waking up one morning to find that everything had changed overnight: your home is buried, your crops destroyed, and it’s too cold to survive for long outside. This is exactly what happened in 2017 in a game called <a href=""http://nomanssky.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>No Man’s Sky</i></a>.</p>
<p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> is (now) a multiplayer video game containing an infinite number of algorithmically created planets for human exploration and settlement. One group of several hundred people established the <a href=""https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Galactic_Hub_Project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Galactic Hub</a> in one region of the game’s online space only to have their settlements ruined by an unintended, catastrophic <a href=""https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-players-who-colonized-a-galaxy-now-have-to-1798357453"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">climate change event</a>, which in this case happened to be a software update. The settlements became disaster ruins overnight, and the players became digital climate refugees resettling elsewhere after a long search.</p>
<p>Their ruined homes and farms remained behind, however, leaving traces in the archaeological record of architecture, agriculture, and digital cultural heritage, which could be surveyed as well as excavated. These archaeological investigations answered several traditional research questions of settlement and abandonment bolstered by inscriptional and physical remains. Through rigorous documentation, I created a gazetteer of 35 abandoned sites, recording over 1,000 digital images and videos of each location, supplementing with maps and text.</p>
<p>This project marks the world’s first formal archaeological expedition into a purely digital landscape inhabited by human players, and shows the realized potential for conducting archaeology in digital places. It serves as a prologue for archaeological projects to come, those focused on human habitations in digital built environments as the Anthropocene bears witness to the diaspora of entire groups of people into navigable and social realms accessed only through screens. One can also draw conclusions and take lessons from this project’s data relating to the very real-world concerns of climate change, climate-induced migration, and human settlement and abandonment (albeit on a smaller scale), as they played out by a real, human population in a digital environment.</p>
<p>So what is the funding for? Archaeological data must be preserved and shared not only for future generations of archaeologists and not just to preserve a record of surveyed and excavated sites. Like a landscape after an earthquake, these abandoned digital places have all either been changed or completely destroyed by further software updates, robbing players of their digital heritage. All that remains of these settlements from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s earliest period are shown in my comprehensive data, which needs a home. And like the people of the Galactic Hub, I’ve found one: the <a href=""https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Archaeology Data Service</a>.</p>
<h2>The Archaeology Data Service</h2>
<p>The Archaeology Data Service is the only accredited digital repository in the UK for heritage data, with over 20 years of experience supporting research, learning, and teaching with free, high quality, and dependable digital resources. The aim of the ADS is to collect, describe, catalogue, preserve, and provide user support for digital resources that are created as a product of archaeological research. Archaeology is in a special position in that much of the creation of its data results from destruction of primary evidence—which is what happened in <i>No Man’s Sky</i>—making access to data all the more critical in order to test, access, and subsequently reanalyze and reinterpret both data and the hypotheses arising from them. Not only that, but members of the player-community will be able to revisit this data whenever they wish.</p>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>I’m not asking for much. It will cost 2,000 pounds (or around 2,500 dollars) to have these 35 Legacy Galactic Hub settlements ingested into the Archaeology Data Service’s system and made available for all time as Open Access. That boils down to around $70 per site, or the cost of a new video game. Each site record will feature text, maps, images, and video along with coordinates and digital object identifiers. It will take me about two months to enter all of the data into the system. The $2750 will cover the data preservation as well as recovering indiegogo platform fees and production costs of the pins, patches, and stickers.</p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>So what’s in it for you? First you’ll be helping to save a permanent record of a human-created digital civilization that was forced to leave its first home, and you’ll be helping a community preserve its digital heritage. If you want, you’ll also get your name published on the project’s home page as a contributor. There are some pretty sweet premiums, too, everything from <i>No Man’s Sky</i> archaeology stickers, pins, and patches to the chance to participate in a new virtual reality archaeological project when the Beyond update launches this summer. See the Perks page for this campaign for more detailed information.</p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>If the original funding goal is met, there are some stretch goals, too, which include funding Open Access fees for an archaeology journal article, to the creation of a book about the archaeology of the Legacy Galactic Hub, to underwriting the next chapter in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> archaeology, an expedition called “Cities of the Hub.” There is still a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll join me in doing a historical first: preserving and publishing archaeological data from a human-occupied digital space.</p>

Follow #Canada150PicnicWhere things are atTo date, I have already poured tons of time (100+ hours since 2016), energy (I am guessing over 10,000 calories) and money ($500+ on everything from supplies, travel, fabric samples, marketing, sourcing, etc.)I need to raise an additional $1,500.00 to help with costs. This includes everything from the purchase of the 150 feet of red & white checkered fabric, sewing expenses, purchasing rolls of clear plastic covering or fabric underlay, picnic table rentals, signage, film/photography, marketing, social media, and much more!PerksI have some really cool perks in store for you.You might be wondering where all of the fabric will be coming from for some of the perks...well, I will actually be upcycling the 150 foot piece of fabric. After the Canada 150 Picnic, the fabric will be cleaned and then sewn into many commemorative keepsakes (napkins, tablecloths, and picnic blankets).If I raise enough funds, I will be able to rent 25 picnic tables to raise the picnic off of the ground and onto the tables providing more comfortable seating for everyone.Thank youI'd love support from friends, family, individuals, non-profits, businesses, and community members! Please connect with me directly about partnering or collaborating.A big thank you to all of my friends and family who have supported me so far! And a special thanks to Scott Lester for filming and Cindy with letsomnom.com for use of a photo of Heritage Days.  Be a part of something spectacular for Canada 150!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>My name is Emily and I am from Seattle, Washington. I am 24 years old and currently a volunteer in Kyrgyzstan (officially known as the Kyrgyz Republic), which is a relatively small country in Central Asia. I am an English teacher and live in a small village in the Issyk-Kul oblast. I was talking to a young local student who explained to me that there is no earthquake drills at her school. I started thinking about giving information about the importance of practicing earthquake drills along with the fire drills. Earthquakes are quite prevalent here in Kyrgyzstan. I am going to travel around the country over the next four months to the different oblasts and train groups of volunteers and their counterparts on this topic. Then, the volunteers and their counterparts will give the seminar at their local school to the students and faculty. They will be trained on how to properly prepare for the earthquake in the school and in the home and how to react during an earthquake, as well as how to respond safely after the earthquake. This is an important project for me because it is important that students, faculty and their families have a concise plan set in place. </li>

<li>I will be traveling via marshrutka (and by car when there is no marshrutka available) to the different volunteers' sites.

From my village to Bishkek will cost me about 7 USD, and then from Bishkek to Talas city will cost me 7 USD. From Talas city, I will go to Toktogul city and will cost me 8USD by car. From Toktogul city to Jalalabad city, it will cost me 8 USD. Then from Jalalabad city to Osh city, it will cost me 5 USD. Osh will be my last stop, then I will go by car from Osh city to Bishkek city and will cost me 31 USD, and from Bishkek city to my village will cost me 7USD. The hostels I will be staying in will be about 62 USD for all the nights, but I will be staying with other volunteers when I can. In total, the cost will be 141 USD for travel and lodging. I will also be purchasing some supplies for the seminars, such as large flip chart paper, pens, markers and small notepads for those attending to use. I estimate this might cost around 50 USD.

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to replace the gazebo in Maplewood Park that was torn down for safety reasons. We believe a larger, more functional gazebo will help maintain Maplewood Park in Oxford Mills as a local landmark, community resource and add to the recreational opportunities of the hamlet of Oxford Mills and the Municipality of North Grenville. Please help us do that in partnership with the Municipality. <strong>Donate what you can</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The Oxford Mills Community Association (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/OxfordMills/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Find us on Facebook</a>) <strong>has committed to covering all the costs</strong>, which are substantial as the structure must meet stringent municipal standards. The current total project estimate is $10,000 of which we've already raised $2,600 through fundraising events. Generous in-kind contributions have covered approximately $2,400 worth of construction costs. We'll continue to fundraise throughout the year but <strong>we need to raise $5,000 asap to cover expenses.</strong></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Well, first of all, you'll get <strong>the satisfaction of being part of a community</strong> of good neighbours, both near and far. This project was initiated, pursued, and will eventually be financed by a generous community who decided to get it done by themselves..</p>

<p>In November 2016, we opened the doors of Makani, a small learning center where displaced Syrian children come to learn what they missed out on as they fled the war in Syria. Think fun literacy classes, cake-making, art collage in the english alphabet, sports, poetry, story telling and more creative lessons to stimulate their minds and expose them to new set of activities . Makani acts as a means of informal education as well as a space for social and psychological support.</p>

<p>We are really grateful for all our friends and community who have been with us through the beginning of our journey. Thanks to your generous support and donations, we were able to sustain the center for three years now, offering educational classes, fun activities, arts and crafts to 50 Syrian refugee children. Makani is not just a safe space for Syrian kids to learn and grow, it is also a lovely makan where friendships are being formed and love and joy are being created through various activities ranging from coloring and painting to photography and story telling and more creative experiences!</p>

<p><strong>NEW UPDATES : Home In Our Heart</strong></p>
<p>During those few years, every few months volunteers equipped with different skill sets and talents would travel from various parts of the world  to this small town across the border of Syria and Turkey and run creative workshops with the kids. It's hard to believe the magic that they create with the kids though for a short time - We believe that these moments will be ingrained in the children's memories, sewing the seeds for healthier, more confident leaders of tomorrow!</p>

</div></div>","In November 2016, we opened the doors of Makani, a small learning center where displaced Syrian children come to learn what they missed out on as they fled the war in Syria. Think fun literacy classes, cake-making, art collage in the english alphabet, sports, poetry, story telling and more creative lessons to stimulate their minds and expose them to new set of activities . Makani acts as a means of informal education as well as a space for social and psychological support.

We are really grateful for all our friends and community who have been with us through the beginning of our journey. Thanks to your generous support and donations, we were able to sustain the center for three years now, offering educational classes, fun activities, arts and crafts to 50 Syrian refugee children. Makani is not just a safe space for Syrian kids to learn and grow, it is also a lovely makan where friendships are being formed and love and joy are being created through various activities ranging from coloring and painting to photography and story telling and more creative experiences!

Hope is truly manifested in the children’s spirit and the beautifully resilient Syrian teachers and staff who give their all to make sure Makani is a burgeoning space of love and growth.  

NEW UPDATES : Home In Our Heart
During those few years, every few months volunteers equipped with different skill sets and talents would travel from various parts of the world  to this small town across the border of Syria and Turkey and run creative workshops with the kids. It's hard to believe the magic that they create with the kids though for a short time - We believe that these moments will be ingrained in the children's memories, sewing the seeds for healthier, more confident leaders of tomorrow!

This year, Dave and Michael, travelled all the way to Reyhanli from Colorado to create a beautiful artistic workshop with the kids, the result of which is a photobook featured on Amazon - art and stories captured beautifully through the children's eyes. 100% of proceeds from the book sale go back to Makani to continue supporting the center's activities.

We explore the relationship between art, spirituality and territory through documentaries, feature films, animation series, art, sound, exhibitions and live events. We are committed to creating high-quality cultural, indigenous and environmentally-conscious content to inspire people and spark change.</span></p><p>4Direcciones has evolved to become a space for dialogue between the ancestral practices of the native peoples of America and those of the urban world; we aim to build bridges of knowledge, crafts and tools in order to learn from each other and celebrate our cultural biodiversity..</p><p><strong>HOW DID THIS PROJECT START?</strong></p><p>Three years ago we were commissioned by the National University of Colombia to create an immersive experience, sound and video installation about the indigenous subjects we have been working on for over a decade. The result was ""The Origin of Night"", a 2.5 hour sound ceremony,  made of prayers, polyphonic chants and also some very dark stories. This is how we found <strong>Reinaldo Giagrekudo</strong>, an elder from La Chorrera Amazonas. Through him, we heard in first person the horrible tales about the rubber-barons era in Predio Putumayo, an indigenous reserve in the central Amazon. Along with the horror stories from the 1930’s and 40’s, we also learned, through Reynaldo, about hope and resilience. All the survivors of the rubber holocaust still struggle today to keep their culture alive in the midst of the forest, forgotten by the government, by Colombia and the world.</p><p><br/><strong>WHAT IS PREDIO PUTUMAYO ? WHY IS UNDER THREAT?</strong></p><p>At the center of Predio Putumayo, we can find La Chorrera. This used to be the headquarters of La Casa Arana,  known as the Auschwitz of the jungle, a concentration camp for people from indigenous communities, who were enslaved and forced to harvest rubber for Europe and the USA. It is located in the centre of Predio Putumayo, an area of 6 million hectares of forest, home to many different nations who speak different languages. Among them are the Uitoto (Murui), Mirañas, Boras, Andoques, Ocainas, Muinanes and Nonuyas, along with communities of the Carijona, Yucuna, Cabiyarí, Inga, Siona and Letuama ethnic groups, among others. After decades of struggle, the government of Colombia gave back these territories to their original owners, and in 1988 declared Predio Putumayo as a reserve, the biggest indigenous reserve in the country.<br/>Reynaldo is one of the traditional Authorities of Predio Putumayo, one of 60 elders who led the struggle for the freedom of their people. We learned from him that the biggest threat of the reserve, besides mining and deforestation, is the growing distance between the younger generations and their own tradition. They don't care about their land or culture anymore. They want to go away, live in a city and sell their land to miners and loggers.<br/>Reynaldo needs to get together again with his colleagues, the 60 elders, who are scattered throughout this territory of 6 million hectares. He needs to meet again with those who dreamt Predio Putumayo 50 years ago and haven’t met in two decades. The last time these important spiritual authorities of the Amazon met together, was in 1998. This kind of gathering, of the elders of different ethnic groups, only occurs in cases of extreme need.<br/>We want Predio Putumayo to be the wild forest it has been since the beginning of time, regulating the climate of the planet, keeping secrets and mysteries for our present and future times. We also believe that the guardians of this territory deserve solidarity and support from us, the people from the cities. We want to celebrate their culture, their worldview, their wisdom.</p><p>At the gathering, which you can support and be a part of, the Traditional Authorities intend to sit down for 4 nights in the traditional Malokas in Chorrera and engage in the ritual of <strong>coca leaf,</strong> which is called a “<strong>Mambeadero”.</strong> It will end with an all-night ritual dance, where all the assistants participate and celebrate. This ceremony, will inspire the elders with visions of the past and future of the reserve, and enable them to transmit their knowledge to the younger generations and the rest of the world.</p><p>Reynaldo cannot do this mega-event on his own, he is tired and needs help to bring everyone to sit again in a circle and do the political and spiritual work necessary to recover the balance and order of their territory and its people.</p><p>We are very passionate about the possibility of making this reunion happen and committed since last year to promote, organise and coordinate it. We have gathered a team of professionals, locals and internationals, that will go there and make this vision a reality. We have already gone to the La Chorrera, the place of gathering, to prepare, learn, listen and be as helpful as possible.</p><p> </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></span></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>To make this project a reality, we seek to raise <strong>30,000 </strong>dollars.</span></p><p>With your help, we would be able to :</p><p><br/>1. <strong><u>Bring the elders </u></strong>to the gathering at Chorrera Amazonas.<br/>This place is reachable only by planes and boats. The great distances and difficulties of access mean that 50% of the resources are invested in logistics,</p><p><br/>2. <u><strong>Have enough supplies,</strong> </u>food and lodging for all the elders, their wives and helpers during the 5 days of the gathering.</p><p>3. <u><strong>Document the event</strong>.</u> A very important part of the gathering is the memory that will be left from this event; we would like to document in film, sound and image, every Elder, his language, his stories. This in order to preserve that knowledge and pass it onwards, as an important collection of memory for the people of Predio Putumayo.</p><p><strong>In return, we created a collection of special objects to give you back. All our perks come from local productions:  Handmade crafted objects from the Amazon and Colombia. By contributing to our cause, you will also help the locals who make those special objects and materials.</strong><br/> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>We thus invite everyone to ally themselves with their cause and support this meeting with their donations, work or prayers.<br/>It will be of great importance for the conservation of the traditional indigenous cultures, not only in Colombia but all over the world and specifically aid the spiritual regeneration of a territory which is crucial for the conservation of the Amazon.</p><p>Along the years, we gained experience in this kind of projects, such as  ""El Origen De La Noche"", ""Jaguares De Yurupari"" and ""The sand and the rain"", which you can see in our website: <a href=""http://www.4direcciones.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.4direcciones.tv</a></p><p>Like any project such as this, there will be also unexpected challenges, but we know, that with your support and our experience, we will come over them in order to make this unique event be what the elders expect it to be.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>If you can not make a donation but still feel this is important to you, we will ask to spread the word, share the project with others, talk about Predio Putumayo.</p><p>MORE INFO ABOUT US:<br/>ON 4 DIRECCIONES:<br/><strong><a href=""http://www.4direcciones.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.4direcciones.tv</a></strong><br/>On THE ORIGIN OF NIGHT- Sounds and voices of the amazo<br/><strong><a href=""http://noche.4direcciones.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://noche.4direcciones.tv</a></strong></p><p><br/>Further Reading on Rubber/ Rubber Barons</p><p><br/>THE PUTUMAYO RED BOOK<br/><a href=""https://archive.org/details/putumayoredbook00thom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://archive.org/details/putumayoredbook00thom</a><br/>The Dream of the Celt<br/><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_Celt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_...</a><br/>One RIver<br/><a href=""http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-River/Wade-Davis/9780684834962"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-River...</a><br/>The Vortex/ La vorágine<br/><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vortex_(novel)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vortex_(novel)</a><br/>FILMS<br/>EL ABRAZO DE LA SERPIENTE  <br/><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace_of_the_Serpent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace_of_the_Se...</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>EN ESPAÑOL</strong></u></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>QUIENES SOMOS? QUE HACEMOS?</strong></p><p>Somos Diana Rico y Richard Décaillet s un dúo colaborativo de artistas, cofundadores  hace 12 años de 4direcciones un proyecto artístico audio-visual que a través de películas, documentales, series de animación, experiencias inmersivas sonoras y visuales y eventos en vivo, explora el tejido entre arte, espiritualidad y territorio.</p><p><br/>Estamos comprometidos en crear contenidos de alta calidad en temas culturales indígenas y de medio ambiente, para inspirar a la gente y despertar iniciativas de cambio. 4direcciones se ha conformado como un espacio de diálogo entre las prácticas ancestrales de los pueblos nativos de América y las del mundo urbano, uniendo saberes, oficios y herramientas para aprender y celebrara la biodiversidad cultural en el planeta</p><p><strong>Como nace este proyecto?</strong></p><p>Hace tres años, la Universidad Nacional de Colombia nos comisionó la creación de una experiencia inmersiva, una instalación de sonido y video sobre los temas indígenas en los que hemos estado trabajando durante más de una década. El resultado es ""El Origen de la Noche"", una ceremonia de sonido de 2,5 horas, hecha de oraciones, cantos polifónicos y también algunas historias muy oscuras. Así es como nos encontramos con Reinaldo Giagrekudo, un abuelo de La Chorrera Amazonas. A través de él, escuchamos en primera persona los horribles relatos sobre la era de la cauchería en Predio Putumayo, una reserva indígena en el Amazonas . Junto con las historias de terror de los años 30 y 40, también aprendimos, a través de Reynaldo, sobre la esperanza y la capacidad de resilencia humana. Todos los sobrevivientes del holocausto de la cauchería  todavía luchan hoy para mantener viva su cultura en medio del bosque, olvidados por el gobierno, por Colombia y el mundo.</p><p><br/><strong>Que es el Predio Putumayo y Chorrera y por que estan amenazados?</strong></p><p><br/>La Chorrera Amazonas solía ser como el Auschwitz de la selva, un campo de concentración para indígenas,  esclavizados y obligados a cosechar caucho para Europa y Estados Unidos. La Chorrera está ubicada en el centro de Predio Putumayo, un área de 6 millones de hectáreas de bosque, hogar de muchas naciones que hablan diferentes lenguas.  Entre ellos se encuentran los Uitoto (Murui), Mirañas, Boras, Andoques, Ocainas, Muinanes y Nonuyas, junto con comunidades de los grupos étnicos Carijona, Yucuna, Cabiyarí, Inga, Siona y Letuama. Después de décadas de lucha, el gobierno de Colombia devolvió estos territorios a sus dueños originales, y en 1988 declaró Predio Putumayo como reserva, la reserva indígena más grande del país.<br/> <br/>Reinaldo es una de las autoridades tradicionales de Predio Putumayo, uno de los 60 ancianos que lideraron la lucha por la libertad de su pueblo. Aprendimos de él que la mayor amenaza del resguardo, además de la minería y la deforestación, es la creciente distancia entre las generaciones más jóvenes y su propia tradición. Ya no les importa su tierra o cultura. Quieren irse, vivir en una ciudad y vender sus tierras a mineros y madereros. Reynaldo necesita reunirse de nuevo con sus colegas, los 60 ancianos, que están dispersos en este territorio de 6 millones de hectáreas. Necesita reunirse de nuevo con aquellos que soñaron con Predio Putumayo hace 30 años y que no se han visto en dos décadas. La última vez que estas autoridades espirituales importantes de la Amazonía se reunieron, fue en 1998. Este tipo de reunión, de los ancianos de diferentes grupos étnicos, solo ocurre en casos de extrema  urgencia. Queremos que Predio Putumayo sea el bosque salvaje que ha sido desde el principio de los tiempos, regulando el clima del planeta, guardando secretos y misterios para nuestros tiempos presentes y futuros. También creemos que los guardianes de este territorio merecen nuestra solidaridad y nuestro apoyo, el de la gente de las ciudades. Queremos celebrar su cultura, su cosmovisión y su sabiduría.<br/> </p><p>En la reunión, que tu puedes apoyar, las Autoridades Tradicionales de este enorme territorio tienen la intención de sentarse durante 4 noches en sus Malocas en La Chorrera para realizar  un mamabeadero, el ritual de palabra con la hoja de coca. El mamabeadero se cerrará con un baile tradicional de Yadico y durante toda la noche todos los asistentes participarán y celebrarán. Esta ceremonia inspirará a los ancianos con las visiones del pasado y el futuro el resguardo y les permitirá transmitir su conocimiento a las generaciones más jóvenes y al resto del mundo.</p><p><br/>Reynaldo no puede hacer este megaevento por su cuenta, está cansado y necesita ayuda para que todos se sienten nuevamente en ese círculo y realicen el trabajo político y espiritual necesario para recuperar el equilibrio y el orden de su territorio y su gente.</p><p><br/>Nos apasiona la posibilidad de ayudar a que esta reunión suceda, desde el año pasado nos hemos comprometido con promoverla, organizarla y coordinarla. Hemos reunido un equipo de profesionales, locales e internacionales, que irán allí y harán de esta visión una realidad. Ya hemos ido a La Chorrera, el lugar de reunión, para preparar, aprender, escuchar y ser lo más útiles posible.</p><p><strong>Lo que necesitamos y lo que recibiras</strong></p><p>Para que este proyecto sea una realidad, buscamos recaudar 30,000 dólares.</p><p>Con tu ayuda, podríamos:</p><p><br/>1. <strong>Llevar a los ancianos a la reunión en Chorrera Amazonas.</strong> Este lugar es accesible solo por aviones y barcos.

We explore the relationship between art, spirituality and territory through documentaries, feature films, animation series, art, sound, exhibitions and live events. We are committed to creating high-quality cultural, indigenous and environmentally-conscious content to inspire people and spark change.4Direcciones has evolved to become a space for dialogue between the ancestral practices of the native peoples of America and those of the urban world; we aim to build bridges of knowledge, crafts and tools in order to learn from each other and celebrate our cultural biodiversity..HOW DID THIS PROJECT START?Three years ago we were commissioned by the National University of Colombia to create an immersive experience, sound and video installation about the indigenous subjects we have been working on for over a decade. The result was ""The Origin of Night"", a 2.5 hour sound ceremony,  made of prayers, polyphonic chants and also some very dark stories. This is how we found Reinaldo Giagrekudo, an elder from La Chorrera Amazonas. Through him, we heard in first person the horrible tales about the rubber-barons era in Predio Putumayo, an indigenous reserve in the central Amazon. Along with the horror stories from the 1930’s and 40’s, we also learned, through Reynaldo, about hope and resilience. All the survivors of the rubber holocaust still struggle today to keep their culture alive in the midst of the forest, forgotten by the government, by Colombia and the world.WHAT IS PREDIO PUTUMAYO ? WHY IS UNDER THREAT?At the center of Predio Putumayo, we can find La Chorrera. This used to be the headquarters of La Casa Arana,  known as the Auschwitz of the jungle, a concentration camp for people from indigenous communities, who were enslaved and forced to harvest rubber for Europe and the USA. It is located in the centre of Predio Putumayo, an area of 6 million hectares of forest, home to many different nations who speak different languages. Among them are the Uitoto (Murui), Mirañas, Boras, Andoques, Ocainas, Muinanes and Nonuyas, along with communities of the Carijona, Yucuna, Cabiyarí, Inga, Siona and Letuama ethnic groups, among others. After decades of struggle, the government of Colombia gave back these territories to their original owners, and in 1988 declared Predio Putumayo as a reserve, the biggest indigenous reserve in the country.Reynaldo is one of the traditional Authorities of Predio Putumayo, one of 60 elders who led the struggle for the freedom of their people. We learned from him that the biggest threat of the reserve, besides mining and deforestation, is the growing distance between the younger generations and their own tradition. They don't care about their land or culture anymore. They want to go away, live in a city and sell their land to miners and loggers.Reynaldo needs to get together again with his colleagues, the 60 elders, who are scattered throughout this territory of 6 million hectares. He needs to meet again with those who dreamt Predio Putumayo 50 years ago and haven’t met in two decades. The last time these important spiritual authorities of the Amazon met together, was in 1998. This kind of gathering, of the elders of different ethnic groups, only occurs in cases of extreme need.We want Predio Putumayo to be the wild forest it has been since the beginning of time, regulating the climate of the planet, keeping secrets and mysteries for our present and future times. We also believe that the guardians of this territory deserve solidarity and support from us, the people from the cities. We want to celebrate their culture, their worldview, their wisdom.At the gathering, which you can support and be a part of, the Traditional Authorities intend to sit down for 4 nights in the traditional Malokas in Chorrera and engage in the ritual of coca leaf, which is called a “Mambeadero”. It will end with an all-night ritual dance, where all the assistants participate and celebrate. This ceremony, will inspire the elders with visions of the past and future of the reserve, and enable them to transmit their knowledge to the younger generations and the rest of the world.Reynaldo cannot do this mega-event on his own, he is tired and needs help to bring everyone to sit again in a circle and do the political and spiritual work necessary to recover the balance and order of their territory and its people.We are very passionate about the possibility of making this reunion happen and committed since last year to promote, organise and coordinate it. We have gathered a team of professionals, locals and internationals, that will go there and make this vision a reality. We have already gone to the La Chorrera, the place of gathering, to prepare, learn, listen and be as helpful as possible. WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETTo make this project a reality, we seek to raise 30,000 dollars.With your help, we would be able to :1. Bring the elders to the gathering at Chorrera Amazonas.This place is reachable only by planes and boats. The great distances and difficulties of access mean that 50% of the resources are invested in logistics,2. Have enough supplies, food and lodging for all the elders, their wives and helpers during the 5 days of the gathering.3. Document the event. A very important part of the gathering is the memory that will be left from this event; we would like to document in film, sound and image, every Elder, his language, his stories. This in order to preserve that knowledge and pass it onwards, as an important collection of memory for the people of Predio Putumayo.In return, we created a collection of special objects to give you back. All our perks come from local productions:  Handmade crafted objects from the Amazon and Colombia. By contributing to our cause, you will also help the locals who make those special objects and materials. The ImpactWe thus invite everyone to ally themselves with their cause and support this meeting with their donations, work or prayers.It will be of great importance for the conservation of the traditional indigenous cultures, not only in Colombia but all over the world and specifically aid the spiritual regeneration of a territory which is crucial for the conservation of the Amazon.Along the years, we gained experience in this kind of projects, such as  ""El Origen De La Noche"", ""Jaguares De Yurupari"" and ""The sand and the rain"", which you can see in our website: www.4direcciones.tvLike any project such as this, there will be also unexpected challenges, but we know, that with your support and our experience, we will come over them in order to make this unique event be what the elders expect it to be. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can not make a donation but still feel this is important to you, we will ask to spread the word, share the project with others, talk about Predio Putumayo.MORE INFO ABOUT US:ON 4 DIRECCIONES:www.4direcciones.tvOn THE ORIGIN OF NIGHT- Sounds and voices of the amazohttp://noche.4direcciones.tvFurther Reading on Rubber/ Rubber BaronsTHE PUTUMAYO RED BOOKhttps://archive.org/details/putumayoredbook00thomThe Dream of the Celthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_...One RIverhttp://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-River...The Vortex/ La voráginehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vortex_(novel)FILMSEL ABRAZO DE LA SERPIENTE  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace_of_the_Se...EN ESPAÑOL QUIENES SOMOS? QUE HACEMOS?Somos Diana Rico y Richard Décaillet s un dúo colaborativo de artistas, cofundadores  hace 12 años de 4direcciones un proyecto artístico audio-visual que a través de películas, documentales, series de animación, experiencias inmersivas sonoras y visuales y eventos en vivo, explora el tejido entre arte, espiritualidad y territorio.Estamos comprometidos en crear contenidos de alta calidad en temas culturales indígenas y de medio ambiente, para inspirar a la gente y despertar iniciativas de cambio. 4direcciones se ha conformado como un espacio de diálogo entre las prácticas ancestrales de los pueblos nativos de América y las del mundo urbano, uniendo saberes, oficios y herramientas para aprender y celebrara la biodiversidad cultural en el planetaComo nace este proyecto?Hace tres años, la Universidad Nacional de Colombia nos comisionó la creación de una experiencia inmersiva, una instalación de sonido y video sobre los temas indígenas en los que hemos estado trabajando durante más de una década. El resultado es ""El Origen de la Noche"", una ceremonia de sonido de 2,5 horas, hecha de oraciones, cantos polifónicos y también algunas historias muy oscuras. Así es como nos encontramos con Reinaldo Giagrekudo, un abuelo de La Chorrera Amazonas. A través de él, escuchamos en primera persona los horribles relatos sobre la era de la cauchería en Predio Putumayo, una reserva indígena en el Amazonas . Junto con las historias de terror de los años 30 y 40, también aprendimos, a través de Reynaldo, sobre la esperanza y la capacidad de resilencia humana. Todos los sobrevivientes del holocausto de la cauchería  todavía luchan hoy para mantener viva su cultura en medio del bosque, olvidados por el gobierno, por Colombia y el mundo.Que es el Predio Putumayo y Chorrera y por que estan amenazados?La Chorrera Amazonas solía ser como el Auschwitz de la selva, un campo de concentración para indígenas,  esclavizados y obligados a cosechar caucho para Europa y Estados Unidos. La Chorrera está ubicada en el centro de Predio Putumayo, un área de 6 millones de hectáreas de bosque, hogar de muchas naciones que hablan diferentes lenguas.  Entre ellos se encuentran los Uitoto (Murui), Mirañas, Boras, Andoques, Ocainas, Muinanes y Nonuyas, junto con comunidades de los grupos étnicos Carijona, Yucuna, Cabiyarí, Inga, Siona y Letuama. Después de décadas de lucha, el gobierno de Colombia devolvió estos territorios a sus dueños originales, y en 1988 declaró Predio Putumayo como reserva, la reserva indígena más grande del país. Reinaldo es una de las autoridades tradicionales de Predio Putumayo, uno de los 60 ancianos que lideraron la lucha por la libertad de su pueblo. Aprendimos de él que la mayor amenaza del resguardo, además de la minería y la deforestación, es la creciente distancia entre las generaciones más jóvenes y su propia tradición. Ya no les importa su tierra o cultura. Quieren irse, vivir en una ciudad y vender sus tierras a mineros y madereros. Reynaldo necesita reunirse de nuevo con sus colegas, los 60 ancianos, que están dispersos en este territorio de 6 millones de hectáreas. Necesita reunirse de nuevo con aquellos que soñaron con Predio Putumayo hace 30 años y que no se han visto en dos décadas. La última vez que estas autoridades espirituales importantes de la Amazonía se reunieron, fue en 1998. Este tipo de reunión, de los ancianos de diferentes grupos étnicos, solo ocurre en casos de extrema  urgencia. Queremos que Predio Putumayo sea el bosque salvaje que ha sido desde el principio de los tiempos, regulando el clima del planeta, guardando secretos y misterios para nuestros tiempos presentes y futuros. También creemos que los guardianes de este territorio merecen nuestra solidaridad y nuestro apoyo, el de la gente de las ciudades. Queremos celebrar su cultura, su cosmovisión y su sabiduría. En la reunión, que tu puedes apoyar, las Autoridades Tradicionales de este enorme territorio tienen la intención de sentarse durante 4 noches en sus Malocas en La Chorrera para realizar  un mamabeadero, el ritual de palabra con la hoja de coca. El mamabeadero se cerrará con un baile tradicional de Yadico y durante toda la noche todos los asistentes participarán y celebrarán. Esta ceremonia inspirará a los ancianos con las visiones del pasado y el futuro el resguardo y les permitirá transmitir su conocimiento a las generaciones más jóvenes y al resto del mundo.Reynaldo no puede hacer este megaevento por su cuenta, está cansado y necesita ayuda para que todos se sienten nuevamente en ese círculo y realicen el trabajo político y espiritual necesario para recuperar el equilibrio y el orden de su territorio y su gente.Nos apasiona la posibilidad de ayudar a que esta reunión suceda, desde el año pasado nos hemos comprometido con promoverla, organizarla y coordinarla. Hemos reunido un equipo de profesionales, locales e internacionales, que irán allí y harán de esta visión una realidad. Ya hemos ido a La Chorrera, el lugar de reunión, para preparar, aprender, escuchar y ser lo más útiles posible.Lo que necesitamos y lo que recibirasPara que este proyecto sea una realidad, buscamos recaudar 30,000 dólares.Con tu ayuda, podríamos:1. Llevar a los ancianos a la reunión en Chorrera Amazonas. Este lugar es accesible solo por aviones y barcos. Las grandes distancias y dificultades de acceso significan que el 50% de los recursos se invierten en logística,2. Tener suficientes recursos de alimentacion  y alojamiento para todos los ancianos, sus esposas y ayudantes durante los 5 días de la reunión.3. Documentar el evento. Una parte muy importante de la reunión es la memoria que quedará de este evento; nos gustaría documentar en película, sonido e imagen, a cada anciano, su lenguaje, sus historias. Esto con el fin de preservar ese conocimiento y pasarlo a las nuevas generaciones, como una importante colección de memoria para la gente de Predio Putumayo.A cambio, creamos una colección de objetos especiales para  que recuerdes tu alianza con el corazón de la Amazonía.Todos nuestros bjetos  provienen de producciones locales: Objetos artesanales hechos a mano en el Predio Putumayo.Al contribuir con nuestra causa, también ayudarás a los nativos del lugar con el apoyo a su cultura materialEl impactoInvitamos a todos los que escuchen este llamado, a aliarse con esta causa y apoyar esta reunión con sus donaciones, trabajo u oraciones. Será de gran importancia para la conservación de las culturas indígenas tradicionales, no solo en Colombia sino en todo el mundo y específicamente en la regeneración espiritual de un territorio que es crucial para la conservación del Amazonas.A lo largo de los años, adquirimos experiencia en este tipo de proyectos, como ""El Origen de la Noche"", ""Jaguares de Yuruparí"" y ""The Sand and teh Rain"", que puedes ver en nuestro sitio web: www.4direcciones.tvComo cualquier proyecto como este, también habrá desafíos inesperados, pero sabemos que con su apoyo y nuestra experiencia los superaremos para que este evento único sea lo que los ancianos esperan que sea.  Puedes ayudar de otras formas también: Si no puede hacer una donación pero aún sientes que esto es importante para ti,  te pedimos que corras la voz, compartas el proyecto con otros y hables sobre el Predio Putumayo.Aquí más información:ON 4 DIRECCIONES: www.4direcciones.tvOn THE ORIGIN OF NIGHT http://noche.4direcciones.tvFurther Reading on Rubber/ Rubber BaronsTHE PUTUMAYO RED BOOKhttps://archive.org/details/putumayoredbook00thomThe Dream of the Celt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_...One River http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/One-River...The Vortex/ La vorágine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vortex_(novel)FILMS EL ABRAZO DE LA SERPIENTE  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace_of_the_Se...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Deathbed Project is LIFE-Affirming! </h3>
<p>I am <strong>Marina White Raven</strong> and I am a socially engaged artist based in London. Last year I travelled to Mexico with the US/UK collective <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/triodefemmes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trio De Femmes</a></strong> and collaborated with five Mexican Artists on 'GirlyShow'. I was blown away by the experience and fell in love with Mexico and it's warm wonderful people.  I knew I would return and soon the crazy idea to bring my performance installation <strong><a href=""https://thedeathbedproject.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Practice for my Deathbed'</a></strong> was brewing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565696134/gnvi9seorces9qighn6w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Marina White Raven meets Kabriele Rosas in Mexico 2018.</i></p>
<p>This desire to bring the Deathbed to Mexico is to develop the piece as a bi-cultural collaboration bringing together artists who have already established a successful working relationship and with cultures that seem to have very different attitudes to death and dying. Together our hope is to enrich the piece to create a more vibrant and life-affirming experience for everyone who experiences and takes part in the project. Coming together in this creative space, we deepen our understanding towards ourselves and each other, feel our fears and losses are acknowledged and cared about and therefore are enabled to cross cultural bridges.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565644442/jm6je7k5ot5o37kwafqu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are four Deathbed events scheduled over the three week tour: Museo de la Ciudad de Mexico, Museo de la Ciudad de Querétaro, Casa Europa in San Miguel de Allende and Foto Museo Coyoacan. Myself and the production team are committed to make <strong>all events FREE to attend</strong>, so they are accessible and inclusive. We will also offer a community meal for everyone to share and discuss their experience after the performance. This is an important part of the process and creates a generous space for people to talk and share personal stories in a friendly, nurturing environment and to create a celebratory atmosphere. An attitude very much embedded in the warm hearted Mexican culture.</p>

<p><i>One of our venues: </i><i>Museo de la Ciudad de Queretaro​</i></p>
<p>When you contribute to a project like this you are <strong>saying YES to art!</strong> Art that sends multiple ripples of impact into and with and through the communities it interacts with, the people that attend and the artists that collaborate and share a creative dialogue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We Can Offer:</h3>
<p>We need to raise <strong>£2,500</strong> to make this happen. We are doing this on a very low budget with the time and expertise, support and effort of many people, local friends and organisations and their generous offers of accommodation, food and rehearsal space. The funds we are asking for will primarily cover the basic expenses: the main one being flying Marina from London to Mexico. It will also cover travel and food for the core team of five artists within Mexico, for the three weeks of the project. As there wont be any income from ticket sales, there are also expenses for: materials to construct the bed, and 'petates' (carpets) for the audience to sit on, material for costume making, the community meals, designing and printing flyers and hire of audio equipment. Once all these expenses are covered and if we go beyond our target, we will be able to cover a small fee for each of the artists involved.</p>
<p>The real full amount required to make this happen would be £7,500. We are able to produce these events on the lower budget of £2,500 because of kindness, generousity and passion for the project:  all the artists have agreed to donate their time and dedication for free, friends are supporting us with housing, photography and video making, and the venues are providing us with spaces to share this work with the public.</p>
<p>Basic expenses are required for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Travel for Marina White Raven (UK to Mexico) <strong>£1000  </strong>
</li>
<li>Travel expenses in Mexico City for the artists (food and local transportation)  <strong>£310 </strong>  </li>
<li>Travel expenses in San Miguel  (food and local transportation)<strong> £185 </strong>
</li>
<li>Travel expenses in Queretaro (food and local transportation)<strong> £185 </strong>
</li>
<li>Community meal after each presentations <strong>£300 </strong>
</li>
<li>Artisanal carpets (<i>petates</i>) for the audience to sit on<strong> £175</strong>
</li>
<li>Bed materials<strong> £65</strong>
</li>
<li>Audio equipment rental for reduced fee<strong> £175 </strong>
</li>
<li>Costumes <strong>£65</strong> </li>
<li>Printed material <strong>£40 </strong>
</li>

<h3>Giving Feels Good!</h3>
<p>The aim of taking 'The Deathbed Project'  to Mexico is to create an uplifting and life affirming creative experience for everyone involved. It may seem <strong>a crazy idea</strong> to take a project about death to Mexico, and I must admit it has taken a huge leap of faith for me to continue following my heart and my creative instinct, to overcome the obstacles and difficulties that go with attempting to produce an international collaborative artwork- without a big grant or high profile backer- particularly when the subject matter is death!  There was a point when I thought I would just quit the whole thing, but regular chats via Skype with my Mexican friends, producers and artistic team has given me the strength and support to continue with this vision.</p>
<p>Together we believe that 'The Deathbed Project' is a highly worthwhile endeavour; an interactive public performance with the potential to connect us with our humanity, transforming difficult emotions and experiences and <strong>shining a light to expose our deepest shared fears</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year I had a successful crowd-funder with Trio De Femmes' GirlyShow project. It was my first time doing this and once we got going and people started responding, it much more fun and much more creative than I had expected. Everyone who donated loved their gifts and incentives and we enjoyed the responses and expanded interest in our performance work. It became a really great way to connect with our audience and give our supporters something personal and meaningful. I learnt a lot from this experience and hope to to do even better this time. </p>
<p>Supporting artistic work generates so much positive energy in the world, by giving something and getting involved, you will get so much more back. We really want to bring the Mexican experience to YOU!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Overcoming obstacles makes us stronger</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacles to us achieving our goal is the subject matter: Death does not really sell it seems, and people may be afraid and shy to step up and get involved in such a <strong>personal and taboo</strong> subject... AND this is why it is an important project! We want to shine a light on this difficult to talk about subject and expose it as a universal and human fear that we all share and that actually unites us. This is what ART can do!</p>
<p> I have performed this piece all over the world. Since it was first created for Whitstable Biennale in 2012 there have been 15 deathbeds in the USA, UK, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia. Each time the experience is different and each country and culture responds to the piece in a particular way and not always what you might expect. </p>
<p>I've always found <strong>strange and seemingly impossible ideas</strong> the most exciting and these are often difficult ideas to find funding and support for, so I have mostly had to fund them myself. However, I want to do things differently this time, I want to at least cover the expenses and make all the events free and if we go beyond our modest target, I would dearly like to pay all the artists for their time and brilliance. I also want to feel supported in this challenging work and to be acknowledged as an independent artist with big, bold and life affirming ideas and to inspire other people to do the same.</p>

I am Marina White Raven and I am a socially engaged artist based in London. Last year I travelled to Mexico with the US/UK collective Trio De Femmes and collaborated with five Mexican Artists on 'GirlyShow'. I was blown away by the experience and fell in love with Mexico and it's warm wonderful people.  I knew I would return and soon the crazy idea to bring my performance installation 'Practice for my Deathbed' was brewing.

Marina White Raven meets Kabriele Rosas in Mexico 2018.
This desire to bring the Deathbed to Mexico is to develop the piece as a bi-cultural collaboration bringing together artists who have already established a successful working relationship and with cultures that seem to have very different attitudes to death and dying. Together our hope is to enrich the piece to create a more vibrant and life-affirming experience for everyone who experiences and takes part in the project. Coming together in this creative space, we deepen our understanding towards ourselves and each other, feel our fears and losses are acknowledged and cared about and therefore are enabled to cross cultural bridges.

There are four Deathbed events scheduled over the three week tour: Museo de la Ciudad de Mexico, Museo de la Ciudad de Querétaro, Casa Europa in San Miguel de Allende and Foto Museo Coyoacan. Myself and the production team are committed to make all events FREE to attend, so they are accessible and inclusive. We will also offer a community meal for everyone to share and discuss their experience after the performance. This is an important part of the process and creates a generous space for people to talk and share personal stories in a friendly, nurturing environment and to create a celebratory atmosphere. An attitude very much embedded in the warm hearted Mexican culture.

One of our venues: Museo de la Ciudad de Queretaro​
When you contribute to a project like this you are saying YES to art! Art that sends multiple ripples of impact into and with and through the communities it interacts with, the people that attend and the artists that collaborate and share a creative dialogue.

What We Need & What We Can Offer:
We need to raise £2,500 to make this happen. We are doing this on a very low budget with the time and expertise, support and effort of many people, local friends and organisations and their generous offers of accommodation, food and rehearsal space. The funds we are asking for will primarily cover the basic expenses: the main one being flying Marina from London to Mexico. It will also cover travel and food for the core team of five artists within Mexico, for the three weeks of the project. As there wont be any income from ticket sales, there are also expenses for: materials to construct the bed, and 'petates' (carpets) for the audience to sit on, material for costume making, the community meals, designing and printing flyers and hire of audio equipment. Once all these expenses are covered and if we go beyond our target, we will be able to cover a small fee for each of the artists involved.
The real full amount required to make this happen would be £7,500. We are able to produce these events on the lower budget of £2,500 because of kindness, generousity and passion for the project:  all the artists have agreed to donate their time and dedication for free, friends are supporting us with housing, photography and video making, and the venues are providing us with spaces to share this work with the public.
Basic expenses are required for: 

Travel for Marina White Raven (UK to Mexico) £1000  

Travel expenses in Mexico City for the artists (food and local transportation)  £310   
Travel expenses in San Miguel  (food and local transportation) £185 

Travel expenses in Queretaro (food and local transportation) £185 

Community meal after each presentations £300 

Artisanal carpets (petates) for the audience to sit on £175

Bed materials £65

Audio equipment rental for reduced fee £175 

Costumes £65 
Printed material £40 


The core Mexico production team (pictured) are really excited to get lots of you involved and to have your input in the project and this is where our project gets really exciting for the contributors!

IMPACT CASE STUDY #3 |  162 NextDayBetter Speakers. We launched 42 Storytelling Events featuring 162 speakers across 10 cities. Watch here: We're excited to continue our work to tell the stories of our community.  FAQ: What is NextDayBetter? NextDayBetter is a storytelling platform for diaspora communities. We design and launch storytelling campaigns that celebrate the stories of migrants across the globe and call them to action. Are you a 501c3 non-profit organization? No, we are not. We are a social enterprise. We use business principles, technology, and design to create social impact. Pushing the world forward is at the core of our work. Is your work just limited to the United States? Nope. Migration is a global phenomenon and our conversation regarding immigration should not be limited to the United States. Why diaspora? Diaspora is a transnational community of people connected by heritage, history, and connection to countries of origins. For example, there are over 11 Million Filipinos outside the Philippines. We believe that as a global community, diasporas have untapped potential to solve today's greatest challenges.",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

We’re going on a dazzling road trip to find out - and you can come with us!With 10 years of experience under our belt, we’ll take a Morgan 4/4 and travel across the UK & Ireland to visit over 25 of their premier artisans. We’ll share their stories with you, and show you some of this archipelago’s most fantastic and authentic places.Together, we can get this show on the road. Grab one of the cool perks on offer by donating to this campaign, and share us on social media. Tradition is now, and you can be a part of it.Discover more here: http://contemporaryclassicstour.com/Our pilot can be found here: https://youtu.be/K2VYENyAmS8Follow us on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/contemporaryclassicstour/ This unique journey is about sharing stories. You’ll discover not how things are made, but why they’re made. This is about the pivotal role traditions play in people’s lives -  about identities and about respecting achievements of the past. At the same time, though, they’re stories of change.You see, traditions that don’t evolve, fade into obscurity. Britain & Ireland’s greatest artisans are keenly aware of this, and over 25 of them have teamed up with us to share how they blend traditional techniques and innovative technologies and approaches to create 21st century national icons.Through our video episodes, they’ll tell you what heritage means to them, and how innovation ties in with their work. You’ll also discover these business are about people as much as they are about the products they create - something we feel the world could do with a bit more of.Have a look at our pilot episode here: https://youtu.be/K2VYENyAmS8 What better way to visit all these extraordinary people and document their stories than a good old-fashioned road trip? Over 100 days, we’ll be taking you everywhere - from Devon to Donegal and from Shetland to Suffolk. With almost 10,000 miles and over 20 ferry crossings, this will be a trip to remember.It will also be all-out scenic. We’ll avoid motorways and dual carriageways. Britain & Ireland have some of the world’s best scenery and towns, and we know where to find the best spots. In our Morgan 4/4 we’ll be taking you to all of them.You’ve never seen Britain & Ireland like this before. And we hope that this project will inspire you to explore these places close to home yourself. To help you get started, some of our perks include a digital map of our actual route!Check out our website to discover more: http://contemporaryclassicstour.com/ We’re Sophie and Daniel. Together for 7 years, We’re both from the Netherlands and first visited Britain over 10 years ago. Our hearts never left. We now both live in Dublin and work in tech. We’re joined by Jimmi, who will oversee editing from his HQ in Berlin.Sophie is from Brabant. When she’s not working on the tour, she’s baking, visiting farmer’s markets, or collecting shells on Sandymount beach. With degrees in anthropology and business, she takes care of the project’s finances and stays in touch with our participants.Daniel is from Groningen. He’s the creative director of the project and takes care of everything from video equipment to the website. He’s also the logistics man. With degrees in International Relations and an adventurous spirit, he’s adept at putting together epic trips.Jimmi lives in Berlin. With a degree in International Relations, he’s lived in many European and South American cities. A keen street photographer, that interest recently spilled over into videography and editing. We’re grateful it did, because he’s incredibly talented. As outsiders, we’re uniquely aware of how special these islands are. Ever since we first visited we’ve been amazed by how saturated with tradition and culture the lives of British & Irish people are. From the cheese at the local farmer’s market to kilts worn on special occasions, that’s something to be proud of.Recent events have put national identity in the spotlight, and we feel now is a great time to show that innovation and open-mindedness are not the death of tradition, but rather the opposite. This way, we can help keep heritage accessible and of interest to future generations, and do something in return for all the great moments we’ve had here.That’s also why we’re not aiming to make money off this project. We just want to cover our costs, have a great adventure, and share with you a place we love and things that are important to us. Life is for living, and that means sometimes experiences are their own reward. This is us following our hearts. Over the last year, we’ve learned so much. We’ve gone through 5 websites, and sent over 300 emails. We’ve switched art styles 3 times, and drank the equivalent of Windermere in cups of tea.We started with a great idea, and now over 25 of Britain & Ireland’s finest artisans have joined the project. From knitters, to wine and cheese makers, to boat builders. Have a look at our website to discover more about them!A number of other organisations have partnered up with us. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company helps us get to and from Man. Conns Cameras of Dublin is providing recording equipment. Visit Jersey is supporting us for the Jersey part of our trip. The Morgan Motor Company is even providing us a car!Through genuinely meticulous planning and unbridled, raw enthusiasm we’re sure to make this project a success as we head for 15 June! Splash out a little and become a part of this once-in-a-lifetime journey. Get a uniquely personal look at the people behind some of Britain & Ireland’s most iconic products. Discover the hidden gems and pure authenticity these islands have to offer.This really is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Whether you love (British & Irish), tradition, or want to be inspired for your next epic road trip, or both, we want you with us. Of course, there will also be snazzy perks up for grabs to help you get close to the adventure. Have a look to the right.There will be about 4 images on Instagram daily, and we’ll be with you on Facebook through longer posts and live videos. This way, it’ll be like you’re really with us. Video updates will be released on a rolling basis as we visit artisans. We’re committed to providing only the highest quality updates for you to be inspired by.If you’re a business, this is a great opportunity to show your customers you’re about communities as much as commodities.

<p>My name is Stephanie Smith, and I am a genealogist, as well as a gravestone renovator.</p>
<p>So many cemeteries around the world have been forgotten and abandoned. My goal is to repair headstones of all types, with the permission of descendants and cities/counties, and clear out the land in which we entombed our forebearers.</p>
<p>Contributions toward this goal will open opportunities to not only pay our respects to those who came before us but will also offer the chance to teach more community members to the art of reviving graveyards. </p>
<p>Contributions to The Gravestone and Cemetery Preservation Project will go directly to the procurement of much-needed supplies for at least <strong>one year</strong>. Not only are the gravestones repaired with a compound invented exactly for this purpose, but a specialized cleansing agent us used to wash away dirt and stains without damaging the stones. Regardless of whether I attain my goal, all donations will still go toward purchasing what is needed to continue my project.</p>
<p>Cemeteries and gravestones can provide people with a rich history of the community where they are situated. A recent headstone that I repaired led to me researching a gentleman who passed in 1892, but not until after he experienced an incredible life. Due to his headstone repair, more people in his community have a better understanding of life in the time that he lived.<br/>The most challenging hindrance to my project is convincing the descendants to allow me to repair their ancestors' headstones. As well, it is shocking how many of those in the grave have no descendants to contact.</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, PLEASE share The Gravestone and Cemetery Preservation Project with your friends and family. Let's get the word out and let's achieve something beautiful!</p>

A recent headstone that I repaired led to me researching a gentleman who passed in 1892, but not until after he experienced an incredible life. Due to his headstone repair, more people in his community have a better understanding of life in the time that he lived.The most challenging hindrance to my project is convincing the descendants to allow me to repair their ancestors' headstones. As well, it is shocking how many of those in the grave have no descendants to contact.
If you are unable to donate, PLEASE share The Gravestone and Cemetery Preservation Project with your friends and family. Let's get the word out and let's achieve something beautiful!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the June Lake Jam Festival, an annual Mono Arts Council (MAC) benefit event.  Now in our 6th year, we've grown to become an important part of MAC funding for school art and music programs in Mono County, California. All  money goes straight to these  programs  for children.</p>
<p>Normally, the festival would be a three-day in-person event with food, fun, music and dancing, but this year it just can't happen.</p>
<p>The show must go on, and it will.  We've arranged for bands to record a performance specifically for our festival and we are live-streaming the event, FREE.</p>
<p>In exchange, we're asking that everyone dig deep to donate through this campaign and receive perks in exchange for desperately needed funding.</p>
<p>Arts Education in Mono County is on the line.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $20,000 this year to replace the money we would have earned with our regular in-person event.  This money goes straight to arts education: in-school programs, summer camps, after-school program and live music performances  at  schools.</p>
<p>We believe our festival will return to an in-person event next year, so we've created perks in this Indiegogo to entice your contribution today for the magic of what will be a stellar live event next year.   We've also lined your opportunities with merchandise and swag that will bring a little of the June Lake magic home to you.</p>
<p>We hope to reach our goal, but if we don't, our programs offered by the Mono Arts Council may need to be cut back, further hampering education and opportunities for children and young adults across Mono County, California.</p>

Célunk mindig is az volt, hogy játszva tanítsuk, szórakoztatva oktassuk a legkisebb korosztályt.</p><p>Emellett a <strong>gyerekek biztonsága</strong> is fontos számunkra, hogy olyan online környezetben töltsék el szabadidejüket, amely nem jelent számukra veszélyt! Itt nem találkozhatnak erőszakos tartalommal, a mesék, versek, játékok mind-mind az ő világukra vannak kitalálva, tervezve, szerkesztve. A Mese TV youtube csatornán is csak <strong>minőségi gyerektartalmakat</strong> kínálunk, olyan neves előadóktól, akik ma meghatározzák a magyar gyerekkultúra világát.</p><p>Büszkék vagyunk arra, hogy az egyszervolt.hu-n már lassan két-három generáció nőtt fel, a nagyok  –  kiskamaszok és már szinte felnőttek is  –  nosztalgiával emlékeznek az oldalra.

Az oldal indítása óta főleg képességfejlesztő, tanulást segítő játékokat készítettünk, amelyeket szeretnénk átdolgozni, hogy minél több felületen elérhetővé váljanak. Így a legkisebbek akár az anya, apa vagy épp a nagyszülő<strong> okos telefonján</strong> is tudnának játszani, vagy egy táblagépen próbálhatnák ki tudásukat.</p><p><a href=""https://egyszervolt.hu/jatek/buborek2017.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517409247/juqr2ixxvavfuzpqu0ok.png"" src=""""/></a></p><h3><strong>Miért fontos ez?</strong></h3><p>Az oldalon megtalálható játékok olyan technológiával készültek régebben, amelyeket mai mobil eszközök már nem tudnak elindítani. Ezért fontos számunkra, hogy ezeket a játékokat ne hagyjuk veszni, szeretnénk újra programozni őket, hogy <strong>minél több kisgyerek</strong> játszhasson  ebben az új formában is velük.

Célunk mindig is az volt, hogy játszva tanítsuk, szórakoztatva oktassuk a legkisebb korosztályt.Emellett a gyerekek biztonsága is fontos számunkra, hogy olyan online környezetben töltsék el szabadidejüket, amely nem jelent számukra veszélyt! Itt nem találkozhatnak erőszakos tartalommal, a mesék, versek, játékok mind-mind az ő világukra vannak kitalálva, tervezve, szerkesztve. A Mese TV youtube csatornán is csak minőségi gyerektartalmakat kínálunk, olyan neves előadóktól, akik ma meghatározzák a magyar gyerekkultúra világát.Büszkék vagyunk arra, hogy az egyszervolt.hu-n már lassan két-három generáció nőtt fel, a nagyok  –  kiskamaszok és már szinte felnőttek is  –  nosztalgiával emlékeznek az oldalra. Most, 2018-ban is fontos számunkra, hogy a legkisebbek is újra megtalálják, megismerjék az oldalunkat. 

 
Új céljainkAz egyszervolt.hu oldalon több száz játék fut, amelyeket szeretnénk megújítani, s ehhez kérjük a segítségeteket. Az oldal indítása óta főleg képességfejlesztő, tanulást segítő játékokat készítettünk, amelyeket szeretnénk átdolgozni, hogy minél több felületen elérhetővé váljanak. Így a legkisebbek akár az anya, apa vagy épp a nagyszülő okos telefonján is tudnának játszani, vagy egy táblagépen próbálhatnák ki tudásukat.Miért fontos ez?Az oldalon megtalálható játékok olyan technológiával készültek régebben, amelyeket mai mobil eszközök már nem tudnak elindítani. Ezért fontos számunkra, hogy ezeket a játékokat ne hagyjuk veszni, szeretnénk újra programozni őket, hogy minél több kisgyerek játszhasson  ebben az új formában is velük. Azt gondoljuk, hogy ezek a játékok nemcsak arra jók, hogy a gyereket lekössük, hanem így a legkisebbek is játszva tanulhatnak, könnyen elsajátíthatják a digitális írástudás alapjait.Youtube oldalA mese.tv oldalt 11 éve indítottuk útjára, amely már a youtube-on is elérhető. Az évek során közel ezer videót, mesét, rajzfilmet készítettünk, amelyek sorát szeretnénk bővíteni. Így például folytatnánk a Fél-Perces-Nóták című sorozatunkat, illetve szeretnénk minél több új rajzfilmet is készíteni. A 4Kids Network hazai és nemzetközi elismerései

Morris, is the Founder &amp; Executive Director of BAMS Fest, Inc. Often inspired from the stories shared by elders in her family, traveling to different music festivals, and arts-related events, and observing the beautiful struggles of her artistic friends, Ms. Morris has spent the majority of her life studying the human experiences and behaviors of people to understand their purpose, hopes, and connections with music and the arts. With this information, Ms. Morris has used mediums such as music concerts, panel discussions and educational workshops to curate around the personal experiences of artists in order to open the door for them to become vulnerable in the social experimentation of presenting new work to broader audiences.</p><p>In 2015, Catherine decided to start her non-profit - BAMS Fest, Inc. that combined her 15 year experience of event management production with community engagement. Boston Art &amp; Music Soul (BAMS) Fest is a 501 c3 nonprofit organization that strives to break down racial and social barriers to arts, music, and culture for underserved communities of color across Greater Boston. To create a diverse and inclusive commonplace for Greater Boston' recording, performing and visual artists of color, to use their artistic talents in a manner that changes societal perception, and empowers and engages audiences of color to convene.</p><p><strong>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT:</strong></p><p>This campaign is one of the vital lifelines to the success of this intergenerational, multicultural, multi-genre festival that seeks to create a new tradition in Boston. Without the support from contributors like you, many residents and newcomers to the City Boston would not get to experience the amazing arts, music and culture scenes that flow throughout each connecting neighborhood. It is important that we recognize the creativity and humanity of artists, musicians and entrepreneurs; and can unite and re-instill hope in people about what our city has to offer - culturally - during these dire times of fear and hate.</p><p>With the funds raised in this campaign, you will help us to re-educate and re-introduce a genuine side of Boston to its citizens, visitors and the rest of the world. Your contribution will help us to bridge the gap of connection between artists and audience in one of the largest parks in the city. Franklin Park is a 527-acre green space that connects (6) marginalized communities of color. Playstead Field is ground zero of past urban festivals, recreational activity, art shows and entertainment.

Los productos que se comercializaban se obtenían de las tierras cercanas.</p><p>Esta economía fue construida por los colonos: toda la familia y los vecinos trabajaban en hacer producir la tierra; las propiedades contaban con una casa familiar y un pequeño muelle para transportar los productos.</p><p>Hacia mediados del siglo XX, con el desarrollo de nuevos caminos terrestres, fueron desapareciendo los barcos a vapor que navegaban por el lago, y con ellos se fue dejando de lado el comercio de sus linderas.</p><p>Con este cambio, pasamos de ser un pueblo netamente comercial a convertirnos poco a poco en un destino turístico por nuestra hermosa y característica naturaleza, flanqueados por las vistas de los imponentes volcanes Osorno, Calbuco y Puntiagudo.</p><p>Sin embargo, como nuestros antepasados, seguimos apostando por el cultivo de nuestra tierra y estamos empeñados en no dejar perder su legado.</p><p>Así nació esta idea de convertir un espacio baldío en un parque museo en el que expongamos los instrumentos, maquinarias y artefactos que usaron nuestros ancestros en el campo que hoy pisamos, y en el que incluiremos caminerías, senderos, mesas de picnics y una huerta.</p><p>Creemos en la autosustentabilidad, por eso el dinero recaudado lo usaremos para construir una cafetería que le de vida al lugar y a mediano plazo comenzar con el acondicionamiento que le hará honores a nuestra historia.</p><h3>¿Por qué ayudarnos?</h3><p>Porque estamos convencidos en la importancia de la conservación y el resguardo de nuestra historia, no solo como legado para las próximas generaciones, también porque entendemos su valor turístico.</p><p>Además, estamos seguros, porque ya lo hemos hecho, de que somos capaces de desarrollar un exitoso proyecto autosustentable que sirva de base para crecer y mantenerse.</p><h3>¿Qué necesitamos? </h3><p>Construir una cafetería sencilla, acogedora, funcional y responsable con el medio ambiente, con todos los implementos necesarios para su funcionamiento.</p><h3>¿Qué ganas al ayudarnos?</h3><p>Por cada 10, 25 o 50 $ que dones, tu nombre estará en una placa expuesta en el museo en reconocimiento a todos nuestros colaboradores, en las categorías Calbuco, Puntiagudo y Osorno, respectivamente.</p><p>Por tu aporte de 200 $ obtendrás dos almuerzos gratis en el restaurante Espantapájaros, válido por este año 2018 y el 2019, además de tu nombre en la placa de reconocimiento a todos nuestros donantes, en la categoría Colonos.</p><p>Por cada aporte de 1.000 $ recibirás alojamiento para dos personas en Puerto Octay, dos almuerzos gratis en el restaurante Espantapájaros, válido por este año 2018 y el 2019, y tu nombre en la placa de reconocimiento expuesta en el museo.</p><p>A todos los donantes, les enviaremos un carnet digital con su membresía como miembro honorario del museo.</p><h3>¿Cuáles son los riesgos del proyecto?</h3><p>Ante los riesgos, la convicción de poder superarlos. Somos una comunidad unida que trabaja incansablemente en ser cada vez más atractiva para los viajeros y turistas que nos visitan, aferrándonos a nuestro arraigo luchador.</p><p>No en vano, ya reacondicionamos el museo El Colono de Puerto Octay, en el que plasmamos la historia prehispánica, colona y contemporánea de nuestro pueblo. Esta experiencia nos sirve como guía y muestra de que nos empeñamos en no desistir ante las dificultades.</p><h3>¿De qué otra forma puedes ayudarnos?</h3><p>Compartir nuestra campaña por tus redes sociales nos ayudará a que llegue a muchas más personas y pronto podamos cumplir nuestra meta de recaudación.</p><p>Este es el link para que puedas compartirlo: <a href=""http://igg.me/at/museopuertooctay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://igg.me/at/museopuertooctay</a></p><p>---</p><p>English Version</p><h2>A historic and inclusive museum park for Puerto Octay</h2><h3>Help us to recover the history of our ancestors</h3><p> </p><p>We are descendants of the founders of Puerto Octay, a town in southern Chile, at the northern end of Lake Llanquihue.</p><p>We are committed to maintaining its legacy so that tourists and travelers know our history. For that, we want to build a cafeteria that allows us to give life to an inclusive and self-sustainable project to condition a space and turn it into a museum of machinery, instruments and artifacts used by our ancestors in the founding of our town.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Our history</h3><p>Puerto Octay was founded by 12 German families that arrived in the area in 1852, as part of an invitation made by the Chilean government to populate these places, in what is known as the German colonization.</p><p>In 1891, during the presidency of Jorge Montt, Puerto Octay formally became a commune, representing an important link in the fluvial commerce of Lake Llanquihue, for being the connection of the north with the south for agricultural and livestock production.</p><p>Warehouses, workshops and industries abounded, since from here the merchandise was transported to Puerto Varas and from there to Puerto Montt and Osorno.

Los productos que se comercializaban se obtenían de las tierras cercanas.Esta economía fue construida por los colonos: toda la familia y los vecinos trabajaban en hacer producir la tierra; las propiedades contaban con una casa familiar y un pequeño muelle para transportar los productos.Hacia mediados del siglo XX, con el desarrollo de nuevos caminos terrestres, fueron desapareciendo los barcos a vapor que navegaban por el lago, y con ellos se fue dejando de lado el comercio de sus linderas.Con este cambio, pasamos de ser un pueblo netamente comercial a convertirnos poco a poco en un destino turístico por nuestra hermosa y característica naturaleza, flanqueados por las vistas de los imponentes volcanes Osorno, Calbuco y Puntiagudo.Sin embargo, como nuestros antepasados, seguimos apostando por el cultivo de nuestra tierra y estamos empeñados en no dejar perder su legado.Así nació esta idea de convertir un espacio baldío en un parque museo en el que expongamos los instrumentos, maquinarias y artefactos que usaron nuestros ancestros en el campo que hoy pisamos, y en el que incluiremos caminerías, senderos, mesas de picnics y una huerta.Creemos en la autosustentabilidad, por eso el dinero recaudado lo usaremos para construir una cafetería que le de vida al lugar y a mediano plazo comenzar con el acondicionamiento que le hará honores a nuestra historia.¿Por qué ayudarnos?Porque estamos convencidos en la importancia de la conservación y el resguardo de nuestra historia, no solo como legado para las próximas generaciones, también porque entendemos su valor turístico.Además, estamos seguros, porque ya lo hemos hecho, de que somos capaces de desarrollar un exitoso proyecto autosustentable que sirva de base para crecer y mantenerse.¿Qué necesitamos? Construir una cafetería sencilla, acogedora, funcional y responsable con el medio ambiente, con todos los implementos necesarios para su funcionamiento.¿Qué ganas al ayudarnos?Por cada 10, 25 o 50 $ que dones, tu nombre estará en una placa expuesta en el museo en reconocimiento a todos nuestros colaboradores, en las categorías Calbuco, Puntiagudo y Osorno, respectivamente.Por tu aporte de 200 $ obtendrás dos almuerzos gratis en el restaurante Espantapájaros, válido por este año 2018 y el 2019, además de tu nombre en la placa de reconocimiento a todos nuestros donantes, en la categoría Colonos.Por cada aporte de 1.000 $ recibirás alojamiento para dos personas en Puerto Octay, dos almuerzos gratis en el restaurante Espantapájaros, válido por este año 2018 y el 2019, y tu nombre en la placa de reconocimiento expuesta en el museo.A todos los donantes, les enviaremos un carnet digital con su membresía como miembro honorario del museo.¿Cuáles son los riesgos del proyecto?Ante los riesgos, la convicción de poder superarlos. Somos una comunidad unida que trabaja incansablemente en ser cada vez más atractiva para los viajeros y turistas que nos visitan, aferrándonos a nuestro arraigo luchador.No en vano, ya reacondicionamos el museo El Colono de Puerto Octay, en el que plasmamos la historia prehispánica, colona y contemporánea de nuestro pueblo. Esta experiencia nos sirve como guía y muestra de que nos empeñamos en no desistir ante las dificultades.¿De qué otra forma puedes ayudarnos?Compartir nuestra campaña por tus redes sociales nos ayudará a que llegue a muchas más personas y pronto podamos cumplir nuestra meta de recaudación.Este es el link para que puedas compartirlo: http://igg.me/at/museopuertooctay---English VersionA historic and inclusive museum park for Puerto OctayHelp us to recover the history of our ancestors We are descendants of the founders of Puerto Octay, a town in southern Chile, at the northern end of Lake Llanquihue.We are committed to maintaining its legacy so that tourists and travelers know our history. For that, we want to build a cafeteria that allows us to give life to an inclusive and self-sustainable project to condition a space and turn it into a museum of machinery, instruments and artifacts used by our ancestors in the founding of our town.  Our historyPuerto Octay was founded by 12 German families that arrived in the area in 1852, as part of an invitation made by the Chilean government to populate these places, in what is known as the German colonization.In 1891, during the presidency of Jorge Montt, Puerto Octay formally became a commune, representing an important link in the fluvial commerce of Lake Llanquihue, for being the connection of the north with the south for agricultural and livestock production.Warehouses, workshops and industries abounded, since from here the merchandise was transported to Puerto Varas and from there to Puerto Montt and Osorno. The products that were commercialized were obtained from the nearby lands.This economy was built by the settlers: the whole family and the neighbors worked to make the land produce; the properties had a family house and a small dock to transport the products.Towards the middle of the 20th century, with the development of new terrestrial roads, the steamboat boats that sailed along the lake disappeared, and with them the trade in their boundaries disappeared.With this change, we went from being a purely commercial town to becoming little by little a tourist destination for our beautiful and characteristic nature, flanked by the views of the imposing volcanoes Osorno, Calbuco and Puntiagudo.However, like our ancestors, we continue to bet on the cultivation of our land and we are determined not to lose their legacy.This is how this idea of ​​converting a vacant space into a museum park was born, where we will expose the instruments, machinery and artifacts that our ancestors used in the field we are treading today, and in which we will include walkways, trails, picnic tables and a vegetable garden.We believe in self-sustainability, that's why the money raised will be used to build a cafeteria that gives life to the place and in the medium term to start with the conditioning that will honor our history.Why help us?Because we are convinced of the importance of conservation and the protection of our history, not only as a legacy for future generations, but also because we understand its tourist value.In addition, we are sure, because we have already done so, that we are capable of developing a successful self-sustaining project that serves as the basis for growth and maintenance.What do we need?To build a simple, welcoming, functional and responsible cafeteria with the environment, with all the necessary implements for its operation.What do you gain by helping us?For every 10, 25 or 50 $ you donate, your name will be on a plaque exhibited in the museum in recognition of all our collaborators, in the Calbuco, Puntiagudo and Osorno categories, respectively.For your contribution of $ 200 you will get two free lunches in the Espantapajaros restaurant, valid for this year 2018 and 2019, in addition to your name on the plaque of recognition to all our donors, in the Settlers category.For each contribution of $ 1,000 you will receive accommodation for two people in Puerto Octay, two free lunches in the Espantapajaros restaurant, valid for this year 2018 and 2019, and your name on the recognition plaque displayed in the museum.To all donors, we will send you a digital card with your membership as an honorary member of the museum.What are the risks of the project?Given the risks, the conviction of being able to overcome them.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">     Out of all the things I let go of, my fiancé was the most painful to let go of, but my company was the most significant because I had been building it for half a decade to get ready for a big mass-market launch. You see, back in November 2014,  <i>I humbly funded ""KoffeeReinvented.com"" on a different crowdfunding site called Kickstarter. </i>I successfully raised $30K in 30 days &amp;  in less than 5 years, I turned 30K into a multi-million-dollar, ""Stomach-Friendly Koffee"" company.<i> </i>After funding Kickstarter &amp; building the brand for 2 years on my own, I partnered w/an angel investor who funded nearly $3M more. This allowed me to build out the company in an unconventional way.  I spent the 3 years &amp; $3M building out an extensive product line, raising brand awareness throughout the LA area &amp; throughout also throughout the beverage industry, ALLLL while building a team for the startup &amp; an entire in-house production facility for the Ready To Drink (RTD) beverage to be produced by the millions.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">        When the time to launch the company on the mass market approached, I not only had interest from <i>Costco</i> &amp; <i>Amazon</i>, but <i>Costco</i> chose <strong><i>Koffee Reinvented</i></strong> as one of their first refrigerated products to ever be offered on Costco online &amp; shipped to your front door! I was ecstatic! It was about to happen in a big way for ""Koffee Reinvented!"" As I approached the long-awaited, highly anticipated launch of my 1st <i>big</i> company, I unexpectedly woke up one day mid-December 2018 covered in open sours w/a mysterious <i>flesh-eating virus</i> that withered my immune system to nothing! </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">       This was truly a curveball I didn't see coming! The infection moved fast &amp; ate through my entire body in just a couple weeks, leaving me more than 25 LBs lighter, still covered in open soars from head to toe, blind in my right eye &amp; now w/my hair falling out. At my weakest most vulnerable state, I decided to let my Koffee company float into the ethers like a balloon. In a nutshell, I  accepted a nominal amount of money. compared to what I could have made if I waited just a couple of years. The difference would have been hundreds of millions of dollars.  But regardless, I decided to exit through the back door with a check for $100K instead.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">     $100K sounds like a lot of money but it's not in the world of an entrepreneur living in modern-day Los Angeles. $100K in a modern-day big city will get you through a year if you're lucky. Not to mention, I was extremely ill &amp; unable to work for almost a year. I knew I needed to be both conservative &amp; strategic w/the spending of the $100K. So b/c of the circumstances, I concluded that spending the money on the buildout of a ""Tiny House on Wheels"" made the most sense. I knew that if I chose this route &amp; ran out of money, I'd still have a place to live without rent or a car payment to worry about. I knew it was time for me to give something radically new a try, so I jumped. I did it!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I took the leap of faith into the ""Cool Bus,"" hitting the road w/my dogs for nearly 5 months. I was so excited to reconnect to my roots and ravage through nature, living on foraged wild food, reading books in trees, bathing &amp; washing my clothes in the rivers! I remember laying blissed out under the stars in deep gratitude many nights, while the coyotes sang me to sleep! I had forgotten how important being in the natural world was for my all-around health! It was the ultimate remembering of who I was! </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">          In conclusion, I took a HUGE risk which turned out to have an even greater reward. A reward  so great that I have lkommitted to bringing this message to the rest of the world, in a Time when w people krave freedom from the systems in which we all live. I know my heart &amp; soul that there are many people out there RIGHT NOW looking for this message right now! People are ready to tap back into their authentic selves!"" I was shocked how many people walked into my Skoolie and jut start crying and hugging me. They all said the same thing. ""This is my Dream!""</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">     And so i share my story. And when I do share w/people, the most common question I </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> get is, ""WHY?!?! Why did </span>I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> hop in the Skoolie? ""  Why did I decide to clip the Karmic Koffee string, instead of trying to hold onto a sliver of equity? My answer; at the peak of my illness is that I didn't think I was gonna survive. And while writing my will &amp; saying my ""GoodByes,"" I came to the conclusion, and fast, that it was <i>one of my soul's main purposes</i> to kreate a ""Stomach-Friendly Koffee"" for people to benefit from, but not necessarily be the person who <i>cashed out</i> and/or became famous because of it. <i><strong>LIFE</strong></i> was dishing me a seriously painful lesson in ""Letting Go"" so </span>I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> could<i> </i>finally feel what it was like to</span> authentically be<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of service without the incentive of money or recognition. After all, I honestly didn't think I'd be around to see the brand grow, so </span>I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> surrendered to the lesson that was right in front of me. I let go,  let it <i>flow</i> &amp; watched the good times UnRoll like a carpet right in front of me! While it felt like the end of the world at the time, it all turned out much different then I thought it was going to. I went in with pain &amp; fear &amp; ended up with more confidence &amp; compassion. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">       <i>Furthermore</i>, it was comforting knowing that I passed the company I spent 5 years building to an individual who IS financially &amp; realistically able to carry it to the Global market. ""KoffeeReinvented"" became my ""offering"" to the world instead of my "" Financial End Game!"" And because of this, it became one of the most powerful lessons I've ever learned in my life. The unfathomable ending turned out to be the major Katalyst in me uncovering, discovering &amp; leaping into a more exciting LYFE worth living. A LYFE that felt more like home for me. It was as though a karmic string was clipped &amp; the lesson was ""PRICELESS!"" Quite literally!""</span></p>
<h2><u><strong>A NEW CHAPTER OF LYFE - ""The Cool Bus 2.0""</strong></u></h2>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">         I hope you enjoyed the excerpt from my new book. It will be out later this year on Amazon so that you can read the entire story. But in a nutshell, my soul led me down a rocky road where <strong><i>it knew</i></strong> I would let my hard work float away. If I didn't let ""Koffee,"" go, I never would have hopped in a solar fueled ""<i>Tiny House on wheels!""</i>  I would've kept building a manufacturing &amp; distribution company for years until it became a global brand! Instead of sell, manufacture, distribute, repeat....until the end of time, I got the privilege to JUST BE, let my hair down &amp; tap back into my true inner child on a daily basis, transforming my heart from the inside out, like an eagle that was remembering how to fly.  On my 5-month road trip, </span>I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> spent a significant amount of time hanging out with &amp; singing to children. I felt a deeper connection to youth than ever. The Universe conspired all events so that I could pass the torch &amp; re-birth into my<strong><i> next chapter</i></strong><i>, which represents the true me much better! </i> And because of all that transpired, I've drawn a refreshing new conclusion that everything in <i>LYFE</i> happens <i>""FOR US""  </i>vs. in <i>LIFE</i> everything happens <i>""TO US!""</i></span></p>
<p><strong><u>LESSONS I LEARNED FROM THIS </u></strong><strong><u>LYFESTYLE....</u></strong></p>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><i><u>I REINVENTED</u></i> </strong>my Relationship with “Bills"" by strategically minimizing them </span></li>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i><u><strong>I RE-CONNECTED </strong></u></i> to Mother Nature &amp; more specifically cold salt-water plunging. I built a deep &amp; profound relationship w/the ocean that I had never built before even living in LA. I opted out of the shower, making the ocean my new bathtub. My instinct said to go with sun-charged saltwater instead of recycled and repeatedly treated pipe water. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i><u><strong>I RE-IGNITED</strong></u></i> a deep curiosity &amp; playful child-like nature in the deepest parts of my being</span></li>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><i><u>I REMEMBERED</u></i> </strong>that instinctual nudity is natural &amp; it's OK to be comfortable naked in front of other people like children do w/out sexualizing the situation. #BodyPositivity</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i><u><strong>I RE-EDUCATED</strong></u></i> myself on different approaches to Bathroom &amp; hygiene habits from bathing/showering/peeing/pooing/Shaving to doing Laundry &amp; washing dishes </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i><u><strong>I REFLECTED</strong></u></i> deeply on my water consumption &amp; garbage production, resulting in a dramatic reduction in both. I also adopted recycling &amp; composting practices almost overnight. </span></li>

Is it learning about new more eco-friendly ways to walk to this earth plane? is it helping others thrive by educating them on health &amp; fitness, or maybe you read tarot cards and have developed a more intimate line of communication with the Universe in a world that doesn't seem to fully understand you? These are the topics that will be brought to the forefront of daily living when you take a leap of faith with me. </p>

         I want to thank you for taking the time to slow down & read my story. This campaign was kreatively krafted so that you'll enjoy exploring every corner of it! I launched it w/the short term goal of raising $111,000.00 in just 38 days, ALL for my new company""LYFE REINVENTED!"" And it's actually not MY company per se, but OUR company. Lyfe Reinvented is a company built by the people so that it can give back to the people. That' right I built this entire campaign with NO MONEY! ZERO DOLLARS. With soley vision & passion, I enrolled other beautiful souls to help me piece together this entire campaign, ALL so that WE, the people of the world, can move upward & onward in our lives. It's Thyme we each make the effort build to out our personal Health-Wealth & Happiness so that we can heal collectively.  It's Thyme we ALL do more than just survive.

      As you may have heard before, ""It takes a Village"" to build something ""extra-ordinary!"" Something that truly makes a difference in the world. Something w/authentic intentions & deep roots to hold those intentions in place when traveling down rocky roads. Along my path as an entrepreneur, i learned that this couldn't be truer. I learned all about leadership & how to build a team over the last 5 years I spent building my 1st major company ""Koffee Reinvented!"" And with all the experiences, knowledge & skills I acquired, I kommit to building another Trybe of masterful individuals that are also committed to being of service & spreading profound kreative messages to the world :-)
Before, I tell you anymore about my new company, I  would like to share the tragic yet transcendent story of how my previous company ""Koffee Reinvented"" ended. And more importantly, how it both triggered and inspired my long-awaited Reinvention.
      I've reinvented myself many times throughout this life, but my most recent REINVENTION was the most profound & dynamic, locked N loaded w/stories that'll keep you reading into the Weeee hours of the morning!  I kreated this champaign w/the intention that you'll not only have a lot of fun exploring it, and possibly shed a tear or two, but also so that you learn something. I invite  & challenge you to read to the very end. You'll be happy you did! ""INCREDIBLE BEGINNINGS BIRTHED FROM UNFATHOMABLE ENDINGS"" - AN EXCERPT FROM MY BOOK ""HOW TO REINVENT YOUR LYFE"" 
 
    ""Like many other tales of new beginnings, mine was followed by a horror movie ending! At the end of 2019, after 5 years of intense business building, I decided to push the master reset button to my entire LIFE & exit through the back door. I let everything in my LIFE, from my company to my big house, car & all my belongings GO! Even my phone number, mail-box, and fiance of 9 months disappeared.
     Out of all the things I let go of, my fiancé was the most painful to let go of, but my company was the most significant because I had been building it for half a decade to get ready for a big mass-market launch. You see, back in November 2014,  I humbly funded ""KoffeeReinvented.com"" on a different crowdfunding site called Kickstarter. I successfully raised $30K in 30 days &  in less than 5 years, I turned 30K into a multi-million-dollar, ""Stomach-Friendly Koffee"" company. After funding Kickstarter & building the brand for 2 years on my own, I partnered w/an angel investor who funded nearly $3M more. This allowed me to build out the company in an unconventional way.  I spent the 3 years & $3M building out an extensive product line, raising brand awareness throughout the LA area & throughout also throughout the beverage industry, ALLLL while building a team for the startup & an entire in-house production facility for the Ready To Drink (RTD) beverage to be produced by the millions.
        When the time to launch the company on the mass market approached, I not only had interest from Costco & Amazon, but Costco chose Koffee Reinvented as one of their first refrigerated products to ever be offered on Costco online & shipped to your front door! I was ecstatic! It was about to happen in a big way for ""Koffee Reinvented!"" As I approached the long-awaited, highly anticipated launch of my 1st big company, I unexpectedly woke up one day mid-December 2018 covered in open sours w/a mysterious flesh-eating virus that withered my immune system to nothing! 
       This was truly a curveball I didn't see coming! The infection moved fast & ate through my entire body in just a couple weeks, leaving me more than 25 LBs lighter, still covered in open soars from head to toe, blind in my right eye & now w/my hair falling out. At my weakest most vulnerable state, I decided to let my Koffee company float into the ethers like a balloon. In a nutshell, I  accepted a nominal amount of money. compared to what I could have made if I waited just a couple of years. The difference would have been hundreds of millions of dollars.  But regardless, I decided to exit through the back door with a check for $100K instead.
     $100K sounds like a lot of money but it's not in the world of an entrepreneur living in modern-day Los Angeles. $100K in a modern-day big city will get you through a year if you're lucky. Not to mention, I was extremely ill & unable to work for almost a year. I knew I needed to be both conservative & strategic w/the spending of the $100K. So b/c of the circumstances, I concluded that spending the money on the buildout of a ""Tiny House on Wheels"" made the most sense. I knew that if I chose this route & ran out of money, I'd still have a place to live without rent or a car payment to worry about. I knew it was time for me to give something radically new a try, so I jumped. I did it!
 I took the leap of faith into the ""Cool Bus,"" hitting the road w/my dogs for nearly 5 months. I was so excited to reconnect to my roots and ravage through nature, living on foraged wild food, reading books in trees, bathing & washing my clothes in the rivers! I remember laying blissed out under the stars in deep gratitude many nights, while the coyotes sang me to sleep! I had forgotten how important being in the natural world was for my all-around health! It was the ultimate remembering of who I was! 
          In conclusion, I took a HUGE risk which turned out to have an even greater reward. A reward  so great that I have lkommitted to bringing this message to the rest of the world, in a Time when w people krave freedom from the systems in which we all live. I know my heart & soul that there are many people out there RIGHT NOW looking for this message right now! People are ready to tap back into their authentic selves!"" I was shocked how many people walked into my Skoolie and jut start crying and hugging me. They all said the same thing. ""This is my Dream!""
     And so i share my story. And when I do share w/people, the most common question I  get is, ""WHY?!?! Why did I hop in the Skoolie? ""  Why did I decide to clip the Karmic Koffee string, instead of trying to hold onto a sliver of equity? My answer; at the peak of my illness is that I didn't think I was gonna survive. And while writing my will & saying my ""GoodByes,"" I came to the conclusion, and fast, that it was one of my soul's main purposes to kreate a ""Stomach-Friendly Koffee"" for people to benefit from, but not necessarily be the person who cashed out and/or became famous because of it. LIFE was dishing me a seriously painful lesson in ""Letting Go"" so I could finally feel what it was like to authentically be of service without the incentive of money or recognition. After all, I honestly didn't think I'd be around to see the brand grow, so I surrendered to the lesson that was right in front of me. I let go,  let it flow & watched the good times UnRoll like a carpet right in front of me! While it felt like the end of the world at the time, it all turned out much different then I thought it was going to. I went in with pain & fear & ended up with more confidence & compassion. 
       Furthermore, it was comforting knowing that I passed the company I spent 5 years building to an individual who IS financially & realistically able to carry it to the Global market. ""KoffeeReinvented"" became my ""offering"" to the world instead of my "" Financial End Game!"" And because of this, it became one of the most powerful lessons I've ever learned in my life. The unfathomable ending turned out to be the major Katalyst in me uncovering, discovering & leaping into a more exciting LYFE worth living. A LYFE that felt more like home for me. It was as though a karmic string was clipped & the lesson was ""PRICELESS!"" Quite literally!""
A NEW CHAPTER OF LYFE - ""The Cool Bus 2.0""
         I hope you enjoyed the excerpt from my new book. It will be out later this year on Amazon so that you can read the entire story. But in a nutshell, my soul led me down a rocky road where it knew I would let my hard work float away. If I didn't let ""Koffee,"" go, I never would have hopped in a solar fueled ""Tiny House on wheels!""  I would've kept building a manufacturing & distribution company for years until it became a global brand! Instead of sell, manufacture, distribute, repeat....until the end of time, I got the privilege to JUST BE, let my hair down & tap back into my true inner child on a daily basis, transforming my heart from the inside out, like an eagle that was remembering how to fly.  On my 5-month road trip, I spent a significant amount of time hanging out with & singing to children. I felt a deeper connection to youth than ever. The Universe conspired all events so that I could pass the torch & re-birth into my next chapter, which represents the true me much better!  And because of all that transpired, I've drawn a refreshing new conclusion that everything in LYFE happens ""FOR US""  vs. in LIFE everything happens ""TO US!""
LESSONS I LEARNED FROM THIS LYFESTYLE....

I REINVENTED my Relationship with “Bills"" by strategically minimizing them 
I REBUILT my  mental/emotional/physical health through minimalism 
I RE-CONNECTED  to Mother Nature & more specifically cold salt-water plunging. I built a deep & profound relationship w/the ocean that I had never built before even living in LA. I opted out of the shower, making the ocean my new bathtub. My instinct said to go with sun-charged saltwater instead of recycled and repeatedly treated pipe water. 
I RE-IGNITED a deep curiosity & playful child-like nature in the deepest parts of my being
I REACTIVATED  my unique singing voice, unique dance movements & the confidence to showcase them both
I REMEMBERED that instinctual nudity is natural & it's OK to be comfortable naked in front of other people like children do w/out sexualizing the situation. #BodyPositivity
I RE-EDUCATED myself on different approaches to Bathroom & hygiene habits from bathing/showering/peeing/pooing/Shaving to doing Laundry & washing dishes 
I REFLECTED deeply on my water consumption & garbage production, resulting in a dramatic reduction in both. I also adopted recycling & composting practices almost overnight. 
I RETURNED to a respectful way of seeing authoritative figures including city officials, police officers, and parking meter attendants

WHAT THE CB2 WILL TEACH THE WORLD?

1. The power of Taking risks/leaps of faith into Vulnerable/Transparent Authentic LIving. 

 2. Rent Free/Off-Grid/Eco-Friendly Living enabling us to reconnect to mother nature
3.  The power of  an ElectriK, Alkaline, Living Plant-Based LyfeStyle
4. Self Sustainable living by Urban Gardening & Raising Wild Food Awareness - including fruit trees 
5. Funktional Calisthenics Movements(Body Weight Fitness)/Yoga/Akro/Cirkus/Gymnastics
6.  Sound Healing, Chanting, MusiK & Dance Therapy 
7.  Art Therapy & the power of Kommunity Art
8.  Child-like playfulness & Natural/Instinctual Nudity
9.   Using Etymology to create next-level effective Kommunication
       Lyfe Reinvented is committed to spreading these specific messages. It is committed to enlightened education while having fun! Using the CB2.0 as this ""Educational Transportation Vehicle,"" we will show the world that the process of self-actualization can be fun. The CB2.0 is designed specifically to assist the people of the world in their Self-Actualization process. It creates a space for people to transform into more joyful, playful, self-sufficient, sovereign, yet konnected human beings. I am turning functional living into FunKtional living. 
       The Cool Bus 2.0 will not just be covered in Chalkboards for the kommunity to create community artwork together & will also be covered in body weight (calisthenics) fitness equipment to work out on, along with many other innovative unexpected ""POP-UP"" features that will shock & impress people over & over again. 
       The CoolBus 2.0 will be fueled by solar, wind turbines, hydroelectric & also will grow sprouts and food right inside the bus. Urban gardening/sprouting helps US reconnect to our roots as farmers while maintaining a more modern, urban Lyfestyle. It's easy to learn, mess-free & is such an incredibly self-sustainable way of living, being & showing up in a world that it naturally inspires others to take steps towards this LyfeStyle. And in a world that desperately needs more people that live in tandem with the laws of nature, I have committed to being a bridge for people to get there!  
Finally!!!! There will be amazing marketing opportunities ON the CB2.0. I will be promoting the most conscientious of products & services through the Cool Bus 2.0 so if this project touches your heart and/or soul, reach out to us to get on the ""Lyfe Reinvented"" roster right away! I am both humbled & honored at the opportunity to konnect & work together.

HELP ME LIGHT THE FIRE IN PEOPLES SOULS 
I learned from my 1st successful crowdfunding campaign that contributors fund ideas they are passionate about & people that they trust. And with that said, enough about me! I'd love to know more about you now! What are you passionate about? What gets your engine ticking? Is it organizing and simplifying your life? Is it learning about new more eco-friendly ways to walk to this earth plane? is it helping others thrive by educating them on health & fitness, or maybe you read tarot cards and have developed a more intimate line of communication with the Universe in a world that doesn't seem to fully understand you? These are the topics that will be brought to the forefront of daily living when you take a leap of faith with me. 
      You see, It wasn't always rainbows & butterflies for me , It was when I starting cutting my chains that I felt true freedom for the first time in my Lyfe. And that's exactly what I am here to help YOU do: become aware of the mulittude of chains & start cutting them one by one. Once you cut your own chains & set yourself free from the firm grip that other' opinions & the constructs of society have on so many people, you discover more of your authentic self, so that you can help others do the same. If you trust me & take my hand, I'll not let you down. In fact, I will hold your hand & walk right over the Rainbow Bridge w/U! Are you ready for your long-awaited Reinvention!?!?! NOW is a better time than ever! Let's GO!!!! Let's F#*K@NG Do this! 
I always have felt as if I was traveling through LIFE as a one-man army/lone ranger lost in a labyrinth hoping to come out the other end transformed and with a fleet of X-Men Superheros at my side. It didn't always turn out like that. But this time is different. Join this conscious fleet of love, light & laughter by contributing what you can to bring it to Lyfe. Help me educate & assist people in ways that help them help themselves. It's time we re-build o connected kommunities.

The event's goals are to introduce more people to art-house cinema. We believe that a story driven by a genuine expression can stimulate new thoughts that have the power to promote the fundamental principles of humanism; expand creative frontiers; stimulate new levels of compassion, and even lead to social change. The Festival is an organization dedicated to the discovery and development of new Artists and Audiences. The Festival seeks to support and inspire independent film and theatre artists from all over the world, and to introduce audiences to their new works.CICFF is a monthly film festival with an annual LIVE screening of the selected films. Each month more than 20 films from each category are Officially Selected and out of them one film receives the Best of Category award. In each month we publish an academic and detailed review of the award winning films in our International film magazine CULT CRITIC. In addition, the best of each month's category competes with all the others at the end of the year and the best of the best in each category will receive the prestigious GOLDEN FOX AWARD and they will be screened in the presence of a live audience.The annual event will be a glamorous red carpet premiere with press conferences and gala parties at Kolkata in the presence of international movie personalities. The participants will have excellent opportunities to exchange their ideas, ideologies and cultural innuendoes. The winners will have a chance to meet with the audience and participate in a Q and A after the screening.But WE NEED YOUR HELP to make it happen!

<h3>What's the Atari Burial Ground?</h3>
<p>In 1983, Atari buried nearly one million video games in a desert landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico, including copies of <i>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</i>, said to be the ""worst video game of all time."" The burial of <i>E.T.</i> by Atari became the stuff of modern mythology until its excavation in April 2014. Over the course of three days, Joe Lewandowski and the City of Alamogordo in cooperation with writer-director Zak Penn (<i>Ready Player One</i>, <i>Free Guy</i>) and five archaeologists and video game historians recovered just over 1,300 video game cartridges, boxes, and hardware from the Atari Burial Ground. The story is told in Penn's documentary, <i>Atari: Game Over</i>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The City of Alamogordo donated several copies of the excavated games to museums around the world and then auctioned most of the other games on eBay. While the games are with new owners, the archaeological data remain. </p>

Because I failed to meet my goal,I am refunding all contributions.I am currently revamping a few of the products,adding pieces for older girls,plus adding other characters etc.I will be relaunching the campaign in August. Again, I thank you all for your amazing support.Warmest Regards,Jos/Marcel  There’s no bones about it. From cartoons to brand mascots, from toys to TV shows, children find a sense of joy and camaraderie in their favorite childhood characters. They want to get things with their faces on them, dress like them for Halloween, put their stickers on their favorite notebooks – they want to be like them. But what happens when the faces splashed all over the things you love are consistently far different from your own?For children of color, it’s this experience that often leaves them feeling confused and insecure, wondering why there’s never anyone with their appearance doing the fun and interesting things that they identify with, are passionate about, and love.As a small business owner, it can be difficult to acquire funding for worthwhile projects such as these, but with the funds raised from this campaign, it is my intention to bring to market a line of AFFORDABLE (no item over $30) and QUALITY products for children of color – from anime and manga to 3D art, they’ll be able to see characters that look just like they do, promoting positive cultural awareness and expression.In it's simplest terms,I want our children to know that they are loved,and in return, they will love and respect themselves and each other.  I invite you to check out a selection of some of what we’ll be making available below,items such as backpacks, umbrellas, ballerina music boxes with brown/black ballerina,children's accessories (watches,bracelets,headbands etc.)                                                                                ""ORIGINAL SKAI BACKPACK""  Bag Size: 15 inches x 11.5 inches x 5.5 inches                                                                                                                        WE WANT TO ADD A BOYS LINE,PLUS THE PIECES BELOW & MORE !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bag Size: 16 inches x 11 inches x 5.5 inches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Boys T-shirts Available In Small.Medium.Large                                       Colors: Black and White The amount of searching that it takes to find good quality, decently priced products of this kind shouldn’t be the norm, and this is one business that is taking the first step to changing that for the African American community and its children.

We do this by combining the best aspects of crowdfunding with the ever popular subscription box model to send massive amounts of help to charities in need.</p><p>It's simple really. Each month we partner with deserving environmental, children and animal focused charities to create a mini crowdfunding campaign to support their mission. Subscribers pledge to send support to a cause they love and in return receive fun crowdfunding perks. Not only is Charity Crate a great way to discover organizations in need, but its a great way for donors to feel connected and actually look forward to helping when they give and get back! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565122323/utnlyq2fsrhow8ptegbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>PERKS</h3><p>Fun perks are what makes crowdfunding possible as they give supporters incentive to back projects. But how can you create worthwhile perks for charities and nonprofits that usually aren't interested in selling products in the first place? </p><p>Our unique solution to create exciting subscription boxes allows Charity Crate to offer perks with wide appeal that's beneficial to both charities and backers. The subscription box market is growing every year as more and more consumers look forward to getting packages delivered to their doorstep. And charities benefit by connecting with younger donors on a tangible and engaging level. </p><p>Currently, Charity Crate is offering two entry level subscription services designed to give everybody the ability to help change charity. </p><p><strong>Sticker Subscription Club</strong> - Subscribers can start out by joining our <a href=""https://charitycrater.com/collections/charity-crates/products/animal-sticker-subscription-club"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sticker subscription club</a> which sends stickers in support of our monthly charities in the mail along with a $5.00 pledge of support!

As a high school teacher, I was invited to participate in a Shark Tank style contest where some of my entrepreneurship students were challenged by local charities to come up with innovative ways to reach the younger donors they were struggling to connect with. </p><p>Listening to their problems, it became apparent a solution would require some out of the box thinking.</p><p>What if the act of charity could be turned into something <strong>fun</strong> that people actually looked <strong>forward</strong> to? What if you took the popularity of a LootCrate and turned its focus towards what you <strong>gave</strong> instead of what you <strong>got</strong>? What if you could wrap a charity up in a box?</p><p>What if you could make charity, cool? </p><p>From the very start, we designed Charity Crate to bring the most aid possible to those smaller and lesser known charities that do amazing work, but don't have the recognition and support they rightfully deserve. One thing we are proud about is our service costs charities nothing beyond the items they donate to create a Charity Crate. This allows us the opportunity to help all organizations regardless of their size, specifically those with tight budgets. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565124520/izxdlmkalhsb5qcsynsq.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>How It Works </h3><p>Upon sign up, subscribers can choose which cause to support and at what level, be it our sticker subscription club or a Charity Crate.. Our color coded system makes choosing what cause to support easy! Blue supports animals, green for environmental (of course), and purple for children based charities so you can support the causes that mean the most to you. </p><p>Each month, subscribers receive their special package delivered to their door full of products from each month's supported charity and the charity receives all the collected subscriber donations in one lump sum. Crowdfunding, for charities! </p><p>And Charity Crate offers guilt free donation that makes giving easy and convenient! We won't share your info with any organization so your generosity remains private. </p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">That means no pestering outside emails.

We see Charity Crate growing to become a similar platform that can do a world of good for amazing charities in need of a boost.</p><p>Truth is, so much time and energy within a nonprofit gets sucked away by the need to constantly acquire donations. Its a never ending battle that chews up their resources and limits their impact. </p><p>But Charity Crate can help to flip that script.</p><p>Imagine thousands of Charity Craters chipping in to provide an entire year's worth of funding for an organization in one month. Now free from chasing donors 24/7, imagine how the program could expand and flourish when all their energy is focused on their mission. Think how their outreach could expand. How their services could grow.</p><p>How many more animals could be saved?</p><p>How many more children can be reached? </p><p>How many more environments could be restored? </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563407902/aln6bler6shknkxawp1o.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>The Road Ahead And How You Can Help </h3><p>Like any new company, coordinating a successful launch is always difficult. Success is never guaranteed and most ideas never even make it past the planning stage.    </p><p>And unlike a lot of other Indiegogo campaigns we're not here asking for your preorders or validation of our idea.</p><p><a href=""https://charitycrater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charity Crate</a> is already live and taking subscribers so if you want to help us change charity, then by all means click <a href=""https://charitycrater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and subscribe to help some great causes.</p><p>Instead we're here asking for your support to help us grow. </p><p>The subscription box market is a popular one and becoming more crowded by the day. And while it's true there's a bunch of boxes out there that give back to charity already, which we love, none are 100% dedicated to charitable causes and nobody gives back as much in donations as Charity Crate is designed to do. Their business model is built around selling products while ours is built around crowdfunding charities in need. </p><p>For Charity Crate to succeed we need your help to increase our marketing and reach so we can compete in the wild world of subscription box madness. </p><p>Luckily, you can help us change charity in three easy ways.</p><p><b>1. Pledge And Help Us Buy Ads</b></p><p>Your generous pledge though Indiegogo will help give us the marketing budget needed to connect with caring subscribers through an extensive marketing campaign. </p><p>Reaching out to popular influencers on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charity_crate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/CharityCrate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pintrest</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YtHt-uk6n0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube</a> is vital but costs us money. Sustained digital ads are a cornerstone of any online marketing strategy but can be pricey. And since we do not charge charities for our services our initial marketing budget must come from backers and supporters like you. </p><p>However, like any good crowdfunding campaign, we are offering some great and collectible perks to make your assistance worthwhile. :) </p><p><strong>2. Sign Up For A Charity Crate</strong></p><p>Why wait? Sign up and <a href=""https://charitycrater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">subscribe for a crate on our website</a> today! </p><p>Choose to support a different animal, environmental or children's charity every month and join either our sticker subscription club or subscribe to a Charity Crate to get in on the fun! </p><p><strong>3.

We do this by combining the best aspects of crowdfunding with the ever popular subscription box model to send massive amounts of help to charities in need.It's simple really. Each month we partner with deserving environmental, children and animal focused charities to create a mini crowdfunding campaign to support their mission. Subscribers pledge to send support to a cause they love and in return receive fun crowdfunding perks. Not only is Charity Crate a great way to discover organizations in need, but its a great way for donors to feel connected and actually look forward to helping when they give and get back! PERKSFun perks are what makes crowdfunding possible as they give supporters incentive to back projects. But how can you create worthwhile perks for charities and nonprofits that usually aren't interested in selling products in the first place? Our unique solution to create exciting subscription boxes allows Charity Crate to offer perks with wide appeal that's beneficial to both charities and backers. The subscription box market is growing every year as more and more consumers look forward to getting packages delivered to their doorstep. And charities benefit by connecting with younger donors on a tangible and engaging level. Currently, Charity Crate is offering two entry level subscription services designed to give everybody the ability to help change charity. Sticker Subscription Club - Subscribers can start out by joining our sticker subscription club which sends stickers in support of our monthly charities in the mail along with a $5.00 pledge of support! Stick 'em where ever you want to show the causes you care most about!  Charity Crate - To offer the most support when pledging, subscribers can sign up for our Charity Crates!  Each one supports a different environmental, children or animal focused charity each month and comes packed with a t-shirt, fun charity loot, information, and a pledge of $15.00 back to charity! Discover new charities when you unbox then share your crate online to raise social awareness and feel good knowing you helped support a deserving charity each month! Why Charity Crate? The idea for Charity Crate actually began two years ago. As a high school teacher, I was invited to participate in a Shark Tank style contest where some of my entrepreneurship students were challenged by local charities to come up with innovative ways to reach the younger donors they were struggling to connect with. Listening to their problems, it became apparent a solution would require some out of the box thinking.What if the act of charity could be turned into something fun that people actually looked forward to? What if you took the popularity of a LootCrate and turned its focus towards what you gave instead of what you got? What if you could wrap a charity up in a box?What if you could make charity, cool? From the very start, we designed Charity Crate to bring the most aid possible to those smaller and lesser known charities that do amazing work, but don't have the recognition and support they rightfully deserve. One thing we are proud about is our service costs charities nothing beyond the items they donate to create a Charity Crate. This allows us the opportunity to help all organizations regardless of their size, specifically those with tight budgets. How It Works Upon sign up, subscribers can choose which cause to support and at what level, be it our sticker subscription club or a Charity Crate.. Our color coded system makes choosing what cause to support easy! Blue supports animals, green for environmental (of course), and purple for children based charities so you can support the causes that mean the most to you. Each month, subscribers receive their special package delivered to their door full of products from each month's supported charity and the charity receives all the collected subscriber donations in one lump sum. Crowdfunding, for charities! And Charity Crate offers guilt free donation that makes giving easy and convenient! We won't share your info with any organization so your generosity remains private. That means no pestering outside emails. No passive aggressive phone calls. No ""lists"" to make.The Impact We love crowdfunding sites like Indigogo because they help foster a huge amount of impact through the combination of individual donations and word of mouth. We see Charity Crate growing to become a similar platform that can do a world of good for amazing charities in need of a boost.Truth is, so much time and energy within a nonprofit gets sucked away by the need to constantly acquire donations. Its a never ending battle that chews up their resources and limits their impact. But Charity Crate can help to flip that script.Imagine thousands of Charity Craters chipping in to provide an entire year's worth of funding for an organization in one month. Now free from chasing donors 24/7, imagine how the program could expand and flourish when all their energy is focused on their mission. Think how their outreach could expand. How their services could grow.How many more animals could be saved?How many more children can be reached? How many more environments could be restored? The Road Ahead And How You Can Help Like any new company, coordinating a successful launch is always difficult. Success is never guaranteed and most ideas never even make it past the planning stage.    And unlike a lot of other Indiegogo campaigns we're not here asking for your preorders or validation of our idea.Charity Crate is already live and taking subscribers so if you want to help us change charity, then by all means click here and subscribe to help some great causes.Instead we're here asking for your support to help us grow. The subscription box market is a popular one and becoming more crowded by the day. And while it's true there's a bunch of boxes out there that give back to charity already, which we love, none are 100% dedicated to charitable causes and nobody gives back as much in donations as Charity Crate is designed to do. Their business model is built around selling products while ours is built around crowdfunding charities in need. For Charity Crate to succeed we need your help to increase our marketing and reach so we can compete in the wild world of subscription box madness. Luckily, you can help us change charity in three easy ways.1. Pledge And Help Us Buy AdsYour generous pledge though Indiegogo will help give us the marketing budget needed to connect with caring subscribers through an extensive marketing campaign. Reaching out to popular influencers on Instagram, Pintrest, Youtube is vital but costs us money. Sustained digital ads are a cornerstone of any online marketing strategy but can be pricey. And since we do not charge charities for our services our initial marketing budget must come from backers and supporters like you. However, like any good crowdfunding campaign, we are offering some great and collectible perks to make your assistance worthwhile. :) 2. Sign Up For A Charity CrateWhy wait? Sign up and subscribe for a crate on our website today! Choose to support a different animal, environmental or children's charity every month and join either our sticker subscription club or subscribe to a Charity Crate to get in on the fun! 3. ShareIt's an internet staple, but an old fashioned share really does help spread our message to others. You can help us help others by sharing this Indiegogo page. Share our website! Share our Youtube videos! Like and share the hell out of us on Instragram, Facebook, Pintrest or Twitter! While a share costs you nothing, the amount of good it can generate back is a huge and we thank and value every shoutout that comes our way! Honestly, THANK YOU! #ChangeCharity Though our needs as a startup may be small, they pale in comparison to the needs of so many of the hardworking charities out there.

<p>Over forty years ago, a 7th grader skipped school to attend the local Gentle Thursday Smoke-In on the lawn at Penn State. The Freak Brothers were his comic book heroes and he just wanted to be the best pothead he could. Yes, it was the seventies… and I now realize I might have been part of the narrative keeping pot illegal another four decades. But hey... you got to live your life.</p>
<p>Shortly after quitting high school and then getting my GED in jail, on parole and in major transitions, I landed with a group house of deadheads in Maryland. I am pretty sure they saved my soul. We called ourselves The Day Job Rehabilitation Center, and this was where a young freak quit his printing job, learned how to tie dye, and started following Jerry.

He thought he knew everything about pot. He knew enough, and did enough, to get a pot strain named after him.  R.I.P. Jack. Thanks for the inspirations.</p>
<p>With that, I caught the hemp bug and bought my first roll of fabric in 1989... or was that 1990?</p>

<p>Somewhere around 1996 my life took a small detour. I got the daddy bug bad. I got served papers by Anheuser-Busch for a parody pot t-shirt on the receiving line at my wedding. I moved back east, eventually selling my hemp company to a friend in Washington DC. Then moved to Vermont to build a home and a family.</p>
<p>In Vermont I started the Box of Java, a small cybercafe and coffee shop to meet the neighbors and make new friends. This worked well… so well that we transformed the place into an all-volunteer nonprofit social club. Replaced the cash register with a magic hat and did everything the same… except by donation… as the New Avenue Collective. That was fun until it closed in 2005.</p>

This is a protest. It's a comment on the razor industry and the beauty industry at large. It's a choice for progress and equality over the status quo.</p><p>We need you. This razor aims to start a conversation. One that will spearhead change. And if enough people take their business away from Gillette, Wilkinson Sword and other major razor brands, they'll have to reassess their business model, to rethink their branding and advertising and their gender pricing discrimination. That's the dream. But we've got to start somewhere. And we'll start by making some noise, with your help. </p><p>To keep the price down, we’ll have to make a minimum of 500 razors, so we'll need need at least £5000 for this project to go ahead.</p><p>Each razor costs £4.20 to manufacture. Our packaging is made from recycled card and costs 80p. So we'll retail at £5. Not one penny more. You've been overcharged for razors long enough. That’s £2,500. We’ll also need £1,500 for extra blades, so we can keep you stocked and your razor can keep on giving. </p><p>We're asking for £5000 because we need to cover the cost of shipping, as our razor is being manufactured in China, by an ethical manufacturer and the cost of promotional materials. </p><p>But that's just our baseline. We want to get our razors and our message to as many people as possible. (We're making a start by plastering protest stickers onto every razor in every shop in London. If you see one of our stickers in the wild, tweet us a photo at @hair_is_hair_.)</p><p>We also wanted to make Hair is Hair as eco as possible, that’s why our razor is made of metal, not plastic.</p><p>Our packaging is eco-friendly, made from recycled kraft paper. And we’re using as little of it as possible. It's just a piece of card. Nothing fancy. We wanted to give you the cheapest, fairest razor. That’s what matters to us.</p><p>The more money we raise, the more razors we can manufacture, the further we can drive the price down in the future.</p><p>And yes, we know you can get those orange Bic 'unisex' razors but they're disposable, difficult to shave with and bad for the environment. Plus, Bic also make those same ones in pink for women and call them 'Bic Lady'. The male counterpart is aptly named 'Bic Blue': they're hardly champions of equality. We need a permanent solution and we need a solution that is going to light a fire underneath the razor industry's arse.

Pink, peach and curvaceous for the ladies. What is this, the 1950s?These marketing tactics fuel outdated models of ‘femininity’ and ‘masculinity’. And produce clichéd, patronising advertising.But here’s what really riles us: ‘feminine’ razors cost more, even though the technology is identical.Women, on average, are charged 37% more than men for the same products and services. This is known as The Pink Tax.Cut the crap.Does pink cost more to produce than grey, black or navy? We’re looking at you Big Razor Company.So we’re asking: why pay more for pink?Introducing: Hair is Hair the world’s first unisex razor.Unisex design. Unisex price. Unisex shave.Because, well, #hairishair.What we need & what you get:You’ll be the first to get your hands on our unisex razor, shaving whilst taking a stand.This is more than just a razor. This is a protest. It's a comment on the razor industry and the beauty industry at large. It's a choice for progress and equality over the status quo.We need you. This razor aims to start a conversation. One that will spearhead change. And if enough people take their business away from Gillette, Wilkinson Sword and other major razor brands, they'll have to reassess their business model, to rethink their branding and advertising and their gender pricing discrimination. That's the dream. But we've got to start somewhere. And we'll start by making some noise, with your help. To keep the price down, we’ll have to make a minimum of 500 razors, so we'll need need at least £5000 for this project to go ahead.Each razor costs £4.20 to manufacture. Our packaging is made from recycled card and costs 80p. So we'll retail at £5. Not one penny more. You've been overcharged for razors long enough. That’s £2,500. We’ll also need £1,500 for extra blades, so we can keep you stocked and your razor can keep on giving. We're asking for £5000 because we need to cover the cost of shipping, as our razor is being manufactured in China, by an ethical manufacturer and the cost of promotional materials. But that's just our baseline. We want to get our razors and our message to as many people as possible. (We're making a start by plastering protest stickers onto every razor in every shop in London. If you see one of our stickers in the wild, tweet us a photo at @hair_is_hair_.)We also wanted to make Hair is Hair as eco as possible, that’s why our razor is made of metal, not plastic.Our packaging is eco-friendly, made from recycled kraft paper. And we’re using as little of it as possible. It's just a piece of card. Nothing fancy. We wanted to give you the cheapest, fairest razor. That’s what matters to us.The more money we raise, the more razors we can manufacture, the further we can drive the price down in the future.And yes, we know you can get those orange Bic 'unisex' razors but they're disposable, difficult to shave with and bad for the environment. Plus, Bic also make those same ones in pink for women and call them 'Bic Lady'. The male counterpart is aptly named 'Bic Blue': they're hardly champions of equality. We need a permanent solution and we need a solution that is going to light a fire underneath the razor industry's arse. A razor that says: 'we're not going to stand for this anymore', a razor that allows us, as consumers, to have our voices heard. What else can I do to shave the world?Every time you see evidence of outdated, patronising gendered branding, tweet it.Look out for price differences in your local shops and supermarkets. Make some noise.Use #hairishair. Tweet at major razor companies. Make sure everyone you know is aware of the Pink Tax, if they aren't already.Boycott brands that use sexist marketing tactics and brands that charge more for women's products. As featured in:   http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion...https://www.the-pool.com/beauty/skincare/2017/2... In case you needed any more persuasion: Look us straight in the eyes and tell us this isn't fucked up:   Get your hands on these perks:£12 Sticker Pack: Protest razor, protest stickers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Situated in the City of Bayside, the Bayside Film Festival had been previously running for 12 years and was once a well renowned event in Melbourne. Due to increasing expenditures, the Bayside Film Festival was no longer able to be supported by the local council and was consequently terminated. 2015 marked the final year of the festival, and today a not for profit organisation, the 'Bayside Film Festival Inc.' is looking to restore the film festival to its original stature, without burdening local taxpayers. Our objective is to help local filmmakers, directors and artists show off their hard work to audiences local and abroad, and to provide them with the opportunity to network with like-minded individuals. We are wanting to attract people from all over Australia to the beautiful seascape in Bayside, while also helping grow local businesses and communities. Our festival will be running over three nights showing short, feature, documentary, drama, action, music and animated videos/films created by talented artists and filmmakers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help! The Bayside Film Festival Inc. is a <strong>not for profit organisation</strong> solely made to run the Bayside Film Festival. Meaning that <strong>ALL</strong> money raised goes towards the planning and running of the festival. <strong>Our organisation survives only through donations and small community grants </strong>and<strong> </strong>therefore needs any help it can get.<strong> </strong>Our goal is to raise $15,000 in order to plan, create, staff and run the festival. Through our budget it has been estimated that the entire festival for this year will cost at a minimum $15,000 for the event to take place. This is including the venue, screen/projector hire, seating, catering, marketing and prizes. We are looking to help build the festival into a self sustaining annual event that can continually assist artists and filmmakers in their future endeavours. Therefore any extra money raised will be put directly towards making this year's festival even better, and contributing to the future years of the event. If our financial goal is not achieved all funds will be put towards the event, and our team will create a festival that accommodates the funds raised.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign we will provide you with tickets, passes and packages depending on the amount you contribute. No contributor will go unnoticed and we will thank every individual that helps us out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will you be helping out an ever growing community of artists, filmmakers, directors, editors and producers, but you will be helping the City of Bayside grow. You will be helping make a once appreciated festival return to its roots and building an event for our community to be recognised for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Besides the ambitious project of creating a film festival there are a few challenges that the organisation needs to overcome:</p>
<p>- Audience attendance: As with all events, a festival only survives from the people that go to it. We are unsure as to the amount of people that will attend the festival, but our objective is to have a minimum of 200 attendees to make the festival continuously viable. We have projected that the festival will need a heavy focus on marketing in order to attract interest and attention.</p>
<p>- Film submissions. While the audience does play a vital role, there would be no audience if there were no films. We are expecting to get a substantial amount of films submitted from what research we have done, but nonetheless this could still potentially be a risk.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello, friends!   My name is Nick Heiwach.  “ARTtabor” is a SOUND, VIDEO recording and editing STUDIO ON THE CAR, free for authors of projects: MUSIC, THEATER, CINEMA, FESTIVALS. I am an associate professor of theatrical art, 20 years of teaching practice. How many I remember myself, I always record something, photoshoots somebody, put on plays, organize festivals.  40 years ago, I recorded my first album. In 1978 I organized the rock group “ZAKIDONY”.</li>
<li> In 2010 burned my studio, but some equipment was saved. When I threw the tools out of the burning house, I thought that maybe it,s a sign and the road continues… Now I have a small studio for audio, video recording and editing. I am often invited in various projects.  I have 11 guitars, lost of drums and heavy equipment. Moving from city to city with the studio, without a car it became very difficult. And I got the idea to put together a studio on the car.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540739546/ov54enhxsblcmuuz1k8n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> Now I have assistants with whom will beable to implement many creative projects, with the help of crowdfanding and place them on my YouTube channel “HEIWACH cinema”. A member of the team: Alexandr Krivenkov, Dordzhe Sempa, Anastasiya Siciliano-Lorenz, my sons Andronick and Ostap Heiwach. I and my sons built a theater in the Altai Mountains.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In order to best illuminate our next projects, we need to update the technique and prepare for the journey. For this you need to purchase a few more microphones, several small video cameras and a video console, a set of lighting for film sets. To conduct for you live broad casts in excellent quality. In order not to get cold on the road, you need to buy: generators, heaters, shelves, sleeping bags.And of course the bus or car with a trailer. As gifts, I can offer to print YOUR NAME or PHOTO on the car-studio, t-shirts and baseball caps with the project logo and a new video of the musical-plastic performance ""CONTEMPORARY OF THE MAIN"" on poems of Russian poets of the XIX-XXI centuries, the theater-studio ""HEART MIRA ""from the village of Lesnoye, the foothills of the Altai, director A. Siciliano-Lorenz, which I am now mounting.</li></ul>

Hello, friends!   My name is Nick Heiwach.  “ARTtabor” is a SOUND, VIDEO recording and editing STUDIO ON THE CAR, free for authors of projects: MUSIC, THEATER, CINEMA, FESTIVALS. I am an associate professor of theatrical art, 20 years of teaching practice. How many I remember myself, I always record something, photoshoots somebody, put on plays, organize festivals.  40 years ago, I recorded my first album. In 1978 I organized the rock group “ZAKIDONY”.
 In 2010 burned my studio, but some equipment was saved. When I threw the tools out of the burning house, I thought that maybe it,s a sign and the road continues… Now I have a small studio for audio, video recording and editing. I am often invited in various projects.  I have 11 guitars, lost of drums and heavy equipment. Moving from city to city with the studio, without a car it became very difficult. And I got the idea to put together a studio on the car.


 
 Now I have assistants with whom will beable to implement many creative projects, with the help of crowdfanding and place them on my YouTube channel “HEIWACH cinema”. A member of the team: Alexandr Krivenkov, Dordzhe Sempa, Anastasiya Siciliano-Lorenz, my sons Andronick and Ostap Heiwach. I and my sons built a theater in the Altai Mountains.

In order to best illuminate our next projects, we need to update the technique and prepare for the journey. For this you need to purchase a few more microphones, several small video cameras and a video console, a set of lighting for film sets. To conduct for you live broad casts in excellent quality. In order not to get cold on the road, you need to buy: generators, heaters, shelves, sleeping bags.And of course the bus or car with a trailer. As gifts, I can offer to print YOUR NAME or PHOTO on the car-studio, t-shirts and baseball caps with the project logo and a new video of the musical-plastic performance ""CONTEMPORARY OF THE MAIN"" on poems of Russian poets of the XIX-XXI centuries, the theater-studio ""HEART MIRA ""from the village of Lesnoye, the foothills of the Altai, director A. Siciliano-Lorenz, which I am now mounting.

I'm Danielle and I am inviting you to be part of my ministry in living life with refugees who are being resettled or are resettled here in the United States. </h3><p>In 2011, while in college, I was introduced to the Burmese refugee community who were new to the community. That was when God first lit a fire. That school year, I changed my major to cultural anthropology to which I focused all of my studies in learning about the refugee community. That semester, I learned how to live life with the Burmese refugee community. I got involved with helping out in ESL classes, assisting with transportation, but most of all living life with the people of the Burmese community. That summer, I did an internship in Chicago through a ministry called Youth With A Mission where I partnered up with them in starting a weekly ESL cafe and finding organizations for the ministry to work alongside with. That summer, I became a certified ESL tutor and was introduced to an Iraqi family that had just moved to Chicago and my summer outside of the internship was living life alongside my new friends. I showed them how to use public transportation, was their ESL tutor, and got to show them around the city. One of my favorite memories was taking the family to Millenium Park to enjoy some music which was their first time on the ""L"" and downtown Chicago! This was the second fire lit by God. </p><p>In 2013, God lit a bigger fire inside of me. He took me to Jordan where I lived for a month in a refugee camp serving Palestinian refugees. I lived with a family for an entire month inside the camp. I volunteered for UNICEF as an ESL tutor. I also served alongside an organization that was committed to working with women who lived in the camp. I created a program using art to teach community development to girls ages 10-12. I learned and experienced a lot in that month. I saw brokenness. I saw struggles. I saw and experienced real hospitality in the homes that I visited and the women who I met that would invite me for dinner. I experienced love from the family that I lived with through the serving of tea and lots of laughter and family time in spite of their struggles and brokenness. </p><p>After graduating, I was called to stay and practice hospitality. These past several years, I have made friends from all around the world, women from the Muslim community, and a few newly arrived immigrants. There has been a lot of tea and coffee poured and drank. Food prepared and eaten. Lots of love, ups and downs, learning and growing along the way.</p><p>Fast forward to 2018, God has been teaching about grace and how to practice grace not just in my actions of service but with my words. I started Words That Are Said. Leaving words of hope, encouragement, and inspiration on pieces of paper behind places that I was at for people to find. This past year, He has taken me on this journey of healing as well and mending my heart.  During this time, God has laid out His purpose for my life and that is to go into a full-time ministry of service/hospitality. I am taking a Discipleship Training class for 3 months through Youth With a Missions that is 100% focused on serving the refugee community in Idaho. The program is set up to learn about God and His purpose and ministry training through in-class learning and then through practicing what we learn. Also, I hope to get certified in teaching ESL through a Connect Language. All of this will help me move closer to the final blueprint that God has architected out for me to own a home and open that home to women/family in the refugee community and live life with them and show God's love and show who He is. Your donations will go towards the rest of what I have saved up this past year. I have been setting aside my tips to go towards my Discipleship Training class and ESL certification. God has been and still is very faithful in this time of waiting to go into a full-time ministry of service/hospitality. I invite you to partner alongside me and my ministry of serving refugees in our communities. Most of all, I ask you for your prayers because prayer is vital!! I greatly appreciate all that you do and your encouragement! I will be praying for you as well! Again, thank you for your prayers, encouragement, and donations.</p><p> </p><p>Much love and blessings, </p><p>Danielle </p><p>website: wordsthataresaid.weebly.com</p><p>instagram: @wordsthataresaid</p></div>","Hello!

En effet, il cherche à implanter, dans les milieux scolaires, soit 500 écoles, 500 boites-à-livres contenant chacune, au moins, 500 cents livres. D'où, un total 250.000 livres seront utilisés et en circulation dans les espaces scolaires ciblés dans le projet.</p><p>Cette mouvance permettant aux jeunes écoliers d'avoir accès à la culture et l'éducation, via le livre et lecture sera soutenue par une équipe d'animateurs bénévoles (2 animateurs/ zone) qui auront à rencontrer les directeurs, ices d'écoles, planifier et gérer les archives des boites (prêt de livre, porte-folio / service de bibliothécaire.), les activités d'animation ludique, les rencontres autour du livre et de la lecture.</p><p>Le projet permettra aussi de découvrir, le niveau d'intérêt des écoles pour une meilleure qualité d'éducation et de formation des élèves, car, l'environnement scolaire, élément clé dans le processus de formation de l'élève, doit favoriser l'apprentissage de ce dernier. Par ailleurs, l'univers culturel des bénéficiaires sera ouvert, ils connaîtront des ouvrages dont le sujet diffère des habitudes, le plaisir du livre et le goût de la lecture seront transmis; les élèves seront curieux à entrer dans les bibliothèques et peut-être à s'y abonner.</p><p>En somme, responsabiliser et conscientiser les jeunes à développer, chez eux, un intérêt, un goût pour l'éducation et la culture afin qu'ils aient d'outils capables de les aider à faire face aux défis des avenirs lointains.</p><p><u><strong>Le Contexte du projet</strong></u></p><p>De nos jours, la majorité des écoles privées et publiques de la communauté de Delmas-Tabarre fonctionne sans la moindre existence d'un espace procurant la possibilité de lire à des élèves, qui n'ont, souvent, ni les moyens d'acheter des livres ni l'accès à la moindre source de lecture.</p><p>Delmas a, aujourd'hui, une population d'environ 395 260 habitants, c'est une commune de 27,74 km² de superficie ; plus riche de l'aire métropolitaine avec des recettes fiscales situées entre 93 à 400 millions de gourdes. Il n'y a pas vraiment d'accès à des espaces de loisirs sains, on peut compter sur le bout des doigts le nombre d'espaces de bibliothèques publiques qui existent dans cette commune-là malgré la présence d'un grand nombre d'institutions d'enseignement dont trois Lycées, plus de cent soixante-dix (170) écoles primaires, trente et une (31) écoles secondaires (IHSI, 2003). On trouve, par exemple, la bibliothèque municipale de Delmas (Delmas 49), la bibliothèque spécialisée de Roger Dorsinville (BSRD) de la SHAA (Delmas 31), la Bibliothèque (Delmas 3 et/ou 5).</p><p>Tout comme, Tabarre a une population d'environ 118 477 habitants (IHSI, 2009) avec une superficie de 24,47 km²; limitrophe à la commune dont, jadis, elle fut partie. Tabarre accueille la plus grande Aéroport du pays, contient plusieurs parcs industriels et commerciaux. Il y a plus d'une centaine institution d'enseignement dont deux Lycées. Or, à Tabarre il existe seulement deux bibliothèques. L'une, est la bibliothèque communautaire de Tabarre de la Fondation Désir d'Haïti, située à Clercine 8 et l'autre, c'est le Centre Culturel SELAKOUN, située à tabarre 48.</p><p>Les communes dont nous faisons mention dans le cadre de ce projet, sont vraiment en nécessité d'intervention urgente, tant au niveau culturel (loisirs) qu'éducatif.

En effet, il cherche à implanter, dans les milieux scolaires, soit 500 écoles, 500 boites-à-livres contenant chacune, au moins, 500 cents livres. D'où, un total 250.000 livres seront utilisés et en circulation dans les espaces scolaires ciblés dans le projet.Cette mouvance permettant aux jeunes écoliers d'avoir accès à la culture et l'éducation, via le livre et lecture sera soutenue par une équipe d'animateurs bénévoles (2 animateurs/ zone) qui auront à rencontrer les directeurs, ices d'écoles, planifier et gérer les archives des boites (prêt de livre, porte-folio / service de bibliothécaire.), les activités d'animation ludique, les rencontres autour du livre et de la lecture.Le projet permettra aussi de découvrir, le niveau d'intérêt des écoles pour une meilleure qualité d'éducation et de formation des élèves, car, l'environnement scolaire, élément clé dans le processus de formation de l'élève, doit favoriser l'apprentissage de ce dernier. Par ailleurs, l'univers culturel des bénéficiaires sera ouvert, ils connaîtront des ouvrages dont le sujet diffère des habitudes, le plaisir du livre et le goût de la lecture seront transmis; les élèves seront curieux à entrer dans les bibliothèques et peut-être à s'y abonner.En somme, responsabiliser et conscientiser les jeunes à développer, chez eux, un intérêt, un goût pour l'éducation et la culture afin qu'ils aient d'outils capables de les aider à faire face aux défis des avenirs lointains.Le Contexte du projetDe nos jours, la majorité des écoles privées et publiques de la communauté de Delmas-Tabarre fonctionne sans la moindre existence d'un espace procurant la possibilité de lire à des élèves, qui n'ont, souvent, ni les moyens d'acheter des livres ni l'accès à la moindre source de lecture.Delmas a, aujourd'hui, une population d'environ 395 260 habitants, c'est une commune de 27,74 km² de superficie ; plus riche de l'aire métropolitaine avec des recettes fiscales situées entre 93 à 400 millions de gourdes. Il n'y a pas vraiment d'accès à des espaces de loisirs sains, on peut compter sur le bout des doigts le nombre d'espaces de bibliothèques publiques qui existent dans cette commune-là malgré la présence d'un grand nombre d'institutions d'enseignement dont trois Lycées, plus de cent soixante-dix (170) écoles primaires, trente et une (31) écoles secondaires (IHSI, 2003). On trouve, par exemple, la bibliothèque municipale de Delmas (Delmas 49), la bibliothèque spécialisée de Roger Dorsinville (BSRD) de la SHAA (Delmas 31), la Bibliothèque (Delmas 3 et/ou 5).Tout comme, Tabarre a une population d'environ 118 477 habitants (IHSI, 2009) avec une superficie de 24,47 km²; limitrophe à la commune dont, jadis, elle fut partie. Tabarre accueille la plus grande Aéroport du pays, contient plusieurs parcs industriels et commerciaux. Il y a plus d'une centaine institution d'enseignement dont deux Lycées. Or, à Tabarre il existe seulement deux bibliothèques. L'une, est la bibliothèque communautaire de Tabarre de la Fondation Désir d'Haïti, située à Clercine 8 et l'autre, c'est le Centre Culturel SELAKOUN, située à tabarre 48.Les communes dont nous faisons mention dans le cadre de ce projet, sont vraiment en nécessité d'intervention urgente, tant au niveau culturel (loisirs) qu'éducatif. L'accès à des livres est très limité. De plus, dans ce projet nous cherchons à mettre à disposition, à emprunter et faire partager les livres dans les espaces scolaires, pour donner accès à la lecture et donc à une forme de Culture pour que ces jeunes aient la possibilité de devenir acteur de cette grande première dans les espaces scolaires.

<h3>APIE</h3>
<p>Projekto ""Trispalvė kosmose"" <strong>tikslas</strong> – iškelti Lietuvos trispalvę į kosmosą, valstybės atkūrimo 100-mečiui paminėti!</p>
<p>Lietuvos vėliava bus iškelta vandenilio dujomis pripildytu balionu, kuris pasiekęs apie 30 km aukštį subliukš ir padaręs pakankamai nuotraukų iš viršaus, gražiai nukris žemyn.</p>
<p>Numatoma <strong>data ir laikas</strong> - 2018 m. Rugsėjo 8 d.</p>
<p>Susidarius nepalankioms oro sąlygoms data ir laikas gali keistis, mat oro sąlygos yra svarbus faktorius sėkmingam baliono pakilimui ir nusileidimui. </p>
<p><strong>Norite padėti? Puiku!</strong> Norint įgyvendint šį #LT100 projektą - reikia Jūsų visų pagalbos - nedidelės finansinės paramos. Tai nėra pelno siekantis projektas, <strong>viskas daroma iš idėjos</strong>, todėl ir surinkti pinigai bus panaudoti tik projekto techninei įrangai ir vykdymui.</p>

<h3>PROJEKTO EIGA</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remiantis brėžiniais, užsakoma visa reikalinga įranga</li>
<li>Gaminamas korpusas ir kita reikalinga įranga</li>
<li>Esant tinkamoms oro sąlygoms – susirenkame paleidimo vietoje ir paleidžiame balioną!<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>PALEIDIMAS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paleidimo metu baliono skersmuo būna apie 2 metrus. Dėl sumažėjančio atmosferos slėgio, 30–33 km aukštyje, balionas būna daugiau negu 9 metrų skersmens.</li>
<li>Balionui sprogus visa įranga pereina į laisvojo kritimo būseną ir kritimo greitis siekia 180 km/h.</li>
<li>Įrangai nusileisti iš 30 km aukščio reikia vos pusvalandžio.</li>
<li>Pakilimas + nusileidimas užtrunka vos daugiau nei 2 val.</li>
<li>Tarp paleidimo ir nusileidimo vietų gali būti daugiau nei 50 km atstumas.</li>
<li>Svarbu paminėti: techniškai tariant, vėliava pakils į antrąjį Žemės atmosferos sluoksnį - stratosferą, kuri prasideda 7-20km aukštyje priklausomai nuo atskaitos taško lokacijos ir sezono (<a href=""https://scied.ucar.edu/shortcontent/stratosphere-overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">šaltinis</a>)</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>KAS BUS, JEI NESUSIDARYS PALANKIOS ORO SĄLYGOS?</h3>
<p>Yra labai maža teorinė galimybė, kad esant nepalankioms oro sąlygoms iki pat 2018-ųjų pabaigos, baliono su trispalve paleisti negalėsime. Tokiu atveju, grąžinsime visą paramą projekto rėmėjams! </p>

Projekto ""Trispalvė kosmose"" tikslas – iškelti Lietuvos trispalvę į kosmosą, valstybės atkūrimo 100-mečiui paminėti!
Lietuvos vėliava bus iškelta vandenilio dujomis pripildytu balionu, kuris pasiekęs apie 30 km aukštį subliukš ir padaręs pakankamai nuotraukų iš viršaus, gražiai nukris žemyn.
Numatoma data ir laikas - 2018 m. Rugsėjo 8 d.
Susidarius nepalankioms oro sąlygoms data ir laikas gali keistis, mat oro sąlygos yra svarbus faktorius sėkmingam baliono pakilimui ir nusileidimui. 
Norite padėti? Puiku! Norint įgyvendint šį #LT100 projektą - reikia Jūsų visų pagalbos - nedidelės finansinės paramos. Tai nėra pelno siekantis projektas, viskas daroma iš idėjos, todėl ir surinkti pinigai bus panaudoti tik projekto techninei įrangai ir vykdymui.
Daugiau informacijos rasite apsilankę mūsų internetiniame puslapyje Trispalvė kosmose.

 
PROJEKTO EIGA

Remiantis brėžiniais, užsakoma visa reikalinga įranga
Gaminamas korpusas ir kita reikalinga įranga
Esant tinkamoms oro sąlygoms – susirenkame paleidimo vietoje ir paleidžiame balioną! 

PALEIDIMAS

Paleidimo metu baliono skersmuo būna apie 2 metrus. Dėl sumažėjančio atmosferos slėgio, 30–33 km aukštyje, balionas būna daugiau negu 9 metrų skersmens.
Balionui sprogus visa įranga pereina į laisvojo kritimo būseną ir kritimo greitis siekia 180 km/h.
Įrangai nusileisti iš 30 km aukščio reikia vos pusvalandžio.
Pakilimas + nusileidimas užtrunka vos daugiau nei 2 val.
Tarp paleidimo ir nusileidimo vietų gali būti daugiau nei 50 km atstumas.
Svarbu paminėti: techniškai tariant, vėliava pakils į antrąjį Žemės atmosferos sluoksnį - stratosferą, kuri prasideda 7-20km aukštyje priklausomai nuo atskaitos taško lokacijos ir sezono (šaltinis)


 
KUR BUS PANAUDOTI SURINKTA PARAMA?
Visa surinkta parama bus skirta sėkmingam projekto įgyvendinimui ir preliminariai pasiskirstys taip:

Techninė įranga, detalės - 60%

Degalai, transportas ir kitos smulkios administracinės išlaidos -  15%

Padėkos ir kitų 'perks' vykdymo kaštai - 25%


Planuojamos techninės įrangos sąrašas:

Specialus balionas
Vandenilio dujos
Parašiutas
Gaminamas korpusas
Pagrindinė, GSM ir atsarginė sekimo sistemos
Fotoaparatai
Baterijų plokštė
Motininė plokštė
Įtampos stabilizatoriai

 
KAS BUS, JEI NESUSIDARYS PALANKIOS ORO SĄLYGOS?
Yra labai maža teorinė galimybė, kad esant nepalankioms oro sąlygoms iki pat 2018-ųjų pabaigos, baliono su trispalve paleisti negalėsime. Tokiu atveju, grąžinsime visą paramą projekto rėmėjams! 

 
KOMANDA 
 Ernestas Kalabuckas, CTO, NanoAvionics (LinkedIn)
Jau 4 kartus į 30 km aukštį meteorologiniu balionu buvo iškėlęs vienokios ar kitokios paskirties objektus. Pvz., savo sukonstruotą fotoaparato dėžę, picą ar kriptovaliutos marškinėlius. Ernesto gyvenimo kryptis aiški – elektronika, fizika, astronomija ir aviacija.
 
 Raimondas Žvirblis, IT sistemų inžinierius, projekto iniciatorius (LinkedIn)
Programuotojas, dviejų nuostabių vaikų tėtis. Visada domėjosi kosmoso galybe ir svajojo pamatyti Lietuvos vėliavą kosmoso platybės fone!
 
 Tauras Sinkus, Antrepreneris (LinkedIn)
Niekad nepavargstantis entuziastas įvairiuose projektuose. Daug keliauja ir yra iškėlęs vėliavą Himalajuose, 5550 m aukštyje! Kitas tikslas – Lietuvos trispalvė dar aukščiau.

<strong>THE VISION</strong>​</h2>
<p>Here’s a virtual welcome to North Austin Sanctuary.​</p>
<p>We're Shaman Jon, Kristikka and our 2 year old son, Miles Acacian.</p>
<p>We are a family of creatives who are passionate about bringing culture, creativity, personal transformation to North Austin. </p>
<p>Our philosophy is pretty simple. </p>
<p>We asked people what they felt North Austin could use a LOT more of and what we got time and again was; <strong><i>“Community, Creativity and Connection”</i></strong></p>
<p>Going deeper we discovered these common and re-occurring desires.</p>
<p><strong>People wanted:​</strong></p>
<p>*A place to feel like they can share their gifts and talents and be appreciated and valued.</p>
<p>*A place to feel like they can contribute. </p>
<p>*A place where they can connect authentically with others. </p>
<p>*A place where they can learn and grow.</p>
<p>*A place where they could get tuned in and turned on to new artists/ideas/practices that would inspire and improve their lives. ​</p>
<p>North Austin Sanctuary intends to be that place but we’re going to need your help. ​</p>
<p>First of all, your willingness and desire to participate in this adventure is very much appreciated. But here are some other ways you can help N.A.S. become a strong and meaningful advocate of the arts. ​</p>
<p>Whether you are a fan of the arts and personal development or someone with a passion for sharing their gifts,  we’re excited to be creating this space for you so that you can share what you love with others.</p>
<h2><strong>​CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
<p>We're doing our best with the resources we have at our disposal but the vision for bringing something greater and more beautiful to the North Austin area requires more than we can do on our own. Artist's need compensation, structures need to be built or finished to accommodate more audience or students, we need lighting, sound equipment, more chairs and resources to help get our offerings in front of the right audiences. </p>
<h2>WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>When you purchase a package, you're going to get a taste of our offerings. From relaxing and healing massage sessions, live music experiences, yoga and meditation classes, movie nights and other fun, entertaining and illuminating events. It's not a typical thing we're doing here. Rarely do you see a combination of genuinely great (non-new agey) musical offerings combined with a healing center vibe that offers various healing modalities and opportunities to expand your mind, transform your body and illuminate your soul. We don't feel these things are mutually exclusive. </p>
<h2>THE SPACE</h2>
<p>What you will experience here is just phase 1. This will ultimately include an indoor space for classes and events, another external dwelling for overnight guests, out of town volunteers and artists as well as outdoor cooking and bathroom facilities. These plans are included in the presentation.  </p>
<p>The greater plan includes the purchase of a larger plot of land which will be turned into a living community, event space and education/arts center that is self sustainable economically as well as (for the most part) providing for their own food through permaculture and energy through renewables.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE IMPACT </h2>
<p>The obvious impact will be more cultural and creative event options to help serve an area of Austin which desperately lacks these things. But we feel the greater impact will be the creation of a greater community movement which will expand out well beyond the boundaries of Austin, Texas and even beyond the borders of our United States. We want this to be a place where people, from all over the world, land offering an opportunity to be able to explore how conscious communities actively engaged in the arts, including the healing arts can be a catalyst for greater transformation and that those who experience this place, particularly those who stay with us as performers, guests, etc., will take with them and inspiration about how creative communities can function and thrive in a gratifying and sustainable way.    Think artist's residencies, wwoofing organizations and the like. </p>
<p>Please join us and find a pre-purchase a package that's right for you now which will allow us to get the projects done and preparation for your arrival. You can also help by donating your time, if money is not something you have an abundance of. We need help with social media, booking, promotion and marketing, gardening, construction, painting and landscaping and since I suspect many of you reading this are in fact local to the austin area we'd love to meet you and include you in this vision of ours. </p>
<p>We are asking for $5000 which is not at all what will actually be required for this project but we figured it was a manageable number to achieve at first and that those of you who really understand the value of person to person community interaction will continue to grab these offerings well beyond the asking amount. </p>
<p>We're exciting by this journey and hope we have conveyed that to you and inspired you as well.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your participation and support. </p>

<p>Hi this is Renee with Improvosa and I’m here today on Indiegogo to invite you to consider supporting the realization of Bards Songs as a staged production</p>
<h1>Musical Theater Making To Bring Joy and Connection To The Planet and Her People.  Make Way For Harmony!</h1>
<p>BardsSongs is a post-epiphany re-imagines traditional Christmas Carols - an epic musical adventure. BardsSongs is a pageant, a multi-media pageant. We’ve mixed world beats and woven sacred phrases from many cultures into choruses and angelic choirs  to remind ourselves, we are sparks of divine creative life force.  We are all one.  Singing and dancing together is how we “make way for harmony.”</p>
<p>Want to be included in updates and special events (we've got theater games planned) use <a href=""https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/282408?v=6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this link </a>to join the <a href=""https://app.convertkit.com/landing_pages/282408?v=6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">adventure</a></p>
<h2>Why is the album and show called BardsSongs?</h2>
<p>Bards have always been the carriers of stories of history, parsing down messages to their essence.  Christmas Carols tell ancient stories and using song to make the message accessible.  The tunes get into our head and we remember the words and meaning.  This magical work of the Bards has a longer lasting effect than even the books on which they are based.  Many of the songs in the show endured for centuries and traveled in one form or another across many lands. Through contemporary arrangement, singing and dancing to their songs we celebrate the work of the Bards, adding sacred prayers from diverse cultures in honor of our global village of peace keepers and harmony makers.</p>
<h2>The BardsSongs backstory</h2>
<p>Bards Songs began as a salve to balm my broken heart after I lost my Dad in a car accident.  I was angry, I was filled with loneliness and despair.  I was barely functional, hardly able to crawl out of bed in the morning.  I was an orphan.  My world was shattered.  </p>
<p>Music saved my life. As luck or fate would have it, a few weeks before my Dad was killed in a car accident, I was gifted a piano from  a friend I had met in Colorado years before.  That piano saved my life.  The local library housed lyrics and history of Christmas songs was a lifeline for me.  In the lyrics of Christmas songs, I found truth and comfort.  Singing out loud, walking in the woods, wailing the songs in my sorrow, transmuted the devastating effects of grief into something useful.   Following are a few of the lyrics I found that offered hope and healing to me, helped me not feel so all alone. </p> <h2>Cause for Celebration!</h2>
<p>How is it that we “honor thy father and thy mother”?</p>
<p>December 2016 my dream came true.  I’d been carrying 25 songs in my head and body since 2004.  It took me over a decade to find the right musician to help develop the composition and  record.  December 23<sup>rd</sup> two boxes arrived containing the first round of CD’s.  It was one of the most uplifting moments of my life, it is a rare gift to have the time and resources to bring an epic artistic creation to life.   Since then, I’ve been focused on the next phase of the project – bringing the music to the stage as a theater production; which is why I’m here today on Indiegogo, asking for your support.  I’ve gotten as far as I can on my own.  We live in a small community at the far norther reaches of Montana USA.  The internet gives easier access to populations that can support big artistic vision.  We hope you will join us on this adventure to use Christmas Carols and Holy Phases together to create more harmony on the planet</p>

<p>Our vision is to use LIVE VIDEO STREAMING to bring a global audience into the workshop and performance process right from the outset. The beauty of living in the age of the internet is that it is possible to create a musical theater work together. And in so doing we have the potential to create more harmony and understanding in the world, especially around the topic of prayer.  There is no god above another.  The genius spark of glorious creation resides in all of us.  WE ARE ONE and our prayers offered in thanks and gratitude, said with reverence.  Those prayers are gifts to god no matter what language they are spoken in.  Agreed? </p>
<p>Now is not the time to argue whose god is most powerful.  Now is the time to Make Way For Harmony.  How do we do it?  We sing!  We dance!  We Create Theater!  We Make Art!</p>
<p><strong>WHY ART?</strong></p>
<p>Between the terrifying political climate and catastrophic weather events (fires, floods, earthquakes and blizzards) it can sometimes feel like the world is on the verge of coming to an end.  The news has only stories of chaos, destruction and fear-mongering to offer, doesn’t matter which side of the fence you land on, they’ve got something terrifying to help get all of us overwhelmed and depressed, hiding away alone in our houses unwrapped in the blue light of the T.V.  It can feel impossible to know what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To feel better</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be a part of something greater than ourselves</strong></li>
<li><strong>To move stuck, stagnant energy</strong></li>
<li><strong>To remove outmoded beliefs and negative habit patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>To take action</strong></li>
<li><strong>To feel less alone</strong></li>
<li><strong>To find and use your voice</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creative endeavors such as these, they help build community.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To feel better.We make art because…what else are you going to do to feel better?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Feel Better – Take Action – Get Involved – Come!Sing, Dance, Make Theatre, Play with Purpose.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>BardsSongs can provide the structure for action that will help create community, get us moving and help us find and use our voices again.  At least it has been part of the answer for me.  Just the act of creation, keeping busy working on a project that involves singing, dancing, and collaborating with friends and fellow artists, making theater helps me feel better. Art offers an opportunity to focus in distinct ways that stretch our mind, body and imagination.  BardsSongs as an art form offers a chance to view a timeless and often told story through a variety of lenses that is more inclusive to the melting pot of a world we live in.</p>
<p>There is something magical about the theater, storytelling through physical expression.  There is something profoundly healing about letting our voice soar across the stage and around the room.  There is something powerfully nourishing about lending your voice to a chorus and creating harmonies.  There is something deliciously joyful about stretching your muscles and letting your body find its grace and power in lyrical movement, dance.  These are all the reasons we make art.</p>
<p>BardsSongs as a community musical theater project offers all these opportunities.  We take the pressure off of perfection too.  In our show, not even the angels sing with perfect pitch, in fact most are often slightly off key.  Yet, sing they do and sweet it sounds, blended together in its various progressions and chords.</p>
<p>Journalism as an art form, this has been the job of the Bards since the beginning of story and song.  Creating a soundscape and melody line that allow you to experience the resonance of feeling your voice blending with others, your tribe.  The beat, rest and feel the joy in your body as the music calls it to move, to the beat.  This is the art we are making with BardsSongs.</p>
<p><strong>Why Bards Songs?  Why Now?</strong></p>
<p>With the world seeming in utter chaos, its easy to feel isolated, lonely, overwhelmed, fearful and depressed. If this is how you've been feeling, the answer isn't going to be found in more pharmaceutical drugs and talk therapy. They might be helpful in the short term to take the edge off of the anxiety, but ultimately, we have to find a way to reconnect to self and others and to defy the fear and hate that is being thrust upon us every day in the news.</p>
<p>I think the answer most of us are seeking is found in living our soul purpose.   Opportunities for personal development through creative self-expression can lead us in following our authentic path of purpose more easily.  Theater offers so many life affirming opportunities for connection.  Bards Songs is a powerful tool to help create structure for the improvisational process of devised theatre.  We are taking it to another level by adding the possibility of sharing the work shopping process beyond the walls of the building we are rehearsing in and using live-streaming as a way to engage our global community in the process. </p>
<p>Its been a long road to get to this place.  I know the power of this music and these lyrics to uplift the spirit. Its important for me to get beyond my ego and let go of the fear of the unknown.  The practice of resisting the temptation to get caught up in the seduction of fear and hate is still a daily practice for me and Bards Songs is so true to the range of emotions that we humans experience it has the comforting effect that we are not alone.  I am not alone.</p>
<p><strong>How Bards Songs First Came Into Being?  </strong></p>
<p>As I said, Bards Songs came to me in part as comfort after the sudden death of my father in a car accident.  From deep within I heard the words, “Get up, there is work to do.  Go To the piano and play.  Go to the library and find the lyrics of Christmas songs.  Copy the lyrics, spread them out on the floor, are there patterns, is there a story within all of these stories.  Go the piano and play, there is work for you to do.”  These were some of the instructions I heard that gave me the strength to pull my collapsed and weeping body back into action.  I can honestly say that Christmas music, saved my life, gave me hope and comfort. To the Bards who brought these songs to the world, I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>It took me years to find the right composer to extract the whole story from my head.  Musician Don Caverly was able to bring together the world beats and soundscapes that will help lead this musical theater adventure across space and time. </p>
<p>Another brilliant addition to the team is technical Director, Stephan Buck, came aboard the project, inspired by a memory of being a King in a grade school play.  He spoke of the magic of Christmas and the potential of the show to bring a fresh perspective to the theater both in concept and design.  He brings magic to the show with sounds and lights.</p>
<p><strong>What is the template you speak of?  </strong></p>
<p>We design this show to have two uses.  #1 indoor space, theater in the round type setting #2 Flashmob, street theater where actors blend into the landscape and the show emerges like magic for onlookers. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The best news!  Unlike many other artistic campaigns that need money to get into the studio, we’ve already produced the sing-along CD and karaoke tracks.  We’ve put together a digital download for $25 that will give you all the resources you need to start singing along the moment we hit our first funding goal.  You won't be waiting forever to start getting your rewards. </p>
<p>And, once we have the show in place we will likely return to the music studio to capture the vocals again, this time with character voices.  So, this means you will get the original Sing-Along CD with an BONUS updated version once we get our next round of recording complete.</p>
<p>PERKS and BUDGET</p>
<p>Let’s start with the <strong>perks</strong></p>
<p>We have everything from posters and stickers, digital music downloads, angelic ornaments and community activism kits to week long intensive workshops to become a Bards Songs community facilitator and opportunities to play the roles of patrons, sponsors and executive producer.  We are even offering the opportunity to enjoy a feast and frolic in the winter wonderland of Whitefish Montana at the orphans Christmas.  Let’s not be alone anymore.  Let’s find fun and healthy ways to be together.  Check out our perks list.  Our $25 Digital Download will get you everything you need to start your Bards Songs adventure.  A single dollar ($1) will get you on the map with an opportunity to add your light to our Map o' Love-n-Blessings. </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>While this project started out as a way to heal from the grief of becoming an orphan.  It has been a constant companion and source of personal inspiration to me for years.  The music inspires me, comforts me and compels me to keep working on bringing it into the world in a way that touches more lives than just my own.  I am elated to share this work</p>
<p>This is intended to be a tool to give voice back to those whose voice is often squashed by the powerful.  It is intended to inspire freedom within the body to experience the joy of movement without fear of judgment. </p>
<p>Ultimately it give us a tool and structure to build a community performance piece that can be used in the streets, at the doorsteps of our political leaders and in our homes when hypocritical rhetoric is being asked of us to swallow as truth.  The songs serve as reminders that the truth has been being carried in the songs and stories of the Bards sung on street corners and stages around the world to remind us to keep loving one and other despite our differences, to treat each other as brothers and sisters and to remember the law is love and the gospel is peace. </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We created a Digital Download that is ready to deliver the moment we hit our first campaign goal $15,000. The Sing-Along CD’s are ready to ready ship</p>
<p>The sooner we hit that first goal the easier it will be to get pieces of the puzzle shipped in time for the Holidays.  And this is a great sing-along to share with family, especially in this political climate.</p>
<p>That said, technology and shipping are always a risk, especially with a complex project like this.  This is why we ask you to understand upfront that; as a foundational supporter of Bards Songs you understand that this is an improvisational process and a creative work in progress.  This is part of the fun of contributing at this stage of the game.  You get to have early adopter insights and opportunity to contribute in ways that future investors will not.  All this to say, our goal is to get perks marked December to arrive in time for the Holidays.  And, we want to bring global community members who contribute to the Fellowship program LIVE STREAM so that you can be a part of the learning and development process from the outset. Again, because this is a beta-test project, we simply don’t yet know all the glitches for attempting to teach and develop a show Virtually and Locally at the same time.  We ask you to be patient with us and understand that most of the perk delivery date estimates are from July-December 2018.  We will be hosting summer camps for some of the contributors and we will be traveling to teach the show over the Spring and Summer and then refocusing on the official stage production in 2018.</p>

Musical Theater Making To Bring Joy and Connection To The Planet and Her People.  Make Way For Harmony!
BardsSongs is a post-epiphany re-imagines traditional Christmas Carols - an epic musical adventure. BardsSongs is a pageant, a multi-media pageant. We’ve mixed world beats and woven sacred phrases from many cultures into choruses and angelic choirs  to remind ourselves, we are sparks of divine creative life force.  We are all one.  Singing and dancing together is how we “make way for harmony.”
Want to be included in updates and special events (we've got theater games planned) use this link to join the adventure
Why is the album and show called BardsSongs?
Bards have always been the carriers of stories of history, parsing down messages to their essence.  Christmas Carols tell ancient stories and using song to make the message accessible.  The tunes get into our head and we remember the words and meaning.  This magical work of the Bards has a longer lasting effect than even the books on which they are based.  Many of the songs in the show endured for centuries and traveled in one form or another across many lands. Through contemporary arrangement, singing and dancing to their songs we celebrate the work of the Bards, adding sacred prayers from diverse cultures in honor of our global village of peace keepers and harmony makers.
The BardsSongs backstory
Bards Songs began as a salve to balm my broken heart after I lost my Dad in a car accident.  I was angry, I was filled with loneliness and despair.  I was barely functional, hardly able to crawl out of bed in the morning.  I was an orphan.  My world was shattered.  
Music saved my life. As luck or fate would have it, a few weeks before my Dad was killed in a car accident, I was gifted a piano from  a friend I had met in Colorado years before.  That piano saved my life.  The local library housed lyrics and history of Christmas songs was a lifeline for me.  In the lyrics of Christmas songs, I found truth and comfort.  Singing out loud, walking in the woods, wailing the songs in my sorrow, transmuted the devastating effects of grief into something useful.   Following are a few of the lyrics I found that offered hope and healing to me, helped me not feel so all alone.  Cause for Celebration!
How is it that we “honor thy father and thy mother”?
December 2016 my dream came true.  I’d been carrying 25 songs in my head and body since 2004.  It took me over a decade to find the right musician to help develop the composition and  record.  December 23rd two boxes arrived containing the first round of CD’s.  It was one of the most uplifting moments of my life, it is a rare gift to have the time and resources to bring an epic artistic creation to life.   Since then, I’ve been focused on the next phase of the project – bringing the music to the stage as a theater production; which is why I’m here today on Indiegogo, asking for your support.  I’ve gotten as far as I can on my own.  We live in a small community at the far norther reaches of Montana USA.  The internet gives easier access to populations that can support big artistic vision.  We hope you will join us on this adventure to use Christmas Carols and Holy Phases together to create more harmony on the planet

WHY ART?
Between the terrifying political climate and catastrophic weather events (fires, floods, earthquakes and blizzards) it can sometimes feel like the world is on the verge of coming to an end.  The news has only stories of chaos, destruction and fear-mongering to offer, doesn’t matter which side of the fence you land on, they’ve got something terrifying to help get all of us overwhelmed and depressed, hiding away alone in our houses unwrapped in the blue light of the T.V.  It can feel impossible to know what to do.

To feel better
To be a part of something greater than ourselves
To move stuck, stagnant energy
To remove outmoded beliefs and negative habit patterns
To take action
To feel less alone
To find and use your voice
Creative endeavors such as these, they help build community.

Subversive and transgressive, it skewered all conventions of heteronormativity and traditional gender roles. It smashed together the tropes of pulp science fiction with the free-wheeling philosophy of the 60’s and 70’s and the aesthetic of Glam rock. It even inspired people to reject an audience’s typically passive role, and make themselves part of the show.We want to take this even further, to break more rules and upend more conventions, and we’ve secured the licence from the Rocky Horror Company to do it:We want to run a 360 degree live-action Rocky Horror roleplay experience from 14-18 February 2018.For just a few days, a beautiful Polish castle will be transformed into the decadent palace of the mad doctor Frank-N-Furter, and our participants will be transformed into the scheming Transylvanians, strange experiments, hapless guests and the visitors from beyond the stars who will live, sleep, eat, sing, dance and party there.The Master Plan, Revealed at Last
We want to create a version of the Rocky Horror Show world that you can live in.
We want to take you on a strange journey... of alien adventures, Hollywood magic and outrageous performance.
We want to give you the alibi to explore and challenge your preconceptions about yourself and society.
We want to give you an experience that is both safe and transgressive, exciting and transformative, something that will take you truly out of this world!
There will be a call to adventure, there will be shivers of anticipation, there will be fishnet.
Try It, You Just Might Like It:
If you love the Rocky Horror Show.
If you love old B-movies and B-movie tropes.
If you long to uncover maddening mystery and have a mind-expanding adventure.
If you ache for the opportunity to take part in a musical.
If you want Charles Atlas sized drama and a story with real, galactic stakes.
""Don't dream it, BE IT!""Larp is a co-operative form of make-believe. It sits somewhere between improvisational theatre and a grown-up playground game of ‘let’s pretend’ with higher production values. During a larp, you have the opportunity to be someone else, create their reality, their dreams, their loves, hopes and fears and through this learn more about yourself.Larp works and larp changes lives. Our worlds create safe spaces for resisting and pushing back against limiting assumptions based on heteronormativity, gender, racism or ableism. In our worlds, people can be who they want to be. And after days of being free to play with new identities, they come away with fresh insights into who they are and who they could be.You don’t need to have any experience with larp to play. You just need to show up, ready to become a part of the story.

Published: six books of poetry, three translated into English by distinguished translator Kristin Dykstra; three books of essays; and books of translation—Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, Anglophone African, and 20th Century Italian poetry. Performs: own music compositions, experiential theater, drum. Paints: with any material found around. His practice: multidimensional, multi-genre, layered with Latin and Afro-Cuban strata. Once-ordained Zen monk. And appearing this fall, his new book Cubanology (Kristin Dykstra, translator), which poet Bob Holman likens to “a global 24 hours that stretches time to eternity, consolidates place, and with a polyglot sensibility that seems bent on unifying all languages.”      Meet the team Sam Truitt – poet, Director of Station Hill Press & President of the Institute for Publishing Arts  Deliana Simeonova – translator, community organizer, artist, from Sofia, Bulgaria  Kim Dinh Pham – visual artist, IT specialistRea Main – creative writer, publicist, social media wiz  Kristin Dykstra – distinguished translator of Cuban poetry, e.g., Cubanology ...  see her SHP pageJoin the project!Poets, writers, translators, designers, architects, artists, musicians, dancers, drummers, actors, activists, historians, collectors, archeologists, critics, journalists, and everyone else! Join us any time via Project Cubanology, September through December 2018 (check the schedule here). The nature of Omar’s art is open and collaborative, as is clearly evidenced by his “Post-Cuban Cabaret,” which will open in New York in October. You will have a chance to work with him, exchange, and co-create. If you can’t make any of the events, write us (publishers [at] stationhill [dot] org) and see what else is possible.Here are some partner organizations hosting Omar’s readings, talks, workshops, performances, and classes:·         Loisaida Center, NY, NY·         Bowery Poetry Club, NY, NY·         Poets House, NY, NY·         Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY·         Saint Michael’s College, Colchester, VT ·         Golden Notebook Bookstore, Woodstock, NY·         Mountain View Studio, Woodstock, NY·         And more partners to be announced!Budget SituationOur original goal was to raise $26,000 (sigh!), which would have included travel (international and local), per diem (housing and living expenses), events (venues, materials), communication & documentation (print, electronic), and labor of team. Our applications to foundations didn’t connect. What we have to date is $2,550, plus the underwriting by team for housing and pro bono labor.To make the project happen, the minimum we need is $12,200, which includes:·         Omar’s $30 per diem for the residency duration: $3,600·         Health Insurance: $2,000·         Event expenses (materials and marketing): $3,200·         Documentation (professional video and archive): $3,400The Institute for Publishing Arts is a not-for-profit organization. Any contribution you make is tax deductible.Project significance (impact)This is a superb opportunity for U.S. artists and audiences of all stripes to work with a masterful Cuban practitioner. It is our hope that it will result in an array of new works and possibilities, not the least of which might be helping attune us with that abiding sense of terrestrial nativity and sacredness enjoyed by the rest of the Americas.Risks and challengesWe will realize this project with what monetary means we have. While we are in sore need of such – and so are asking for your help – at the same time, we want you to be part of a historic enterprise. The team is as committed as Omar has been in his lifetime of building poetic lore.Other ways you can helpVisit the Project Cubanology site, and impart this project with others via social media.

<h3><strong>What is T.H.A.T.?</strong></h3>
<p>Our founder, Gabrielle, traveled the world and quickly realized a common thread: phone cameras and selfies are frequently the tools to express ourselves, our passions, and our experiences. Shared across social media, perhaps to create a bit of FOMO,  people are craving new backdrops to make their expressions, passions, and experiences come to life in a way that feeds the Happy - and perhaps the bizarre - within each of us.</p>
<p>Created to conjure the playfulness of youth, this family-friendly, self-guided, interactive experience is designed to allow you to explore your senses while having a ball. Each room draws on local culture for its theme and features tidbits to dazzle at least a few of your senses. The tour is designed to last approximately an hour and is available rain or shine. Tickets, exclusively pre-sold online through our website, grant visitors entrance during a specific time-slot.</p>

<p>South Korea is one of the only countries in the world known to intensively breed and capture stray dogs for human consumption. Thousands of dog meat farms across the country capture stray dogs and confine them in small, barren cages outdoors. They live in states of perpetual fear, boredom, hunger and disease, often resulting in self-mutilation.

Thousands of dog meat farms across the country capture stray dogs and confine them in small, barren cages outdoors.

<p><strong>Magic of Love</strong> is a film about the warmhearted farmer Sam the Dog, the wise 108 year old mentor Harold the Turtle and the anonymous disabled Bat living in Sam’s barn. Our three protagonists are to compete in the biggest magic-competition in the world, which takes place locally where Harry Houndini retired and lived his last years. <strong>For Sam</strong>, a true cross country ski-enthusiast, the challenge really is about winning the heart of lovely Elise the Fox who is hosting the competition. Sam sets out to win the competition despite not being much of an illusionist, but lucky for him, his new farm hand Harold the Turtle once mentored the craftsman Houndini himself. </p>

My name is Juan Betancur, I am 26 years old and I live in the capital city of Risaralda, Pereira, The Coffee Cultural Landscape of Colombia (CCLC).   My  passion for photography started 7 years ago when I was 19. I remember the very first day in the university, I had photography class and I think it was sort of love at first sight.

Then, I pictured myself doing what I wanted and living a life towards it, I created my life as a project I wanted to invest in and I did. If you ask me why I'm a photographer the answer  would be something along the lines of: photography has allowed me to experience everything I ever wanted to be when I was a child and be part of everything I dreamed of as an adult and I am very thankful.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507504362/ajqtzfrpvxkrzfvakcef.png"" src=""""/></p><p>After a couple of years trying to survive I managed to get my first camera; nevertheless, something bad happened, one week after having it was stolen and I lost not only my precious tool of work with which I was supposed to realize my dream but also the money from my college education. I had invested the money of my career in this photographic equipment that back then I did not have. Yes, it was terrible, but you know what, I did not give up on my dreams, I was going to continue and I hold onto this dream more than ever. It did not take too long until the universe sent me a sign, or that is what I thought it was, my dear uncle gave me a camera, it was not as good as the one I lost (I had to face it), but hey! I knew this, it is not the camera but the eye looking through it, and now I was back on track. I quit the jobs I did not like and just focus on photography, I took photos in weddings, I worked with models, birthday parties, and last but not least, documenting places, actually this is what I enjoyed the most, working with people to see their reality and get to know what they feel about their context.

I created the #BLACKandSTEM community over four years ago while completing my PhD in biochemistry and biophysics. Being a Black woman and a single mother, I was experiencing the pressures of coming from several minoritized groups while facing the arduous task of earning a PhD. I started this community to connect with others with commonalities. Social media provided a platform to connect thousands of STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) professionals to sources of support, career and educational opportunities, and professional development. The impact of this community has been affirming for thousands of people, resulting in features in <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3027122/blackandstem-the-hashtag-as-community"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fast Company</a> and other major media outlets over the years. Since its inception, I have done the majority of the work of maintaining this community both on and offline. The purpose of this campaign is to support the continued growth of the #BLACKandSTEM community through registration as a business, the launch of our website as a resource portal, and hiring an intern to learn the ins and outs of maintaining the community and join #BLACKandSTEM as staff.</div><div> </div><div>
<h2>Dollars and sense:</h2>

<li>Business registration</li>
<li>Trademark registration application</li>
<li>(2-3) 15-week part-time paid internships</li>
<li>Website registration, hosting, launch</li>
<li>Administrative support</li>
<li>Database building, maintenance</li>
<li>Branded email account</li>
<li>Personnel</li>
</ul>
<p>The internship will include training on social media management, attending/participating in advocacy meetings, writing/submitting pitches for op-ed articles, hosting twitter chats, facilitating support services for students/professionals needing direct assistance.</p>
<p>Administrative support includes managing email, direct messaging, and scheduling. 500-1000 messages are received daily through various platforms that require organization and responses.</p>
<h2>Impacts:</h2>

<h2><strong>Thank you for your time and consideration...</strong></h2>
</div></div>","I am Dr. Stephani Page, a biomedical research scientist. I created the #BLACKandSTEM community over four years ago while completing my PhD in biochemistry and biophysics. Being a Black woman and a single mother, I was experiencing the pressures of coming from several minoritized groups while facing the arduous task of earning a PhD. I started this community to connect with others with commonalities. Social media provided a platform to connect thousands of STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) professionals to sources of support, career and educational opportunities, and professional development. The impact of this community has been affirming for thousands of people, resulting in features in Fast Company and other major media outlets over the years. Since its inception, I have done the majority of the work of maintaining this community both on and offline. The purpose of this campaign is to support the continued growth of the #BLACKandSTEM community through registration as a business, the launch of our website as a resource portal, and hiring an intern to learn the ins and outs of maintaining the community and join #BLACKandSTEM as staff. 
Dollars and sense:

Business registration
Trademark registration application
(2-3) 15-week part-time paid internships
Website registration, hosting, launch
Administrative support
Database building, maintenance
Branded email account
Personnel

The internship will include training on social media management, attending/participating in advocacy meetings, writing/submitting pitches for op-ed articles, hosting twitter chats, facilitating support services for students/professionals needing direct assistance.
Administrative support includes managing email, direct messaging, and scheduling. 500-1000 messages are received daily through various platforms that require organization and responses.
Impacts:
The #BLACKandSTEM community has a direct following of over 7000 individuals. The reach of the community is nearly 200,000 individuals.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In this documentary I follow the Indigenous Australian people of northern Australia, the keepers of fire, traditional custodians of country. A clan of people who can feel the rhythms of the land and it’s inhabitants. For over 65,000 years this oldest continuous culture on the planet have managed the land. Living in harmony with the environment. They are such a part of the land that where they have left the land is dying. The plants and animals need them to thrive.</p>
<p>For 65,000 this ancient culture still continues to live in harmony with the land. In a time when our planet is suffering from over farming, unsustainable land management in a rapidly warming world can we afford continue to ignore the lessons we can learn from them to help heal our fragile world? </p>
<p>We explore how this culture is being passed to the next generation and with modern influences and pressures on young people will the teachings survive? What can we do to help keep this ancient culture alive? </p>
<p>A UWE production in partnership with the BBC</p>

<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>In July 2021, it was reported that NBA legend and American hero, Bill Russell, will be selling most of the memorabilia from his own personal collection. Well, we think he SHOULDN'T have to. So we are stepping in with a plan to help SAVE BILL RUSSELL'S MEMORABILIA and still give Bill (and his foundation) the financial windfall he deserves. Together, fans and admirers from all over the world, will help create a BILL RUSSELL MUSEUM &amp; a BILL RUSSELL MEMORABILIA NFT MARKETPLACE SALE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: RAISE $ TO BUY-OUT THE MEMORABILIA (THAT'S WHAT THIS INDIEGOGO IS!)</strong></p>
<p>We have set an ambitious $1 MILLION goal through a this indiegogo campaign to buy-out most, if not all, of the memorabilia so it can remain under Bill’s ownership (we set the goal at $250K, but the ULTIMATE goal is $1m.  We aim to actually raise $500K here and then get the Boston Celtics to MATCH that for a total of $1m). The $1m is NOT necessarily what we think the value is. It’s just the first step. If we can buy, or at least intrigue Bill Russell enough to not auction off his memorabilia, we can put it in a museum for everyone to enjoy and honor Bill.  (Oh and everyone who contributes over a certain level will receive a limited edition NFT. NFT, you say? Read on…)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STEP 2: DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS ""IDIEGOGO"" CAMPAIGN, FANS CONVINCE THE BOSTON CELTICS TO MATCH OUR FUNDRAISING</strong></p>
<p>If not in Bill’s personal possession, his memorabilia should be part of a Bill Russell Museum at the Boston Garden. <a href=""https://www.change.org/billrussell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Our petition</a> (<a href=""https://www.change.org/billrussell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.change.org/billrussell</a>) calls on the the Celtics organization should step in and agree to match all our funds raised to ensure the establishment of the Bill Russell Museum for the next generation of fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STEP 3: GET BILL’S ATTENTION</strong></p>
<p>We need Bill to hear that his fans – from all generations and all over the world – are stepping into ensure he doesn’t have to sell his personal memorabilia to private collectors.  In stead of selling, we will work with Bill and the Boston Celtics to create a Bill Russell Museum in Boston, MA.   Once Bill sees the groundswell of support, including the from the Boston Celtics franchise, we can share with him the final step of our plan, which will allow him to earn even more money AND build his legacy even higher: A Bill Russell NFT Virtual Museum &amp; Memorabilia shop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STEP 4: LAUNCH NFT MEMORABILIA VIRTUAL MUSEUM &amp; SALES MARKETPLACE</strong></p>
<p>We believe Bill, and his foundation, can earn – and keep earning – exponentially more by converting his (now saved and preserved) memorabilia into a collection of NFTs. The NFTs will be digital versions of his physical items as well as some special issued NFTs.</p>
<p>You can visit the whole campaign website at: <a href=""http://billrussell6.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://billrussell6.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</strong></p>
<p>There is often a debate among Boston sports fans – who is on the “Mount Rushmore” of Boston Sports? Is it Brady, Bird, Orr and Russell? Maybe Ted Williams or Ortiz? Ray Bourque or Pedro?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The truth is that the real Boston Sports “Mount Rushmore” is Bill Russell the player, Bill Russell the coach, Bill Russell the activist and Bill Russell the legend. That’s how much Bill’s career, impact and legacy dwarfs every other Boston sports icon. (And if you ask us after Bill, it’s Brady, Bird, Orr and Ortiz on that next Mount Rushmore).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bill is an 11 time champion as a player and coach of the Boston Celtics, a Gold medal winner and his impact on the NBA and the game of basketball – including players of all generations – can not be overstated. The NBA has even named the Postseason MVP Award after him. Yet his impact as an activist and civil rights trailblazer might be his enduring legacy. His heroic life was recognized by President Obama with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

<h2><strong>Our Past</strong></h2>
<p>The start of the Harambee Ujima Black Arts and Culture Association began in 1967 under the name Together Inc. Honoring the Swahili language, the incorporation used the words “Harambee” – The Kenyan tradition of community self-help translating to “all pull together” and “Ujima” – The third of the seven principles of Kwanzaa meaning collective work and responsibility, to introduce the concept of coming together to protest the mistreatment of African Americans in that era. The start of the Harambee Black Arts festival focused on using Black Power dialogue, visual art, music, and Black Spirituality to being bring harmony, morality, and rising consciousness to Pittsburgh and the rest of America. At its peak, the festival was the largest of its kind in Pittsburgh and 3<sup>rd</sup> largest in all of the United States.</p>
<p>In 2001, after years of fractured relations and Together Inc. disbanding, it rose from the ashes and transformed into The Harambee Ujima Black Arts and Culture Association. The association has pushed against many obstacles since its reinstatement to bring the festival back to its glory days. It is with great pleasure that we are able to celebrate the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year and to say we have made it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our Present </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This year marks the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Harambee Black Arts Festival. We kick off on August 4<sup>th</sup> with the Soul Stepping Parade swinging through the streets of Pittsburgh’s historic Homewood neighborhood. The festival continues on Saturday August 5<sup>th </sup>and Sunday August 6<sup>th</sup>.  The main components of the festival are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy Art Gallery</li>
<li>Creative Balance 4 Empowering People Wellness Expo</li>
<li>Children’s Village</li>
<li>African Vending Market</li>
<li>Film Documentary</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to honor our motto “Breathing Life into the Community” by continuing in our Kenyan tradition of pulling together and bringing the best of what we have to the festival. The efforts put forth into this festival are done willingly; with an all-volunteer board, donations, grants, and various funding techniques and we need YOU to join our community to make sure Harambee is celebrated. The time for Black Arts to be appreciated, reciprocated, and distributed among the general public is long overdue.   </p>
<p>Your sponsorship will be used to fund artist exhibitions, cultural performances, festival operations and marketing materials for the 50th Anniversary Harambee Black Arts Festival. Your contribution gives not only funding to much needed factors of the festival, it enables us to give those who rely on their craft to survive a market where they are accepted and appreciated. Your contribution is your invite into much more than a festival; it invites you to make a difference in a world you may not be aware existed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why it is more than Just another Festival</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2010 The Harambee Ujima Association formed an economic justice consortium with Diversity FOOTprint Project. (The Thomas Merton Center serves as its IRS-Fiscal Agent).  The consortium reconvened the historical Harambee Black Arts Festival, promoted with an innovative concept called an Art Social Economic Generator (A+SEG) designed to expand trade. The mission is to create an economic base for arts to expand the diversity of culture in the Pittsburgh region honoring the spirit, integrity and unity of all people.</p>
<p>The first phase of building the A+SEG prototype engine has been completed within the past three years. With Government support we pulled together not to make profit, but created an environment where profit can be made (investing life in many places) by local and regional artists and to emerge local vendors to separate the Black Diaspora communities from political power and racism.  The challenge for the next two years is to increase social capital for the association, businesses/entrepreneurs, and the community through the Harambee Ujima Black Arts Festival.</p>
<p>We aim to use the festival as a celebration of the Harambee Legacy; advancing the Black Arts to the masses in and around Pittsburgh by producing an annual community-based buy and sell event. In short, we are constructing a new trade market right in our own neighborhoods that can be reached by those who are underprivileged and disenfranchised, where they can become self-supporting while supporting their community at the same time.</p>
<p>This is what the Harambee Legacy is based around.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Where We Want Harambee Ujima to Go</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Harambee Ujima Black Arts and Culture Association is a cultural collaboration that advocates and advances the Black Arts Movement in order to preserve all forms of Black Art in the greater Pittsburgh region. We not only do this for our own interest, but for the future generations that will come about in Black diaspora communities. We work to give the underemployed and unemployed ample opportunity to develop skills and utilize talents to enter the marketplace. Going forward, we want to see the association and the Black Arts Movement in Pittsburgh grow, hand-in-hand. We want people to recognize our logo, our artists, our voices and our message.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want people to understand that Black Art is Appreciated, Black Art is Beautiful, Black Art is Profitable, and Black Art is Art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Join our movement and live the Spirit of Harambee</p>

What initially was a thought to solve event logistics, now has turned into a working concept with multiple applications for both artists and event organisers alike - A creative unit catering to all your event needs.</p><p>The Beyond project has it’s roots within JAQ Studios; an arts collective formed in 2014 by Jorgen Rabben (artist) Andre Edwardsson (artist) and Quinn Cordukes (Musician) now consisting of 17 artists that create Music, Art, Film, Photography, Design, Architecture and Fashion. JAQ has been a support structure and community for collaboration that has facilitated artistic growth in the counter culture movement here in Umeå, taking part in various projects from exhibitions to music and culture events.</p><p>In late 2015 we successfully held a three day music and art festival, consisting of 12 music acts, 8 artists and 2 film screenings. We’ve produced films, taken part in multiple guerrilla gardening projects, recordings, videos and made 3 room installations during MTF Scandi (Music Tech Fest) </p><p>Now we are ready to expand and thus searching for new collaborations within the international community; the JAQ team and a few amazing friends are proud to launch our outreach project. Beyond - The transforming stage bus.</p><p> </p><p>MISSION STATEMENT</p><p>The purpose of Beyond is to create a platform for artists to meet their audience and vice versa. A mobile culture point that will facilitate inspiring events, build community and open up possibilities. </p><p>We will travel round Europe each summer, creating our own events and joining others.</p><p>All this whilst keeping up an ongoing dialogue with our fanbase via podcasts, social media, live recordings and small documentary instalments that will narrate our journey, introducing new characters, teachings and inspiration to inject into the growing scene. </p><p> </p><p>THE TOOLKIT - Facilities and Expertise</p><p>Small rooftop scene</p><p>Large folding main scene</p><p>3D mapped projections</p><p>Full backline</p><p>Food truck kitchen</p><p>Green Generator</p><p>Recording equipment</p><p> </p><p>What the team can offer:</p><p>Music, art, film, photography</p><p>Sound and lighting engineering</p><p>Organization</p><p>Problem solving</p><p>PR</p><p>Documentation of events</p><p> </p><p>EXCHANGE AND COLLABORATIONS</p><p>We have already started the process of reaching out to other art and music collectives, event organisers and festivals around Europe but need your help and tips. </p><p>Our plan is to create an accessible network that will forge the way for other artists starting their own journey on the road to professionalism, creating links between scenes across the globe.</p><p>In each area we visit collaboration and cooperation is key. We hope to incorporate local artists and communities into each event held, giving them access to our facilities and expertise whilst bringing our own flavour to the town. </p><p>Drop us a line if you're interested in a collaboration - quinn.cordukes@jaqstudios.se</p><p> </p><p>Students:</p><p>We're also looking to collaborate with schools and student bodies where we can hold events and workshops, an open facility that can grow and inspire the minds of tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>Burning Man:</p><p>Burning man has been a huge inspiration and we plan to eventually bring our bus to Black Rock City where we can get involved and share space. Burning mans 10 principles speak to our vision of radical inclusion and community. A vehicle of co-creation we can all share.</p><p> </p><p>Relief gigs:</p><p>We plan to provide relief gigs in refugee camps, collaborating with local charities and municipalities to create social welfare and enjoyment to those in dire need. </p><p> </p><p>Open Scene:</p><p>Quinn has been running Open Mic and Jam events at local pub the past 2 years. These nights have been a significant contribution to the local scene, becoming a sort of living room for artists of different practises in which bands have been formed, new acts discovered and friendships made. </p><p>Since it's worked so well this concept will join us on the road, an opportunity for anyone and everyone to share the stage with us. Whether that be a solo act, a group, or a jam along with us. We will cater to whatever needs you have, no matter your skill level.</p><p> </p><p>THE FILM</p><p>During our trip we will be filming the interactions we have and the wonderful places we visit. Creating a full length film about our experiences and teachings at the end of the tour.</p><p> </p><p>TOUR LABEL AND SCENE</p><p>Fungus Hill is the first band to jump on board, as we build the concept we plan to add a diverse range of music to the scene. Signed bands will join the team on our travels, playing gigs, collaborating with the other artists and recording. All this will build experience and provide enough exposure for an act to make the leap of striking out on their own</p><p> </p><p>JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND PR </p><p>If you don't have the income to contribute to this campaign please tell your friends about us and share our campaign around the internet,</p><p>The more people that know of us the better the chances we come to your town.</p><p>We also have some positions available:</p><p>Chef</p><p>Electrician</p><p>Engineer</p><p>Social media marketer</p><p>Radio host/ podcast</p><p>Writer/ blogger</p><p> </p><p>If you're interested please send an email to: quinn.cordukes@jaqstudios.se</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495842002/ole0yq9xq7hkrwaghaoh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>BUDGET</p><p>Our initial campaign for 55,000 euros will be enough to purchase and build the vehicle.

What initially was a thought to solve event logistics, now has turned into a working concept with multiple applications for both artists and event organisers alike - A creative unit catering to all your event needs.The Beyond project has it’s roots within JAQ Studios; an arts collective formed in 2014 by Jorgen Rabben (artist) Andre Edwardsson (artist) and Quinn Cordukes (Musician) now consisting of 17 artists that create Music, Art, Film, Photography, Design, Architecture and Fashion. JAQ has been a support structure and community for collaboration that has facilitated artistic growth in the counter culture movement here in Umeå, taking part in various projects from exhibitions to music and culture events.In late 2015 we successfully held a three day music and art festival, consisting of 12 music acts, 8 artists and 2 film screenings. We’ve produced films, taken part in multiple guerrilla gardening projects, recordings, videos and made 3 room installations during MTF Scandi (Music Tech Fest) Now we are ready to expand and thus searching for new collaborations within the international community; the JAQ team and a few amazing friends are proud to launch our outreach project. Beyond - The transforming stage bus. MISSION STATEMENTThe purpose of Beyond is to create a platform for artists to meet their audience and vice versa. A mobile culture point that will facilitate inspiring events, build community and open up possibilities. We will travel round Europe each summer, creating our own events and joining others.All this whilst keeping up an ongoing dialogue with our fanbase via podcasts, social media, live recordings and small documentary instalments that will narrate our journey, introducing new characters, teachings and inspiration to inject into the growing scene.  THE TOOLKIT - Facilities and ExpertiseSmall rooftop sceneLarge folding main scene3D mapped projectionsFull backlineFood truck kitchenGreen GeneratorRecording equipment What the team can offer:Music, art, film, photographySound and lighting engineeringOrganizationProblem solvingPRDocumentation of events EXCHANGE AND COLLABORATIONSWe have already started the process of reaching out to other art and music collectives, event organisers and festivals around Europe but need your help and tips. Our plan is to create an accessible network that will forge the way for other artists starting their own journey on the road to professionalism, creating links between scenes across the globe.In each area we visit collaboration and cooperation is key. We hope to incorporate local artists and communities into each event held, giving them access to our facilities and expertise whilst bringing our own flavour to the town. Drop us a line if you're interested in a collaboration - quinn.cordukes@jaqstudios.se Students:We're also looking to collaborate with schools and student bodies where we can hold events and workshops, an open facility that can grow and inspire the minds of tomorrow. Burning Man:Burning man has been a huge inspiration and we plan to eventually bring our bus to Black Rock City where we can get involved and share space. Burning mans 10 principles speak to our vision of radical inclusion and community. A vehicle of co-creation we can all share. Relief gigs:We plan to provide relief gigs in refugee camps, collaborating with local charities and municipalities to create social welfare and enjoyment to those in dire need.  Open Scene:Quinn has been running Open Mic and Jam events at local pub the past 2 years. These nights have been a significant contribution to the local scene, becoming a sort of living room for artists of different practises in which bands have been formed, new acts discovered and friendships made. Since it's worked so well this concept will join us on the road, an opportunity for anyone and everyone to share the stage with us. Whether that be a solo act, a group, or a jam along with us. We will cater to whatever needs you have, no matter your skill level. THE FILMDuring our trip we will be filming the interactions we have and the wonderful places we visit. Creating a full length film about our experiences and teachings at the end of the tour. TOUR LABEL AND SCENEFungus Hill is the first band to jump on board, as we build the concept we plan to add a diverse range of music to the scene. Signed bands will join the team on our travels, playing gigs, collaborating with the other artists and recording. All this will build experience and provide enough exposure for an act to make the leap of striking out on their own JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND PR If you don't have the income to contribute to this campaign please tell your friends about us and share our campaign around the internet,The more people that know of us the better the chances we come to your town.We also have some positions available:ChefElectricianEngineerSocial media marketerRadio host/ podcastWriter/ blogger If you're interested please send an email to: quinn.cordukes@jaqstudios.se    BUDGETOur initial campaign for 55,000 euros will be enough to purchase and build the vehicle. Enabling us to start the journey.  And that's us. Thank you for taking the time to read through our campaign and we'll see you summer 2018",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>OUR STORY: </h3>
<p>The Optimist Hill Campaign has been working towards creating a winter recreation facility in Diefenbaker Park, Saskatoon - bringing winter activities like snowboarding, skiing, tubing, and tobboganning to our winter city! Phase 1 construction of the Optimist Hill, in Diefenbaker Park, is 70% complete with a goal of opening this 2018/2019 winter season. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We couldn't be more stoked to bring snowboarding, skiing and tubing to Saskatoon this winter and we know we are not alone! In order to complete the full scope of Phase 1 of the campaign, we need the second lift! Especially with how big the hill is! That's why we're launching our final crowdfunding campaign - to help us reach the end of our phase 1 fundraising goals and get our second lift system! Help us get families and people of all ages to the top of the hill! Not to mention we've got some awesome perks and prizes to give away in exchange for your support in the project!</span></p>

Yoga instructor, passionate for hulla hoop, art-therapist + inter-dimensional traveler who works with the voice used as a tool for self-knowledge and healing. We believe in a better world. We know the good things mankind has to offer and we believe in optimism as a way of life. Our path have been blessed in many ways so, by putting ourselves in a place of gratitude and service, we are building Halaken Festival</p><h3>
<br/><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong>
</h3><p>Halaken is a free festival, open to everyone, that sets a path towards social advance by focusing on the knowledge of oneself. In the course of a year, visiting 12 cities in 4 countries of South America, Halaken will show us different roads towards our natural being. Halaken comes from the maya, Inlakech Halaken. When they met the say hello by saying Inlakech (I am another you) and then getting in reply Halaken (You are another me). We believe this is a beautiful concept because it reminds us, in something as simple as the salutation, that there are really no differences between the one and the other<br/> </p><h3><strong>WHY?</strong></h3><p>We live in a unique time. Some are participants, others witnesses, of an upcoming paradigm shift in mankind. The crisis that the world is going through is not of political or economical character, it is a consciousness crisis produced for being disconnected of our true nature, disconnected one from the other but, even more, disconnected of our essence and ourselves. We are more than a physical body, more than raw matter. We are not isolated beings. We are rather part of a whole. But many had lost this connection. To reconnect with this whole is paramount for us to be able to fulfill our greatest potential as individuals and from there, our full potential as mankind. We believe that, for helping this change, it’s important to generate spaces of interchange and experience that are totally open for everybody. This spaces are fundamental because they produce connection, enrichment, elevation and allows us to observe ourselves and reflect about our behaviors and patterns<br/> </p><h3><strong>HOW?</strong></h3><p>By using different tools like film-debate, meditation, yoga, dance and movement, singing medicine workshops, art therapy and talking circles; all together conforming a powerful tool, we’ll seek to generate spaces of silence and reflection that will provide the individual a frame for self-observation. The format of the project is of a totally free festival, to be presented in 12 cities (4 countries) of South America, with a duration of two weeks in each city<br/> </p><h3><strong>WHERE?</strong></h3><p>12 cities of South America (Perú, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil), starting at Cusco, Perú<br/> </p><h3><strong>WHEN?</strong></h3><p>The project have a duration of one year, starting in May 2020 and ending in May 2021<br/> </p><h3><strong>FOR WHOM?</strong></h3><p>To every person that wish to know, and discover, itself more. The festival have activities for all ages, giving the same chance to everyone, beyond economical realities. That’s why it’s so important the admission being free<br/> </p><h3><strong>IMPACT</strong></h3><p>We want the world to be a better place. That optimism, love and solidarity be the norm and not just mere utopias. We’ll seek to open more silence each time and to generate more inner space. We will reach our true nature. By the end of the festival we’ll produce a documentary with the intention to bring its essence to those who weren’t present. In a second stage, we’ll bring the festival all around the world!<br/> </p><h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED?</strong></h3><p>Our financial goal for this campaign is <strong>EUR 21960</strong> which are going to be destined to:</p><p><strong>13100: </strong>Developing workshop content and create opportunity to pay workshop leaders during the whole duration of the project</p><p><strong>4240:</strong> Tickets.

WHAT IS IT?
Halaken is a free festival, open to everyone, that sets a path towards social advance by focusing on the knowledge of oneself. In the course of a year, visiting 12 cities in 4 countries of South America, Halaken will show us different roads towards our natural being. Halaken comes from the maya, Inlakech Halaken. When they met the say hello by saying Inlakech (I am another you) and then getting in reply Halaken (You are another me).

<li>To help preserve the Cantonese language and culture</li>
<li>To support Chinese families in the UK to pass on the Cantonese language and culture to the next generation</li>
<li>To celebrate cultural diversity in the UK through intergenerational theatre projects</li>
<li>To promote cultural cohesion between the Chinese diaspora and the UK community</li>
<li>To increase cultural exposure of Chinese families in the UK who are not usual theatre-goers</li>
</ul><p>What we actually do:</p><ul>
<li>Interactive theatre performances</li>
<li>Drama/ music workshops</li>
<li>Develop Cantonese teaching/ learning materials (e.g. YouTube videos, nursery rhymes)</li>
</ul><p>為咗鼓勵同支持英國嘅廣東話家庭傳承母語，小豆釘會以互動音樂劇同布偶等推廣廣東話教育，令喺英國以致其他海外地區嘅廣東話家庭同小朋友獲得更多接觸廣東話嘅機會，以更有趣同有效嘅方法學習廣東話。我哋都會不時返香港，為香港嘅非華語小朋友演出同主持廣東話戲劇/音樂工作坊。我哋嘅主要工作包括：</p><ul>
<li>互動親子劇場演出</li>
<li>戲劇及音樂工作坊</li>
<li>發展趣味廣東話教材 (例如﹕YouTube影片、原創兒歌等)</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Why Cantonese? 點解係廣東話？</h3><p>Cantonese is our native language and it is at risk in Hong Kong and Canton region in China because of the popularisation of Mandarin. Cantonese is also the mother tongue of many people of Hong Kong and East Asian descent in the UK. In London, there are more than 12,000 people who speak Cantonese at home*, which outweighs the Mandarin population by over a double. Other big cities like Manchester and Liverpool also have a relatively big Cantonese speaking population. Many parents send their children to Cantonese playgroups and Chinese schools, but children might get reluctant in learning as they might see it as extra workloads on top of their normal school works. Little Bean believes music and theatre are fun and effective ways to engage children in learning the language.</p><p>Cantonese is a beautiful language which inherited rich ancient Chinese culture. It is our responsibility to preserve and pass our heritage down to our next generation.</p><p>廣東話喺香港同廣東地區嘅地位，近年一直受普通話嘅普及而受威脅，因此好多人都開始努力保育同捍衛廣東話。除了喺本土嘅香港人，身在海外嘅華人都一直致力承傳廣東話。喺英國，以廣東話為第一語言嘅人口遠超普通話；單喺倫敦，就有超過 1,2000 人以廣東話為母語*。移民或旅居英國嘅香港人同華僑，有唔少都會用廣東話同仔女溝通。為咗增加子女接觸廣東話嘅機會，部分家長更加會送仔女到課外中文學校或者參加廣東話唱遊小組。但刻板嘅課外中文堂或者會減低小朋友嘅學習興趣，所以小豆釘就以活潑互動嘅戲劇同音樂作為媒介，令小朋友可以愉快地沉浸喺廣東話語境，增進學習興趣同成效。</p><p>廣東話係我哋引以為傲嘅母語，所以保育同承傳廣東話係我哋身為香港人應有嘅責任。</p><p>*Main language from 2011 Census (detailed) - Census table QS204EW</p><p> </p><h3>Why a Hong Kong trip? 點解要去香港？</h3><p>Little Bean is going to Hong Kong! As part of our research and development work, we're bringing our show Boh Boh Finds Home to Hong Kong for kids learning Cantonese as a second language. We will also team up with experts in teaching Chinese as a foreign language and arts education in Hong Kong to carry out studies, which will help us to develop more fun and effective ways to learn Cantonese with music and drama!</p><p>小豆釘就嚟會去香港喇！我哋仲會帶埋外星朋友波波同演出《波波星球歷險記》返嚟同學緊中文嘅非華語小朋友見面！今次嘅香港之旅，我哋會聯同香港嘅非華語學生中文教育同藝術教育嘅專家一齊做觀察同研究，幫助小豆釘發展更有趣同有效，以戲劇同音樂學習廣東話嘅方法。</p><p> </p><h3>Why crowdfunding? 點解要眾籌？</h3><p>We are an emerging company so it is difficult for us to get arts council funding at this early stage. Therefore we will need your support to help our little beans to grow into bean sprouts! Please help us to pass on Cantonese as our mother language to the next generation! Also, please don't forget to spread the word for us!</p><p>我哋係剛剛成立嘅藝團，要申請英格蘭藝術委員會資金會有一定困難。所以我哋好需要大家嘅支持，幫助我哋慢慢起步、持續發展，向下一代傳承廣東話！而且今次香港研究同發展之旅對於小豆釘同非母語廣東話教學研究都意義重大，希望支持承傳廣東話同認同小豆釘理念同工作嘅各位，可以多多關注同埋令多啲人認識我哋！</p><p> </p><h3>Want to know more about us? 想認識我哋多啲？</h3><p>Please visit <a href=""http://www.littlebeantheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Little Bean’s website</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/littlebeantheatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> to know more about the team and our work!</p><p>想知多啲小豆釘背後嘅團隊同我哋嘅工作，就要click入去<a href=""http://www.littlebeantheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">小豆釘嘅網頁</a>同<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/littlebeantheatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>睇吓喇！</p><p> </p></div>","Who is Little Bean? 小豆釘係乜水？We are an interdisciplinary theatre company focusing on Cantonese speaking children and families in the UK.

To celebrate cultural diversity in the UK through intergenerational theatre projects
To promote cultural cohesion between the Chinese diaspora and the UK community
To increase cultural exposure of Chinese families in the UK who are not usual theatre-goers
What we actually do:
Interactive theatre performances
Drama/ music workshops
Develop Cantonese teaching/ learning materials (e.g. YouTube videos, nursery rhymes)
為咗鼓勵同支持英國嘅廣東話家庭傳承母語，小豆釘會以互動音樂劇同布偶等推廣廣東話教育，令喺英國以致其他海外地區嘅廣東話家庭同小朋友獲得更多接觸廣東話嘅機會，以更有趣同有效嘅方法學習廣東話。我哋都會不時返香港，為香港嘅非華語小朋友演出同主持廣東話戲劇/音樂工作坊。我哋嘅主要工作包括：
互動親子劇場演出
戲劇及音樂工作坊
發展趣味廣東話教材 (例如﹕YouTube影片、原創兒歌等)
 Why Cantonese? 點解係廣東話？Cantonese is our native language and it is at risk in Hong Kong and Canton region in China because of the popularisation of Mandarin. Cantonese is also the mother tongue of many people of Hong Kong and East Asian descent in the UK. In London, there are more than 12,000 people who speak Cantonese at home*, which outweighs the Mandarin population by over a double. Other big cities like Manchester and Liverpool also have a relatively big Cantonese speaking population. Many parents send their children to Cantonese playgroups and Chinese schools, but children might get reluctant in learning as they might see it as extra workloads on top of their normal school works. Little Bean believes music and theatre are fun and effective ways to engage children in learning the language.Cantonese is a beautiful language which inherited rich ancient Chinese culture. It is our responsibility to preserve and pass our heritage down to our next generation.廣東話喺香港同廣東地區嘅地位，近年一直受普通話嘅普及而受威脅，因此好多人都開始努力保育同捍衛廣東話。除了喺本土嘅香港人，身在海外嘅華人都一直致力承傳廣東話。喺英國，以廣東話為第一語言嘅人口遠超普通話；單喺倫敦，就有超過 1,2000 人以廣東話為母語*。移民或旅居英國嘅香港人同華僑，有唔少都會用廣東話同仔女溝通。為咗增加子女接觸廣東話嘅機會，部分家長更加會送仔女到課外中文學校或者參加廣東話唱遊小組。但刻板嘅課外中文堂或者會減低小朋友嘅學習興趣，所以小豆釘就以活潑互動嘅戲劇同音樂作為媒介，令小朋友可以愉快地沉浸喺廣東話語境，增進學習興趣同成效。廣東話係我哋引以為傲嘅母語，所以保育同承傳廣東話係我哋身為香港人應有嘅責任。*Main language from 2011 Census (detailed) - Census table QS204EW Why a Hong Kong trip? 點解要去香港？Little Bean is going to Hong Kong! As part of our research and development work, we're bringing our show Boh Boh Finds Home to Hong Kong for kids learning Cantonese as a second language. We will also team up with experts in teaching Chinese as a foreign language and arts education in Hong Kong to carry out studies, which will help us to develop more fun and effective ways to learn Cantonese with music and drama!小豆釘就嚟會去香港喇！我哋仲會帶埋外星朋友波波同演出《波波星球歷險記》返嚟同學緊中文嘅非華語小朋友見面！今次嘅香港之旅，我哋會聯同香港嘅非華語學生中文教育同藝術教育嘅專家一齊做觀察同研究，幫助小豆釘發展更有趣同有效，以戲劇同音樂學習廣東話嘅方法。 Why crowdfunding? 點解要眾籌？We are an emerging company so it is difficult for us to get arts council funding at this early stage. Therefore we will need your support to help our little beans to grow into bean sprouts! Please help us to pass on Cantonese as our mother language to the next generation! Also, please don't forget to spread the word for us!我哋係剛剛成立嘅藝團，要申請英格蘭藝術委員會資金會有一定困難。所以我哋好需要大家嘅支持，幫助我哋慢慢起步、持續發展，向下一代傳承廣東話！而且今次香港研究同發展之旅對於小豆釘同非母語廣東話教學研究都意義重大，希望支持承傳廣東話同認同小豆釘理念同工作嘅各位，可以多多關注同埋令多啲人認識我哋！ Want to know more about us? 想認識我哋多啲？Please visit Little Bean’s website and Facebook page to know more about the team and our work!想知多啲小豆釘背後嘅團隊同我哋嘅工作，就要click入去小豆釘嘅網頁同Facebook page睇吓喇！",1.0,0,"1 Campaign
