is the latest offering from the crew who created Metamorphosis – a temple of
transformation – for the AfrikaBurn festival in South Africa last year. This is a creative project, entirely volunteer-run, with a vision to create beautiful art while creating positive shifts in the world around us.</span><br/></p>
<p>Temple
structures like Metamorphosis and Awakening play a special role at AfrikaBurn;
they provide a space for personal reflection and for spiritual and emotional
awakening. They provide sanctuary
for you to release, and ultimately burn, all that no longer serves you. And
so Awakening is intended to be somewhere you can meditate, contemplate,
rejoice, mourn, release and celebrate. A place for ceremonies of love,
commitment, farewell and friendship.
<span>The lotus, an ancient symbol of rebirth and awakening, invites
you to </span>consider what you want to awaken in yourself… what dreams
and potential is lying dormant?</p>
<p><b>Social upliftment</b></p>
<p>Awakening is a project with a conscience; creating positive change and awakening the potential in others is part of our vision. We
strive to leave legacies that benefit communities beyond the Burn, and help
spark transformation and awakening in others.</p>
<p>Last year the Metamorphosis team brought the
theme of transformation home, raising a substantial amount of money to renovate
the Home of Hope in Johannesburg. The
Home rescues women and children from abuse, poverty and sexual exploitation and
ensures they get an education while having a safe place to live. The extreme
makeover included everything from fresh paint to new furniture, kitchen
appliances, light fittings, bedding and décor. Mam Khanyi, who runs the
organization, said that the renovations had “helped restore dignity to all the
girls who live at the Home.”</p>
<p>Building
on this relationship, after the Burn, Awakening will be installing a learning centre at the Home of Hope including computers and internet access. This will help all of the women
who are studying and don't have ready access to these resources. The focus on
education fits with the idea of awakening… awakening to one’s potential, to a
world of opportunity.</p>
<p>In addition we hope to open the Burn up to
other communities and to aid skills development. To this end we included four
local artists from Alexandra in the Metamorphosis project last year. Tsholo,
Tebogo, Mpumi and Mmabadimo assisted with the building of the temple in
Jo’burg, construction in Tankwa and attended the festival. This year we are
bringing Tsholo and his wife Salome and Mpumi and we want to help facilitate
that journey for them. Helping us with funds means contributing to both the
Home of Hope and to providing access to the Burn for others. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Donate</b></p>
<p>If
passion alone could bring our structure into being, we’d pretty much be ready
to head into the Karoo. However, the reality is that there is money to be
raised… R100 000 (ZAR) to be exact. We were fortunate to be awarded some
funding from AfrikaBurn’s art grant fund (hence we were able to start the
building) but we don’t yet have enough funds to bring this powerful project to
its completion! </p>

<b>Reception menu and supplies</b> - we will be preparing all our own food, to save on catering costs, but that does mean we will need to pay for furniture rental, serving equipment, paper/plastic disposables - and, of course, all the groceries!</li>

It will also serve as an opportunity for our friends and family to see the fruits of our labors, to understand those all-nighters and triple-shot-espressos and obsession over pixel perfection.   
What You're Funding:

Exhibition design and construction - Specifically, the displays on which we will mount our printed work. We will be constructing these from our own plans, from start to finish. This money will cover items such as lumber, hardware, and paint.

Venue rental costs - We will have the privilege of displaying our work in the University of West Florida's own Innovation Institute, but this space does not come without some minor convenience and cleaning fees.

Reception menu and supplies - we will be preparing all our own food, to save on catering costs, but that does mean we will need to pay for furniture rental, serving equipment, paper/plastic disposables - and, of course, all the groceries!

Show collateral - also known as promotional material or print promotions. This includes things like postcards, buttons, stickers, t-shirts for the reception, and our sponsor rewards for IndieGoGo contributors!
What is more, we as members of Resolution are invested in giving back to our community, and to youth in the arts. Which is why: any donations in excess of our needs for the show will be donated to First City Art Center in Pensacola, who so kindly will be hosting us at their Hot Glass Cold Brew event on March 18th, 2016.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A little about me</h3>
<p>I am the artist known online as Christy ""Goldenwolf"" Grandjean (and sometimes just Goldenwolf)!  I am a mostly self-taught professional artist well known for my anthropomorphic animal characters and unique whimsical style.  My work is quite visible, well known, and wide-spread across the internet. I have had several licensing deals with various companies, and I have been published in several magazines and other publications.  My art has even been featured on the hit MTV series ""Teen Wolf""!</p>
<p>This is my fourth sketchbook volume that follows my wildly successful three previous volumes.  These ""sketchbooks"" are collections of drawings I have done for clients, or friends, or for myself, plus doodles, scribbles, ideas, vignettes, and just plain silliness from my own personal sketchbooks over the years. No two of my sketchbook collections are alike, and each one features entirely different art than the others.</p>
<p>I need your help getting funded so that I can cover my costs of printing a first run of these sketchbooks. </p>
<h3>The Sketchbook</h3>
<p>Same format and size as the first three volumes:<br/>8.5"" X 11"" Perfect Bound Paperback<br/>Black and White interior<br/>Glossy Full Color Cover<br/>PG-13 Content (suitable for teens and up)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517255073/wrvg4xotnk9hxloab0jd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>63 Pages full of my sketches and drawings from over the years, including many never before seen works!  There will be some old, and lots of new in this volume so there will be tons of great stuff to enjoy! (FYI I will never repeat stuff that has been used in previous volumes so that the art in each of my sketchbooks is fresh).</p>
<h3>What I Need, and Perks!</h3>
<p>I would like to do an initial printing run of 200 books, plus enough to re-order 100 copies of each of the previous three sketchbooks. All of this, with shipping, will cost about $3,000. Once the books are printed they will be available on my website, <a href=""http://www.goldenwolfen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.goldenwolfen.com</a>, in my Etsy store, and at the various art shows and conventions I attend throughout the year. However, if you help fund this campaign, you will get your sketchbook(s) and other perks at a reduced price!</p>
<p>Here are the perks I am offering in return for your contribution:</p>
<p><strong>Sketchbook V4 - $18</strong>: You will receive an signed copy of the sketchbook.</p>
<p><strong>Sketchbook Plus - $30:</strong> You will receive a signed copy of the sketchbook, plus an 8.5"" X 11"" open edition, unmatted print of your choice from my website.</p>

I am hoping to have them to me by April 2018 (or sooner if I can). Once I have them, I will begin shipping them out to everyone. Please be aware that I am just one person handling this, however, so getting everyone's perks out may take some additional time.

2012 will be the 100th anniversary of the birth
of Alan Turing, one of the greatest minds Britain has ever produced. Between inventing the digital

<p>PiRats   are a buoyant community of creators and art appreciators who   demonstrate the very best of which Second Life is capable. Its steady   leaders have developed an international community with both real-life   and virtual presence.</p>
<p>PiRats members are connected by both shared   activity and social fellowship -- exactly the formula which, Linden   Lab's own research shows, is most likely to keep residents in SL. As   such, the PiRats are a considerable economic asset to Linden Lab.</p>

<p>As   a tremendous aesthetic and creativity-promoting asset to Second Life,   the PiRats are perfect candidates for a free region from the Linden   Endowment for the Arts.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that a region   will be granted to the PiRat owners so that they can save up resources   for a year to continue PiRats thereafter. Keeping the PiRats in Second   Life at the cost of simply granting them a region would be a terrific   bargain for Linden Lab.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story


Some of you
know Pirats Art Network, because we have a strong communication, both inside
and outside Second Life as on Facebook, YouTube, Dailymotion, MySpace, LinkedIn
and especially through our website now followed in more than 100 countries and
whose visits are steadily rising.
I would
pass quickly on the Second Life statistics, a group of 1,400 people, almost 20,070
unique visitors and some 170.000 TP in our galleries, openings with 90 to 200
people every Monday to see the work of more than 240 artists from around wide.
In three
years Pirats Art Network made 160 exhibitions and openings, some in Real Life
and Second Life, 4,800 individual arts shows, more than 13,000 art works exhibited for an international audience.
Our main
strength is undoubtedly the growing number of people we attract in Second Life,
which came first for Art, for Pirats Art Network, but still, ultimately,
residents of Second Life and clients of Linden Lab.

<h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>My name is Beatrice Bulteau. I'm an artist. I've been painting for over forty years, and I am known for my works with horses. I have already published two art books since 2001, Magical Horses and Lusitano. The latter depicts the character of the Lusitano Horse with paintings, drawings and ceramics, along with the help of poetry written by Joseph Sherman and others. Such a complete and sincere account was only possible after many years of living in Portugal among the breeders and the horses themselves in their natural habitat. Through the arts we show the soul of what we depict.</p>
<p>This year I intend to to the same by publishing my third book, this time on the Arabian Horse.</p>
<p>I had the incredible luck of meeting exceptional breeders from Cairo, Egypt, the birthplace of the Egyptian Arab Horse. Dr. Nasr Marei (breeder and international judge) and Dani Barbeiri (with 40+ years of experience in arabian horse breeding) among them. They both showed me the incredible mystical side of the desert horse, so that I could portray it. It's a kind of secret that I can't keep, and after a few years among their company, want to reveal.</p>
<p>It is important that I publish this book myself because, just as it was with my first book, I feel like this work needs my full control. In order to make sure that it is organized in the best possible way, that the message goes across as best as possible, I have chosen to self-publish to ensure that it remains a pure work of art.</p>
<p>This is my second book on a specific breed. The first one helped to spread the knowledge and the origins of the Lusitano horse throughout the world, along with its beauty, character, and the cultural connection it has to its country, Portugal. My art served as the vehicle for this expression. I want to do the same for the Arabian Horse, as I think it deserves the same recognition. By helping me publish this book, you are helping me show the hidden side of the Arabian Horse.</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, the funds will further support my art and cover some of the expenses of my research on the Arab Horse, along with all the other resources that I gathered to make this book. Also, you will have still had the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and acquire my works at an incredibly low price! How dare you! :)<br/>I will also have had the compensation of knowing you all better and working like heck to send you all this wonderful stuff! Oh, well... :)</p>
<p>So please join my project so we can show the world an artistic report on the soul of the desert horse. Also, let us pay tribute to the greatest breeders of this most ancient and valuable treasure.</p></div>","Help me publish a wonderful book...
... and get wonderful art in the process!

ABOUT THE PROJECT
My name is Beatrice Bulteau. I'm an artist. I've been painting for over forty years, and I am known for my works with horses. I have already published two art books since 2001, Magical Horses and Lusitano. The latter depicts the character of the Lusitano Horse with paintings, drawings and ceramics, along with the help of poetry written by Joseph Sherman and others. Such a complete and sincere account was only possible after many years of living in Portugal among the breeders and the horses themselves in their natural habitat. Through the arts we show the soul of what we depict.
This year I intend to to the same by publishing my third book, this time on the Arabian Horse.
I had the incredible luck of meeting exceptional breeders from Cairo, Egypt, the birthplace of the Egyptian Arab Horse. Dr. Nasr Marei (breeder and international judge) and Dani Barbeiri (with 40+ years of experience in arabian horse breeding) among them. They both showed me the incredible mystical side of the desert horse, so that I could portray it. It's a kind of secret that I can't keep, and after a few years among their company, want to reveal.
It is important that I publish this book myself because, just as it was with my first book, I feel like this work needs my full control. In order to make sure that it is organized in the best possible way, that the message goes across as best as possible, I have chosen to self-publish to ensure that it remains a pure work of art.
This is my second book on a specific breed. The first one helped to spread the knowledge and the origins of the Lusitano horse throughout the world, along with its beauty, character, and the cultural connection it has to its country, Portugal. My art served as the vehicle for this expression. I want to do the same for the Arabian Horse, as I think it deserves the same recognition. By helping me publish this book, you are helping me show the hidden side of the Arabian Horse.
If the goal is not reached, the funds will further support my art and cover some of the expenses of my research on the Arab Horse, along with all the other resources that I gathered to make this book. Also, you will have still had the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and acquire my works at an incredibly low price! How dare you! :)I will also have had the compensation of knowing you all better and working like heck to send you all this wonderful stuff! Oh, well... :)
So please join my project so we can show the world an artistic report on the soul of the desert horse. Also, let us pay tribute to the greatest breeders of this most ancient and valuable treasure.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Dorian ""Paul D"" Rogers. I have been a performance poet for more than ten years. During that time, I have been blessed to make many achievements in the U.S. I've featured at over 40 colleges and universities. I have also won both regional and national poetry competitions. My most recent goal has been to take my talents abroad. In November 2011, I moved to Abu Dhabi to teach and help spread spoken word. In December, I was able to have my first international feature in Berlin. With your help, I will continue my goal with my first international tour to Cape Town and Johannesburg. With your assistance, no matter how small, I will be fulfilling my dreams to spread performance poetry across the world. I will also be able to give free educational workshops that focus on writing poetry and an appreciation for language arts.</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
For this two-week journey, I will need $4,000. I will be taking care of the cost of my own flight. Your funds will be allotted to a few specific areas. I will use $1500 to bring along a film-maker to document the journey. This will take care of their flight, hotel, and give them spending money for food. It will also cover cost for equipment rental. Another $1500 will assist with helping me commute across different regions of South Africa. Another $1,000 will assist with my own lodging. I am offering a silver, gold, and diamond donor package that includes everything from copies of my upcoming poetry CD a custom-made poem written specifically to a big occasion in your life.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
The impact of this tour will be big. If you know me, you know that I am positive ambassador for progressive arts that empowers others to express themselves. As a school teacher for seven years, I know that I am uniquely qualified to get youth excited about the power of words. The video documentary will help you see first-hand the impact that I will have on South Africa. Don't worry if you can't pony up any funds. Getting the word out is valuable in of itself. Take a second to share my campaign link with your close friends. It only takes a second and will make a world of difference to me. Thanks and may God bless you!</div>

Hi,
my name is Tex Allen. For the last four years, I've worn a clown Nose
on my face every time I leave the house. I did so because it made me
happy. The first day, three people asked me, “Why the Nose?” That
night, my fiance told me to, “...grab that domain name, you're onto
something.”</p>
<p>
I
did and kept wearing the Nose, handing them out to anyone brave
enough to <b>SPEAK</b> to me. I also started taking their photos with the
Nose and telling the amazing and beautiful stories online. People
around the world who've tuned into the movement have asked me for
Noses or bought their own and spread this <b>JOY</b> to over

this!”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the song's infectious lyrics and
how it put the raw, beautiful breadth of humanity on display through
dance just grabbed me and I was overwhelmed.

<p>
</p><p><b>
“This

<p>
</p><p>
NOTE:
<b>Noses are OPTIONAL during the video</b> :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
After
that night in March, we began to ask if there was community interest
in the project and <b>instantly</b> found that:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
	People,
	Camps, Art Projects and Core organizations were ready to participate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Videographers
	from all over the community wanted to pitch in!</p>
</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>Bolstered by the support, I prepared a brief and sent it over to
Burning Man as a media project. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>
It

The
previous four years of ridiculous stunts in the name of <b>LOVE</b> for

</p><h4><b>
360Happy!
serves many purposes:</b></h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
	It's
	the first music video documentary of it's kind that's been
	collaboratively created and funded by the <b>ENTIRE</b> community. It's the
	World's Longest Home Video starring <b>YOU</b> and thousands of your
	friends!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	360Happy!
	will portray the Burning Man experience from “the inside out”
	We'll be highlighting the organizations, camps and art pieces that
	are the <b>HEART</b> of our community. Then we add in Happy! and a dancer
	and the backdrop of Burning Man in all directions. You could call it
	“Meeting John Malkovich” meets Soul Train in the desert, for 24
	hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Once
	completed, we'll have a film that can be shown around the world as a
	unique artwork that <b>IMMERSES</b> the viewer in the Burning Man
	experience. It will be available to Burning Man regionals, as well
	as civic art events, art museums and other creatively inspired
	community engagements globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	360Happy!
	allows us to create a <b>HISTORIC, NEXTCULTURE documentary</b> that reaches out and pays
	tribute to the thousands of Burning Man artists by encouraging <b>ALL</b>
	the community to participate in it's creation.

there was ever an instant symbol of the Nose and the love that Cat
and I have for this community, the Janky Tent shines. Before the

months before and created a circus tent for the trip. It's a
hand-painted mess, courtesy of my lack-of-painting-skills! It's
janky.</p>
<p>It's
been the center of every event we've attended though and we've handed
out thousands of Noses under it's awnings. It's held thousands of
friends and family in and out of it's modest shell. Really, it's our
sacred spot and we know that it's got so much lovin' JUJU soaked up
in the fabric that secret government agencies are probably tracking
it's heat signature. For real.</p><p></p><p><b>(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)</b></p><p></p><p><b>VIPPEE

360
Degrees of Happy! At Burning Man 


WhyTheNose?


Hi,
my name is Tex Allen. For the last four years, I've worn a clown Nose
on my face every time I leave the house. I did so because it made me
happy. The first day, three people asked me, “Why the Nose?” That
night, my fiance told me to, “...grab that domain name, you're onto
something.”

I
did and kept wearing the Nose, handing them out to anyone brave
enough to SPEAK to me. I also started taking their photos with the
Nose and telling the amazing and beautiful stories online. People
around the world who've tuned into the movement have asked me for
Noses or bought their own and spread this JOY to over
30 countries with nearly 250,000 lovebombs gifted to date! 

WhyTheNose? has produced over 40 music videos too and this one is starting a REVOLUTION!
In
early March, late one night I discovered the site:


24hoursofhappy.com


via
my fiance' Cat handing me an iPad, saying, “You've GOT to see
this!”

Well, the song's infectious lyrics and
how it put the raw, beautiful breadth of humanity on display through
dance just grabbed me and I was overwhelmed. 



“This
needs to happen at Burning Man!', I told my fiance Cat.

“With
Noses!” she replied.


NOTE:
Noses are OPTIONAL during the video :)


After
that night in March, we began to ask if there was community interest
in the project and instantly found that:




	People,
	Camps, Art Projects and Core organizations were ready to participate



	Videographers
	from all over the community wanted to pitch in!


Bolstered by the support, I prepared a brief and sent it over to
Burning Man as a media project. 



It
got approved and a team began assembling to co-create this massive videography artwork.

It's a bold, audacious and grand LOVESTUNT!

Our
goal is to REMIX and REBUILD the universal meme Pharrell created and show the entire
Burning Man community through a lens of dance and happiness that's
unique to the citizens of Black Rock City. We'll take the viewer on a
journey from Gate to the Temple in 24 hours...and create an
experience that immerses the viewer in the myriad, unlimited
possibilities that we create on the Playa, together.


For
those who've never attended, this will be a living document of the
love that went into creating Burning Man 2014 and a chance for the
millions who want to attend Burning Man to take a 24 hour trip to the
desert!Every
camp / art installation / core services team / and major Playa event
will have the opportunity to participate and we'll film it for them.
We're being given an opportunity to create the WORLD'S FIRST MUSIC VIDEO DOCUMENTARY and have the entire Burning Man community ready to
participate.

“You're
a fan of the Grand Gesture...”

The
previous four years of ridiculous stunts in the name of LOVE for
EVERYONE via WhyTheNose? have paved the way for this GRAND project.
We've had plenty of practice pulling together community under the
banner of FUN, we're simply scaling it up a bit for 2014!


360Happy!
serves many purposes:




	It's
	the first music video documentary of it's kind that's been
	collaboratively created and funded by the ENTIRE community. It's the
	World's Longest Home Video starring YOU and thousands of your
	friends!



	360Happy!
	will portray the Burning Man experience from “the inside out”
	We'll be highlighting the organizations, camps and art pieces that
	are the HEART of our community. Then we add in Happy! and a dancer
	and the backdrop of Burning Man in all directions. You could call it
	“Meeting John Malkovich” meets Soul Train in the desert, for 24
	hours.



	Once
	completed, we'll have a film that can be shown around the world as a
	unique artwork that IMMERSES the viewer in the Burning Man
	experience. It will be available to Burning Man regionals, as well
	as civic art events, art museums and other creatively inspired
	community engagements globally.



	360Happy!
	allows us to create a HISTORIC, NEXTCULTURE documentary that reaches out and pays
	tribute to the thousands of Burning Man artists by encouraging ALL
	the community to participate in it's creation. 
	



360Happy!
is a massive GIFT of Happiness! from our community to each other and
the world.Remember, this is a Burning Man version of Happy!


There's
a lot of planning and equipment going into creating this video and
we've made this list of items and services to be funded with your
help:





	2003
	Chevy Express Cargo Van and 2-person travel trailer serving as
	production headquarters for Burning Man and our Community Engagement
	vehicles for the Nose and 360Happy! - Rental $4650


Electric art car filming platform, previously used by Roy2Thousand
	to create “The Fertile Desert” with  a complement of four
	batteries, chargers and a generator http://vimeo.com/37149784
	- $3800



	10
	GoPro kits for the five video crews. Each kit includes a GoPro3,
	hand-held stabilizer, two backup batteries, viewer BacPak, 128GB of
	memory, external memory bank for video storage and LED lighting for night
	capture. Cameras and branded accessories will be rentals. - $4550

All
the money raised will go directly towards purchasing the
equipment needed to bring this gift to life. Any funds raised beyond
our needs will go into extra equipment to further outfit  video
volunteer teams. Also, we've been offered the opportunity to apply our van/trailer rental fees towards purchasing them as a platform to move forward with our art. Extra funds would be added to those fees and outright purchase of the vehicles.

Since
this is a WhyTheNose? Project, you should be aware that we've got some
ridiculous and amazing rewards!
Producer
Credit – $1
That's
right, you get to be a REAL LIVE PRODUCER of a 24-hour documentary!
We'll put your name up there, or whatever name you like, as one of
our Producers. Heck, you can put that on a business card! Think of
the possibilities. The mind boggles!Personal
Thank You in the “World's Longest Credits Video” - $5
After
we're done, I'm gonna personally thank EVERYONE WHO DONATED at and
above this level. YEP. My last “Thank You” video for Burning Man
2012 went for 12 minutes...My goal is to also make it the most entertaining credits EVER.I can't wait to SHOUT YOU OUT!
WhyTheNose?
Archives 8 x 10 print - $25
Since
the project began, I've taken thousands of portraits of faces from
all over the world. For this reward level, you'll get a signed print
I've chosen from the massive galleries taken at Burning Man.   (You also receive the previous reward levels.)
Two
Hour 360Happy! DVD with bonus footage - $50
Look,
24 hours of video is a LOT to watch and you'd probably love to watch
a condensed version of this trip to Burning Man on a DVD, right?
Well, this reward puts the experience AND a whole mess of
behind-the-scenes in a single package! Seriously, if you're already
laughing at this idea, wait until you see what went into making it
happen :) It'll be the best gag reel...Ever.(You also receive the previous reward levels.)
Sponsor
a DANCE! - $100
We
KNOW you're a lovely person and a giving person and someone who wants
to make everyone Happy! Knowing that, we created “Sponsor a Dance”
just for YOU! At this level, you are SPONSORING a random person at
Burning Man and gifting them their 4 MINUTES OF FAME :) Our teams
will tell the people who are lining up to dance that YOU sponsored
them to do their THANG. Or shake their THANG. Or however they GET
DOWN. 

In
addition, we'll put your name as the AWESOME gifting sponsor on their
dance credits and connect you and your dancer as artist and
benefactor. You're getting a new, dancing friend and everyone's even
Happier! (Yes, there's a theme here)(You also receive Producer and Credit levels)Set
of 12 Limited Edition Prints - $200
During
Burning Man 2014, I'll be creating a series of photos that capture
the experience of filming 360Happy! combined with WhyTheNose?
Afterwards, the shots will be printed in a limited set of 12 and
never printed again. For a few supporters, I'll create this #loveset
of photos to enjoy and remember the beautiful effort the community
put forth to create this art.(You also receive Producer and Credit levels)
Featured
Dance, Top of the Hour! - $350
With
24 hours available, we thought it would be great to REALLY give
everyone attending this year, the opportunity to have their OWN
FEATURED DANCE. At the top of each hour, we'll have a highlighted
dance that will begin that specific If you'd like to show the world YOUR awesome dancing self at the highlighted times in 360Happy! in front of the WORLD: Here's your shot!Who wants to
DANCE at Sunset? Or Sunrise? Or even Noon?(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)DANCIN'
TEX - $500This
reward is a FANTASTIC opportunity for YOU to make ME look completely SILLY. Because I'm
putting up FIVE rewards where I'm your dancin' Tex! You tell me how
to dance and I'll do it. It's your script. Want me to climb upside
down and jerk like a monkey, flip down, crawl towards to camera like
Madonna, strip off my boots and take a shower with my clothes on
while dancing to Happy! And eating a peanut butter sandwich with no
milk in a tutu? OK. That's EASY.
You
could actually ask me to do something RIDICULOUS too, I guess.(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)
The
NOSE - $1000Four
years ago, I wore a Nose and changed my life. Shortly after we
attended Burning Man for the first time, took 50 Noses and the story
that began. Thousands and thousands of Noses later, I've still
got two from that first trip. They've been placed on my
personal altar. Sometimes, when I feel I really NEED a lift, I drop one in my pocket as a
token. After four years, I'm offering up one of these personal
artifacts.(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)
Janky
Tent - $2000

If
there was ever an instant symbol of the Nose and the love that Cat
and I have for this community, the Janky Tent shines. Before the
first Burning Man with the Nose, we camped out in the desert a few
months before and created a circus tent for the trip. It's a
hand-painted mess, courtesy of my lack-of-painting-skills! It's
janky.
It's
been the center of every event we've attended though and we've handed
out thousands of Noses under it's awnings. It's held thousands of
friends and family in and out of it's modest shell. Really, it's our
sacred spot and we know that it's got so much lovin' JUJU soaked up
in the fabric that secret government agencies are probably tracking
it's heat signature. For real.(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)VIPPEE
Nose Ambassador - $3000
Once
360Happy! Is complete, we expect to take it around the USA to art
events where the Nose has already been asked to participate on a
civic/community level. If the movie is playing near you, I'll fly in
to meet YOU for the entire 24hour Happy! experience and we'll Nose
your TOWN! Additionally, YOU'LL be the VIPPEE presenting the movie,
and the Nose Ambassador of Love! (No Pressure) Sound like fun? You have no idea how much we can
do in a day together with a few hundred Noses...(You also receive Producer and Credit levels, along with an archive print)
We've
got a crew of media professional, Playa-veterans on our team.
Their
expertise is centered around video production and between them
there's 30 years of experience in the Black Rock Desert. Every one of
them is ready to dedicate the time and energy to make sure this
project covers our entire community and brings 25 hours of smiles :)
PLEASE WATCH BELOW WHERE I EXPLAIN THE RISKS, THANKS!So, although usage rights prevent us from using ""Happy"" in the crowdfunding video itself, we are securing synchronization license from the copyright owner, where we will have full use of the song in our 24+ hour movie venture!Thank
you!
Without
you, there would be no WhyTheNose? You've all carried this #lovestunt around the world. We want to broadcast that ethos of
love, inclusion and understanding to a larger audience.360Happy! is ready to do that with your continued belief in:Spreading
Love Around the World, Person to Person, One Nose at a Time :)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a free-lance artist who specializes in painting guitars. I've been painting guitars for over 20 years for several companies including, but not limited to, Fender, Gibson and Ibanez. I've also painted drums for bands including but not limited to Motley Crue, Def Leppard and Mick Fleetwood. I've also created art for bands and festivals to use on tour merchandise for the Scorpions, Aerosmith, Lollapalooza and others. In recent years, I've been working on a portrait portfolio of musicians and sports celebritites.</p>
<p>I've been working out of my home studio and it's time to get out! I want to open an art gallery in North Hollywood, CA. where I can display my art and meet clients in a professional setting. This gallery will be the first of its kind in the world. One investor funded the creation of 10 guitars and matching paintings for the grand opening. The luthiers involved are world-renowned masterbuilders from Fender's and Ibanez's Custom Shops. The event that brings us all together in one place will be HISTORIC IN THE GUITAR WORLD.</p>
<p>My entire career I've worked as a free-lancer creating art for companies and private collectors. I've worked at home to raise my child. Now that he's 23, it's time for me to make my own stamp in public. The goal is to run this as a family business with my son handling the business, leaving me free to paint.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for funding to cover expenses for the first year of the gallery. The total costs are $120,000 which will cover building expenses such as rent and utillities, construction in the building, supplies, advertising, insurance and an assistant's salary. I'm asking for 25% of total funds.</p>
<p>I have hundreds of images that you can choose from for your perks. I do my own fine art prints that I personally quality control. As my public profile increases, so will the value of my art. Some of my guitars have sold for as much as $30,000. John Mayer and Kenny Wayne Shepherd are 2 musicians that have played instruments I've painted. A painted guitar will add an immediate value to your guitar that will grow with time.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the money will be saved until I do. I have several interested investors and also have the option to subsidize the gap with a loan.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be the first art gallery of its kind, blending music and art. If you want to be part of something that is truly unique and special, this is your chance. When you see your favorite musician playing an instrument painted by me, you'll know you had a part in making it happen.</p>
<p>I've been working in this industry for over 20 years. I've painted some of Fender's most successful projects including the Playboy 40th Anniversary Fender CS Strat and the Jimi Hendrix Monterey Pop Fender CS Strat. I was also on the design team of the Harley 90th Anniversary Fender CS Strat. These guitars are selling for up to $30,000.</p>
<p>I have a strong reputation as being reliable and delivering the highest quality possible. This is why the companies I've worked with have been relationships lasting more than 20 years.</p>

<h3>Who is Honey Pot Performance?</h3>
<p>Honey Pot Performance (HPP) is Felicia Holman, Aisha Jean-Baptiste, Abra Johnson and Meida McNeal---a quartet of Chicago-based, kindred creative spirits who began collaborating in January 2001.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/948875/pictures/full/20130725133929-Price_Point___Sketchbook_13.jpg?1374784855"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>HPP is a woman-focused collaborative creative community committed to chronicling and interrogating Afro-diasporic feminist and unconventional subjectivities amidst the pressures of contemporary global life.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of cultural workers such as Zora Neale Hurston, Beryl McBurnie, Pearl Primus and Katherine Dunham, Honey Pot Performance forefronts African diasporic performance traditions. We draw upon a central notion found in both performance studies and black feminist discourse: non-Western, everyday popular and/or folk forms of cultural performance are valuable sites of knowledge production and cultural capital for subjectivities that often exist outside of mainstream communities.</p>

<p>During the monthlong world premiere of 'Price Point' (June 2013; Sketchbook 13 performance festival), our audience response included overwhelming demand for a remount!  Here’s a sample of the feedback from our wonderfully engaged Sketchbook 13 audiences:</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>“Great performance! These amazing artists are terrific, straight forward and touching at the same time. Lots of times I have felt misunderstood, misinterpreted, and misheard when I speak up about life in general (success, economics, work, and even spiritual life) working so hard to obtain the BEST sacrificing many valuable things as family, mind, spirit, soul, and even compromising one’s health. When the performance finished I had a sweet &amp; sour after taste!!! I love their work, very well done. Good sense of humor in some parts (why not laugh about our reality for a little bit?). I totally recommend… It’s a Must!”</em></p>

<p>As Sketchbook 13 festival participants, all of our production and marketing needs were supported by the festival's producer---Collaboraction theater company.  As we approach our self-produced 2013/2014 performance season, we are creatively sourcing our production/marketing needs through various channels....which include THIS 30-day fundraising campaign!</p>

<h3>The HPP Impact</h3>
<p>The audience feedback above vividly illustrates the impact of an HPP show, but let's also consider this: funding HPP's 2013-14 season is important to us, our audiences and our communities because we each recognize that everyday popular and/or folk forms of cultural performance are valuable sites of knowledge production and cultural capital for subjectivities that often exist outside of mainstream communities. Performance is our therapy, our catharsis, our way to community. Performance is the haven that welcomes us to rediscover our own value and worth.  Performance and expression bring our dormant, unsaid emotions to the surface and urge us to work them out within a community that not only bears witness, but also empathizes through experience. It is in this spirit of healing &amp; community that we strive to incorporate an outreach component in each of our projects.</p>
<p><img alt=""http://performanceethnography.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/price-point-abra-video.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://performanceethnography.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/price-point-abra-video.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>For example, during our 2010 residency at the UNC/Chapel Hill, we devised and led afterschool workshops to share our creative process with area public school students. During our 2011 touring performance festival ('To Art &amp; Profit'; Chicago,IL), we coordinated site specific public ""spectacles"" and panel discussions which invited residents of the participating festival neighborhoods to witness/participate in collaborative art practices &amp; art valuation.</p>

<p>Our latest work, 'Price Point', serves as a hybrid of art and public service...an economic ringshout! The live 'Price Point' experience offers a proverbial safe space to both witness and testify to the dynamic endeavor of surviving in a devalued labor market. A safe space to create new answers to the question ""What is today's social contract?"". Our coalition with fellow artists and concerned citizens reflects our shared vision and experiences of alternative/DIY economic mobility. With your generous contributions, we can continue to pursue and manifest that vision!</p>
<p>Since 2001, our creative works have been presented at Kenyon College, Columbia College, the Chicago Cultural Center, Ohio University, Northwestern University, University of California-Irvine, Malcolm X College (Chicago), Links Hall (Chicago), Old Town School of Folk Music (Chicago) and the University of West Indies (Trinidad).  We have also received grants and other generous support from the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in the Arts (Northwestern University), the Telecommunications Service of Trinidad &amp; Tobago (Trinidad), the Community Arts Assistance Program, the Evanston Arts Council, the Illinois Humanities Council, the Contemporary Arts Council (Chicago), Driehaus Foundation, Chicago Dancemakers Forum, Puffin Foundation and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.</p>

Honey Pot Performance (HPP) is Felicia Holman, Aisha Jean-Baptiste, Abra Johnson and Meida McNeal---a quartet of Chicago-based, kindred creative spirits who began collaborating in January 2001.

HPP is a woman-focused collaborative creative community committed to chronicling and interrogating Afro-diasporic feminist and unconventional subjectivities amidst the pressures of contemporary global life.
Following in the footsteps of cultural workers such as Zora Neale Hurston, Beryl McBurnie, Pearl Primus and Katherine Dunham, Honey Pot Performance forefronts African diasporic performance traditions. We draw upon a central notion found in both performance studies and black feminist discourse: non-Western, everyday popular and/or folk forms of cultural performance are valuable sites of knowledge production and cultural capital for subjectivities that often exist outside of mainstream communities.

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>So ten years of art-making later, I'm finally getting myself a proper online portfolio for my paintings, words and curatorial projects. Yay!  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Because Multiply has ceased functioning as a blog site (*shakes fist in the air*) and if I don't get a site I can update, my public profile is doomed to forever be frozen in January 2013 -- not good for an independant practitioner of any sort!</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>In summary, I am artist/writer based in Singapore and my work revolves around exploring how personal stories can be used to address larger socio-cultural issues of sex, gender, queer desire and notions of home. Besides painting and writing, my curatorial practice includes co-founding/running <em>Etiquette</em>, Singapore's first multidisciplinary art collective focused on feminist issues and organising exhibitions/discussions in alignment with NGOS/collectives such as the Association of Women for Action &amp; Research (AWARE), IndigNation, Slutwalk Singapore, Animal Concerns, Research &amp; Education Society (ACRES) and Sayoni. </p>

<h3>When?</h3>
<div>I'm aiming to get the website out by June 2013. With two books coming out this year, a whole new slew of <em>Etiquette</em> events and me fresh into a new research project re-presenting art-activism in Singapore, I thought it would be a great time to start documenting everything that is going on. </div>
<p> </p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Good question! Especially since I am to computers what fire is to ice. Don't worry, I'm not attempting to build a website from scratch. I've hired the awesome peeps at Octopus Ink to do it.

<h2>Mongolia’s Buddhist Monasteries Project</h2>
<h3>Uncovering the past, building the future</h3>
<p>Help us publish a treasure trove of data on historic Buddhist temple sites and share the stories of Mongolia’s elders, preserving a rich cultural past and encouraging young Mongolian citizens to embrace their heritage.</p>
<h3>THEN</h3>
<p>In the late 1930’s Mongolia’s Buddhist heritage was torn away when the Soviet-style Communists devastated the country’s sacred landscapes by destroying all the monasteries – and exiling or killing the monks or ordering them to be nomads, factory workers or soldiers.</p>
<h3> NOW</h3>
<p>Today, Mongolians are actively seeking to retrieve the past, and striving to make contact with their historic cultural identity.  The history of Mongolia has been captured through stories of the elderly and archeological mapping of former Buddhist monastery sites, key to rediscovering Mongolia's unique cultural heritage.</p>
<p><em>STEP 1:</em> We visited over 1300 sites of old and revived temples</p>
<p>The Arts Council of Mongolia sent survey teams to every part of the country to seek out the elders and survey the sites over a 1,000 Buddhist temples.  These elders, many of them young monks at the time of the destruction, told us their stories about daily life in the temples and monasteries. We also took GPS readings and photographs to preserve the elder’s identification of the Monastery sites.</p>
<p><em>STEP 2:</em> We now need to publish what we found</p>
<p>The hard part is done.  Now, these stories, locations and photographs need to be published initially online so that Mongolians – and people across the globe – can gain access to Mongolia’s rich Buddhist past.</p>
<h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>We are so close!  We need only $8,000 to complete the online publishing and make Mongolia’s Buddhist history accessible to Mongolians and the rest of the world.  We can do that with your help.  Please help us preserve the past and build the future of Mongolia’s history, and worldwide cultural understanding.</p>
<h3><strong>PROJECT SPECIFICS</strong></h3>

<p><span><strong>Short Summary</strong></span></p>
<p><span>My name is Gregg Deal. I am an artist, a husband, a father and a member of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. Welcome to what could very easily be the most important work of my artistic career. </span></p>
<p><span>This project is a performance art piece. I will be wearing traditional Native American clothing in various, everyday scenarios interacting with the public which will create </span>interesting, thought-provoking, and even comical situations where the public will be forced to look at me, as a stereotypical Native person, and what I'm doing, and question what they are watching. How will they react if they saw me, a Native dressed in buckskin and a headdress, doing something as mundane as shopping for cereal at the grocery store? How would they react if they saw me eating Chinese food in China Town or taking pictures of buffalo at the National Zoo? How would they react if they saw me waiting in a Metro station or were riding in the same Metro car?</p>
<div>The performances will include a number of things that are simple, mundane, funny, political, over the top, satirical, ironic and even sad. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The initial phase of this project will take place in the Washington D.C. and DC metro area. </div>
<p><span>The purpose of this project is to raise questions about Native people, often viewed as a relic, and how they’re perceived in the modern age.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Gregg Deal. I am an artist, a husband, a father and a member of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. Welcome to what could very easily be the most important work of my artistic career. 
This project is a performance art piece. I will be wearing traditional Native American clothing in various, everyday scenarios interacting with the public which will create interesting, thought-provoking, and even comical situations where the public will be forced to look at me, as a stereotypical Native person, and what I'm doing, and question what they are watching. How will they react if they saw me, a Native dressed in buckskin and a headdress, doing something as mundane as shopping for cereal at the grocery store? How would they react if they saw me eating Chinese food in China Town or taking pictures of buffalo at the National Zoo? How would they react if they saw me waiting in a Metro station or were riding in the same Metro car?
The performances will include a number of things that are simple, mundane, funny, political, over the top, satirical, ironic and even sad. 
 
The initial phase of this project will take place in the Washington D.C. and DC metro area. 
The purpose of this project is to raise questions about Native people, often viewed as a relic, and how they’re perceived in the modern age.
What We Need & What You Get
The funding will help with obtaining the “traditional” outfit I will use, equipment needed for documentation and expenses to go along with it. I will be documenting this entire project through film and photography. This documentation will result in prints for upcoming shows as well a short film about the work and why it's relevant to art and the Native voice associated with it. 
The incentives to contributing funds will get you limited prints of the work, with larger donations receiving more and larger prints*. Another aspect to the 'perks' is being listed in the closing credits of the short documentary that will coincide with this project. This wouldn't happen without you.  
The Impact
I am aware of the subjective nature of art, but feel strongly about this work. This art campaign will force it's audience to engage the legitimacy of what they're seeing, where they stand, how it makes them feel, and what it means for Native people to exist, thrive and perpetuate their own culture in a society that has forced their assimilation.

<h2><strong>Behold, the Blacklight Wonder...</strong></h2>
<p>Aloha and welcome to the wonderful world of transformative body painting! Meet  Rachel Deboer, a visual artist involved in theater arts and body painting collectively for over 27 years. Over the past 11 years, Rachel has nurtured Maui's face and body painting community and started Next Level Theater Productions to share Polynesian culture in a blacklight theater medium. Rachel's next big goal is to bring her passionate team on a very special journey to the World Body Painting Festival in Austria to compete in the Fluoro (UV/black light) body paint category this summer.</p>
<h2>
<strong>15th Annual World Body Painting Festival</strong>       </h2>
<p>The World Body Painting Festival in Austria is the mecca of body painting education, instruction and events and Rachel Deboer has been accepted as one of only 15 artists in the entire world to create a blacklight bodypaint performance for the UV world bodypainting competition. We have 3 minutes on the world stage to represent Maui and to present our unique vision of the theme (Inner Fears: Battling the Invisible) utilizing body paint, costuming, and props. </p>
<p>This is the Olympics of body painting and the Fluoro division is one of the most interactive and intense categories; we are required go beyond body painting to create a visual spectacle. Theater and visual arts and black light body painting are the tools we use to make the private processes of human experience public. Using these tools of illusion, we present an exciting new level of reality. We take the ancient magic of storytelling and shine ultraviolet light onto our cast, props and costumes, creating memorable and transformative experiences for our audiences.</p>

I'm
Sophie, an artist working with and in response to the natural
environment. I have been offered a place on an MA in Art and
Environment in Falmouth and I very much want to take this next step
in my creative journey. It will allow me to continue my artistic practice within a framework
of guidance, to research and realise a project exploring the
relationship between art and environment.</p>
<p>
I
believe a great potential exists in the interaction between art and
environment. Environment relates to us all, it is what nourishes and
sustains us, it is the air that we breathe and the water we drink. We
are connected to and dependant upon our natural environment. Yet we
are at a time of great concern, of imbalance. The destruction of natural
environment resonates within us, loss of habitat echoes something of
our own pain and loss. I want to look at creative ways of connecting and of
understanding our connection to nature. I believe art has a role to
play, creativity is the ability to
imagine new ways, to visualise, art can respond and
give voice to that which has no voice. 
</p>
<p>
I
want to particpate in this larger conversation about art's role in
working for the environment. By supporting my work you will enable me
to support myself and to progress with my artistic practice. Despite
the difficulties I face in this quest, relocating myself
with my two girls age 1 and 9, I see this as a great
opportunity to contribute. When I question myself as to why take such
a challenging path, the answer is clear: because I think that this is
important and I am dedicated to this. I feel compelled to act, to do what I can, I
have to respond. To carry out my work within the framework of this
course will give me the opportunity to shine light on something that
I became aware of, something that concerns me.</p><p></p><p>You can see and read more about my work so far here:</p><p><a href=""http://www.stwiss.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stwiss.net</a><br/><a href=""http://www.stwiss.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stwiss.wordpress.com</a></p><p></p>

I'm
Sophie, an artist working with and in response to the natural
environment. I have been offered a place on an MA in Art and
Environment in Falmouth and I very much want to take this next step
in my creative journey. It will allow me to continue my artistic practice within a framework
of guidance, to research and realise a project exploring the
relationship between art and environment.

I
believe a great potential exists in the interaction between art and
environment. Environment relates to us all, it is what nourishes and
sustains us, it is the air that we breathe and the water we drink. We
are connected to and dependant upon our natural environment. Yet we
are at a time of great concern, of imbalance. The destruction of natural
environment resonates within us, loss of habitat echoes something of
our own pain and loss. I want to look at creative ways of connecting and of
understanding our connection to nature. I believe art has a role to
play, creativity is the ability to
imagine new ways, to visualise, art can respond and
give voice to that which has no voice. 


I
want to particpate in this larger conversation about art's role in
working for the environment. By supporting my work you will enable me
to support myself and to progress with my artistic practice. Despite
the difficulties I face in this quest, relocating myself
with my two girls age 1 and 9, I see this as a great
opportunity to contribute. When I question myself as to why take such
a challenging path, the answer is clear: because I think that this is
important and I am dedicated to this. I feel compelled to act, to do what I can, I
have to respond. To carry out my work within the framework of this
course will give me the opportunity to shine light on something that
I became aware of, something that concerns me.You can see and read more about my work so far here:www.stwiss.netwww.stwiss.wordpress.com
Please help me to
add my voice to this dialogue.What I Need & What You Get
I
have set my goal at £5000
and to raise this would be really amazing, it would allow me
to take this next step with stability. My costs are:


The
course fees which are £4995. 

Relocation and rent in Falmouth which looks to be about double what I currently pay (I'm looking into caravans as an alternative living arrangement but I'll get back to you on that...)
Nursery fees
Materials for the course

I do have some money saved and a part time job lined up in Falmouth. I will
continue to work as an artist during the course selling what work I
am able. I am also in the process of arranging a related work placement
which will mean a reduction in the course fee.

<p>Hello, my name is Allison Wade, and I'm an artist and professor in New York City. Born and raised in Illinois and Iowa, and educated in New Mexico and upstate New York, I have a BFA in Photography, an MA in Education, and an MFA in Fine Arts. I am very fortunate to have ended up teaching at the Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC.</p>
<p>I recently received the best news! I was selected to attend the Vermont Studio Center Artist Residency Program this summer. But I need a little help to make this amazing opportunity possible. My campaign is to raise enough money to cover my tuition to attend this residency program in July. The opportunity to live and work in Vermont with 49 other artists and to be away from all the distraction of life in the city, focusing solely my artwork for four glorious weeks, will be extremely beneficial to my creative process and growth as an artist. And I'm not just thinking of my own development here. As an educator, it is extremely important to keep my own artistic practice flourishing, and in turn, share that energy with my students. A win for everyone!</p>
<p>I cannot express the magnitude of what your contributions, in any amount, will help me to achieve.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Art is meant to be shared! So let me help you help me :)</p>
<p>I am trying to raise $3,100 to cover all tuition cost and any extra will go into art supplies such as canvas and paint. Tuition is $3,950 and $650 for painting supplies. I raised $1500 in part 1 of this canpaign! </p>
<p>Get excited because this campaign is a really great way to start collecting some artwork. With every contribution over $25, you will receive an original Allison Wade Photograph taken in Central Park (2012). The image captures a large soap bubble floating over the pond. The higher the contribution, the larger the photographic print you will receive.</p>
<p>All funds raised will go to the Vermont Studio Center for my residency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

We’re very excited to see you in the spring at DOC NOW!</p><p></p><p><b>What DOC NOW is (who we are, what we’re
doing):</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>DOC
NOW is a free multimedia festival developed and run by artists completing the Master
of Fine Arts program in Documentary Media at Ryerson University. It showcases
the first release of film, photography, and new media projects created over two years
of intense focus and collaboration. This diverse group of artists has come
together from Bosnia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Peru, Iran, Korea, the U.S., and
across Canada to support and challenge each other’s work. The work appeals to
an expansive audience through its diversity of topic and viewpoint, from the personal, social,
economic, and political, to the metaphysical and philosophical.</p>
<p>The festival will take place in May and June 2014, offering free exhibitions at
galleries across Toronto and screenings at the Bloor Hot Docs Cinema* and
Ryerson Image Arts. This year marks the sixth annual DOC NOW, and we’d like to
increase the festival’s public engagement by adding an outdoor site-specific
screening and initiating a panel discussion series featuring acclaimed
documentary filmmakers, photographers, and theorists.</p><p>(*Made possible by our sponsor Hot Docs Blue Ice!)</p>
<p><b>Why it’s important:</b></p>
<p></p>

We’re completely overwhelmed by your incredibly generous support, and we can’t thank all of you enough.Even though we’ve hit the $5,000 mark, DOC NOW is a massive undertaking with a very large budget of over $25,000. Every extra contribution we receive will continue to help us on the road to realizing this festival.If you’re able to help, please still do so knowing that we will put ALL the funds raised via Indiegogo to very good use for the festival.Thanks again so much from all of us in the Documentary Media Program. We’re very excited to see you in the spring at DOC NOW!What DOC NOW is (who we are, what we’re
doing):

DOC
NOW is a free multimedia festival developed and run by artists completing the Master
of Fine Arts program in Documentary Media at Ryerson University. It showcases
the first release of film, photography, and new media projects created over two years
of intense focus and collaboration. This diverse group of artists has come
together from Bosnia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Peru, Iran, Korea, the U.S., and
across Canada to support and challenge each other’s work. The work appeals to
an expansive audience through its diversity of topic and viewpoint, from the personal, social,
economic, and political, to the metaphysical and philosophical.
The festival will take place in May and June 2014, offering free exhibitions at
galleries across Toronto and screenings at the Bloor Hot Docs Cinema* and
Ryerson Image Arts. This year marks the sixth annual DOC NOW, and we’d like to
increase the festival’s public engagement by adding an outdoor site-specific
screening and initiating a panel discussion series featuring acclaimed
documentary filmmakers, photographers, and theorists.(*Made possible by our sponsor Hot Docs Blue Ice!)
Why it’s important:

Documentary
is integral to Canada’s artistic identity, and Toronto, as host to multiple festivals and industry
groups, has claimed its identity as a documentary hub. DOC NOW is uniquely important because it is the only free multimedia artist-run documentary festival in Toronto. It is fundamental in providing a

<h3>My Project</h3>
<p>My name is Claudia Gutierrez and I am a Latin-Canadian artist living and working Ottawa, Canada. I have been researching textiles and its history in Latin America for the past year and decided it was the right pivot for my practice. I applied to Arquetopia's residency program and was accepted!</p>
<p>At the residency, I will learn weaving techniques from fifth generation weaving masters. I will also be developing my personal body of work by translating forms and concepts I address in my paintings and prints into my woven works. By going to the capital of textiles in Mexico, I will submersed  in my heritage (coming from Mexican and Uruguayan parents) and bring back not only a practical skill but a part of my personal culture to share with my community in Ottawa, Canada. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why support my project?</h3>
<p>While I am applying for grant funding for CARFAC artist per diums and travel expenses, this Indiegogo campaign will raise funds for the cost of the residency- including the instructional training and ancillary fees from Arquetopia. My goal is to raise $2,000 with your help. All you have to do it purchase some of my work!</p>
<p>By supporting this project you will receive the following:</p>
<p>$25 in support will receive a pack of Thank You cards created and illustrated by me</p>
<p>$50 in support will receive a pack of Thank You cards and an illustrated print by me</p>
<p>$100 in support will receive a pack of Thank you cards, illustrated print and a hand woven rug made by me (sized 24"" x 36"")</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Long term goals</h3>
<p>While developing my arts practice outside of my cultural work (ie my day job at the Ottawa Art Gallery) is the main goal for this project; I also hope this training will create opportunities for me to pass on what I have learned to my local community. In the spirit of promoting pluralism, I believe passing on the traditions and stories of my culture to my Canadian community will create a greater sense of connectivity and allow me to explore my place and role as first generation Canadian. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unable to support monetarily? No problem!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If you are unable to support with a pledge, your voice is an even greater help! Liking and/or sharing my campaign will be an enormous aid in making my project come to fruition. Even sending a message of encouragement means more than you know :) </p>

<div>Insects are beautiful products of nature and far too many people see them as gross and don't take the time to look into the numerous wonders for which they are responsible.

Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival is the most amazing music and camping festival in North America, which takes place in Manchester, Tennessee. At the heart of Bonnaroo is a dedicated and caring philanthropic community. The Bonnaroo Works Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, represents this charitable spirit and supports worthy causes nationally and regionally.  In addition to these hand-signed prints by world famous artists from around the world, there will also be new, original Soundwaves Art pieces being added throughout the campaign. Be be sure to check back and see what is new!! Somewhere near the top of our to-do list is “change the world.” So, in 2009, we created the Bonnaroo Works Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. The Bonnaroo Works Fund supports regional and national organizations with a mission of making communities healthy in areas of the arts, education, and environmental sustainability; with the goal of local reinvestment and asset building for the communities where we live, work, and play.We devote a lot of attention to middle Tennessee and, in particular, the Manchester and Coffee County communities. We support educational, arts and environmental programs as well as a variety of community projects. Since the inception of Bonnaroo, we have given back upward of $7 million to over 100 organizations. Visit http://www.bonnarooworksfund.org for more information and up to date news.Tim is donating the profits from this amazing collection to The Bonnaroo Works Fund. Each piece will be accompanied by a letter of authenticity signed by the artist.Tim has exhibited in cities all over the world from from Singapore to Los Angeles and worked with over 150 of the world's leading recording artists. As Tim's work becomes more collectable you will not only be helping a worthy cause in desperate need of your help but also be investing in a highly collectable piece of music history. At auction recently original pieces fetched in excess of $25,000.Black Keys Singing in 2008All of the images below represent the limited edition artwork you are purchasing. Every print has been hand signed by the musician and by Soundwaves artist, Tim Wakefield. These are not printed or facsimile signatures. Artwork will also be signed and numbered by Tim Wakefield.

<h3>About</h3>
<p>            My name is Jeffrey Sincich.  I have just graduated from the University of Florida with a BFA in Ceramics.  Choosing to study art has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.  I have found myself in some extraordinary situations because of it and could not be happier!  Alongside art is my passion for cycling.  I began cycling in high school by being introduced to track bikes and alleycats.  This love has spread to bicycle touring.  My love for art and cycling has culminated in an amazing opportunity: a three-week long bicycle tour from Portland, OR to San Francisco, CA to research tourism and the Great American West Coast for my future artwork starting on June 18.  I was awarded a Regina Brown Undergraduate Fellowship through the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts (NCECA) to help fund and complete this tour (alongside my longtime, best friend Derek).  As fantastic as this may be, I still need a little more help to make this dream a reality.  This is where you come in!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> What I Need <br/></strong></p>
<p>            To make this tour happen I am going to need another $800 from generous supporters like you.  As I am sure you already know, a recent graduate from college is the perfect storm of running out of money.  Things like travel expenses, cycling specific clothing/gear and the cold, wet Pacific Northwest weather, which requires specific camping gear, adds up quick.  I also plan to keep a blog throughout the duration of the trip so my friends, family and contributors like you can follow Derek and me along our journey.  Of course, this requires a lightweight, technological option, such as a tablet (i.e. iPad or similar device).  It is important for me that I can share this amazing experience with as many people as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>            To make it easier for you to help me, I have added some great perks!  For just $10 you will be getting a personal postcard sent to you from somewhere awesome on our bike tour!  For $50 you will not only be getting a postcard, but a unique, never before seen to you (I hope!) souvenir or artifact from somewhere on the tour!  WOW!  This could include a trolley car bobble head from San Francisco or a giant pinecone from the Redwood Forest.  Imagine the possibilities…   Are you ready for this?  For $100 you will be receiving a postcard AND a handmade, by me, ceramic cup with a drawing inspired by the tour on it!!!  WHOA, BUDDY!  Imagine drinking out of a cup every morning/afternoon/night that was made especially for you!  If just one of these is not enough for you, which I can totally understand, for $200, you will receive a postcard, a handmade, ceramic cup and a souvenir!  Talk about the ultimate gift package!  And of course, I will appreciate everything and anything you can contribute, from $1 to $1000. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> The Impact</strong></p>
<p>            This tour is meant to help me explore the things that inspire my work the most.  My desire to travel, continue cultural traditions such as folklore and folk music and appreciate the land that we have in the good ol’ United States is what drives me to make the work that I do.  Bicycle touring is a unique form of tourism, with little environmental impact, time to smell the roses (literally) and a chance to interact with the local communities in a way that almost no other form of tourism provides.  On this trip, I plan to see the sights and sounds that attract others and me to the Mighty West Coast and translate this into my artwork, which can be seen at <a href=""http://www.jeffreysincich.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jeffreysincich.com</a>.</p>
<p>            I hope that you can help me with this endeavor, whether it is through contributing what you can monetarily or by sharing this link on Facebook, email, word of mouth, Twitter or anything else you can think of.  Thank you for your time and I hope you follow my blog of the trip through my website!</p>

<h2>DAT VERDIENT EEN BEELD</h2>
Nijmegen krijgt dit jaar tijdens de 4 daagse (16-19 juli) een multimedia standbeeld voor de '4 daagse wandelaar'. Een levend standbeeld met ingebouwde display, vertoont unieke beelden van wandelaars eerder die dag. Het beeld zal elke dag langs de route te vinden zijn.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Initiatiefneemster <strong>Ellen Mulders</strong> gaat het beeld ontwerpen: 'Elke dag 40 of 50 kilometer, zo een formidabele prestatie verdient gewoon een beeld'.

<h2>'That deservers a statue/image'</h2>
<p>In Dutch the word 'beeld' means both 'statue' and 'image'. During the international 4 day marches in Nijmegen (16th-19th july) we like to honor all particpating marchers with a special multimedia statue. Our living statue will have a built in display showing images from the marchers earlier that day. The statue will be situated all marching-days at the route.</p>
<p>Initiator <strong>Ellen Mulders</strong>, former dutch champion living statue, will design the statue. 'Walking every day for 40 or 50 kilometer, that is an special achievement, that deserves a statue!'.</p>
<p>Co-initiator <strong>Richard Schut</strong>, of the 4 daagse filmcrew: 'on the built-in displays we will show short interviews from earlier that day, the statue will literally comes alive through the stories of the participants'.</p>
<h3>What do we need</h3>
<p>Mostly we need materials to build the statue: like special paint and tablets for the displays. We also need some additional hardware/software to get the images as soon as possible on the displays of the statue. We estimate 1000 euro for material costs.</p>
<h3>Wanna support us financially?</h3>
<p>Everyone who likes to 'honor' the participants of the 4 daagse in Nijmegen can make a small or bigger donation. With your financial support we can make this beautiful statue come alive!. To thank you for your support we gathered some great perks. Choose on the right the contribution that fits you most.</p>

DAT VERDIENT EEN BEELD
Nijmegen krijgt dit jaar tijdens de 4 daagse (16-19 juli) een multimedia standbeeld voor de '4 daagse wandelaar'. Een levend standbeeld met ingebouwde display, vertoont unieke beelden van wandelaars eerder die dag. Het beeld zal elke dag langs de route te vinden zijn.
 
Initiatiefneemster Ellen Mulders gaat het beeld ontwerpen: 'Elke dag 40 of 50 kilometer, zo een formidabele prestatie verdient gewoon een beeld'.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Mickie and I like to make things for people.</p>
<p>I've been designing, drawing, and creating my entire life. Additionally, I've always been a bit of a social butterfly and party girl. I've managed to bring those aspects of my life together through event design, planning, and production for private functions, corporate events, award shows, and fundraisers.</p>
<p>I am always the first to volunteer to help make a friend's event special through decor, fancy paper hats, and invitations. My love of creating for events has inspired me to launch an Etsy store dedicated to paper products for special occasions.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me purchase a Silhouette CAMEO machine. The Cameo connects to my computer and cuts shapes and artwork I have created. I can design 3D products, ornate designs cut from paper or adhesive vinyl that I have drawn into Adobe Illustrator. This machine will enable me to create my own custom look and shapes. Additional funds will go to acquiring extra blades, cutting mats, paper, cover stock, and adhesives.</p>
<p>I am SO EXCITED to add this tool to my repertoire of creation!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My Wish List:</p>
<p>Silhouette Cameo: $299<br/>Extra Blades: 3 @ $12.99 = 38.97<br/>Extra Mats: 2 @ $19.99 = 59.97<br/>Vinyl Starter Kit: $39.99<br/>8.5x11 Colored Paper 10 Pack: 20 @ $2.50 = 50<br/>8.5x11 Colored Cover Stock 10 Pack: 20 @ $3.75 = 75<br/>A6 Colored Envelopes 10 Pack: 20 @ $3.50 = 70<br/>A2 Colored Envelopes 10 Pack: 20 @ $3.25 = 65</p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal, any funds raised will be prioritized towards the purchase of the Silhouette CAMEO and tools.</p>
<p>RECEIVE MY VERY FIRST DESIGNS!<br/>Contributors will receive custom designs as a thank you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past year, I have designed invitations for weddings and bar mitzvahs, I have decorated wedding showers and receptions, I created paper fascinators for a bachelorette party, and I won Best Informal Hat at the 139th Kentucky Derby party at The Bell House.</p>
<p>I want to keep the momentum going! <br/>(I'd also love to be the reigning hat champion next year!)</p>

</p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The Museum of Neon Art
(MONA) encourages learning, curiosity and expression through the preservation,
collection and interpretation of neon, electric and kinetic art. </p>
<p>MONA has been a non-profit
art museum in Los Angeles since our founding in 1981. Now in our 32<sup>nd</sup>
year and only 18 months away from moving into our permanent<span>,
new home in the City of Glendale, we are focused on restoring some of the most
challenging signs in the collection to display in the new facility.</span></p>

museum were each set to receive one of the two neon dragon marquees upon their
removal from the landmark Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood. For 43 years
these iconic neon dragons graced the marquee with their glowing presence,
entertaining visitors with their animation and illuminating a long list of
well-known Hollywood movie premieres and celebrities.</p>
<p>However, when their
take-down day arrived, word came that the owners had changed their minds,
rescinded their donation and decided instead to keep the dragon signs for
themselves in an outdoor storage yard. </p>
<p>Letters were written and a
petition was signed by those who were concerned about the signs’ future. Yet
nothing changed the minds of the signs’ owners to return to their original
agreement and donate the dragons to MONA.</p>
<p>Although the marquees were
in perfect, working condition when they were removed from the Chinese Theater,
neglect took a heavy toll. The signs remained in a destructive limbo for six
years with no maintenance, no protection from the elements or from souvenir
hunters. After these many years, the dragons’ owners concluded the signs were unsalvageable
and orders were given to remove them to a dump.</p>
<p>Like magic, the Neon Gods
were watching over that landmark sign and word found its way to us that another
attempt must be made to rescue those neon dragons or lose them forever. </p>
<p>In 2007, MONA finally came
into possession of the neon dragons and immediately placed them in a protective
indoor warehouse. Still, the damage had been done by the previous owner’s
haphazard storage and neglect.</p>
<p>Today, MONA has retained the
West-facing dragon and gifted the East-facing one to another local non-profit
institution. With the opening of MONA’s new museum just around the corner, the
restored dragon will have a new home in the public eye, greeting museum
visitors.</p>
<p>To make that happen, we’re
asking for your help in restoring the Chinese Theater’s dragon to its animated
and glowing glory!</p>
<p>The task is a big one… but
with your contribution, it will be done!</p>

<li>Clean out decades of
gunk both on the inside and outside of each 20’ section of the 40’ long dragon.</li>
<li>Restore and replace
badly rusted and weak portions of the sign with new metal and reshape areas that
had been damaged in haphazard storage condition.</li>
<li>Make paper pattern of the hand-painted design by working with the existing painted surface as well as photographically research its original paint scheme.</li>
<li>Remove as much of the existing surface paint as possible to smooth and prepare the dragons for new paint.</li>
<li>Prime the metal surface to prepare for the final painting.</li>

The Museum of Neon Art
(MONA) encourages learning, curiosity and expression through the preservation,
collection and interpretation of neon, electric and kinetic art. 
MONA has been a non-profit
art museum in Los Angeles since our founding in 1981. Now in our 32nd
year and only 18 months away from moving into our permanent,
new home in the City of Glendale, we are focused on restoring some of the most
challenging signs in the collection to display in the new facility.

THE STORYIn 2001 MONA and another
museum were each set to receive one of the two neon dragon marquees upon their
removal from the landmark Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood. For 43 years
these iconic neon dragons graced the marquee with their glowing presence,
entertaining visitors with their animation and illuminating a long list of
well-known Hollywood movie premieres and celebrities.
However, when their
take-down day arrived, word came that the owners had changed their minds,
rescinded their donation and decided instead to keep the dragon signs for
themselves in an outdoor storage yard. 
Letters were written and a
petition was signed by those who were concerned about the signs’ future. Yet
nothing changed the minds of the signs’ owners to return to their original
agreement and donate the dragons to MONA.
Although the marquees were
in perfect, working condition when they were removed from the Chinese Theater,
neglect took a heavy toll. The signs remained in a destructive limbo for six
years with no maintenance, no protection from the elements or from souvenir
hunters. After these many years, the dragons’ owners concluded the signs were unsalvageable
and orders were given to remove them to a dump.
Like magic, the Neon Gods
were watching over that landmark sign and word found its way to us that another
attempt must be made to rescue those neon dragons or lose them forever. 
In 2007, MONA finally came
into possession of the neon dragons and immediately placed them in a protective
indoor warehouse. Still, the damage had been done by the previous owner’s
haphazard storage and neglect.
Today, MONA has retained the
West-facing dragon and gifted the East-facing one to another local non-profit
institution. With the opening of MONA’s new museum just around the corner, the
restored dragon will have a new home in the public eye, greeting museum
visitors.
To make that happen, we’re
asking for your help in restoring the Chinese Theater’s dragon to its animated
and glowing glory!
The task is a big one… but
with your contribution, it will be done!
WHAT WE NEED TO DOPHASE ONE:
Clean out decades of
gunk both on the inside and outside of each 20’ section of the 40’ long dragon.
Restore and replace
badly rusted and weak portions of the sign with new metal and reshape areas that
had been damaged in haphazard storage condition.
Make paper pattern of the hand-painted design by working with the existing painted surface as well as photographically research its original paint scheme.
Remove as much of the existing surface paint as possible to smooth and prepare the dragons for new paint.
Prime the metal surface to prepare for the final painting.
Paint the dragon! 

PHASE TWO:
Make paper patterns for the glass neon units.
Purchase the glass tubing and engage a skilled neon bender to fabricate and process the glass units....all 65 of them!  (Through research and by enlarging old photos and postcards of the Grauman's Chinese Theater, we have determined the original neon-tube colors that graced the dragon.)

PHASE THREE:
Recreate the exact animated sequencing. (The 1974 Mel Brooks classic ""Blazing Saddles"" will be
used to view the animation of the neon tubing on the dragon and will help our
restorers recreate the sequencing.)
Purchase neon supplies for installing the neon tubing, including transformers, animators and GTO wire.
Wire electricals and install all of the above.
Build a metal framework with wheels to support the dragon for exhibition.

COST BREAKDOWNApproximately 20% of total goal will cover production of perks, mailing costs and fees. 80% of total goal will fund the three phases listed above. Additional donations, if any, will be spent on our ongoing restoration projects.
IMPACTYour donation will help us
to relight an icon of neon, Hollywood and theater architectural history! No
other pictorial marquee of this scale, magnitude and importance has survived
once it was removed from the original theater on which it stood. Help us
relight the Chinese Theater dragon; make a donation today!

<p>We additionally pride ourselves in our coverage of philanthropy: one of our main tenets is to stay on top of the going-on’s in the world and acknowledge crises both widely covered and under-reported in the mainstream media. <b>As of now, we are looking into several charities that support those affected in the Israel/Gaza conflict, Ukraine, Iraq, Thailand, Central African Republic, Venezuela, Thailand and in other locations that dearly need humanitarian assistance. Such charities include OCHA, Children for Peace, Chamos, Doctors Without Borders, and Hand in Hand for Syria. </b>For the time being, we aim to hit the ground running with 5 charities.

Constant polling will decide what charities we covered: every month, the 3 out of 5 charities we cover that receive the biggest support or are determined to need the most long-term relief will we continued and the 2 charities that are phased out will be similarly replaced by the 2 most charities that people want to see covered on the site.

</div> <div> <h3>How will the ""Creations"" system work?</h3> <p></p>
<p>The theme of free choice playing a large role where proceeds are going makes us unique. <b>Our site is grounded in an “Affiliation” system that we believe raises the autonomy and stakes involved in our proceed raising. </b>For each individual work, Creators have a choice to make the work Affiliated or Unaffiliated. <b>When a work is Affiliated, The Creator has a direct choice of what charity/cause ALL of the revenue for the CC goes to.</b> For example, an artist can choose for all the revenue of a painting made to go to alleviating the Syrian crisis. This allows artists to voice their own opinions and pledge support for one cause directly through their work. Additionally, donors interested in a certain cause will be naturally drawn to an artist's work should it be affiliated to their advocacy with the knowledge that all their money and all the revenue raised by that work will go to the cause they support. <b>However, if a work is Unaffiliated, there are two choices.</b> An artist can take the “Liberté” route, in that any person buying the work can choose whatever charity partnered with “Creations for Concord” for their money to go to. While every purchasing option we offer gives donors a large degree of control over where their money is going, this option gives interested donors the most freedom. However, an artist can also take the “Démocratie” route, where all the money that is used to buy the unaffiliated painting will be given to the winning charity of a monthly poll held at the front page. This fosters a great sense of community decision-making and makes your participation in the polls all the more important. The poll will feature all covered charities for the first two weeks of every month. After the two weeks, only the two most popular charities will remain in the poll. For the rest of the month, those two charities will remain in the poll, and the more popular of the two will receive the earnings at the end of the month.</p>

<div>Math: Based on references (links below), prints will cost anywhere from $5 to $60+ depending on size and paper type. For simplicity, let's say $30 is the average price of a print (actual price of a 16x20 or 20x20 matte print), and bump it down to $25 for a bulk discount. Shipping in the continental US will average about $10 each purchase, according to the USPS. Therefore, each purchase will cost approximately $35 on our part. With $1,500, we could print and ship out around 42 creations. Given if around 2-3 purchases occur every week, we could eliminate all customer shipping, handling, and printing fees for the rest of the year!</div>

I am a young art student who partnered up with my like-minded friend, and together, we are launching a new philanthropy/art organization called Creations for Concord. We currently have around 10 other like-minded people on board and we would love for you to hear our goal and advocacy out.


Our goal is to raise money for the maintenance of safety and tranquility in regions of the world currently ravaged by violence or danger. While many other non-profit organizations may share that dream, we aim to raise money for these causes differently.

We additionally pride ourselves in our coverage of philanthropy: one of our main tenets is to stay on top of the going-on’s in the world and acknowledge crises both widely covered and under-reported in the mainstream media.

Stretch Goal: Barring administrative problems, we are considering adding an additional initial charity for every $200 we receive past our goal! 


  How will the ""Creations"" system work? 
The theme of free choice playing a large role where proceeds are going makes us unique. Our site is grounded in an “Affiliation” system that we believe raises the autonomy and stakes involved in our proceed raising. For each individual work, Creators have a choice to make the work Affiliated or Unaffiliated. When a work is Affiliated, The Creator has a direct choice of what charity/cause ALL of the revenue for the CC goes to. For example, an artist can choose for all the revenue of a painting made to go to alleviating the Syrian crisis. This allows artists to voice their own opinions and pledge support for one cause directly through their work. Additionally, donors interested in a certain cause will be naturally drawn to an artist's work should it be affiliated to their advocacy with the knowledge that all their money and all the revenue raised by that work will go to the cause they support. However, if a work is Unaffiliated, there are two choices. An artist can take the “Liberté” route, in that any person buying the work can choose whatever charity partnered with “Creations for Concord” for their money to go to. While every purchasing option we offer gives donors a large degree of control over where their money is going, this option gives interested donors the most freedom.

For the rest of the month, those two charities will remain in the poll, and the more popular of the two will receive the earnings at the end of the month.



  What about Creators themselves?  
Creators receive 10% of earnings for every CC they sell, while 90% goes to charity. If you would like to become a creator or help with our project, feel free to contact us and send in some of your work/experience; we eagerly welcome anybody interested on board and we would love to have more artists, designers, and musicians join our budding community.



Where will the money go?
All raised funds will go towards website maintenance/upgrades, initial shipping/handling/printing (which can get expensive for large prints), and art supplies for creators who need them,  We may also offset payments to creators with raised funds - which means even more can go to charity!

<p><strong>Artist Bio</strong></p>
</div><p>LALA EATS LALA formally known as Zachary Widgren is an avant-garde underground artist hailing from the Smoky Mountains in the USA.  The subtle qualities of his work mixed with his attention to detail make for strange yet strangely seductive work. Known for being prolific and working in a variety of media he has certainly produced powerfully unique artwork throughout his career. He attended the University of Tennessee for painting. Following his graduation after curating at a local bar he wanted to provide an open platform for non-traditional artists to showcase their work. He then opened the infamous Fireproof Gallery with some like minded collaborators which was a two year series of seasonal large scale collaborative installations where he featured his work as well as many other artist and musicians.</p><p>He is currently based in Taipei, Taiwan where he is working on a variety of projects with local and other foreign artist. He has been featured in Milk Magazine a Hong Kong based magazine for his paintings and illustrations. As well as featured and interviewed in Collectif lifestyle magazine from Belgium for one of his projects By The Way The Bird Flies. As his popularity has grown so has his international patronage. In the future he sees himself working to grow and explore the international art community while maintaining an effort to always keep a constant stream of interesting projects in progress.</p></div>","Why Use Indiegogo?
This campaign is important to me because it gives me a chance to bypass finding grants, sponsors, and publishers in the efforts to produce these artbooks. These other avenues although valuable to the arts bring into play a certain amount control over content and how it is presented. As I am growing as an artist I want to feel able and capable to delve into taboos in the future projects as well as maintain a sense of artistic integrity. Losing control of the quantity produce, inserting ads, and editing content to suite a company interest are something I don't want to sacrifice. For example the artbook SYBL I am taking the time to hand detail each of them to give each book its' own sense of uniqueness. This would not be able to happen going through a publisher. Using an avenue like Indiegogo allows me to deliver pure art content straight to you the supporter.

This year the visiting faculty includes a stellar line up of artists including Roni Horn, Jennie C. Jones, Jeffrey Gibson, Sigrid Sandstrom, Sheila Hicks and Yoshua Okon, among others!  </b></p><p>There is a tuition fee and I have been fortunate enough to have 80% of it covered by Skowhegan.  A small portion of the funds will also go towards covering the remainder of my tuition.  </p><p>Contributors will help me get to and from my destination, develop new work and ideas and participate in an invaluable experience. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>GOAL &amp; PERKS</h3><div><b>I need to raise $4500 in three weeks.  </b></div><div>Roughly 80% will go towards the cost of film, development, photo paper and other materials such as negative sleeves, miscellaneous materials that will help me experiment with installation in my studio space. </div><div>Remaining funds will go towards a round-trip flight ticket and the production of a zine based on my experience at Skowhegan to including new photographs, documentation of my process and writings.  </div><div><i>In return, I am offering the following:</i></div><div><ul>
<li>Editioned inkjet prints in the size of 8 x 10, 11 x 14 &amp; 16 x 20 (Please view image gallery tab for selections).<br/>
</li>
<li>Post Cards</li>
<li>A limited edition zine done based on the residency period. <br/>
</li>
<li>Portrait commissions for those in the New Haven, New York City and Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area.  <br/>
</li>
</ul></div><div>All prints are editioned &amp; archival inkjet prints on Epson matte paper with a quarter inch border on top and sides.  <b>All content comes signed with a personal thank you note.    </b>

This year the visiting faculty includes a stellar line up of artists including Roni Horn, Jennie C. Jones, Jeffrey Gibson, Sigrid Sandstrom, Sheila Hicks and Yoshua Okon, among others!  There is a tuition fee and I have been fortunate enough to have 80% of it covered by Skowhegan.  A small portion of the funds will also go towards covering the remainder of my tuition.  Contributors will help me get to and from my destination, develop new work and ideas and participate in an invaluable experience. GOAL & PERKSI need to raise $4500 in three weeks.  Roughly 80% will go towards the cost of film, development, photo paper and other materials such as negative sleeves, miscellaneous materials that will help me experiment with installation in my studio space. Remaining funds will go towards a round-trip flight ticket and the production of a zine based on my experience at Skowhegan to including new photographs, documentation of my process and writings.  In return, I am offering the following:
Editioned inkjet prints in the size of 8 x 10, 11 x 14 & 16 x 20 (Please view image gallery tab for selections).

Post Cards
A limited edition zine done based on the residency period. 

Portrait commissions for those in the New Haven, New York City and Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area.  

All prints are editioned & archival inkjet prints on Epson matte paper with a quarter inch border on top and sides.  All content comes signed with a personal thank you note.    
THE IMPACTSkowhegan will be an incredible, life changing experience for me.  As an artist who has grown up and always made work in an urban community, living in Madison, Maine will allow me to completely challenge my process in art making.  This will be an important part of my lifetime education as an artist and help me prepare for thinking outside of my own confines for graduate school.  Being surrounding by artists at all different points in their careers and mediums will enrich my perspective and process immensely.  CAN'T DONATE?

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>TRANSPORTATION!</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is a really big project and will require quite a bit of space for transportation.  This means we need to rent a box truck or a truck and trailer.  Either way, transportation to the playa is a major cost.  We anticipate that we will need a minimum of $2000 for this.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>BUILDING MATERIALS! </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This year we were given 4 times the space of the project we had last year.  We are building to fill a 20'x40' space.  That is 800sf of space!  This project is very ambitious and we are looking at a minimum of $1500 for the building materials.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>WORKSHOP MATERIALS! </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have to fill 12 hours a day with workshops over the course of 6 days in two workshop spaces that will be running simultaneously.  This means we need to come up with 144 hours of workshop (building/crafting/creating) materials for hundreds of people.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>THE FUTURE! </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If we manage to raise over our goal, we will be putting the money toward our long term goal of buying a large trailer for transportation of the  Regional project each year.  Interest in making this an annual endeavor has grown and we see this project continuing for years.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>DONATIONS!</b>  We need donations of all kinds of supplies!  This includes lumber, plywood, arts and crafts supplies, etc.  We are partnered with a non-profit that will be collecting donations for us so that donations can be a tax write off.  Please send us a message at coburners@gmail.com if you have something to donate or would like more information.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Please remember that donations at ANY level help us get this thing built and out to the playa!  We set our goal low, so that we would actually make it and be eligible for Indigogo's InDemand promotions that you can only get when you meet your goal, but this year we are trying to raise a minimum of $10,000.  This is a huge goal!   Please give at any level to help us out!</b></p>

The codebreaker brain is the crossword brain.  During World War II the London Times and New York Times would have crossword competitions and the intelligence services would contact the winners and recruit them as codebreakers.I have made custom crosswords for SURFER Magazine, for champion surfer Kelly Slater, for the actresses Jane Leeves and Nia Peeples (see below) for a Google exec who shall remain nameless, a famous New York hotelier/restaurateur who shall remain nameless, and even some non-famous people.)For Nancy Pelosi's puzzle I have hired an illustrator in Mexico named Ariel Medel to produce some illustrations for a crossword with the working title:  WHOSE HOUSE? NANCY'S HOUSE!                 A Birthday Crossword to Celebrate the XXXXXXXXtraordinary Nancy PelosiWe did a custom crossword puzzle for the actress Jane Leeves and I asked Ariel to produce an illustration of her famous, million dollar face to put on a 20 pound note. Ariel nailed it. He's very good and a pleasure to work with.It's possible I dream up these goofy ideas just to work with the hombre and challenge him with new projects.Ariel is very talented and I have some ideas for decorating this crossword with Nancy Pelosi illustrations that I don't want to share publicly, but if you chip in we can communicate and I will share the ideas - and even show you the raw puzzle - if you're interested.Okay here's one illustration I want to commission. Remember the final scene from Seinfeld? I want Ariel to re-create this, but with Team Trump behind bars: Donald, Ivanka, Donald Junior. Eric. And maybe Kimberley Guilfoyle shaking the bars and screaming.Barron Trump separated from Melania in his own cage, pouting for his mom?Evil!Fun? You betcha!I want to properly pay Ariel Medel the illustrator and art director Joni Casimiro who will lay the puzzle out - these crosswords are a pain to lay out properly.We are going to print one version at 16"" x 22"" for Madame Speaker to fill out and another at 20"" x 30"" for her to hang on the wall of her office - hopefully.And possibly pay for some photos and other costs. So if you believe in Nancy Pelosi and all she has stood for and withstood, pitch in a little and we'll send you a full-sized, full-color copy of the puzzle, either electronically or by mail.And let you in on the creation process if that interests you.And also add your name and email to a list of contributors that could go on the back of the puzzle that is submitted to Madame Speaker.(And if you want one of these custom crosswords for the Word Nerd in your family, let me know.)They're fun to create and fun to give and fun to receive and I hope Nancy Pelosi will enjoy hers.Madame Speaker's custom crossword will look something like this crossword the husband of Jane Leeves commissioned me to do. (She had it hanging in her dressing room while she was shooting Hot in Cleveland. Her English parents do the London Times crossword every day. They loved it and sent me a thank you card - because they are English and that's how they roll.)I can only hope Madame Speaker hangs her crossword proudly, and that some impressionable, rioting mullet-head doesn't break in and steal it.This will be fun.

Backers from tiers Pepperoni Breadsticks and Cheese Pizza will receive a high quality PDF file of the sticker sheet & permission to print as long as it's for personal use. (UNLOCKED)


​
""Hardcover"" upgrade!!! If the goal of 16k is reached, every backer who bought the softcover artbook + up will receive a free upgrade to a luxurious hardcover! (Avalable for backers from Pepperoni Pizza (third tier/artbook only) +up) (UNLOCKED)


+ 10 pages of sketches/thumbnails (if the goal of 20k is reached, every backer who bought the artbook + up will receive 10 extra pages! which also applies for PDF buyers.) (UNLOCKED)

The total funds are divided in printing the books, the Indiegogo fee, credit card & paypal fees and additional prizes to upgrade the perks. I found it best not to include the shipping in my fee, for that would most likely jeopardize the funding effort and minimize my control over how the packages are going to arrive in your lovely hands.We will be working with quality product suppliers and printhouses for both the artbook and the extra items, and worldwide shipment will be overseen by a major e-commerce fullfillment company! All of it to make sure that the book will be delivered perfect and on time.Regarding the risks of backing this project, I'd like to make it clear that i'm not doing this alone! My superhero of an agent is overseeing every possible aspect that could go wrong and tackling it mercilessly! We're not a publishing house nor a millionaire investment, so we're bound to learn something with any possible rocks along the path, still I think we're as prepared as it's humanly possible.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an abstract landscape artist I find myself most inspired while participating as an artist in residence. Whether within the US or abroad, every experience forces me to create a new visual language to express what I see and feel. This summer I would like to travel to Sicily as an artist in residence with Officina Stamperia del Notaio. The residency is located in the village of Tusa and is shared with 3 other artists in residence.  I will be painting on location throughout the countryside and in the historic Sicilian cities of Tusa and Palermo.  Visiting Palermo will allow me time to explore my Sicilian heritage and reflect on the anniversary of my father's death. The 18 day+ residency is 570 euros and covers my living quarters, studio space and exhibition. I will also have international flight, material, and shipping expenses, meals and other in-country travel expenses.  I am offering ""painting perks from Sicily"" as a thank you to my supporters.</p>

<h3>Wonder Fair</h3> <p></p>
<p>Wonder Fair is an art gallery and shop in Lawrence, Kansas.
We recently moved from our cozy location above the Burger Stand to
a large and beautiful street-level space at 841 Mass St. It’s a big, scary leap and the rent is a whole lot higher and that’s why we’re recruiting some help.</p>
<p>When we asked our patrons what they wanted as Wonder Fair expands our operations, nearly all votes were for a downtown art supply. So let’s do it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re excited to serve up knowledge and equipment to hardworking local artists---and to offer an alternative for those of you whose values aren’t represented by the other art supply businesses in town (we’re looking at you, Hobby Lobby).</p>
<p>On top of adding art supplies to our resume, our retail and gallery spaces are now bigger and better, and our new location will soon host the headquarters for the Secret Order of the Black Diamond. With a permanent base of operations, we intend to expand the activities for this not-so-secret art/adventure club.</p>

<p>""Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful."" - William Morris</p>
<p>Wonder Fair is a gallery and retail space (and soon an art supply shop) in Downtown Lawrence, Kansas. We typically host 5 to 6 high quality gallery exhibitions each year featuring a mix of regional and national artists. Our primary focus is on printed matter, a process we honor for its egalitarian tradition of making beautiful art at affordable prices.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The spirit of Wonder Fair lies in the conviction that
creativity is essential for the wellbeing of individuals and their community.
Wonder Fair believes in the power of the handmade, the connecting and
transformative properties of art, and the importance of shared experience.</p>
<p>Our practical commitment to these beliefs is to maintain a
gallery, a site for social dialogue and creative exchange. Through the gallery
and our rigorous exhibition schedule and a diverse range of special events, we
form a hub of interconnectivity, a link between family, friends, and
like-minded strangers within Lawrence and beyond. Through our shop, we approach

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Shari Tranchina, creator and one of the producers of a new TV show project called <i><strong>Mad Turn Up!</strong></i>  Myself and the producers at 4 Lion Productions welcome you to our IndieGogo fundraising page.</p>
<p>I'd like to share with you my story...</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last 20 years working with kids of all ages and have felt so much joy being around their happy energy!  </p>
<p>One summer years ago <strong><i>Mad Turn Up! </i></strong> was born to me while enjoying the teens in my Performing Arts Summer Camp program do sketch comedy and improv skits during our weekly drama class. They had so much fun and were hilarious! They cracked each other up with creative and off the wall ideas.</p>
<p>I said to them…""You guys need your own show!""  Of course the silly little hams loved that idea!</p>
<p>After years of stage performances with them featuring dance, comedy and singing, here we are!</p>
<p><strong><i>Mad Turn Up!</i> is a hilarious comedy/variety show involving an all teenage cast of actors and performers that we know is unlike any other show for teenagers and young adults out there today.</strong></p>
<p>It speaks to them in their language. It’s real to them, something they can relate to and totally get because it gets them!  It's edgy yet clean, not raunchy, not too adulterated and inappropriate, yet not too ""tween-silly"" (like shows perfect for a younger 8-15 year old audience.) <i><strong> Mad Turn Up!</strong></i>  targets the 16-21ish age demographic.  Think Saturday Night Live and In Living Color with a few extra unique and inspiring segments!</p>
<p>I am so grateful for the many special years I’ve spent laughing with my acting and dance class students.  I would love for the world of teens and all appropriate ages to enjoy their talent as I have.</p>

<p><i>Mad Turn Up!</i> will mostly feature sketch comedy, musical and variety performances, and celebrity actors and musical guests, <i>plus</i>...a few other bit segments sprinkled throughout the episode that serve to unite, inspire and empower other young people.  The show explores teens from other cultures and will feature our cast involved in community.  You will also enjoy fun, entertaining reality-type segments that bring our audience closer to our cast and the Mad Turn Up! production.</p>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">  Why Art Prize?   </span><br/><br/>My brother invited me to Grand Rapids last year for Art Prize, an open, city-wide art exhibition and competition.  I was amazed to see over 100,000 people walking all around and talking about art.  Families, couples, kids.  For days on end.  I decided Art Prize was an excellent opportunity to expose thousands of people to this project -- the war rugs, the Buddhist mandalas, the voices of Afghan women -- to generate conversation about the effect of war on culture.    <br/>
</h5><h5 style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, I will recreate a 9/11 War Rug, using spices, and display monoprints of an earlier, Soviet-era War Rug.  War Rug Trading Cards will be distributed with valuable information, and a book will be produced documenting the entire project.   I've made 8 war rugs so far -- you can see them <a href=""http://barbarakoenen.com/section/143767.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">here</a> -- and I'd like to create a book that documents the project.  <br/>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/><br/>  The War Rug project honors the women of Afghanistan -- the original weavers who responded to wars and occupations that impacted them but they did not initiate -- and gets people talking about the more subtle impacts of war on culture, whether it is war rugs in Afghanistan or video games here at home.</h5><h5 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your gift will help with framing the prints, making the platform, printing the trading cards, and documenting the project with photographs and a book.  All together, it will cost about $10,000, and I'd like to raise half that now.    If I win Art Prize, a percentage of the proceeds will go to charities that help Afghan women.  If I don't win, its still a great opportunity to broaden the dialogue about the war on the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001.<br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spread the Word  </span>

an artist and educator currently residing and working in Brooklyn, New York. My
work is primarily made of the ancient stuff that takes billions and billions of
years to come into existence and spans across the globe, CLAY!  I am very
passionate about this mud, so much so, I have dedicated the last 8 years to
touching it, molding it, throwing it, mixing it, and even making it gold.
 I work primarily in a method called slip-casting, a high production level
process but make small runs of edition pieces.  My largest and most
prolific project to date consisted of a 1,000 piece installation at Socrates
Sculpture Park in Long Island City, NY.<span style="""">

residency program in May at The Pottery Workshop in the ""Porcelain capital
of the world"", Jingdezhen, China.  This residency is situated on the
site of an old National Porcelain Company, which has been making porcelain
ceramics for over one thousand years. This experimental factory is surrounded
by hundreds of independent craftsmen and artists with every kind of ceramic
skill imaginable; clay producers, throwers, sculptors, mould makers, blue and
white decorators, over glaze decorators, and color shops, kiln firing
workshops, brush makers, black smiths, box makers, and shippers.   Objects
are from fingernail size to twelve feet high, all in porcelain. The
possibilities for me are endless and the fountain of knowledge is overflowing,
waiting for someone like me to scoop it up!  I can't express how excited I
am just typing this out and thinking about this summer!  </span><span style=""font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

and hand with gaining knowledge, experience and is a wonderful creative outlet
which would not just benefit me but further the education of many others in my
community through the techniques I will learn and share This residency/workshop
will allow me to further explore both handmade and mass produced through
historical and culture context.  As an advocate of the handmade, and as
someone who deals daily with the mass produced, this adventure would be a great
discovery into a city built on the crossover between this dichotomy.

Hello!  My name is Zena Verda Pesta and I am
an artist and educator currently residing and working in Brooklyn, New York. My
work is primarily made of the ancient stuff that takes billions and billions of
years to come into existence and spans across the globe, CLAY!  I am very
passionate about this mud, so much so, I have dedicated the last 8 years to
touching it, molding it, throwing it, mixing it, and even making it gold.
 I work primarily in a method called slip-casting, a high production level
process but make small runs of edition pieces.  My largest and most
prolific project to date consisted of a 1,000 piece installation at Socrates
Sculpture Park in Long Island City, NY. 
Making 36 pieces every day for 36 days = 1080!!!!! Below is a link.

http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/public-spectacles-art-in-plein-air/




 





 
 What I'm Doing
I have been invited to take part in a 3 week
residency program in May at The Pottery Workshop in the ""Porcelain capital
of the world"", Jingdezhen, China.  This residency is situated on the
site of an old National Porcelain Company, which has been making porcelain
ceramics for over one thousand years. This experimental factory is surrounded
by hundreds of independent craftsmen and artists with every kind of ceramic
skill imaginable; clay producers, throwers, sculptors, mould makers, blue and
white decorators, over glaze decorators, and color shops, kiln firing
workshops, brush makers, black smiths, box makers, and shippers.   Objects
are from fingernail size to twelve feet high, all in porcelain. The
possibilities for me are endless and the fountain of knowledge is overflowing,
waiting for someone like me to scoop it up!  I can't express how excited I
am just typing this out and thinking about this summer!  
This opportunity to travel and explore goes hand
and hand with gaining knowledge, experience and is a wonderful creative outlet
which would not just benefit me but further the education of many others in my
community through the techniques I will learn and share This residency/workshop
will allow me to further explore both handmade and mass produced through
historical and culture context.  As an advocate of the handmade, and as
someone who deals daily with the mass produced, this adventure would be a great
discovery into a city built on the crossover between this dichotomy.
  
 
What I Need & What You Receive in Return
Sadly, I am unable to fund this trip alone, and
need help from all of you.  I am asking for your support to assist in
helping to keep the spirit and excitement of the handmade alive! Your donation
will be greatly appreciated and also compensated with some wonderful perks! 
Donations will go towards
the following expenses:
Flight from NYC to
Shanghai:  1,300
Transportation
to Jingdezhen:  100
Room and
Board includes meals (except Sun), studio and translators to get you
around the city: 1,150 
For a grand total
of.....2,550 to raise by the beginning of May.
 
I am a firm believer in,  “EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS” , so 1 dollar
to even 20 dollars is a gracious gift!  
 
If all of this money is
not raised, my trip will be shortened.

<p></p><p></p></div>","We are taking our revered online platform,""Oden Gallery"", and creating a physical presence in Vancouver, B.C. The gallery will be a modern inspired showcase of handcrafted home furnishings from North American Artisans and a place for discerning clients and art patrons to source, purchase and commission work. 
Oden will offer a collection of work from Oden's furniture artisans, as well as promote professional artists in the community and expand our offerings to include wall art, and furnishings made in metal, textile and ceramic. 
We hand-pick and represent artisans who have fine-tuned their craft. The work produced is rich in detail, seductive to the touch, employs the finest materials, and truly shines when experienced in person. Until now, potential clients could only source our work online, which kept them from experiencing the work first hand. A physical location will help us meet our artisans need for representation and product distribution as well as curate a full and empowered purchasing experience for clients.  
Oden Gallery was founded in 2012 by artist, furniture maker, and entrepreneur Meredith Nicole. She built Oden on the dream to help professional artisans have a thriving, purposeful career by connecting their work to lovers of fine home furnishings. Currently, there are 12 Oden Artisans that reside in British Columbia, Ontario, California, Minnesota, Nebraska and Alaska. We are traditionally-trained or follow traditional building practices, and strive to offer this quality in fresh contemporary inspired one-of-a-kind or limited edition works.

We believe we are stewards of the earth and seek to leave it better than when we arrived. We do this by offering sustainable, non-toxic furniture made with intention and designed to last generations. Many of us have won awards for our work, are avid contributors to industry publications and teachers of our craft. Most importantly, we are professional, sincere and passionate about what we do.
Here are a few places we have been seen in and supported by! We deeply appreciate the support from media.


Hello! I'm so happy you are reading this because it's not just your-  financial support, but also your genuine interest that creates the possibility for this project to be a success! Possibility is my driving force, the sparkle in my eye and my favourite topic of conversation. I believe there is always so much more possibility than what's seen at the surface of any situation and I love to dive in to see the light! 

For me, Oden is about the possibility for artisans to have a radiant and flourishing career, and the opportunity to add value to the societal tapestry of economics, culture, community and legacy. It is about the clients who want furniture to serve a greater purpose than mere function but also act as a time capsule which ages gracefully with every scratch and spill of wine.  The artisan creations are for people who recognise and appreciate unique and fine craftsmanship in their lives. 

I love knowing our work holds the possibility to be the future antiques and heirlooms. I also love to throw a good party! I'm an avid participant in Vancouver's art community and come equipped with years of event planning experience. You can trust I will personally take great pleasure in hosting vibrant viewing nights at the gallery where people can engage with the work and artisans. So, look forward to radiant, educational and inspiring events!
See how the Ford Car company supports Meredith and her work.

<p><b>Fundraising Goals:</b></p>
<p>I’ve geared my fundraising goals into (4) tiers. My
hope is that each tier function to accomplish a goal, and that each successive goal
reached lead to accomplishing the next tier.</p>
<p><b>Tier 1 </b></p>
<p>As I develop a stable art practice, it is important
for me to get the minimum parts in place to be able to produce my work: <b>A
camera with a large digital sensor to make large photographic based artwork</b><b> ($4000), a small proofing printer ($300) and
a dependable light kit ($300)</b>. This equipment would be used while attending
the Fire Island Artist Residency to make new artwork centering on the ways I
navigate this culture in the present day and would be foundational to my making in the
future. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Tier 2</b> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> It's an honor to be invited to attend FIAR,
but it is up to me to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">raise the funds for travel</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">($1000).</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> For me this
destination is key to realizing my upcoming art projects. Steeped in the
history of the gay liberation movement, Fire Island is embedded in the history
of a community that continues to forge a way for civil rights. My hope
is to invoke the history of this place, bringing the past into heavy context,
with its present state. </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">One component of the sculptures I am developing,
consist of nostalgic memorabilia from the past such as classic red wagons,
rocket ships and other electronics and another component brings in close contact historically southern cuisine such as black eye'd peas with large scale objects ( together the amassing of these components cost an estimate of $1000)</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Tier 3 </b></p>
<p>At SAIC, I have had access to state of the art printing facilities. As I
develop a stable studio practice apart from those resources, it is important to
me to work with locally owned and operated printers such as Document Printing
Services and Latitude Chicago to realize future work<b>. I am looking to
produce (6) large-scale acrylic mounted photographs, developed from my experience
at the Fire Island residency. </b>Printed, mounted &amp; framed these piece <b>will
cost roughly $400 each to produce</b> for the exhibitions opening in the Fall: the
Center on Halsted in August &amp; ACRE residency exhibition in September.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Tier 4 </b></p>
<p> Much of my art that has been well received
in the past several years has been at the intersection studio photography and
sculpture. As I have transitioned to life after graduate school, <b>it is
important for me to secure workspace in Chicago, where artist's studios are
roughly $1.35</b> <b>per square foot</b>. In order to have a work area to be
able to complete multiple projects (both sculptural &amp; photographic<b>), I
need to budget approximately $3000 annually ($250 Per Month)</b>. My goal is to
move into a studio upon my return from Fire Island this fall.</p>

 a live/work space for a four-week program marked by intimate 
studio visits with, and public lectures by, renowned leaders in 
contemporary art and curation.

A Solo exhibition @ the Center on Halsted in Chicago (Opens August 19th) The Center on Halsted is
 the Midwest's most comprehensive community center dedicated to 
advancing community and securing the health and  well-being of the 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) people  of 
Chicagoland. More than 1,000 community members visit the Center every 
day, located in the heart of Chicago's Lakeview Neighborhood. 
        
The ACRE Residency exhibition (Opening
 in September),  an artist-run non-profit based in Chicago devoted to 
employing various systems of support for emerging artists and to 
creating a generative community of cultural producers. ACRE investigates
 and institutes models designed to help artists develop, present, and 
discuss their practices by providing forums for idea exchange, 
interdisciplinary collaboration, and experimental projects.
*** and a host of other opportunities I have currently applied for 
and haven't quite heard back from (I will update this page as I get 
more news)




(Above) No,We Mustn't Be / As They are / Without You (II) (2015) (multiple iterations) - treated railroad tie, varnish, lacquer, polyurethane, & black eyed peas,  9”(H) x 7”(D) X 96”(W) 

Fundraising Goals:
I’ve geared my fundraising goals into (4) tiers. My
hope is that each tier function to accomplish a goal, and that each successive goal
reached lead to accomplishing the next tier.
Tier 1 
As I develop a stable art practice, it is important
for me to get the minimum parts in place to be able to produce my work: A
camera with a large digital sensor to make large photographic based artwork ($4000), a small proofing printer ($300) and
a dependable light kit ($300). This equipment would be used while attending
the Fire Island Artist Residency to make new artwork centering on the ways I
navigate this culture in the present day and would be foundational to my making in the
future. 

Tier 2 
 It's an honor to be invited to attend FIAR,
but it is up to me to raise the funds for travel ($1000). For me this
destination is key to realizing my upcoming art projects. Steeped in the
history of the gay liberation movement, Fire Island is embedded in the history
of a community that continues to forge a way for civil rights. My hope
is to invoke the history of this place, bringing the past into heavy context,
with its present state. One component of the sculptures I am developing,
consist of nostalgic memorabilia from the past such as classic red wagons,
rocket ships and other electronics and another component brings in close contact historically southern cuisine such as black eye'd peas with large scale objects ( together the amassing of these components cost an estimate of $1000).

Tier 3 
At SAIC, I have had access to state of the art printing facilities. As I
develop a stable studio practice apart from those resources, it is important to
me to work with locally owned and operated printers such as Document Printing
Services and Latitude Chicago to realize future work. I am looking to
produce (6) large-scale acrylic mounted photographs, developed from my experience
at the Fire Island residency. Printed, mounted & framed these piece will
cost roughly $400 each to produce for the exhibitions opening in the Fall: the
Center on Halsted in August & ACRE residency exhibition in September.

Tier 4 
 Much of my art that has been well received
in the past several years has been at the intersection studio photography and
sculpture. As I have transitioned to life after graduate school, it is
important for me to secure workspace in Chicago, where artist's studios are
roughly $1.35 per square foot. In order to have a work area to be
able to complete multiple projects (both sculptural & photographic), I
need to budget approximately $3000 annually ($250 Per Month). My goal is to
move into a studio upon my return from Fire Island this fall.




(Above) From The Series, A Tale of Three Women, Disappearing Reflectance Spectrum - 18% gray - In comparison to all things color ( Self-Representation as Venus) (2015)  (Diptych) 78” x 52”My goals are to
develop thought provoking images in the present in hopes that the future holds a place where we welcome people of all orientations 
and identifications. With your support you are allowing me to follow my passions and to help give greater visibility
 to marginalized people within our community. Whether I barely meet my 
goal, or get twice as much, I hope that you'll come to realize that I am
 highly appreciative to anyone and everyone who has taken the time out 
of their day to browse this page. If you are financially unable to give, and you feel so moved, please help spread the word.Thank You,Derrick Woods-Morrow",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

We consist of many talented poets with many accolades and slams under their belt. We have been invited to compete at Youth Speaks - Brave New Voices 2014 in Philadelphia! With the help of our coaches <b>Patrick De Belen </b>and <b>Brian Millado</b> we're hoping to bring crazy fire to Philadelphia this year at Brave New Voices and the other events we hope to competing at! This is a dream come true for all of our poets and we would appreciate any help that you can provide to help us get there! </p><p>Here is a little bit about our members:</p><p><strong>Ray Abergas</strong> is an 19 year old poet from Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. He was the captain of the 2012-2013 National Youth Slam team, BTdot. He is also the BAM! Toronto Youth Grand Slam Champion for the 2013-2014 season. He combines his relentless passion of helping others, poetry and performance to mold the person he is today. Ray has performed for a number of organizations like UNITY charity, UNIFFECT, RISE Poetry and and competed at Brave New Voices. When asked about why he loves spoken word poetry, he replies: ""I think words can save lives and that's what I want to do"".<br/></p><p><strong>Saredo Mohamed</strong> is a 18 year old poet from London, Ontario, Canada. She ventured into spoken word poetry in Grade 11, where she continued to present and compete at BAM! Toronto Youth Slam. Saredo became the BAM! Toronto Youth Slam Grand Slam Champion for the 2012-2013 season, and has been featured in an article by Metro newspaper. Saredo uses her experiences with race, immigration and travel as inspiration for her work, and hopes to inspire others with her poetry.</p><p><strong></strong><b>Ida Sophia</b> is a 19 year old MC and spoken word poet from Toronto, Ontario. She was first introduced to the spoken word scene at 16, attending the Drake Hotel to compete and watch others perform. Ida's inspiration thrives through her love of music and Hip Hop.  Quick wordplay and crafty tongue twisters give her poetry a distinct rhythm and flow. Aside from music, her team mates continue to inspire her artistic growth. In 2013 she competed for a spot in the Toronto Poetry Slam team at the finals and is now an active member of Bam Youth Slam 2014</p><p>At the age of 18, <strong>Berma</strong> is a wordsmith who's passion cannot be questioned. As a member of Spoken Ward, UNIFFECT, and the 2013 National youth championship team, BTdot, he has honed his ability to perform and enjoys spilling his soul on the stage. At a young age, Berma encountered many hardships only to come out stronger. He uses his words to speak out on issues that affected him and to help those who are dealing with the same things. Whether its talking about sports, music, or even the weather, Berma is a character that can't be missed.</p><p>Hailing from Toronto, Ontario, <b>Karel La Guardia</b> is a spoken word artist who's goal is to bring light to the stage. He is a member of the BAM! Toronto Youth Poetry Slam team, BTdot, who've recently competed in Brave New Voices and pl<span>aced first in Canada's national youth slam, YouthCanSlam. Trying to take inspiration from his ever changing generation, Karel's poetry radiates the personality, attitudes, and energy of today's youth. When he's not out making his audience smile with his poetry, Karel is an avid music listener, tv show binger, and breakfast eater. If he's not bringing joy to others in his performance, you can be sure Karel is out somewhere making somebody's day, awesome.</span><br/></p><p><b>Brian Lanigan</b> is 19 years old and reads poetry to anyone who will listen in Toronto, Ontario. Though new to the poetry scene, Brian has already performed at numerous competitions across the GTA as both a competitor and featured artist (alongside the BTdot team). Brian has led poetry workshops at his high school and enjoys showing his peers that anyone make a living out of doing what they love.

page!
 
We are committed to supporting the arts and creating new
opportunities in unique and unconventional places.  Our “background info"" (below) will tell you all the facts
about our project but don’t let that dry talk fool you—we are a group of
art-centric people that have as much to do with the business of art, as we do with all things . . . “contemporary!”
 
This project will happen no matter what.  We have secured South Bay Lexus as our
event hosts.  We have our “Curator
Prospectus” and “Call for Artists” available on our website: www.FlagStopArt.com.  “Indiegogo” is a fundraising platform
that will allow us to make this event bigger and better, for the talents we
will be featuring.
 
Our efforts are broken into phases.  Phase 1, will allow us to purchase
large containers to be installed on the grounds of Lexus.  We are hoping to afford 50 containers,
as the more containers we have, the more curators and artists we can feature.  The more containers we can afford
through fundraising, the higher are your chances of getting in!
 
Sit back, relax, and have a look at our video (there will be
a quiz.)  After we get you all
excited about helping us make “FLAG STOP” the most exciting art event of the
century, keep updated on our blog “FlagStopArt.wordpress.com” and “Like” us on
Facebook “Flag Stop 2011”. . . and get that submission in by July 15th!
--Background Information--
 
FLAG STOP
an alternative contemporary art event
 
Torrance, CA –  FLAG STOP is pleased to announce An Alternative Contemporary Art
Event which presents art in unique, unconventional places.
The goal of FLAG STOP is to give local art communities and the art world at
large a chance to see and experience art where previously not thought possible.
Torrance is a community where many local contemporary artists live and work,
but is not currently known as an arts destination. FLAG STOP is creating the
opportunity for curators, established artists, emerging artists, and local
businesses to rethink the possibilities of exhibiting art within the context of
a local community. South Bay Lexus in Torrance will be the first stop to
present this unique art experience. The event will be held on September 2, 3, &
4, 2011 and is free and open to the public.
 
Mission: 
FLAG STOP’s mission is to present new and emerging contemporary
art to a larger audience outside the main stream art venues. FLAG STOP is searching for
alternative venues in which to present the best curated examples of what, why,
and how art is becoming relevant today. Each “STOP” will feature art which has
been curated with some of the best examples of contemporary art, brought to you
by some of the top professional,
emerging curators and artists from Southern California.
 
About FLAG STOP: 
FLAG STOP’s committee is a group of South Bay art supporters,
promoters, artists, designers, curators, collectors, local businesses and art
enthusiasts, working to establish a new destination opportunity to experience
local and international contemporary art. FLAG STOP is creating the
opportunity for communities to rethink the possibilities of exhibiting art.

<ul>

<li>Increased civic engagement for over <strong>6,000 volunteers</strong>, involved over<strong> 100 organizations</strong>, and provided leadership training for over <strong>80 youth leaders</strong>;</li>
<li>Provided a safe place for youth to learn about their culture in a community environment with over <strong>1,500 inner-city youth</strong> engaged in <em>Eskuwela Kultura</em> education programs;</li>

<h3>Send ToonSeum Executive Director Joe Wos to the International Cartoon Arts Museum Conference!</h3>
Over the past five year Joe has been the founder and volunteer director of the ToonSeum, Pittsburgh's Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art. This year he has been invited to become the first US Cartoon Art Museum representative to attend the international cartoon art museums conference in Kruishoutem, Belgium. Museums from throughout Europe and the Middle East will be attending. This is the 4th annual conference and is strictly limited to 30 attendees.</div>
<div>
<p>As you can imagine this is quite an honor and we are almost there! A generous board member of the ToonSeum has donated the airfare to and from Europe, and the conference itself covers some of the lodging cost.</p>
<p><br/>But as you can imagine traveling to Europe is not cheap, additional lodging, trains, and other costs have to be factored in to make this happen.</p>
</div>
<p>The ToonSeum has grown substantially over the past five years, but we also know we have a long way to go. In Europe cartoon art museums are both widely respected and prevelant. We know there is much we can all learn from attending this conference.</p>
<p><br/>Joe will arrive in Paris and then take a train to Belgium. This is his first visit to Europe and will be reaching out to cartoon art museums during his visit to establish exhibition sharing programs and much more.</p>
<p><br/>We know not everyone can lend financial support. But there are other ways you can help. Joe welcomes travel advice, hotel vouchers, any way you can help.</p>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to take the ToonSeum to the international stage!</p>

<p>Kite Dream is an artist's graphic novel about my life through dystonia, tainted blood, the joy and challenges of unexpected parenting and redemption through art and the love of art.</p>

</p>
<p>WHAT WILL THIS MONEY DO? The funds for the Kite Dream indiegogo project will help to  support me while I work on the graphic novel as well as contributing to the cost of materials. At the end of a year I will have the finished product . Your contribution will help Kite Dream to fly and to support the power of art.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I bring my 33 years of work as a full time artist to Kite Dream. Colour, shape humour and the use of symbols and dream come together in this project and it feels like a perfect fit to share my story and art with all of you. </p>
<p>WHAT IS DYSTONIA? </p>
<p>Dystonia is a neurological disorder centered in the basal ganglia at the base of the brain.  Three clusters of neurons send out neurotransmitters (chemicals that direct movement.) With dystonia the wrong type or wrong amount of neurotransmitters are released causing a range of involuntary movement. The type of dystonia I have affects the head neck and shoulders with a range of involuntary movements and tremors. Dystonia comes with pain and dicomfort due to contortion of various parts of the body. My current treatment is injections of botulism toxins every three months (one of the best treatments available.) A side effect of this treatment is  the thickening of  certain muscles and a distortion of the appearance of muscles around the injection sites. <br/></p>

<p>I became an unexpected parent to my sister's beloved daughter  Victoria and experienced the joys and challenges of unexpected parenting.</p>

I bring my 33 years of work as a full time artist to Kite Dream. Colour, shape humour and the use of symbols and dream come together in this project and it feels like a perfect fit to share my story and art with all of you. 
WHAT IS DYSTONIA? 
Dystonia is a neurological disorder centered in the basal ganglia at the base of the brain.  Three clusters of neurons send out neurotransmitters (chemicals that direct movement.) With dystonia the wrong type or wrong amount of neurotransmitters are released causing a range of involuntary movement. The type of dystonia I have affects the head neck and shoulders with a range of involuntary movements and tremors. Dystonia comes with pain and dicomfort due to contortion of various parts of the body. My current treatment is injections of botulism toxins every three months (one of the best treatments available.) A side effect of this treatment is  the thickening of  certain muscles and a distortion of the appearance of muscles around the injection sites. 
   Cats & Cocktails This is phase 1 of a 2 year art project.  Your support will make this project possible.     Phase 1 is creating Kite Dream, the artist's graphic novel .
Phase 2 will be the actual printing or  publishing of the book .

You could appear in the book, get an unique commission of your cat in Riley style, enjoy cocktails with the artist, proudly sport a Kite Dream T-shirt or enjoy art year-round, My sincere thanks goes out to all supporters, whatever the contribution amount. 
   This story begins in 1991 when I awoke... 

One  fall morning with dystonia, a  disease I had not heard of but would come to know well.  My Lesbian community surrounded me during these years as they do today.
Kite Dream also describes my sister's nine year journey to death in 2000, a victim of the Canadian Tainted Blood Scandal. 
I became an unexpected parent to my sister's beloved daughter  Victoria and experienced the joys and challenges of unexpected parenting.
Interwoven and pulling together all the threads of my life are the artworks I have completed over the past two decades. (at the time that dystonia  made an appearance,I had already spent a decade dedicated to  art )

I own a very small machine shop in Tarrytown, NY.  I am planning to expand the shop and retool to make beautiful replica engines. The focus is not only to provide functioning engines, but also something that would look good on display. These will not only be functioning engines, but also something that would look good on display. We will also be developing our own unique designs.  All machines and parts are hand made, meaning very little CNC work here. There is some recycling done in the process as well. Some parts may be recast from scrap and re-machined. This is not something that will be mass-produced. You will know that every engine we make will have the attention it deserves. <br/><br/>Here are some examples of the engines that we will be building:<br/><br/>The Atkinson-Cycle Engine:<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/252187/files/20131209222835-800px-Atkinson-cycle_engine.jpg?1386656915"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Photo courtesy Wikipedia</i><p></p><p>And the Essex Hot air engine:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/252192/files/20131209223122-essex_pics_010.jpg?1386657082"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Photo courtesy myfordboy.blogspot.com</i><p></p>The goal is to supplement the existing shop as well as update some of the dated equipment:<br/><ul>

I’m asking for your help funding my latest project, The Coney Island Magic Machine, the location where I will be an artist-in-residence, this summer (July). The Magic Machine will serve as my laboratory for research, reflection and exploration into new ideas for a new body of art work that I will later exhibit, after the residency is over. All the while, the project will give a voice to those who often times go unheard during moments of social and economic change.

Why now?

Hello everyone! We are the Light Field group, a student team of the Virginia Tech chapter of Design for America. We've been working to foster a culture of public art and exploration at Virginia Tech through a highly visible and interactive installation. We hope that this will showcase the amalgam of technology and art, and also serve as a gathering place for people from both the local and regional area. 


The installation itself will be an array of balloons, each individually illuminated with LEDs. When unengaged, the field will remain statically illuminated. However, once a user enters the field, the balloons will become activated and change in color. Throughout the area will be several motion sensors which will be used to detect a user’s presence and trigger a shift in the balloon’s color. To further engage the community, the complex mechanics behind this project as well as the process have been documented from its conception. There will be a booth nearby to show this process and the mechanism.This project seeks to engage the community not only visually, but also experientially and educationally.

Why It's Important

This installation is important to bring the conversation of public art to a wider audience. We also hope a public showcasing of work will give rise to more opportunities for transdisciplinary cooperation and research by inspiring community members. In addition, there is the potential that the field could be repurposed and used as an educational tool to teach people about the nature of fields and how energy and information travel through waves.

How You Can HelpAny contributions that you are generous enough to send our way will be put towards purchasing the supplies needed to finish prototyping and create the final installation. This will include things such as arduinos, LEDs, balloons, and the other tools to make our installation a reality.

<p>I am also in Stage 4 of cancer and advancing. As hope starts to fade, I have managed to re-kindle my love for art and free my thoughts onto paper, so that my mind can have a rest from them!<br/></p>
<p>This campaign is all about enabling me to share with you my art as well as helping to fund my healing process. By contributing to this campaign, you will be making it possible for:</p> <ul>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>So what is in this Book?</h3>
<p>The illustrated art book contains 16 original artworks I made by hand using mixed media. Some of the pages of the book simply capture a deep emotion I either experienced or dreamt of whilst in hospice for pain control over the three months earlier this year. Here I learned to stop and look at the flowers, seeing people like me with cancer come and go, sometimes gone forever... </p>
<p>I completed the rest of the artworks recently as art continued to be a form of colour and being for me, and a meditative way to scrabble through the cloud of grey that always seems to follow me above my head. </p>
<p>Learning how to cope is the key, and I have found that nothing heals the body like the language of heart emotion. No pill can cure deeper than this wave of love activated by our deep wanting of change, a way of looking forward to something greater. Happiness of the heart and not being afraid to dream is my emotion I try to portray throughout this book. </p>
<p>I hope you are able to get your hands on a copy and pray you will be impacted as you immerse yourself in the magical pages of illustrations and words in this crazy journey me and so many others are going through. </p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p><b>FIRST PHASE: Magazine Test run</b></p>
<p>I need £600 in this initial campaign in order to print the short run of the books. This will allow me to sell the books to family and friends (and friends of friends hopefully!) at £10.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SECOND PHASE: Book Publication</b></p>
<p>With the funds from the books sold, I should be able to have my book published with its own ISBN and sold at £20, with the aim of selling to the general public and earning more funds.</p>
<p><b>ONGOING PHASE: Healing</b><br/></p>
<p>With the funds from the sale of the above phases, I hope to be able to purchase some (very expensive) medical treatment as an alternative to the current chemotherapy I am receiving, which does not appear to be healing me. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By donating to this campaign, you are enabling me to leave the legacy I dream of in this world. While my life may be cut short from me, I want to help and share with as many people as I can (cancer sufferers, family, friends and anyone else who has been touched by it) the true emotional roller coaster that a cancer sufferer goes through and the message that we <span style=""background-color: initial;"">should not take for granted the beauty of life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I'm still strong and have been working on this project with all my heart when I have the strength. However, it is challenging, especially on the days where reality hits and I am in so much pain, bones are breaking and it is impossible to sleep. This is real life but it will not stop me from bringing to the world these illustrations and words to impact the lives of others. </p>
<p>I have a few people helping me make this art book vision come to life. The hope is that we can achieve this before it is too late, but we need your help financially to keep the dream alive. </p>

However, if you have friends and family who you know would be interested in supporting, please share this campaign on your social media (Facebook, Twitter etc), email or in person word of mouth, and I will be eternally grateful!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Going through cancer can be like any other struggle in life that stops you from moving forward. Emotionally the struggle can become unbearable, the chain and ball of cancer are heavy, as is the loss of others from  cancer can be devastating too. Even in the deepest pit, there can be hope of achieving our goals, as it is only in the lowest time of our lives that wake us up and urge us to choose between living a better way or giving up entirely.</p>
<p>While I feel lost and alone and want to let go and be free of all of this, I know that even on my off days, the greater picture is there and there is hope.</p>

<h2>Our Story:</h2>
<h3>This year, Movement Research will finally have a long-term home! We’ll be moving into three gorgeous spaces at the 122 Community Center (122CC). Housed in the former Public School 122 at the corner of First Avenue and Ninth Street, 122CC is also the home to The Alliance for Positive Change, Mabou Mines, Painting Space 122 and Performance Space New York. This move is a historic moment for our performing arts community, and one that will benefit all of the communities that MR serves – throughout New York City, across the country and around the world.</h3> <p>The new space at 122CC will offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully ADA accessible space, including accessible studios and restrooms</li>
<li>Increased interaction between MR’s programs, as well as with the surrounding communities in the building and in the neighborhood</li>
<li>Expansion of MR’s programs to meet the needs of our growing artist communities</li>
<li>Unprecedented organizational stability through shelter from rising rents</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Our Story:
This year, Movement Research will finally have a long-term home! We’ll be moving into three gorgeous spaces at the 122 Community Center (122CC). Housed in the former Public School 122 at the corner of First Avenue and Ninth Street, 122CC is also the home to The Alliance for Positive Change, Mabou Mines, Painting Space 122 and Performance Space New York. This move is a historic moment for our performing arts community, and one that will benefit all of the communities that MR serves – throughout New York City, across the country and around the world. The new space at 122CC will offer:

A fully ADA accessible space, including accessible studios and restrooms
Increased interaction between MR’s programs, as well as with the surrounding communities in the building and in the neighborhood
Expansion of MR’s programs to meet the needs of our growing artist communities
Unprecedented organizational stability through shelter from rising rents
More subsidized rehearsal space!

<p>I'm Josh di Donato. I'm a standup comedian, but I have a bachelor's degree in Fine Art from UCLA.</p>
<p>I've been taking Polaroids at the Coachella Festival since 2001, and have over 1800 Polaroids from this festival 2001-2011. I'm looking to do a book of the best pictures. There will probably be 200-250 pictures, about 20 from each year. If the book is a success, I certainly have enough shots to do a second volume.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to keeping the Instant Photography flag flying. Digital photography is nice, because most everyone now has the ability to take pictures. But a by-product of thousands of images being generated without much effort or thought or stakes, means that the individual image has lost its significance. Polaroids make each picture something that can be treasured.</p>
<p>I haven't found a publisher for this book yet, though I haven't stopped looking. The options in self-publishing are such that I can make a first printing of the book myself, with the hope that a publishing company would pick it up for a second printing.</p>
<h2>HOW IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN</h2>
<p>There are two niche demographics I can target this book toward- fans of Polaroids, and fans of the Coachella Festival. There are many people who are devoted to both these things.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, it would take $20,000 to print 1,000 books, and have them look really good. Over the past ten-plus years, I have spent over $20,000 on cameras and film- mostly on the film. This film is not cheap.</p>
<p>Having already invested so much of my own money over the last decade, it's going to be challenging to additionally fund the printing. This is why I have posted this project here. I believe I have the makings of what could be a successful book. Not a runaway bestseller or anything, but something that more than 1000 people would like to have on their coffee table!</p>
<p>There are different Polaroid enthusiast websites, including The Impossible Project, who are the people who put out the new film made for Polaroid cameras, since the Polaroid company discontinued making the standard 600, 1200 and SX-70 film. I can connect with other Polaroid fans through TIP, Flickr, and other sites where Polaroidists post their work.</p>
<p>There are also many gathering places for fans of Coachella, and chances to connect and get the word out via the Coachella website message boards, Facebook page, etc.</p>
<h2>SEE A PREVIEW OF WHAT WILL BE IN THE BOOK</h2>
<p>There are some examples in my pitch video here on IndieGoGo. You can see more of the Polaroids at Facebook.com/CoachellaPolaroids . As of this writing, most of them are up. When I get back from the festival this weekend, this will be modified, and there will be fewer that are viewable.</p>
<h2>SOME PERKS</h2>
<p>For some levels of donation, you can get a mention in the Thanks section of the book when it comes out, have a signed copy of the book, have one of my Polaroid cameras from my personal collection (I have quite a few), get a pack of some of the last original Polaroid film, or have me do a Polaroid shoot of you and your friends, in LA, or anywhere in the US!</p>
<h2>TELL PEOPLE</h2>
<p>If you can't donate, but know people who would be interested in this project, please post about it on Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or any other place you think would reach interested parties.</p>

<p>We are Jane, Lisa, and Jeremy from the Victory Gallery in Portland, Oregon. We are dedicated tobringing new and exciting work to our city. Though our area is very art-conscious, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries and testing the limits. We are dedicated to standing out. We are dedicated tobringing the public free artwork from around the world.We are dedicated.But we need your financial help to continue to bring cutting-edge art to our fair city. Our worthy cause canuse whatever funds you can spare – your donation of even the two dollars you spend on coffee in themorning will help.</p>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $7,000 right now to cover our basic costs for a three month period, which roughly<br/>translates to this:</p>
<p>Shipping of artwork: $1,500</p>
<p>Travel costs for artists to do Q and A's and give lectures : $2,000</p>
<p>Hanging art and cleaning of the gallery: $400</p>
<p>General costs for opening, closing, seating, refreshments, and lighting: $500</p>
<p>General gallery maintenance and upkeep: $600</p>
<p>Payment for design and printing of all publicity material: $1,800</p>
<p>What do you get in return? So MUCH! We have buttons, posters, postcards, stickers, donor certificates,<br/>private viewings prior to a show’s opening, books, booklets, T-shirts, and much, much more.</p>
<p>Why this is important to you.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help us survive, it will help us continue to grow and expand. More than anything, the gallery is meant as a place for both first time viewers and long-time art critics to mingle and share opinions. Our approach will educate, entertain, and inspire you while providing free access to innovative and thought  provoking artists with a global perspective.</p>
<p>Don't have money? Don't worry!</p>
<p>You're broke. We get it. That's totally fine. Everyone is having a hard time right now. But if you could share this with your friends, family, relatives, work buddies, band members, gallery friends, sugar  daddies, wealthy second uncles, Bill Gates, or anyone else you might know, we would greatly appreciate<br/>it.</p>

<p>From a vengeful mother to a deranged hillbilly, copycat killer to possessed bystander, the surprisingly varied cast of villains throughout our favorite horror franchise have brandished an equally diverse set of killing tools. Collecting every single handheld weapon utilized for dissecting the many victims of summer camp, Manhattan, and outer space, this unique design creates a bold image reflecting the simple-yet-complex nature of these classic slasher films. Plus, it totally looks kick-ass!</p>
<p><strong>About Darb Tees</strong></p>
<p>Darb Tees is a T-shirt company and website featuring humorous designs that merge original ideas with established pop culture staples. Shirts are produced in a limited quantity since we believe people aren't just buying a shirt, they're investing in a limited edition piece of wearable art.

<p><strong>Why Should You Donate?</strong></p>
<p>For several years, Darb Tees has been a dream that we've poured all of our creative thoughts into in the hopes of one day bringing this vision to reality. All money raised through this campaign will be utilized to purchase shirts, have them imprinted with our design, and finally made available for purchase through our website, DarbTees.com. As young entrepreneurs, we hope for Darb Tees to be the first step towards fulfilling all of our creative aspirations - and we'd like for you to be a part of it.

<h3>An Artists Story</h3>
<p>As an artist, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I believe in creating opportunities for others to discover and nurture their artistic and creative abilities. </p>
<p>Salon 477 is a network of Grand Rapids artists used to mentor, support and provide opportunities for emerging artists to display and sell their work.</p>
<p>The Artists residency trip to Israel will provide the opportunity for me to journey alongside Israeli and Palestinian artists exploring what it means to create within the context of our varying cultures. It will consist of two weeks of intensive work through workshops, lectures and art creation. It is also about learning by visiting the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim holy sites, and meeting Israelis and Palestinians working on peace and reconciliation. The goal is to learn to integrate faith and justice into our art, to approach our body of work as a legacy that will communicate responsibly who we were and the times we lived.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a result of this trip I aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthen my voice as an artist within my community and learn to effectively utilize my work as a communication tool that will leave a lasting impact</li>
<li>inspire and encourage my students to have a broader view of the world around them</li>
<li>facilitate conversations among artists in my community about our work and how we use it.</li>
<li>gain a deeper understanding about the power behind artistic expression and what art can mean for those who need a voice.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<h3>I need to raise $4000 for airfare, transit, field costs and personal expenses.</h3>
<p>Airfare and transit: $1400, Field costs: $2000 (room, breakfast and dinner, entrance to sites, gratuities, honorariums to all of the speakers, cost of my insurance), $600:lunch and personal expenses (entertainment, souvenirs, toiletries) </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>By becoming a part of this life changing experience, your involvement will:</p>
<ul>
<li>support my artistic development and encourage art for social change</li>
<li>secure your invitation to a special viewing of a new body of work this fall (for funders living in Grand Rapids and surrounding areas).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Money isn't the only thing that matters...</strong></h3>
<p>Helping me spread the word and sharing this with your friends and family on Facebook is invaluable. I appreciate your help in any way possible.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of my story.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>San Quentin's Prison Arts Project is a role model of community arts programming, funded by the William James Association, a non-profit which has supported arts in California prisons since 1977. The Prison Arts Project at San Quentin has continued despite the ending of the 30-year-old state supported Arts-in-Corrections program in 2010. Inmates who participate regularly in arts programming have significantly lower recidivism (return-to-prison) rates and fewer behavioral problems in prison, which saves the public significant money and is more humane. Since 90% of inmates will parole to our communities, it's important that they've had the opportunity to grow, change and develop skills and self-esteem. (Please visit <em><a href=""http://www.williamjamesassociation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.williamjamesassociation.org</a></em> for more information.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The inmate designed mural depicts a fantasy town, providing a beautiful and comforting image for the dining hall; the design is by Scott McKinstry, who will be heading the mural crew for this work. Under the supervision of Patrick Maloney, who has taught at San Quentin for 24 years, the inmates will create a 64' x 7' mural in acrylics. It continues a tradition of dining hall murals, since there is a fantastic historically preserved 600' 6-part mural already there created by Alfredo Santos 60 years ago. (<em><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/arts/design/19hall.html?_r=1&amp;sq="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/arts/design/1...</a></em>) The mural crew has tremendous talent and experience, and some samples of their previous San Quentin work is in the 'gallery' tab.</div>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Mural art in prisons helps reduce tension in a very tense environment. The mural crew and studio also offer a rare sanctuary in prison, where inmates, who are normally segregated by race and other factors, work side by side in peace. The opportunity to create a beautiful, permanent artwork will provide great personal growth for the artists, and help improve the quality of life for the thousands of incarcerated viewers and correctional staff.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The mural will be done in acrylic paint, and Utrecht Art Supply in Berkeley is offering a 20% discount and free delivery to support this project. All funds will go directly to art supplies through the non-profit William James Association, a 501(c)3. The Marin Community Foundation has again offered a grant to help support the Prison Arts Project, and the grant requires matching funds, so the donations here are doubled by the MCF!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For a $10 contribution, WJA will send you a postcard of thanks; for $25, WJA will send you a 4x6 photo of the mural proposal; for $50, you'll receive a 5x7 photo. For $100 you will receive an original print from the printmaking workshop at San Quentin! Also, Peter Merts, a volunteer photographer will be documenting the mural and its progress, and those images will be posted here and ultimately on the WJA website.</div>

<p><strong>Coffee Talks</strong> is the title of a project that aims to open up a discussion about the state of arts in public space of the city of Zurich. The intention is to seize the opportunity to create temporary interventions in the urban landscape of the city. This project started from a conversation between Candida Pestana (curator), Susana Pedrosa (artist) and André Catalão (artist). The main idea started in a coffee shop during a random discussion about the need to research and approach public space. Lately this necessity of presence in the space created a link involving the artists Cornelia Heusser and Niklaus Rüegg.  </p>
<p>As site-specific and event-driven, <strong>Coffee Talks</strong> aims to address multiple audiences, shake up the city dynamics by occupying and creating small-scale events in the public domain, and open up the possibilities for sharing the vision behind those events, specifically through performative actions, with anyone who takes part. </p>
<p>The proposals of the involved artists challenges the public by raising urgent questions about the limits of the law. It is important to discuss public space as something that we are used to sharing. However, normally there are no references telling us how far we can go. The methodology applied in this collaboration is based on an exhaustive investigation about the relevant legal parameters centered predominantly on legal institutional entities; these are related to the notion and practice of justice, to the Swiss constitution, and to the cultural and subcultural urban groups whose primary nature is rooted in the visual arts. The research permits integration between the artistic context, on the one hand, and the context of the public law on the other, thus creating a natural platform for dialogue concerning the aforementioned issues.</p>
<p>The artists are working with a clear collaborative spirit, investing in strong community engagement as a part of their operations. This engagement will define the outcome of their joint work. The resulting work will manifest itself publicly in a series of events: a exhibition at Perla-Mode: message salon, located in one of core and fast-living areas in the city of Zurich (Langstrasse). This urban zone - an ideal location for critical observation of the issues of legality and power in public space - has been intentionally chosen as a main punctum of the final display. Given its local reputation (known for immigration, prostitution, second-hand shops, and art galleries) it becomes a zone of transformative potential, inevitably connected to the everyday life practices rooted in the politics of the place.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For this project to happen in these dimensions, it needs financial support. The involved parties already invested all available resources for this project to transpire. Without your help this project cannot achieve the proportions that we are working for, including the live events, the symposium, and the publication. Thanks to the true commitment of all artists involved and the other participants, this project has developed even further. At the moment we are working on a low cost basis: we already created a web-platform, and we are now looking to local sponsors, and to the goodwill of our associates, in order to finance the necessary materials.</p>
<p>We need your help to make this idea grow and to make it visible to the public, to be seen, to be discussed, and to create an impact in the local culture.  Finding the resources to do a publication will permit an expansion of this local experience onto an international level. In advance I would like to thank all possible collaborators for believing in this idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our main financial goal is to pay for all of the material for this project, which includes:</p>
<p>Flyers (design and print): $200</p>
<p>Booklets (design and print): $300</p>

</div></div>","Public health matters, and public art is powerful. Let's bring them together in Naco, Mexico and Bisbee, Arizona.


In these two communities we have an amazing opportunity to promote better health along the border. We've been working on this project for five months and it's time to be there in person and help see this through.


Hi! My name is Nathan Hewitt and I am a fourth-year student at the University of Kentucky, currently studying Music Performance and Arts Administration. (I'm also the General Manager of WRFL, the University's student-run radio station, a Fellow at the Gaines Center for the Humanities, and the Founder of the UK Arts Administration Society.) 

This spring break (March 16-21), I plan to travel to Naco, Mexico to start laying the groundwork for an exciting new project. But I need your help!


Here are the basics:
The Naco-Bisbee Mural Project
The Naco-Bisbee Mural Project is a new bi-national public art initiative, focused on promoting better public health at the US-Mexico border and bringing two communities together through artistic collaboration. Grade school students and community members from both towns will work through local artist Pablo Pencil to design and paint murals which will  promote good health.
Pablo has laid out an amazing framework, through which school children from both sides of the border will be able to help formulate the murals' designs. Next, community members will take part in the physical creation of the mural with Pablo's help. This creates greater community ownership and increases the murals' impact.
The project is a recipient of support through the Clinton Global Initiative University program, but funds will be directed towards the murals, not travel, and will not be received until later this year.


Project Leaders


Here's a rundown of who else is is leading the project: 



My main partner in the project is fellow student Kaylee Hicks an International Studies and Biology major at the University of Kentucky. With undergraduate experience in civic deliberation and public health systems research, Kaylee is in the process of publishing her second paper on community health needs assessments quality. Her goal is to serve rural communities in Latin America through culturally sensitive education and preventive care. Kaylee is a Junior Fellow at the Gaines Center for the Humanities and is a member of UK’s Honors Program, Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, and Alpha Delta Pi Sorority.


Our contact in Bisbee, Tom Carlson, leads the Naco Wellness Initiative (NWI) alongside several leaders in the community. During his years in Bisbee, Tom has become increasingly concerned with his Mexican neighbors’ limited opportunities for well-being. However, he knew that providing them with acute care would not be enough to stop the socioeconomic causes of Naco’s main illnesses. So, in true public health spirit, he set about forming NWI with numerous partners on both sides of the border. NWI’s notable successes include educational workshops, exercise classes, a blood glucose testing program, and a community gardens project.




Our artist/facilitator for the project is Pablo Pencil, a cornerstone of the Bisbee arts community. From painting murals on historic buildings to creating the flyers for local events, his artistic mark is all over town. In his pre-Bisbee life, Pablo worked as a professional scenic and lighting designer, and a technical director in the theater world and was employed as an assistant to designers at the Boston Ballet Company and the Opera Company of Boston. He taught drawing and sculpture at Plymouth State College and was Artist-in-Residence for the state of New Hampshire. 
Pablo has resided in Bisbee for the last 20 years, and he keeps himself busy with creative activities such as a cartooning, caricature drawing, mural painting, and building. Here is a taste of the sort of amazing work he plans to do through the project: 


We have contacts in Naco through the Naco Wellness Initiative and have made contact with the mayors of both communities. Additionally, we are receiving advisement from the University of Arizona, the University of Kentucky, and through the Clinton Global Initiative.



Our Beginnings

The Naco-Bisbee Mural Project began as a summer trip in July 2015. Kaylee was working with Naco Wellness Initiative, a community health nonprofit, when she was struck by the prevalence of mural advertisements in Latino communities. She wondered how we could use that medium to make a positive impact on the community’s health.

On that same trip, Kaylee made our first mural (see below). She received a lot of great positive feedback from nearby community members.

What Now?
The project we now propose is a continuation of the work Kaylee began this summer. The first step for us in the concrete execution of the project is to travel there again and get the ball rolling. Through Tom, I will be able to meet with many different members of the community and begin to select mural sites. 
The Budget
 flight: $340 (CVG-AZA rountrip, Allegiant)
travel airport-Bisbee: $160 ($80 each way)
(lodging will be provided)
total: $500

The Bottom Line

I need your help to make an impact in Naco and Bisbee. In order to solidify the project, it is important for me to travel to speak in person with the community members involved. Please consider donating or sharing this campaign so that we can start building momentum towards the painting of these murals in the summer or fall of 2016! No contribution is too small.
Adelante!

This campaign will allow us to launch our first website allowing us to spread Love across the world.         Contributors will assist us in expenses towards initial, website launching, such as copyright fees, trademark fees, design fees, and web-hosting fees. Once the website is launched, proceeds from our sales and creations will build schools here in America, and all across the globe in third-world-countries. We also will be donating our proceeds to children who have been abused and neglected across the world. Help us make a difference! Help us spread the message of Love, peace, unity, and positive change!         Your donations, no matter the amount, will go directly towards the launching of LoveProjections.com and its initial fees to get started. You will receive website thank-yous, original artwork, and be the first to experience autographed, visual art, prints of our books and paintings, or clothing and promotional merchandise depending on the size of your donation. Again, we will not stop until our mission is complete, so your one dollar will be a contribution towards future schools for children in need.       Want to experience the value of our message first-hand?

<p></p>
<p>As a member of the <a href=""http://www.spithari.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spithari –Walking Life</a> I have worked for
the completion of free entrance -open source- seminars in the fields of natural
farming, permaculture, biodynamics, natural building, renewable energy sources,
trying to spread the news about other ways to cover our needs.  I find joy when humans are able to work with
nature such as to work with each other in peace<i>.</i> </p>
<p>As an actor I enjoyed working, for a
short period, with children with special abilities – needs, in the theatrical
group of <a href=""http://www.vsahellas.gr/cms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Very Special Arts Athens</a>. Thus,
I want to present Cycle for Sustainability to this group and also I would like
to approach social groups which are oppressed or marginalized by the majority, as
a part of the project’s tour. </p>
<p>Moreover, I want to collaborate with
artists &amp; activists in order to explore the field of sustainable art,
namely a field where art and activism immerge. An approach to the Academy of
Arts has already taken place, and I am in close contact with several teams of
activists.  I believe that it is crucial
to connect the movement of social ecology to art so as to upgrade aesthetic and
awake awareness in our lives. As an example, we can organize artistic events of
neighborhoods, showing people how to make a roof permaculture garden in
apartment blocks, or presentations of the application and use of the cycle
generator, which will give the opportunity to anyone who has no electricity
access to consider this even low efficient way to light up his/hers space on

 Who Am I 

My name is Spyros
Tsiknas, I live in Athens, I have a son,
and I have studied and work in the fields of renewable energy sources and
representative arts. 
I am a member of Spithari-Walking Life, a project located in
the suburbs of Athens (Marathon area). We are a group of people working on a
testing ground which is desertified by fires. For the last three years, we put
our great effort into the creation of a sustainable environment that will
enable us to cover our needs in energy, food, and lodging while sharing the
knowledge of above scopes.   
I am involved in the coordination of
a workshop for sustainability & art which will take place in the
Solidarity, Sustainability and Creation Festival. Moreover, I participate in
the production of the theatrical play titled The Final and will be presented in theatre
of Vyrsodepsio.  Both projects
explore the field of sustainable art and their electricity needs will be fully
covered by the cycle power generator. 

Why Cycle 4
sustainability?

The direct relation of
human power to electricity production / consumption is a starting point for
opening discussions and increasing awareness on environmental and social
issues. With activism immerging to
art, I will ride the cycle power generator and start a tour shedding
light on events related to sustainability and social ecology. The tour will start in two months.  

TheCycleTouring
 30-31-01 May
2014.The first stop of the tour is on the three day
Solidarity, Sustainability and Creation Festival, a free entrance event located on the
coastal suburbs of Athens (Camping Voula), a place which is due to
privatization under terms defined by local- global economic interests. The Festival
includes numerous workshops for practicing towards the sustainability of the
environment, the society and our selves. A workshop for construction of the
cycle power generator will be organized, which will illuminate a children’s
(theatrical) interactive play under the trees.June
2014. The second stop is at the Contemporary Greek Writers
platform in the Theatre
of Vyrsodepsio, where the theatrical play titled “The Final”, which I wrote
in 2013, will be presented.  It is a
story about a family leasing- from a SEZ (Special Economic Zone) - a cycler
with a cycle generator so as to watch the football final from the energy
produced by the cycler. However, the children of the family have a different

Autumn
2014:
In Autumn 2014, the presentation, application and use of Cycle Generator in schools
for educational and artistic purposes will be forwarded such as the
collaboration with fellow artists and activists. 

Needs 

This
campaign aims to gather the amount of 1500 euros, which will be spent as
follows:

Ø 
Construction of the base and the mechanism of the cycle
generator (including
labour cost)
Ø 
Capacitor with volt meter
Ø 
Lights 
Ø 
Cables, switches, diodes, etc.
Ø 
 Extra equipment: Inverter
or Battery or Battery charger 
Ø 
Also
a part of the touring travel expenses and support of the fellow artists
creating the video and the poster will be covered. Plus the Ιndiegogo platform fees and any other
fees for the transactions.  

Social
Impact & Future Aims 

As a member of the Spithari –Walking Life I have worked for
the completion of free entrance -open source- seminars in the fields of natural
farming, permaculture, biodynamics, natural building, renewable energy sources,
trying to spread the news about other ways to cover our needs.  I find joy when humans are able to work with
nature such as to work with each other in peace. 
As an actor I enjoyed working, for a
short period, with children with special abilities – needs, in the theatrical
group of Very Special Arts Athens. Thus,
I want to present Cycle for Sustainability to this group and also I would like
to approach social groups which are oppressed or marginalized by the majority, as

everyday struggle of people who try to cover their basic needs.

κατασκευής ποδηλατογεννήτριας, με την οποία θα φωταγωγήσουμε μια  διαδραστική παιδική παράσταση κάτω απ τα
δέντρα. 
Ιούνιος
2014:
Η επόμενη στάση είναι η πλατφόρμα Σύγχρονων Ελλήνων Συγγραφέων στο Θέατρο
Βυρσοδεψείο. Εκεί θα γίνει παρουσίαση του έργου «Ο ΤΕΛΙΚΟΣ», το οποίο
έγραψα το 2013. Είναι η ιστορία μιας οικογένειας η οποία μισθώνει, από μια
Ειδική Οικονομική Ζώνη (Ε.Ο.Ζ.), έναν ποδηλάτη και μια ποδήλατο-γεννήτρια ώστε
να τους παράγει ρεύμα για να δούνε το τελικό ποδοσφαίρου. Τα δύο παιδιά της
οικογένειας όμως έχουν διαφορετική αντίληψη των γεγονότων…
Φθινόπωρο 2014:
To Φθινόπωρο του
2014 θα προωθηθεί η παρουσίαση, εφαρμογή και χρήση της ποδήλατο – γεννήτριας
στα σχολεία για εκπαιδευτικούς σκοπούς καθώς και η συνεργασίαμε καλλιτέχνες και ακτιβιστές.  

Τι
χρειάζομαι: 

Αυτή η καμπάνια
έχει ως στόχο να συγκεντρώσει το ποσό των 1500 Ευρώ, τo  οποίo θα χρησιμοποιηθεί για τα παρακάτω έξοδα του
εγχειρήματος:
Ø  Κατασκευή βάσης 
και μηχανισμός Π/Γ (περιλαμβάνοντας το εργατικό κόστος)
Ø  Πυκνωτής με ποτενσιόμετρο
Ø  Φωτισμός 
Ø  Extra
εξοπλισμός: Αντιστροφέας, ή μπαταρία, ή ρυθμιστής φόρτισης
Ø  παρελκόμενα : καλώδια , διακόπτες, δίοδοι κτλ.
Ø  Επιπλέον θα καλυφθεί μέρος των εξόδων ταξιδίου και
λειτουργίας του εγχειρήματος καθώς και ενίσχυση των φίλων καλλιτεχνών που
δημιούργησαν το βίντεο και την αφίσα, πλέον των αμοιβών της Πλατφόρμας Ιndiegogo και λοιπών εξόδων συναλλαγών. 
Κοινωνικό Αντίκτυπο & Μελλοντικοί
Στόχοι

Ως μέλος του Σπιθάρι WalkingLife  έχω εργαστεί στη
διεξαγωγή ανοιχτών, προς τον κόσμο, σεμιναρίων στους παρακάτω τομείς: φυσική
καλλιέργεια, περμακουλτούρα, βιοδυναμική, κατασκευές με υλικά φυσικής δόμησης,
ανανεώσιμες πηγές ενέργειας, προωθώντας τη διάδοση εναλλακτικών τρόπων κάλυψης
των βασικών αναγκών μας. Νιώθω χαρά όταν βρίσκομαι ανάμεσα σε ανθρώπους που
μπορούν να εργαστούν με τη φύση και να συνεργαστούν μεταξύ τους με ειρηνικό
τρόπο. 

Ως ηθοποιός
εργάστηκα- για σύντομο χρονικό διάστημα -, στη θεατρική ομάδα παιδιών με
ειδικές ανάγκες- ικανότητες της Very Special Arts Athens. Συνεπώς, θα ήθελα να παρουσιάσω τον Αυτόνομο Ποδηλάτη
σε αυτή την ομάδα, καθώς και να προσεγγίσω κοινωνικά ευπαθείς ομάδες οι οποίες
είναι καταπιεσμένες ή περιθωριοποιημένες από την πλειονότητα.  
Επίσης επιθυμώ
να συνεργαστώ με άλλους καλλιτέχνες & ακτιβιστές με σκοπό να διερευνήσουμε
το πεδίο της βιώσιμης τέχνης ως σημείο συνάντησης ακτιβισμού και τέχνης. Έχω
ήδη προσεγγίσει τη Σχολή Καλών Τεχνών και είμαι σε στενή επαφή με πολλές ομάδες
ακτιβιστών. Πιστεύω ότι είναι κρίσιμο να συνδεθεί η κοινωνική οικολογία με την
τέχνη, προκειμένου να βελτιωθεί η αισθητική στις ζωές μας και να αφυπνιστεί η
συνείδησή μας.  Για παράδειγμα, μπορούν
να διοργανωθούν καλλιτεχνικά δρώμενα σε γειτονιές, δείχνοντας στους ανθρώπους
πώς να φτιάξουν έναν λαχανόκηπο στην ταράτσα μιας πολυκατοικίας, ή να γίνουν
παρουσιάσεις της εφαρμογής και χρήσης της ποδήλατο – γεννήτριας, οι οποίες
δίνουν τη δυνατότητα σε κάποιον που δεν έχει ρεύμα να καλύψει τις βασικές του
ανάγκες να γνωρίσει αυτόν τον, παρ’ ότι χαμηλής απόδοσης, τρόπο παραγωγής
ηλεκτρικής ενέργειας ώστε να ηλεκτροδοτήσει  το χώρο του, κάνοντας ποδήλατο και κρατώντας
τη φόρμα του. 
Μέσα απ το
εγχείρημα «Αυτόνομος Ποδηλάτης» επιθυμώ να εκφράσω αυτό που είναι ζωτικό μέσα
μου. Να αναζητήσω και να ρίξω φως σε απαντήσεις που σχετίζονται με τον
καθημερινό μας αγώνα για την κάλυψη των βασικών μας αναγκών.

</h3><p></p>
<p>My name is Catherine Armbrust— I am a mixed
media/assemblage artist who works with found objects, knitting/crocheting, and
more.  After
receiving my MFA from the University of Missouri in December 2012, I was
invited to be the first artist-in-residence at <i>360 Xochi Quetzal </i>in Chapala, Mexico. Thanks to a previous
Indiegogo campaign I was able to spend an inspiring month in Mexico absorbing
my surroundings and making vibrant work.<span> 
While in Chapala I had hoped to produce a series of outdoor
installations, but realized that a month was not enough time to plan and
achieve such a large-scale goal.  Since
my return to the states I have spent my time constructing new installations
&amp; exhibition proposals with my art partner; teaching Sculpture, Fibers,
&amp; 3D Design at the University of Missouri &amp; University of Missouri-Kansas
City; and planning my return to Chapala in order to produce this new body of
work.  With the encouragement of fellow
artist and Chapala resident Deborah Kruger, I plan to return to Mexico in late
August 2014. I am launching this Indiegogo fundraiser in order to facilitate my
return to Mexico to produce what I call <i>The
Lake Chapala Projects</i>.  <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/555940/files/20140504085016-Cath_Chapala_studio.jpg?1399218616"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>(Catherine in her Chapala studio, January 2013)</i><br/><br/>The
town of Chapala is approximately 45 minutes outside of Guadalajara and sits on
the shore of Lake Chapala—Mexico’s largest lake.<span>  The lake is an important resource for the
state of Jalisco—providing income for fishermen, fresh water for drinking and
irrigating crops, and a revenue base for enormous amounts of weekend tourism.  Though a major source of life, the lake is in
jeopardy for various political and environmental reasons and is a constant
source of debate in the region. 
According to globalnature.org, “</span>Eleven million people live in the [Chapala] catchment area (about
10 % of the total population of México), and the potential for conflict over
regional water resources is high due to their overexploitation… About 81 % of
the lake’s catchment area is agricultural, and the area irrigated has
quintupled over the last 50 years.”  Thus
the lake is the essence of the area, acting simultaneously as a symbol of both
vitality and loss.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/555941/files/20140504085128-DSCN2592.jpg?1399218688"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><span></span><p><span>
</span></p><p><i>(the lake at sunset, January 2013)<br/></i></p><p><i>The Lake Chapala Projects</i> are a series of works dedicated to the lake—and
in the grander scheme, to water in general.<span> 
Through installations and performances I will simultaneously celebrate
the gift of life and express my concerns over its availability.  The issues related to Chapala are not
isolated there—though the project will be directly connected to that site,
accessibility to fresh water is a global concern.  As stewards of the earth, humans need to be
conscious of our relationship to water for the present and the future.</span></p>
<p>The
impact this project will have on my creative research is tremendous.<span>  The majority of my work thus far, has been a
series of singular objects for indoor display. 
The work I have planned for Chapala is in step with my earlier work—which
often references icons &amp; altars while utilizing altered found objects to
provide context.  This new series of work
planned for Chapala is similar to the old in that it deals with cultural topics
and uses specific materials to build meaning, but will push my creative
boundaries through outdoor installations and costumed performances related to
the lake and surrounding region.  </span></p>
<p>I hope
to also make a difference by raising awareness regarding the health of the
lake.<span>  There will be a number of
festivals taking place in Chapala while I am there—I plan to publicize this
project by attending these events &amp; passing out flyers, using social media,
and making local gallery &amp; political connections.  There are a number of groups in the Chapala
region that host lake-related activities with whom I would like to connect.</span></p>

<p></p></div>","The Lake Chapala Projects

My name is Catherine Armbrust— I am a mixed
media/assemblage artist who works with found objects, knitting/crocheting, and
more.  After
receiving my MFA from the University of Missouri in December 2012, I was
invited to be the first artist-in-residence at 360 Xochi Quetzal in Chapala, Mexico. Thanks to a previous
Indiegogo campaign I was able to spend an inspiring month in Mexico absorbing
my surroundings and making vibrant work. 
While in Chapala I had hoped to produce a series of outdoor
installations, but realized that a month was not enough time to plan and
achieve such a large-scale goal.  Since
my return to the states I have spent my time constructing new installations
& exhibition proposals with my art partner; teaching Sculpture, Fibers,
& 3D Design at the University of Missouri & University of Missouri-Kansas
City; and planning my return to Chapala in order to produce this new body of
work.  With the encouragement of fellow
artist and Chapala resident Deborah Kruger, I plan to return to Mexico in late
August 2014. I am launching this Indiegogo fundraiser in order to facilitate my
return to Mexico to produce what I call The
Lake Chapala Projects.  (Catherine in her Chapala studio, January 2013)The
town of Chapala is approximately 45 minutes outside of Guadalajara and sits on
the shore of Lake Chapala—Mexico’s largest lake.  The lake is an important resource for the
state of Jalisco—providing income for fishermen, fresh water for drinking and
irrigating crops, and a revenue base for enormous amounts of weekend tourism.  Though a major source of life, the lake is in
jeopardy for various political and environmental reasons and is a constant
source of debate in the region. 
According to globalnature.org, “Eleven million people live in the [Chapala] catchment area (about
10 % of the total population of México), and the potential for conflict over
regional water resources is high due to their overexploitation… About 81 % of
the lake’s catchment area is agricultural, and the area irrigated has
quintupled over the last 50 years.”  Thus
the lake is the essence of the area, acting simultaneously as a symbol of both
vitality and loss.
(the lake at sunset, January 2013)The Lake Chapala Projects are a series of works dedicated to the lake—and
in the grander scheme, to water in general. 
Through installations and performances I will simultaneously celebrate
the gift of life and express my concerns over its availability.  The issues related to Chapala are not
isolated there—though the project will be directly connected to that site,
accessibility to fresh water is a global concern.  As stewards of the earth, humans need to be
conscious of our relationship to water for the present and the future.
The
impact this project will have on my creative research is tremendous.  The majority of my work thus far, has been a
series of singular objects for indoor display. 
The work I have planned for Chapala is in step with my earlier work—which
often references icons & altars while utilizing altered found objects to
provide context.  This new series of work
planned for Chapala is similar to the old in that it deals with cultural topics
and uses specific materials to build meaning, but will push my creative
boundaries through outdoor installations and costumed performances related to
the lake and surrounding region.  
I hope
to also make a difference by raising awareness regarding the health of the
lake.  There will be a number of
festivals taking place in Chapala while I am there—I plan to publicize this
project by attending these events & passing out flyers, using social media,
and making local gallery & political connections.  There are a number of groups in the Chapala
region that host lake-related activities with whom I would like to connect.

(mural by Jose Lopez Vega in Ajijic)Project Plans, Budget, & Perks

The funding I seek will help pay for
living expenses, transportation, and material costs during my stay.  I plan to stay in Chapala from
late August 2014 until early January 2015. 
Any extra funding earned will be rolled into those costs. 

Projects in
the works:I
know that 4 months will go quickly and I may not be able to accomplish
everything on my list, but these are the projects I am
developing (in order of priority).  The
work is all inspired by Chalchiuhtlicue & Ix Chel, the Aztec & Mayan
Goddesses of still and running water. 


Floating sculpture that acts as a (temporary) altar on the lake

Small shrines & amulets (made of biodegradable materials)
placed around  the edge of the lake 


Costumed performance: Immersed in water, then emerging from lake
onto shore and drawing in sand with large braid.  Documenting through photo & video


Costumed performance: Placing unfired ceramic jugs and/or ceramic
fish in shallow water.  Filling the jugs
with water from the lake.  Documenting
their deterioration—clay “melting” back into lake--through photo & video


Documenting the area using found vegetation and salvaged rainwater
to create natural dyed fabrics

Supply Expenses:
 I will need a variety of materials to produce the installations,
costumes, & performances I have in the works:  @ $1500-2000.
I plan to purchase most of my materials in
the Chapala/Guadalajara area in order to support the local economy there.  Final materials required will depend on each
specific project...  


Floating
sculpture materials:  wood, plastic, recycled
materials, glue,    paper mache materials, glitter, chicken wire, tape, wire


Unfired
ceramic materials for shoreline installations

Boat
hire to install & de-install floating sculpture

Small
shrine materials:  found objects &
vegetation


Kayak
rental to place small shrines around shoreline

Costume
materials:  fabric, yarn, thread, rope,
ready-made garments to alter with sewing, crochet, knitting, & embroidery,
sewing machine


Hire
videographer & photographer to help document installations &
performances

Natural
dye materials: plants, vegetables, fruits, flowers, fabric, bowls & jars

Transportation
& Living Expenses:
The bulk of my costs will be spent on travel
and living expenses, both in and out of Mexico.


Round trip plane ticket:  @ $650


In-country transportation (buses to/from
Guad, town to town for events) =  @$200


Apartment Rental with studio (4-5
months):  @ $500/month = $2000-2500


Food: 
@ $200/month = $800-1000


I will have additional financial
responsibilities (shared with my spouse) in the US that I will also need to
keep up with (housing/utilities in US, student loan debt, pet care, etc.—my
half is @ $1000/month)
I have some money saved for this
venture, but not enough to sustain the full project. Thus, I’m launching this
campaign and offering some fabulous perks!  All the perks are artworks lovingly created
by me.  I’m offering stickers, collages,
stencil prints, art cards, and more—so much color and
pattern!  All perks include shipping within the US.  Some photos of perk samples are posted here in the gallery section.  If you’d like to see more,
photo albums of more perks are posted on The Lake Chapala Projects’ Facebook page.  https://www.facebook.com/lakechapalaprojects(samples of some of the $25 postcard collage perks)Making a Difference...

Back in 2011 a group of artists had the desire to create a wonderful little calendar and began a project called My Little Sweetheart. Eventually it became the charity art book you know and love today, already undergoing it's fourth edition (more information can be found at this tumblr).This brings us to our baby project; Cutey Confidential! We selected some of your favorite artists from previous books to create to you a one-of-a-kind fully illustrated calendar. This calendar features sexy human ladies parodying your favorite fandom characters for 14 months!This calendar will have a sfw and a sexy edition, depending on what you pledge and your pledges also unlock special hidden features as well as items! (whooooo, mystery~)
Digital EditionDigital editions will include high resolution digital copies of the calendar and a desktop version. The Cutey Editions will include PSD\SAI files, sketches, videos and any other extras artists have collected.
Standard PrintStandard Prints shipped to you will be 8.5x11 full color.
Premium Print
Premium Prints shipped to you will be 13.5x19 full color.Standard base bonusButtons & bookmarks of artwork that have been featured in MLS or Cutey Confidential.
Milestone bonuses **
Special bonuses will be at tier levels that will allow you to gain access to merchandise. As the project increases funds, more merchandise options will be available through milestones. This means you will gain more selection as the project hits each milestone. This will allow you to customize what your calendar comes with to best match your personal taste and interest. Additional bonuses will be able to be purchased post project! There will be an offer to purchase extra bonuses at a discount for supporters at the delivery stage.Taxes & Shipping?None! No extra fees applied to your pledge unless you want to upgrade later on.

This is the list of wonderful artists involved in this project! All profits will support them for making this calendar come to life. The commission slots are for high pledgers only~.

With a Cintiq, you draw ON the screen, so your artwork retains certain qualities that I personally feel I can't achieve with a tablet. The Wacom Cintiq is an amazing tool that would benefit myself and my career for many years to come!What is Needed The Wacom Cintiq 22""HD will cost me $1899.00 + tax = $2126.88, rounded up to $2127.00 as the final total of funds I need to raise. All funds contributed will go directly to the purchase of the Cintiq. Rewards for your support!As a thanks for your support, everyone who contributes will receive artwork in return! Every amount counts, and different price ranges have different rewards. $1 =

<h4>The Jungle Gym</h4>
<p>The bar jungle gym will inhabit the cozy space between the houses.  Over the course of the summer, this will change shape, varying between more geometric forms to more organic ones.  These bars also fit into the larger bar system holding the sunshades down popup path. Designed for children AND Adults!<br/></p>

<p><b>There are 4 major design components of the POPUP Public Installation System.</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Canvas Sunscreens</b> - Long swaths and short bands of canvas and roping at varying intervals.  Each component is sown to slip onto the pipe</li>
<li>
<b> Pipe System</b> - A heavy-duty speedrail system, composed of schedule 80 galvanized pipe, clamps, and custom cuts.  Strong enough to lean, hang, and swing around on.  Sunshades and hammocks are suspended from the system.</li>
<li>
<b>Hammock Climbers </b>- Designed, printed, and sown by local artist and textile designer Julya Rosenberg;  These are not your typical hammocks.  They are pulled taught between bars and are strong enough to jump or roll over, yet still comfy for a brief respite.   Large and small, to accommodate one or two people. </li>
<li>
<b>Wood Timbers</b> - The basing of the system is large 12x12 timber beams locked into place by the bar system.  Configured for working, eating, lounging, and, of course, play! </li>

POPUP is a modular, portable playground for children and adults.  We travel around the country, popping up in parks, public and private spaces, schools, museums, and more.

Site

POPUP PUBLIC will be located in Nolan Park on Governors Island in NYC, just south of the Manhattan Ferry.  The design is composed of two major spaces--the Jungle Gym and the Playscape Path.  Consideration is given to entry points to Spontaneous Interventions and the location of the Little Free Library (see below).





The Jungle Gym
The bar jungle gym will inhabit the cozy space between the houses.  Over the course of the summer, this will change shape, varying between more geometric forms to more organic ones.  These bars also fit into the larger bar system holding the sunshades down popup path. Designed for children AND Adults!

Shading
Throughout the site we hope to install sunshades, to cast shadows on the bars and keep them cool  for use in the mid-day, high-heat summers.  They also will provide much needed shading for the social spaces along playscape path for visitors who choose to lounge or relax in the space.
