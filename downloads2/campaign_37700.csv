<p>Bonjour, je m'appelle Marc Desgagné et je suis technicien agricole, spécialisé en environnement. </p>
<p>J'ai 48 ans, marié, trois enfants et J'habite un petit village en banlieue de ville de Saguenay, au Québec, Canada. </p><p>Je fais appel à vous afin d'amasser la mise de fonds nécessaire au démarrage d'un projet qui me tient vraiment à cœur. J'y travail depuis plus d'un ans, partant de la plus petite partie possible, un bout de tissus vivant, dans un vase de Pétrie. </p>
<p>Mon projet consiste à utiliser des bâtiments désaffectés ( ancien séchoir à bois industriel, chambres froides désaffectées, ou autres),　afin de　produire 500 kg/semaine de champignons de spécialité, certifiés Biologique (Pleurote, Shiitake et autres) et ainsi créer des emplois.</p>
<p>À　partir de sous produits locaux, tel que de la pâte thermo mécanique de feuillus,  de granules d'avoine (sous produit de la fabrication de flocons d'avoine　pour consommation humaine) et de paille de céréales biologique, je prépare un substrat qui est novateur et qui favorise une croissance plus rapide des champignons.　　 </p>
<p>　Le projet repose sur les prémisses suivantes: </p>
<ul><li>　-　La consommation de champignons de spécialité est en croissance au Québec. </li></ul>
<ul><li>     - Les produits présents sur le marché proviennent de l'importation 　(Asie, États Unis, Ontario) et sont fatigués par le long voyage et les intermédiaires. </li></ul>
<ul><li>　-Les matières premières sont disponibles localement et à un coût abordable. </li></ul>
<ul><li>　-Des locaux sont disponibles et inutilisés. </li></ul>
<p><br/></p><p>L'appareil de productions sera constitué d'équipements industriels récupérés et adaptés. </p><p>La forme juridique sera une compagnie privé et sera incorporée au Canada.</p>
<p>Les sources d'énergie disponibles localement sont: Le gaz naturel, l'hydroélectricité　ou la bio masse.　　 </p>
<p>Pour l'éclairage des chambres de production, je compte utiliser un système d'éclairage à DEL. (Très peu énergivore.) </p>
<p>Une partie du chauffage se fera à partir d'un système à l'énergie solaire. </p>
<p>À　partir du financement amassé, je vais récupérer des équipements industriels en fin de vie utile, pour monter mes équipements de production. (Laboratoire, étuves, Autoclave, mélangeur, étagères, climatisation, ventilation, filtration, etc.) </p>
<p>Ces équipements sont disponibles localement, via des récupérateurs et à une fraction du prix des équipements neufs. </p>
<p>Le bâtiment que je veux utiliser est composé de 3 sections  indépendantes pouvant être subdivisé en trois chambres plus petites, offrant un potentiel de 9 chambres de production. </p>
<p>Le bâtiment est équipé d'un système de chauffage au gaz naturel et d'un système de ventilation de très grande capacité qui devront être adapter. Le climat des chambre sera contrôler par un système intelligent et des unités de contrôle indépendantes pour chaque chambre. </p>
<p>Dans un premier temps, en collaboration avec le département de biologie d'un établissement d'enseignement locale, je compte faire la multiplication de　tissue qui me serviront　à maîtriser la technique de production en substrat liquide.</p>

</div></div>","WHY?


Conservation International considers South East Asia as one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world. Seemingly endless varieties of flora and fauna inhabit the forest, river, mountain, marine and wetland ecosystems of this unique corner of our planet.
Many individuals, organizations and communites are already engaged in environmental education, conservation and preservation of this critical area. However, most work in isolation and their innovative work and inspiring ideas are not well known.
We would like that to change, and invite you to help make it happen!

HOW?
In June 2012, we will begin our journey; exploring Southeast AsiaÊ¼s biodiversity while riding bamboo bicycles from Thailand to Bali to shed a light on the creative and exciting work of individuals, organizations and communities that will inspire others into action for conservation!
Using YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, our blog, website and other media we will bring these crucial issues to the forefront for a network of concerned educators, students and citizens around the globe.
By becoming part of the GREEN Riders: Southeast Asia community you will be an active participant in the protection of these critically important natural resources on which we all depend.

<p>My name is Rue Mapp -- I am the founder of Outdoor Afro, and I am passionate about the great outdoors for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>Inspired by my family, I started Outdoor Afro in 2009 to share this passion using social media. The message quickly resonated with thousands of others from around the country who shared their own images and stories that affirmed African Americans do have a positive and historic relationship to nature.</p>
<p>In May of this year, we launched the Outdoor Afro Leadership Team that went to work connecting folks of all ages to nature right in their own backyards. Since then, team members from nearly every region in the US have altogether connected nearly 500 people to the outdoors through recreation and conservation activities.</p>
<p>In 2013 we want to <em>significantly</em> increase the number of people we connect to nature, and to accomplish this goal we need to provide greater professional development for the leadership team to enhance their outdoor skills (hiking, camping, birding, etc). </p>
<p><strong><em>Why is this important?</em></strong></p>
<p>In the face of alarming rates of obesity in the African American community, and the need for more people to care for our fragile planet to support its sustainability and local community health, we all need to get out and build a relationship with nature and the outdoors like never before.</p>
<p><strong>Please help us reach our goal of $15,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Outdoor Afro is about connecting more people to the natural world through fun and relevant outdoor experiences. And we know that people respond positively to leadership that reflects their community.</p>
<p>People need nature like never before. More people getting outside now means healthier people, communities, and greater stewardship for our precious natural resources our futures depend on.</p>
<p>With a start-up of volunteers and monthly training calls this year, we have successfully been able to organize nearly 500 people, from all around the country to be tomorrow’s Outdoor Afro leaders.</p>

<p>Our names are Marc and Cassie. We are two chronically sleep-deprived university students from Chicago with shared passions for travel, design, and creating impact (and trees!).

We can turn the tide on ""Colony Collapse Disorder,"" the name given to the modern phenomenon of disappearing honeybees. It's a race against industry. We must prevail, because--let's face it-- our comfort depends upon it. 

We are Rorie and Raine of Abundant Harvest Apiary in western Massachusetts. 
http://abundantharvestapiary.com/

We take pride in raising healthy bees to meet todays challenging conditions. We all thrive when honeybees thrive. Our future is intricately tied to the future of the honeybee-- literally and collectively. 

Raine & Rorie with Zeke. (Raine Brown)Synopsis:

Honeybee populations have been decimated in recent years by the introduction of systemic pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides. 

Honeybees and other flying creatures have also been compromised by EMF radiation associated with cell phones, cell towers, and Wi-Fi.

These challenges are not going away. Even if systemic pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides were banned outright today, much of our soil is contaminated with them from many years of use, and the half-life of these compounds can be twenty years or more.

The EMF radiation and Wi-Fi issues could perhaps be mitigated by using different frequencies, if we could get government and industry to acknowledge the issues and engage a national conversation to address them. Meanwhile, cell phone and Wi-Fi use are increasingly necessary components of our communications infrastructure--they're here to stay.
Therefore, honeybees and beekeepers need all the support and encouragement we can provide them in order for the bees to survive. Our health depends upon their health. Their ability to pollinate diverse food crops in a manner which keeps food prices stabilized supports our healthy eating habits. We can think of honeybees as today's canaries in the coal mines. Their air is our air, their toxins are our toxins. The quality of our food is indicated in the expression of their health.
It's about biodiversity and food security. (And cruelty, and hubris, and greed...)

Healthy replacement colonies, to replace honeybee hives lost to toxins and other environmental factors, are increasingly hard to come by. Many beekeepers are giving up. This dual trend of dying bees and declining numbers of beekeepers needs to be stabilized and reversed.
We raise healthy nucleus colonies to replace lost honeybee colonies, and we have a plan to expand our impact.

3. Support campaigns calling for comprehensive studies on the effects of EMF radiation and Wi-Fi on honeybees, other flying creatures, and on human health. It would be foolhardy to mistake the telecom industry's successes at burying the problem as an indication that there is no problem.
The Electromagnetic Radiation Policy Institute has links to many studies:  http://emrpolicy.org/news/headlines/

A closer look:

One in three bites of food is pollinated by honeybees. Big agriculture has turned to mono crops--along with systemic pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides--to make food production more profitable, at the expense of pollinators. Sick and dead populations of honeybees leads to sky rocketing food prices for consumers, and it's cruel. 

Rorie holding a frame of brood. (Raine Brown)
We've been studying so called ""colony collapse disorder"" intently for several years. Industry likes to suggest the reason for dying honeybees is a mystery, pointing to mites as the most likely culprit. 

Asian honeybees have been dealing with parasitic mites and associated viruses for over a century, and no doubt they will continue to co-evolve. The introduction of the varroa mite--along with their associated pathogens--to the Americas has dealt a crushing blow to our European honeybees.  

These populations are recovering, however, as they are interbred with their Asian, Russian and Carniolan counterparts. These foreign bees had already been introduced to the Americas because honeybee populations were decimated by modern agricultural methods, and the multi-billion-dollar California almond crop was at stake.Russian honeybee, apis cerana. (Azman)Although vibrant honeybee populations may die from mites alone, they also often learn to adapt--developing hygienic behaviors, such as regularly cleaning mites from themselves and each other. What's really killing them is the toxic soup of poisons designed to make crop production cheaper, at the expense of soil health, pollinator health, and human health. Weakened health compromises honeybee immunity, enabling opportunistic infections to take hold.

By breeding bees at organic farms and wild swamps, and by staying away from high fructose corn syrup (an industry standard for feeding bees, contaminated with residual pesticides) we are able to raise healthy, vigorous honeybees. 

Rorie with a thriving hive. (Raine Brown)Our market is bee keepers in the New York and New England region in the United States, where the growing season is short and conditions often harsh. The Northeast Region is also the last stop on the commercial pollination circuit, so bees brought into the area come with toxins and pathogens from a variety of crops and thousands of miles of stress. Once here, they pass on their pathogens to existing hives. Honeybee hive losses have occurred at alarming rates in recent years--as high as 75%--with some beekeepers losing all of their hives. The trend is not abating.

EMF radiation from cell towers, cell phones, and WiFi also plays a role in the vigor of honeybee hives. Please visit our web site to read the various studies we have posted there:  http://abundantharvestapiary.com/bee-health-2/ 

Although many beekeepers report no trouble with hives in proximity to cell towers, others report obvious issues, suggesting perhaps a change in frequency can alter the balance for a hive. Honeybees have proven to be exceptionally adaptive, although we need comprehensive studies to investigate frequency thresholds, issues associated with changes in frequencies, proximity to cell towers, etc.
As with all stressors, we believe adaptation is possible, and is incumbent upon honeybee health.

Rorie with a ""nuc.""  (Raine Brown)
We sell nucleus colonies (five-frame starter hives, also known as ""nucs"") to backyard beekeepers. Healthy replacement and starter hives have been increasingly hard to come by. We make every effort to expose our bees exclusively to organic conditions, safeguarding their health, vitality, and survival. 



Rorie splitting/growing a hive. (Raine Brown)
Our bees are raised with diverse genetics to encourage survival through hybrid strength. We believe that by promoting survivor lines of honeybees, the bees have a better chance of adapting to the increasingly adverse conditions faced by pollinators. We employ integrated pest management techniques to assist our bees in challenges with parasitic mites. Honeybees reproduce quickly, raising several generations of bees within a single growing season. It is possible for healthy bees to adapt to survive in adverse conditions. Our methods help honeybees thrive.

Other bee suppliers sell nucleus colonies from hives that have already made the pollination circuit, from almonds to fruit trees to cranberries. They are often weakened by pesticides, fungicides and herbicides used to treat these crops.
A few of our nucs, raised exclusively for the backyard beekeeper-- the key to honeybee survival. (Rorie Woods)
Many of our competitors have collapsed along with their hives and pesticide treatment regimens. These days, the inherent risks of beekeeping as a business model translate into very high interest rates when doing business with banks. 

This is why we're looking to crowd-sourced investment to help us grow and maximize our current capacity in nucleus colony production. Every penny we make from nucleus colony sales will be re invested in the business, so that we may keep providing healthy, vibrant nucleus colonies in a sustainable manner for years to come.Each new hive costs $200.-$300. to establish. We plan to expand our 4 current small apiaries to 6 medium sized apiaries, going from a few dozen hives to a few hundred hives. We'll be transporting breeding hives from New England in summer to Florida in winter. We economize where we can, making our own hive boxes when practical and trading pollination services for location rentals. Travel expenses are significant, though, at around $1500. per round trip, and we'll need to upgrade to a larger trailer to transport our hives and nucs, with our sights on a commercial flat bed truck.
One of our small bee yards. (Rorie Woods)

Please help us make the leap from a small scale apiary to a mid sized apiary capable of providing healthy nucs to many more beekeepers than we can service at our current capacity.

For every $10,000 we raise, we can produce another one hundred hives to distribute to backyard beekeepers. We'd like to raise $30,000 or more through this campaign. We set our campaign threshold much lower, because once we meet that goal indiegogo takes a smaller cut of the funds raised. All funds will enable us to establish more healthy hives and produce more nucleus colonies for distribution. 

A wild swarm, an indicator of honey bee health. Honey bees are inherently nonaggressive, and are least likely to sting when they are swarming.

No contribution is too small, and all will be gratefully appreciated. Although we're happy for large contributions, ANY amount will automatically enroll you for updates to our campaign, reminding you to spread the word to others who may be interested. This is a dual purpose campaign, to raise funds and to raise awareness.

Please help us foster robust honeybee populations.  Be sure to share this campaign with your friends, family, neighbors, and colleagues. Thank you.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hi everybody! Thanks for coming this far and actually
reading what this is about. </p>
<p>Well, it's about closing the loop for the mobile
industry, in Africa (Ghana, to start with). Because the mobile phone we all
love (OK, most of us) and that has given the world so much also has a downside,
which you find at the end of its life cycle. Because on the entire African continent,
recycling a phone is just not possible (due to the huge costs of a recycling
plant). Considering the hazardous (but some of it also valuable) metals and
components in a phone, the waste stream is really becoming a health and
environmental problem. That's why created awareness campaigns and started collecting
the scrap phones and bringing them to the world's best recyclers. 120.000
pieces so far. Now, we want to grow and reach the goal of 1 million
phones. </p>
<p>Care to help?</p>
<p>I worked at commercial and non-profit organizations,
but found that the combination rocks for me: social business. I think we
created a business model that only has benefits. It makes the mobile industry,
that's so important for Africa, greener and cleaner. If we can it happen in
Ghana, Africa is next, with around 150 million mobile phones being thrown away
every year!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The 30.000 euro is needed to fill a container with
scrap phones (around 100.000 of them). This quantity makes it worthwhile to
ship the phones. My partner, a Ghanaian that I have worked with in the last two
years, will collect the phones from phone shops, repair companies and people's
homes. We are the first to offer a practical solution to this growing problem!</p>
<p>While collecting the end-of-life phone, we also set up
awareness campaigns about the recycling of electronics, like we did in Uganda
(see: <a href=""http://bit.ly/PVaLvs)."" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://bit.ly/PVaLvs).</span></a> We
were the first to do this in Africa as well! Our approach is bottom up; help
people clean up their country and not wait for governments and multinationals
to finish their endless conversations about possible measures.</p>
<p>So, if we get 30.000 euro; we can finance scrap
collectors in Ghana to fill a container, and after that (with the revenues of
the metals in the phones), another one, and another... (if we get less than 30.000
euro, the money will of course also be used to collect scrap and I will work to
get the rest of the funds needed for a whole container, or ship a not fully
loaded one). </p>
<p>We do not pay out employees of our foundation, or use
this money for any of the costs we incur. Just to collect scrap and set up
awareness campaigns. I hope this will lead to people and companies becoming
involved in the electronic waste reduction and perhaps in 5 year lead to the
first recycler to start recycling complete mobile phones in Africa!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The mobile industry is delivering great value, both
social and financial, around the world and is getting countries like Ghana
connected to the world for the first time (fixed lines and internet cables did
not have the same impact in Africa as in other places around the world). But
with 600 million mobile users on the African continent, there should be some
ways to safely get rid of a phone, when it can’t be used anymore. But there isn’t…</p>
<p>Awareness on recycling and the need and opportunities for
mobile phone end-of-life processes need to become commonplace for people in

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We, at Orlando Green, have been working on this project for the last four years.  We have had the ups and downs of getting such a project off the ground.  This project, when up and running, will divert 200,000 tons of garbage away from landfill and recycle it, every year.  Every ton diverted saves 2.2 tons of carbon.  We will create electricity from the waste thus saving 200,000 tons of coal or oil from being used.  We will prevent 4,000,000 tons of Green House Gas emissions, every year, from landfill because of diverting that waste.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We need $15,000,000 to get this project started.  The total cost is $75,000,000 for the three full plant phases.  The recycling center is phase one and requires $15,000,000 in full to get it operational.  Permits are currently in the process of being applied for.  A site in Orlando identified.  Eager contractors, including the City of Orlando, looking for an alternative to landfill.</li>
<li>Phase two ($50,000,000) will be to manufacture the Synthesis Gas from Pyrolysis (cracking-like in a refinery) that will then be used as a fuel to power the generators that will produce the electricity.</li>

We, at Orlando Green, have been working on this project for the last four years.  We have had the ups and downs of getting such a project off the ground.  This project, when up and running, will divert 200,000 tons of garbage away from landfill and recycle it, every year.  Every ton diverted saves 2.2 tons of carbon.  We will create electricity from the waste thus saving 200,000 tons of coal or oil from being used.  We will prevent 4,000,000 tons of Green House Gas emissions, every year, from landfill because of diverting that waste.
What We Need & What You Get

We need $15,000,000 to get this project started.  The total cost is $75,000,000 for the three full plant phases.  The recycling center is phase one and requires $15,000,000 in full to get it operational.  Permits are currently in the process of being applied for.  A site in Orlando identified.  Eager contractors, including the City of Orlando, looking for an alternative to landfill.
Phase two ($50,000,000) will be to manufacture the Synthesis Gas from Pyrolysis (cracking-like in a refinery) that will then be used as a fuel to power the generators that will produce the electricity.
Phase three ($10,000,000) will be a tire recycling plant that will turn the waste tires into electricity.
We will create Carbon Credits that are traded worldwide.  A ton of coal used to create electricity generates 2.2 tons of carbon.  1 ton of garbage used to make electricity creates 2.2 Carbon Credits because we avoid using coal.  Become a part of a project that will let you see your benefits in the credits you will help to create.
All funds received through this campaign will be used in this project.   You will help to reduce the amount we need to borrow.

<p><b><u>Poaching</u></b></p>
<p>Commercial
poaching has become big business, thanks to the boom in populations and the
“new wealth” in Asia. Consumption of products derived from endangered species
is flourishing be it for ‘Medicinal’ purposes, trinkets and status symbols or
just simply to be on the menu. Subsequently rhino poaching has escalated
dramatically in recent years and is being driven by the demand for rhino horn
in Asian countries, particularly Vietnam and China, due to its use as a status
symbol to display someone’s success and wealth and in Traditional Chinese
Medicine. Although there is no scientific proof of its medicinal value, rhino
horn is still highly prized in traditional Asian medicine. It is ground into a
fine powder or manufactured into tablets as a treatment for a variety of
illnesses such as nosebleeds, strokes, convulsions, and fevers. Despite
intensive conservation efforts, poaching of this iconic species is still
increasing across South Africa and pushing the remaining rhinos closer and closer
towards extinction. If the killing continues at the same rate, we could see
rhino deaths overtaking births in 2016-2018, meaning rhinos will go extinct in
the very near future.</p><p></p><p><b><u>The Bigger Picture</u></b></p>

<h3>What life is like when the tap only flows a few hours a week</h3>
<p>Imagine that all the water you need in a month — all the water for everything except drinking —keeping your home clean, washing your dishes and clothes, showering, bathing your children — everything — only flowed out of the tap for a couple of hours each week.</p>
<p>You’d get really, really good at managing water. You’d treat every drop as though it were precious. On those days when the tap flowed, you’d fill every available vessel to have enough to last until it flowed again. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, those storage vessels are the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and the diseases they bring. Chikungunya, which causes debilitating fever and excruciating joint pain. Dengue fever, which can be fatal to children. And Zika, which can lead to the heartbreak of microcephaly in babies. Chemical insecticides don’t seem to be effective, plus they have their own dangers.</p>
<p>This was the reality for the people of a humble village in Honduras called Monte Verde . But not anymore.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Monte Verde’s success is historic and game-changing</h3>
<p>In three years, an international charity, a program developed by scientists, and community effort have eradicated mosquito production and mosquito-borne diseases in Monte Verde. It's the only instance we know of this happening anywhere in Latin America in decades. </p>
<p>Instead of using expensive, ineffective, and dangerous pesticides, the Monte Verde Project developed a system of biological control to eradicate the mosquitoes. The system works with two strategies: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Introducing baby turtles, young tilapia, and tiny shrimp-like predators called copepods to each household’s stored water. </i>These animals eat every mosquito larva. They’re very inexpensive and can do an excellent job if people know how to use them. </li>
<li>
<i>Developing a program to maintain these animals in the water storage containers. </i>Community volunteers have become citizen-scientists for mosquito eradication.

These amazing creatures are threatened with extinction, which is endangering the world's agricultural resources. Bees are responsible for pollinating roughly one-third of the crops grown in the United States. Without these critical pollinators, a vast portion of our edible plants would be lost.<div>
<br/><p>Scientists are working diligently to identify the cause of colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon in which worker bees abruptly disappear. In the meantime, bees are being threatened by the widespread use of toxic pesticides, hazardous bee hive removal processes and a lack of dietary biodiversity. <br/></p>
<p>AHBPA strives to save the bees by rescuing and relocating unwanted hives (our donation-based bee removal service is being replicated by others across Central Texas and the nation) and creating widespread awareness about the perilous situation they currently are in. We partner with schools, community gardens, Texas landowners, farmers and the Travis County Correctional Complex to promote bee education and bee keeper certification. Finally, we work to affect change in the Texas legislature to ensure the honey bee is protected. We believe that our legislative efforts will serve as a much needed example for other states to follow. </p>
<p>AHBPA is a very small non-profit with limited resources and huge goals. We are <b>seeking funds to expand operations</b>, which includes hiring additional bee wranglers to work in and around Austin, Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth. We also need funds to <b>cover basic operational costs</b>, such as office equipment and money to pay office employee salaries. This campaign focuses on these very basic needs; future campaigns will target larger goals. </p>
<div>
<h2>Existing Legislative Success</h2>
<div>We are proud of the legislative success we have had in the past and look forward to helping enact further bee-friendly changes in the near future. With your help, we can allocate funds to help us move forward with efforts to make the honey bee the official pollinator of the state of Texas, create educational requirements for bee handlers and bee removal experts in Texas and create a higher level of protection for the honey bee in Texas. </div>
<div>It is AHBPA's hope that our current and future legislative successes will serve as a template for other states to use to protect one of our most valuable pollinators.<br/>

</div></div>","Bee the ChangeWhat's the Buzz?The American Honey Bee Protection Agency (AHBPA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to saving the honey bees. These amazing creatures are threatened with extinction, which is endangering the world's agricultural resources. Bees are responsible for pollinating roughly one-third of the crops grown in the United States. Without these critical pollinators, a vast portion of our edible plants would be lost.
Scientists are working diligently to identify the cause of colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon in which worker bees abruptly disappear. In the meantime, bees are being threatened by the widespread use of toxic pesticides, hazardous bee hive removal processes and a lack of dietary biodiversity. 
AHBPA strives to save the bees by rescuing and relocating unwanted hives (our donation-based bee removal service is being replicated by others across Central Texas and the nation) and creating widespread awareness about the perilous situation they currently are in. We partner with schools, community gardens, Texas landowners, farmers and the Travis County Correctional Complex to promote bee education and bee keeper certification. Finally, we work to affect change in the Texas legislature to ensure the honey bee is protected. We believe that our legislative efforts will serve as a much needed example for other states to follow. 
AHBPA is a very small non-profit with limited resources and huge goals. We are seeking funds to expand operations, which includes hiring additional bee wranglers to work in and around Austin, Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth. We also need funds to cover basic operational costs, such as office equipment and money to pay office employee salaries. This campaign focuses on these very basic needs; future campaigns will target larger goals. 

Existing Legislative Success
We are proud of the legislative success we have had in the past and look forward to helping enact further bee-friendly changes in the near future. With your help, we can allocate funds to help us move forward with efforts to make the honey bee the official pollinator of the state of Texas, create educational requirements for bee handlers and bee removal experts in Texas and create a higher level of protection for the honey bee in Texas. 
It is AHBPA's hope that our current and future legislative successes will serve as a template for other states to use to protect one of our most valuable pollinators.

The following outlines the legislative success we have already had:

ORDINANCE NO. 20120322-019
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING CITY CODE CHAPTER 3-6 TO PROVIDE FOR THE RELOCATION OF WILD OR ABANDONED BEES THAT DO NOT THREATEN HUMAN OR ANIMAL HEALTH OR INTERFERE WITH THE NORMAL USE OR ENJOYMENT OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROPERTY.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AUSTIN:
PART 1. Section 3-6-22 of the City Code (Destruction of Wild or Abandoned Bees) is amended to read as follows:
§ 3-6-22 DESTRUCTION OF WILD OR ABANDONED BEES.
(A) The health authority will order relocation of bees described in Subsection (B) (1H3) if the relocation of the bees can be done without threatening human or animal health or interfering with the normal use and enjoyment of public or private property.

What Makes us Special?

We are a very unique entity in the pest control service industry that targets a niche market of bee hive removal. We are also the only company in Texas that can say we do this on a non-profit structure which allows to be used as a public service for local communities that can't afford the cost of ""professional"" bee removal or extermination.

<p>Extreme Energy is the ""bottom of the barrel"" kind of oil and gas projects. Many of the last pristine areas on earth are within Indigenous lands. Extreme energy includes fracking, tar sands, and deep sea off-shore drilling. Indigenous Peoples bear the brunt of extreme energy development through loss of land, clean water, and clean air. Many still live sustainably off the land.</p>
<p><span>We are raising money to bring an Indigenous delegation of First Nations and Alaska Natives living at ground zero of Shells fracking, tar sands mining-the largest human development project on earth; and proposed off-shore drilling. Your donation to this campaign will help with airfare so four Indigenous People can attend the Royal Dutch Shell Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the shareholders in The Hague, Netherlands on May 21st, 2013.  </span></p>
<p><span>Our goals are for Indigenous leaders to speak for themselves, to hold the shareholders accountable and put a human face to the impacts of extreme energy development. With your help we will bring international attention and remind the world there are better options than extreme energy development that destroys Indigenous communities!</span></p>
<p><strong>$8000 is our goal!!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We want to pay for travel for four Indigenous People to travel from Alaska, Northern British Columbia, southwestern Ontario and Northern Alberta. Because the areas people are traveling from are more remote and not major metropolitan areas the airfare will cost the most! We hope to raise $2000.00 per person. </span></li>
<li><span>If we were to raise more than our goal? Which would be amazing! Those funds would go to additional travel costs such as food, lodging, and ground transportation. </span></li>
<li><span>If we dont raise our goal? We wont be able to send as many delegation members. But with your help we are hopeful that that wont happen!</span></li>

</div></div>","Extreme Energy is the ""bottom of the barrel"" kind of oil and gas projects. Many of the last pristine areas on earth are within Indigenous lands. Extreme energy includes fracking, tar sands, and deep sea off-shore drilling. Indigenous Peoples bear the brunt of extreme energy development through loss of land, clean water, and clean air. Many still live sustainably off the land.
We are raising money to bring an Indigenous delegation of First Nations and Alaska Natives living at ground zero of Shells fracking, tar sands mining-the largest human development project on earth; and proposed off-shore drilling. Your donation to this campaign will help with airfare so four Indigenous People can attend the Royal Dutch Shell Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the shareholders in The Hague, Netherlands on May 21st, 2013.  
Our goals are for Indigenous leaders to speak for themselves, to hold the shareholders accountable and put a human face to the impacts of extreme energy development. With your help we will bring international attention and remind the world there are better options than extreme energy development that destroys Indigenous communities!
$8000 is our goal!!

We want to pay for travel for four Indigenous People to travel from Alaska, Northern British Columbia, southwestern Ontario and Northern Alberta. Because the areas people are traveling from are more remote and not major metropolitan areas the airfare will cost the most! We hope to raise $2000.00 per person. 
If we were to raise more than our goal? Which would be amazing! Those funds would go to additional travel costs such as food, lodging, and ground transportation. 
If we dont raise our goal? We wont be able to send as many delegation members. But with your help we are hopeful that that wont happen!

The Impact


First Nations and Alaska Natives are leading the way forward to a future free of fossil fuel development through protecting their lands, way of life and culture. This is super strategic because its not just for Indigenous communities but for all people. We all deserve to have clean air and water. To live free from sickness like cancer which is an epidemic in some communities due to their high level of exposure to development pollution. 
With support from partner non-profit organizations such as UK Tar Sands Network, the Indigenous Tar Sands Campaign, 
Delegation members include:
Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation- (ACFN) is a Denesuline community based in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. Its territory spans and includes lands within the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, the Lower Athabasca and North West Saskatchewan planning regions. Members of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation hold rights that are protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Since time immemorial and long before ACFN entered into Treaty, Denesuline Peoples of its region lived and continue to live and sustain themselves, their families and their community from Mother Earth and all that she provides. Industrialization of ACFN’s traditional territories has lead to the cumulative removal of lands, wildlife and fish habitat as well as the destruction of ecological, aesthetic and sensory systems. This will consequently affect Treaty promises, cultural and spiritual renewal, procurement of resources, and Denesuline Peoples connection and use of landscape that is integral to traditional use.
This industrialization has thrust the ACFN to the forefront of the tar sands controversy. Canada and Alberta’s elected leaders have been promoting tar sands development on ACFN traditional lands at a pace that appears irresponsible and irreparably destructive. The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN) filed suit against Shell Oil Canada in September of 2011. Papers were served to Shell executives in November.

<h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
<p>Social Venture Africa together with the NGO <a href=""http://www.villageexchangeinternational.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Village Exchange Ghana</a> (VEG) and the charity <a href=""http://www.knowyourplanet.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Know Your Planet</a> (KYP) wants to train young Ghanaian women to produce small, cheap and low-tech solar power devices. The pilot project focus on basic electrical training, the production of 200 solar-powered phone rechargers and the development of prototypes for other small devises such as lamps and radios. Using the crafting skills of young mothers employed by the local NGO VEG, we aim to produce stylish devices that are sold locally. In the medium run, we aim to transform the pilot project into an economically self-sustainable business.</p>
<p>SVAfrica together with VEG will organise a two week workshop in February 2014 to train a group of women. T<span>he workshop leader is from KYP and t</span><span>he training will take place in the premises of VEG in Ho, Ghana.</span></p>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>SVAfrica believes that the key for development and life-quality improvement is to create local opportunities that are economically sustainable rather than simply provide devices free of charge. With our project we bring training, employment and empowerment for vulnerable women. Moreover we support the local economy by sourcing part of the material from local producers and by creating a new market with a high potential demand.</p>
<p><span>Although electricity is available in Ghana across most areas, many households in the rural villages of the Volta region do not have access to electricity because it is too expensive. </span>Nevertheless almost everybody owns a cell phone. <span>Recharging the cell phone battery is, however, costly. Villagers need to walk to a recharging point, which is time-consuming and expensive. Recharging only twice a week costs up to $2 a month! </span>Our estimate is that less than three months of recharging fees would pay for a solar-powered cell phone recharger! Last but not least, our project is environmental sustainable: the PV panels used to produce the devises are scrapped material that KYP recycles from European Producers.</p>
<p>More details on our project's impact can be found on <a href=""http://www.SVAfrica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.svafrica.org</a>.</p>
<h3>WHO WE ARE &amp; WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>We are a group of economists in our early 30s with a special bound to Africa. We founded the non-profit initiative SVAfrica after a life changing trip to the Volta Region in Ghana where we volunteered for the NGO VEG. <span>Once back home the warmth, enthusiasm and willingness to act for development we witnessed in Ho and in the surrounding areas prompted us to work further for the development of our project</span>. The mission of SVAfrica is to promote women's empowerment and to develop local economies in Africa by introducing sustainable market-based solutions.</p>
<p>For this project we have joined forces with two highly experienced and successful partners: the Ghana-based NGO Village Exchange Ghana (VEG) and the charity Know Your Planet (KYP). VEG<span><span> has been supporting the local communities of the Volta Region since 2003 with social micro-finance, health education and by creating a successful social enterprise called Lady Volta which gives work to young mothers. VEG will provide the base for our training and we will employ its local network as a distribution channel to sell solar-powered devices. KYP</span><span> is an international provider of solar power solutions. It also invests in research and development of cheap solar power kits for developing countries which have already been successfully introduced in Kenya.</span></span></p>
<p>On our homepage <a href=""http://www.SVAfrica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.svafrica.org</a> you can learn more.</p>
<p>We need to raise 5500 € to jump-start the project! We will spend the money in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>700 € electrical material provided by KYP (PV panels, wires, connectors)</span></li>
<li><span>300 € local material (wooden frames and glass sheets)</span></li>
<li><span>3300€ transportation costs and local accommodation (flight from London, UK to Accra, Ghana and transport from Accra to Ho in the Volta region and accommodation in Ho for KYP workshop leader and SVAfrica responsible)</span></li>
<li><span>300 € production, local marketing and distribution costs</span></li>
<li><span>400 € follow-up</span></li>
<li><span>500 € other costs (Indiegogo and credit card fees, perks) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Our and our partners' work, time and expertise are fully donated. </span></p>
<p><span>If we exceed our goal, we will use the additional funds to scale the project and run a second workshop next winter to introduce new product lines such as solar powered lamps and radios. In the unlucky event that we do not meet our target we will keep the donated money and use it to cover the project costs in the following order: material, production, flight for KYP workshop leader, flight for SVAfrica responsible, other expenditures.</span></p>
<h3>WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>As a thank you for your donation you can receive exclusive hand made African perks which vary with the amount donated. You will be part of this adventure no matter how big your contribution and receive timely updates on the state of the project.

<h3>The Gist Of It</h3>
<p>In order to empower the residents of the Slocan Valley to make our water clean again, we need help to bring two experts in community bioremediation, Anita Burke and Leila Darwish, </p>
<p>On July 26, <a href=""http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2013/08/07/Jet-Fuel-Spill/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a tanker fell into a local creek</a> emptying 32,000 litres of fuel into Lemon Creek and the Slocan River.</p>
<p>We'd like it cleaned up.</p>
<p>Thousands of us depend on this water for drinking, bathing, irrigation, providing water to farm animals, and swimming. Tens of thousands of feet of shoreline and the corresponding ecosystem has now been contaminated.<br/></p>
<p>Remediation outfits have been brought in by the fuel transport company to remove the bulk of the fuel but, at the end of the day, they don't live here. The Do Not Use order on the river has been lifted, the cleanup companies are packing up to go home, and pools of jet fuel remain in logjams, back eddies and side pools.</p>
<p>Help empower us to do the job right. Help us to do it together. As a community.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who Are These ""Experts"" Anyway?</h3>
<p>Both Leila Darwish and Anita Burke have had many years of experience working with remediation companies and affected communities to help clean up environmental disasters. We think that their differing skill sets will be complementary, helping us to diversify our approach to cleaning these waterways.</p>
<p><b><b>Anita Burke</b></b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Anita has worked to help organizations design, develop and implement sustainable businesses for over twenty five years. Anita spent seventeen years working at Shell and its subsidiaries, focussing on increasing environmental health and safety in the refining industry. Her projects there included advising and designing implementation programs for the CEO and senior leadership team on issues such as climate change, sust<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ainable development policy, and c</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">orporate social responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In
2003, Ms. Burke founded The Catalyst Institute, an organization that has
provided strategic and tactical guidance on climate and sustainability programs
to multinational corporations, governments, universities, and small to medium
sized businesses. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Ms. Burke
currently is a board advisor to a number of start-up companies in Canada, United
States, and in Mexico. Anita also advises several US based energy companies on
building long term sustainable business practices.</span><br/></p></span><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Anita has been a lecturer at Beijing University, and the University of California Santa Barbara. She has also teamed with the Rocky Mountain Institute to design and implement a sustainable development program for Anglo American’s South African enterprises. Anita is a global traveler, and recently moved to Colorado from Vancouver. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Leila Darwish</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Leila is the author of the recently published Earth Repair, a book specifically designed as a handbook for grassroots bioremediation. <a href=""http://earthrepair.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check it out here.</a></p>
<p>Leila Darwish is a community organizer,  permaculture practioner and rabble rouser with a deep commitment to environmental justice, food sovereignty, and to providing accessible and transformative tools for communities dealing with toxic contamination of their land and drinking water. She is the author of the upcoming book “Earth Repair: A Grassroots Guide to Healing Toxic and Damaged Landscapes”, which will be released by New Society Publishers in June 2013.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, she has worked as a community organizer for different environmental organizations and community groups in Alberta, BC and the USA on campaigns such as tar sands, fracking, nuclear energy, coal, climate justice, water protection, and more.  She has also given workshops on grassroots bioremediation and earth repair for a diversity of groups and organizations, such as Langara College, The Victoria Compost Education Centre, The Purple Thistle Youth Cooperative, The Radical Mycology Convergence, The Urban Farmer Field School, and The Cowichan Land Trust.</p>

<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Where Does The Money Go?</b></span></font></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Both Anita and Leila are going to try to make it our here to offer at least one workshop. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">No matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">That said, we think that they both deserve to be paid for their work. We also hope that we can offer them enough that they will be able to afford to stay longer and reach offer more workshops and to different demographics in the valley.</span><br/></p>
<p>If money is left over after paying both Leila and Anita for all the time they've spent here teaching, advocating, researching and empowering, we hope to use the extra funds to pay for any equipment we need for the bioremediation process.<br/></p>
<p><b>No matter what, all funders will receive a detailed report of how the money is spent.</b></p>
<h3>How To Support The Cause</h3>
<p>Just click the pick Contribute button at the top of the page and pick an amount that you would like to donate.</p>
<p>We've set the goal to $1500 but only because if we meet our goal, more of your money goes to the cause and less to Indiegogo. We'd love to raise double that -- or more. As mentioned earlier, if money is left over after paying both Leila and Anita for all the time they've spent here teaching, advocating, researching and empowering, we hope to use the extra funds to pay for any equipment we need for the bioremediation process.</p>
<p>It would have been nice to have the time to put together perks for donators, but this feels pretty time sensitive. We hope knowing that you've helped clean up one of the few places left in the world where people can still get their drinking water from the nearest creek or river is enough.</p>

Leila Darwish

Leila is the author of the recently published Earth Repair, a book specifically designed as a handbook for grassroots bioremediation. Check it out here.
Leila Darwish is a community organizer,  permaculture practioner and rabble rouser with a deep commitment to environmental justice, food sovereignty, and to providing accessible and transformative tools for communities dealing with toxic contamination of their land and drinking water. She is the author of the upcoming book “Earth Repair: A Grassroots Guide to Healing Toxic and Damaged Landscapes”, which will be released by New Society Publishers in June 2013.
Over the last decade, she has worked as a community organizer for different environmental organizations and community groups in Alberta, BC and the USA on campaigns such as tar sands, fracking, nuclear energy, coal, climate justice, water protection, and more.  She has also given workshops on grassroots bioremediation and earth repair for a diversity of groups and organizations, such as Langara College, The Victoria Compost Education Centre, The Purple Thistle Youth Cooperative, The Radical Mycology Convergence, The Urban Farmer Field School, and The Cowichan Land Trust.

Where Does The Money Go?
Both Anita and Leila are going to try to make it our here to offer at least one workshop. No matter what.
That said, we think that they both deserve to be paid for their work. We also hope that we can offer them enough that they will be able to afford to stay longer and reach offer more workshops and to different demographics in the valley.
If money is left over after paying both Leila and Anita for all the time they've spent here teaching, advocating, researching and empowering, we hope to use the extra funds to pay for any equipment we need for the bioremediation process.
No matter what, all funders will receive a detailed report of how the money is spent.
How To Support The Cause
Just click the pick Contribute button at the top of the page and pick an amount that you would like to donate.
We've set the goal to $1500 but only because if we meet our goal, more of your money goes to the cause and less to Indiegogo. We'd love to raise double that -- or more. As mentioned earlier, if money is left over after paying both Leila and Anita for all the time they've spent here teaching, advocating, researching and empowering, we hope to use the extra funds to pay for any equipment we need for the bioremediation process.
It would have been nice to have the time to put together perks for donators, but this feels pretty time sensitive. We hope knowing that you've helped clean up one of the few places left in the world where people can still get their drinking water from the nearest creek or river is enough.

<p>We are a pair of Masters students from South Africa and the United States who met at the University of Oxford. We are completing our fiedlwork in rural Ghana studying   the relationship between forest elephants and people! We are asking for your help to fund our dissertation fieldwork!<br/><br/>Our original Indiegogo goal was $1,000 dollars, which we are humbled to have met. Our ultimate goal is full funding of the project. Our current best estimate is $4,000 for us both.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bethanygoodrich.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/sincekidstxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our study site is in South Central Ghana on the outskirts of Kakum National Park in the villages on the northern boundary. Kakum is home to a variety of strange and wonderful creatures, the famous canopy walkway, some of the last intact rain forest in West Africa and importantly for us, the endangered forest elephant.</p>
<p>African forest elephants are highly endangered. Research published this year suggests that forest elephants in central Africa have suffered a 60% decline in number in the last ten years. This loss is fueled mainly by habitat loss, poaching for ivory, and retaliatory killing. Elephants have large range requirements and frequently venture outside of protected areas, in addition people who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods often go into protected areas. This means that people and elephants come into contact and this often results in conflict. Crop raids around Kakum can result in a family loosing and entire crop in one night, this can have devastating consequences for both communities of humans and communities of elephants.</p>
<p>But interactions between elephants and people shouldn’t be as conflict, which is where our research comes in. Lynsey will be exploring the possibility of using community-based conservation to reduce the costs of elephants on people and improve the conservation status of elephants in the region. Bethany will be investigating the role cocoa farming plays in human elephant conflict.</p>
<p>During our year on the MSc in Biodiversity, Conservation and Management at the University of Oxford, we have learnt so much from so many different people; we believe that we can make a real contribution to reducing human-elephant conflict in Ghana. We have conviction in the importance of our work, and we hope you agree. We are humbly asking you to please help fund our fieldwork.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>On a student budget our 5 weeks of fieldwork is going to cost quite a bit. We need to finance flights ($800), visas ($150), accommodation, food, malaria medication ($50), transport from Accra to Kakum and to the rural villages each day, and a translator to help us with our interviews. The many uncertainties associated with this type of fieldwork mean we don’t know exactly how much it’s all going to cost at this point. We are estimating that it will amount to about $2,500 each. We both have some funding from Oxford ($450 each) and the rest of the trip will be paid for by our ever-increasing student loans, so any donation would help!</p>
<p>Our original Indiegogo goal was $1,000 dollars, which we are humbled to have met. Our ultimate goal is full funding of the project. Our current best estimate is four thousand dollars for us both. Our campaign will continue for the duration of our fieldwork and we will update with our costs.</p>
<p>To say thank you for your donations we will be sending you once-off original Ghana inspired art. Our friendship is not only bound by our love for conservation, we both enjoy photography and fine art and will be drawing and photo-documenting our journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a $10 donation we will send you a digital photo taken in Ghana and thank you note</p>
<p>For $20 we will send you an A4 limited edition, high resolution photograph print on high quality photo paper</p>
<p>For $25 we will send an A4 limited edition print of one of our original drawings </p>
<p>For $40 we will send you an A4 original drawing done by us in Ghana and thank you note</p>
<p>For $60 we will send you an A4 photograph and drawing collage and thank you note</p>
<p>For $100 we will send you an A3 photograph and drawing collage done by both of us together, a thank you note and maybe even some famous Ghanaian chocolate or some other little present!</p>
<p>Of course you are welcome to donate any amount without choosing a gift, and donations can be anonymous if you prefer. </p>
<p>Samples of our work from other inspiring places are shown below to give you a taster of what your donation would get you. If you have a preference of whose artwork you receive, or if you would like to swap around gifts (ie. you would prefer to receive more photography rather than a drawing or collage) please let us know!</p>
<h3>Bethany's Work Samples</h3>
<p>I have both professional and academic experience in photography and the fine arts. My creativity was fostered at quite an early age and I have apprenticed under my mother (who is a long-time professional photographer) for my lifetime. </p>

We're not in the business of making money, we're interested in spreading ideas, in furthering discussion, showing the world what civilization is, what the domestication process does to us and to our world, and finding ways to resist it. </p>
<p>     Black and Green Press goes back to the year 2000, after the worldwide anti-globalization and anarchist resistance scenes were making headlines through property destruction and riots in the wake of every global political/economic power meeting during the day with earth and animal liberation groups lighting the stage at night. While traditional activist tactics wore out, untraditional anarchist targets were being exposed by digging at the roots of civilization. As big as capitalism can be, it didn't create this world, it just became the current face of it. <br/>     So we pushed the envelope. First through zines, pamphlets, and Species Traitor, an insurrectionary anarchist primitivist journal, which grew to a book size and format within 4 issues. In 2010, B&amp;G published Kevin Tucker's <i>For Wildness and Anarchy</i> and John Zerzan's <i>Origins</i>.</p>
<p>     And things are heating up again. <br/>     So far in 2014, we have our first novella, Natasha Alvarez's <i>Liminal</i>, press-bound. Quickly following on it's hells we have Kevin Tucker's <i>Roots: A Field Guide to Anarcho-Primitivism</i> and we've just announced our new bi-annual magazine, <i>The Black and Green Review</i>, with a decisively discussion/debate focus. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The entirety of the funding we seek goes directly to publishing. We have no paid staff, we have no office expenses. Our goal is to get Black and Green Press self-sufficient to ensure that we can keep putting out publications. There are a lot of projects in the discussion phase right now and we want to see them happen. </p>
<p>     The perks listed below include current and previous Black and Green Press titles. For the most part, we are using this campaign to get pre-orders (for individuals and wholesale) as well as get subscriptions for <i>The Black and Green Review. </i>Other perks might come along, but the main goal is to cover our primary printing costs so that we can keep things rolling without having to spend years trying to come up with the funds. </p>
<p>     The Indie Go Go campaign that we ran for <i>Liminal </i>was hugely successful. We greatly appreciate everyone that helped make that happen. This current campaign directly includes two different B&amp;G projects, <i>Roots</i> and <i>Black and Green Review, </i>since we hope to run them pretty much side by side. Your contribution here isn't just helping us get these titles into a physical format, it's to help ensure that Black and Green can keep titles like this coming. </p>
<p>     The goal we've set is high, but these projects aren't cheap. Not hitting our goal won't keep us from getting these projects out, but it will certainly help us get to where we need to be and getting there faster. The less time we spend working on fund raising, the more time we can spend writing, editing, and preparing these kinds of titles. </p>
<p>     A direct benefit of hitting our goals is that if we can substantially cover our costs through donations, we can greatly reduce the cover price on our books and get them in more hands. Generous donations made it possible to drop the cover price of <i>Liminal</i> $2. Donations in any amount directly impact our ability to spread these ideas. </p>

The goal here is lower than the amount we will actually need to ensure that we hit it and Indie Go Go takes a smaller amount of that total. <br/>     Put simply, everything helps, and the more money we raise through this, the more we can get out in the long haul. </p>
<p>     Knowing that money isn't always the easiest way to help, our hope is that if you don't have funds and are interested in pushing these debates and titles, you can at least help us spread the word as far and wide as possible.

BAGR is an anarcho-primitivist magazine meant to create a format for debate and discussion within the AP and green anarchist milieu. The format is a handful of essays, a moderated debate, essays ""for discussion"", action review, reviews, letters, and more, all with the intention of driving the discussion of civilization, wildness, and the struggle against domestication. For more information, click here.
  Other Ways You Can Help We are running this campaign for 60 days, which is the maximum amount of time allotted. The goal here is lower than the amount we will actually need to ensure that we hit it and Indie Go Go takes a smaller amount of that total.      Put simply, everything helps, and the more money we raise through this, the more we can get out in the long haul. 
     Knowing that money isn't always the easiest way to help, our hope is that if you don't have funds and are interested in pushing these debates and titles, you can at least help us spread the word as far and wide as possible. The more successful these campaigns are, the more we can put out for the world to see and the more accessible we can make it. 
     If you wish to contact us outside of Indie Go Go, you can email us at blackandgreenpress (at) gmail [dot] com.     Thank you!     For wildness and anarchy,

Sound a bit like paradise? That’s because it sort of is! For humans AND dolphins alike. The mangrove-fringed waters of <b>Dolphin Bay </b>are home to a small population of bottlenose dolphins, many of which are <b>year round residents of this ecologically productive, sheltered bay</b>. Playful and social, the Bocas dolphins attract boatloads of tourists to Dolphin Bay each year.

The Bocas dolphins captivate the human imagination… and they keep the tourists coming back year after year. This frequent exposure to dolphin watching boats might actually be contributing to a <b>decline in the dolphin population</b>. Since 2004, we have documented avoidance behavior and other negative behavioral responses in dolphins exposed to tour boats and we suspect that dolphin tourism could be displacing dolphins from their preferred habitat of Dolphin Bay. Sound harsh? Well, we think so!

One of the most popular attractions is a <b>dolphin watching tour to Dolphin Bay</b> where tourists are almost guaranteed intimate encounters with the area’s resident dolphins.  <p></p>The <i><b>problem</b></i> is that the Bocas dolphin population is<b> </b>estimated to be small<b> </b>(about 100-150 individuals) and many individuals remain in Dolphin Bay for life. These animals can be repeatedly exposed to tour boats over time and are at increased risk for <b>cumulative effects of boat disturbance</b>.

Who are we?We’re a team of conservation scientists with the Bocas Dolphin Project, a research initiative of Panacetacea, a non-profit organization 
dedicated to the study and conservation of whales and dolphins of Panama. We study bottlenose dolphin behavioral ecology, bioacoustics, genetics and human impacts in Dolphin Bay, Bocas del Toro, Panama to inform long-term sustainable tourism practices and conservation of the resident bottlenose dolphin population.  We have been studying this population of bottlenose dolphins since 2004. In 2007, our research team and the Bocas del Toro community joined efforts with several NGOs in a campaign to protect the Bocas dolphin population from capture by an international company who planned to harvest individual animals for display in captive aquaria and dolphinariums. The data collected by our research team provided strong evidence that the Bocas population is small and that removing individuals would have been detrimental to its long-term health . Now the dolphins are facing other conservation challenges and we are enlisting YOUR generous support to help us protect them once again.A brief summary of what we plan to do:We will be traveling to Bocas del Toro, Panama in the summer of 2014 to investigate the impacts of boat-based dolphin tourism on the bottlenose dolphin population of Dolphin Bay, an important ecological habitat and mother-calf nursery for dolphins and a tourism hotspot. Our research is interdisciplinary, community-oriented and aimed at long-term conservation of dolphins in Dolphin Bay through the integration of science and community action.Our Project Goals (in a nutshell):
To continue our behavioral, acoustic and genetic research into the Bocas dolphins to further our scientific understanding of this unique coastal population's behavioral ecology and the long-term impacts of dolphin-tour boat interactions.

To enhance and expand our dolphin surveys through the use of Conservation Drones.
To bridge the gap between science and the Bocas del Toro community through partcipatory research, environmental education and community-based conservation initatives.

To implement a long-term conservation management plan for dolphins and develop sustainable dolphin watching practices in partnership with the local tourism industry and other community stakeholders.

As an international research team with Latin American origins and heritage (we are collectively from Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Panama, and the United States), we are committed to helping conserve the Bocas dolphins in partnership with local stakeholders including the local tourism industry, indigenous communities and local NGOs through scientific research, community-based conservation planning, outreach and education.  Click on our names to learn more about us!

Get updates and learn more about our work at  http://www.bocasdolphins.com/!What is the Bocas Dolphin Project about?The island archipelago of Bocas del Toro, located on the northwestern Caribbean coast of Panama, is a biodiversity hotspot boasting turquoise waters, coral reefs, mangrove swamps and tropical rainforests. Sound a bit like paradise? That’s because it sort of is! For humans AND dolphins alike. The mangrove-fringed waters of Dolphin Bay are home to a small population of bottlenose dolphins, many of which are year round residents of this ecologically productive, sheltered bay. Playful and social, the Bocas dolphins attract boatloads of tourists to Dolphin Bay each year. This place was nicknamed Dolphin Bay for a reason—because tourists are pretty much guaranteed dolphin sightings year round in this pristine habitat. But tourists aren't the only ones who love these dolphins. The various adjacent indigenous communities of the archipelago have co-existed with the dolphin community of Bocas del Toro for hundreds of years, sharing marine resources and scenery with these amazing marine mammals.Come join us as we explore the ecology of the Bocas dolphins through science AND nurture the ancient connection between local communities and their dolphin neighbors through community-based conservation and education!    Our project represents an interdisciplinary approach to the study of dolphin ecology and conservation, thus our goals are both scientific and community-oriented. As scientists, we will investigate the behavioral ecology of the Bocas dolphin population through studying their acoustic and behavioral communication, habitat use, movement patterns and genetics to build a strong case for their conservation. As community organizers, we will help bridge the gap between science and community by educating local school children about the importance of marine conservation, involving the local community in our research and decision-making processes, integrating traditional ecological knowledge into management planning and collaborating with the local tourism industry on development of sustainable tourism practices.  By contributing to our project, you will have the exciting opportunity to support conservation science within a community context and experience firsthand the rewards of community-based conservation in action. Essentially, YOU will be empowering US to help preserve both the biological and cultural diversity of the Bocas del Toro archipelago for future generations by promoting community connections to science, stewardship of marine resources and a socially and ecologically responsible wildlife tourism economy.Why Bocas del Toro?Because there is trouble in paradise. What the indigenous people of the region have known for centuries, international tourists are now only beginning to understand. The Bocas dolphins captivate the human imagination… and they keep the tourists coming back year after year. This frequent exposure to dolphin watching boats might actually be contributing to a decline in the dolphin population. Since 2004, we have documented avoidance behavior and other negative behavioral responses in dolphins exposed to tour boats and we suspect that dolphin tourism could be displacing dolphins from their preferred habitat of Dolphin Bay. Sound harsh? Well, we think so! That’s why we are on a mission to understand the impacts that dolphin watching boats are having on the long-term health of the Bocas dolphins.The Dolphin-Tourist DilemmaThe colorful and bustling Bocas Town on the main island of Isla Colon is a haven for international tourists seeking surf, sun and adventure among the diverse breaks, jungles and reefs of the Bocas del Toro archipelago. Local tourist companies sell hundreds of tour packages to tens of hundreds of international tourists each year. One of the most popular attractions is a dolphin watching tour to Dolphin Bay where tourists are almost guaranteed intimate encounters with the area’s resident dolphins.  The problem is that the Bocas dolphin population is estimated to be small (about 100-150 individuals) and many individuals remain in Dolphin Bay for life. These animals can be repeatedly exposed to tour boats over time and are at increased risk for cumulative effects of boat disturbance. Currently, many tour boat operators do not comply with national commercial whale watching guidelines and routinely engage in aggressive encounters with dolphins to please their dolphin-happy customers.   For example, boat operators will encircle dolphins to entice them to surf the wake of their boats (YouTube video here). This is fun times for dolphin watchers but dangerous business for dolphins who have been seriously injured by boat propellers. Sadly, five calves have already been killed by boat collisions. But speed isn’t the only problem. Engine noise disrupts the acoustic communication of dolphins and impacts social behavior--this effect is especially dangerous for mothers with calves who rely heavily on sound to maintain contact with their babies.Our Impact Plan: What we plan to do and why:
Collect high resolution photographs of dolphin dorsal fins to build a photo-identification catalog of the population.
This will help us estimate dolphin abundance in
Dolphin Bay and establish a conservation management plan for the
population  

Document dolphin sighting locations and movements with GPS technology.
This will help us learn more about dolphin habitat use so we can identify important protected areas for dolphins

Collect acoustic and behavioral data of individuals and groups to evaluate effects of dolphin-tour boat interactions.
Dolphins
 can be negatively impacted by engine noise and intrusive boat 
encounters; these data will help us determine the level of acoustic and behavioral disturbance within this population.
                          
Collect tissue biopsies of individuals to perform microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA analyses.
The
 Bocas dolphin population is small and possesses low genetic 
diversity; genetic studies will help us determine the sex of individuals
 and the genetic profile of the population to establish conservation 
management units. 

Implement the newest technology for aerial surveys: Conservation Drones! A video camera mounted on a small drone will allow us to view the subsurface dolphin behaviors from an aerial vantage point. 

Dolphin
 behavior is very hard to study as dolphins spend most of their time 
beneath the surface of the water; aerial video observation is an 
exciting new research tool for learning more about subsurface dolphin behavior and dolphin-tour boat interactions.

solar modules (Photovoltaic) can be overcome by incorporating motifs
and designs into the array.  The task is to use Photovoltaic Modules as
an artist's medium.  

This project mosaic is of Arizona's Four Peaks Mountains with a moon, coyote, and saguaro.  
This 7 KW system produces 60% of the home’s electrical energy
needs.    The black solar modules are fitted with thick aluminum
sheets to produce curves that form the artistic detail.   Under panel L.E.D.
lighting will back light the motif in the evenings. 

Artist InstallerI am a sculptor and environmentalist. 
 I have been painting and sculpting my whole life.  Several years ago
I started learning about Photovoltaic via Santa Monica College and doing volunteer
installations with Grid Alternatives.   Many of the residential solar
installations have been placed on Habitat for Humanity homes.   These all have
been traditional solar installations.   I want to expand the use
of Solar Modules by illustrating the use of Solar Modules as a
functional art medium.

<h3><span>The Cause:</span></h3>
<p><b>Protecting Haiti's coral reefs through “immersion learning.""</b></p>
<br/><p>The severely overfished reefs of Haiti are being overgrown by slimy algae because there are not enough fish to eat the algae. But there is hope because the biodiversity remains high – the imbalance can be cured naturally if the fish are allowed to grow to maturity and reproduce. Reef Check prides itself on implementing economically sustainable and ecologically sound solutions. Areas of the sea need to be set aside where fishing is banned to allow fish to return, grow and reproduce. They in turn will eat the algae and in a few years the coral reefs will return to their former glory. Given the large numbers of Haitian fishermen, incentives will be required to gain their support and participation for setting aside some coral reefs as Marine Managed Areas (MMAs). Fishermen could then also catch more fish outside these areas. But how to gain their support?</p>
<p>The key is the kids. In Haiti, over 95% of the people do <b>not know how to swim</b>, and there is no marine science taught in schools -- therefore they know very little about the underwater world off their coast. By training kids (6 to 16) to swim, snorkel and start to learn basic marine biology, we will start to change how Haitian families talk and think about the ocean. The kids come home and tell their parents about how reefs can repair themselves naturally and reef fish will return. We have done this at La Caleta marine park in neighboring Dominican Republic and the fish came back in 2 years. By getting kids excited about the ocean, we can gain the support of fishermen’s families to better manage this renewable resource resulting in more fish and more jobs.</p>
<p>In a few years, some of these students can enter Reef Check's EcoDiver Program, where we <b>train university students to become citizen scientists so that they can monitor coral reefs, </b>track their health and how that <b>affects the health of their</b> <b>economy</b> and <b>their future</b>. Starting with 600 applicants from Haiti’s top universities the 32 trainees are now PADI certified scuba divers and Reef Check EcoDivers.</p>
<h3></h3>Recently, the government declared two new marine parks and already two Reef Check EcoDivers have been hired to help manage them. Other graduates will join the tourism industry and create a more diverse economy that depends on seeing big fish not just eating them. But first we need to teach the kids to swim and get the fishermen on our side... and <b>we need your help.</b>

<p>Clayoquot Salmon Investigation (CSI) is our salmon farm watchdog program. <strong>During COVID the Department of Fisheries has cut monitoring, making this grassroots program more important than ever before</strong>. And now, Cermaq (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp.) has towed a new experimental fish farm into Millar Channel near Ahousat, posing new threats that must be monitored and exposed.</p>

<p>Our fish farm monitoring program, Clayoquot Salmon Investigation (CSI) gets out on the water near Tofino. We keep an eye on this polluting industry, which otherwise operates out of sight, out of mind. <strong>We've been able to expose stories which no-one would have heard about</strong>, such as mass die-offs, viral outbreaks, sea lice epidemics; and we get those stories in the news to build political pressure.</p>
<p>Our Going Viral project (powered up by our 2019 Indiegogo!) was able to expose the fact that <strong>all but one salmon farm tested in Clayoquot Sound was contaminated with the deadly Norwegian Piscine orthoreovirus</strong> (PRV).</p>
<p>We travel deep up Clayoquot Sound, year-round in all weather, to collect samples and monitor what's happening on the ground. This year, we'll be paying special attention to the new experimental farm, and how we can minimize its threat to wild salmon.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Clayoquot Sound is the largest and most famous ancient rainforest left on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The Clayoquot Summer blockades of 1993 which stopped the chainsaws were the largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>'The War of the Woods' in Clayoquot Sound—Canada's largest-ever act of civil disobedience.</i></p>
<p>Yet all of this is being put at risk by open-net pen salmon farms. Wild salmon runs which used to return to spawn in the tens of thousands, now only return in tens. If wild salmon go the way of the dodo, wildlife will starve and so will the forests.</p>
<p><strong>Clayoquot Salmon Investigation shines a spotlight on the local face of the global salmon farming industry</strong>. In past we have been successful in breaking media stories about Creative Salmon’s tainted bloodwater discharge into Tofino Harbour; as well as Cermaq’s mass die-off, a sea lion massacre, on-going sea lice epidemic (three years running), and their controversial chemical warfare to manage their sea lice crisis. <strong>We were able to pressure the BC government to investigate all pesticide use on fish farms in BC, as well as all blood water discharge from fish processing plants</strong>.</p>
<p>All of these stories in the news are turning people off salmon farming. A 2018 poll showed almost 75% of British Columbians want salmon farms removed from the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>And now the momentum has begun!</strong> In 2018 Washington state banned salmon farms from their waters by 2022. British Columbia announced in 2018 that salmon farms will be removed from the Broughton Archipelago by 2022. <strong>Canada's government pledged in 2019 to transition from open-net pen salmon farms to closed containment by 2025</strong>. And now in 2020, B.C.’s First Nations Leadership Council (FNLC) is calling for an immediate end to marine-based salmon farming in the province.</p>

</div></div>","Overview
Wild salmon in Clayoquot Sound are rapidly sliding towards extinction—only 2 Chinook salmon returned to spawn in Tofino Creek last year. We're working hard to save wild salmon!
Fish farms are having major impacts on wild salmon populations. But momentum is building to get salmon farms out of Clayoquot Sound. We need you to help to make this happen.
Clayoquot Action is a longstanding defender of what makes this place so special. Our founders have over 35 years experience in local waters.
Support this campaign to help keep Clayoquot Sound wild and majestic. These are salmon forests. We are salmon people.

What We Need & What You Get
Clayoquot Salmon Investigation (CSI) is our salmon farm watchdog program. During COVID the Department of Fisheries has cut monitoring, making this grassroots program more important than ever before. And now, Cermaq (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp.) has towed a new experimental fish farm into Millar Channel near Ahousat, posing new threats that must be monitored and exposed.

Retrieving farmed fish samples from Cermaq's Hydrolicer on a fish farm near Tofino
Our fish farm monitoring program, Clayoquot Salmon Investigation (CSI) gets out on the water near Tofino. We keep an eye on this polluting industry, which otherwise operates out of sight, out of mind. We've been able to expose stories which no-one would have heard about, such as mass die-offs, viral outbreaks, sea lice epidemics; and we get those stories in the news to build political pressure.
Our Going Viral project (powered up by our 2019 Indiegogo!) was able to expose the fact that all but one salmon farm tested in Clayoquot Sound was contaminated with the deadly Norwegian Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV).
We travel deep up Clayoquot Sound, year-round in all weather, to collect samples and monitor what's happening on the ground. This year, we'll be paying special attention to the new experimental farm, and how we can minimize its threat to wild salmon.

We've made the national news several times exposing fish farms awful environmental record

</div></div>","Support the 2015 I Sea Change Expedition! Ahoy! My name is Orestis Herodotou and I'm part of the crew for the 5Gyres 2015 Sea Change Expedition. We're sailing from Bermuda to NYC to collect samples of plastic pollution in the Atlantic. Help us share what we learn and empower action around the world to keep our oceans healthy and end single use plastic waste!

The Expedition



We'll be aboard the Mystic, a 170 ft schooner tall ship. She's a beauty, but don't expect a leisure cruise. We'll be hard at work collecting data (plastic pieces!) with our special ""manta"" trawls, which are special nets designed to catch even the tiniest plastic particles. The measurements we take will further help scientists understand how our oceans and ocean wildlife are affected by plastic pollution, and make our models and estimates on the amount and location of the plastic more accurate. We've learned that plastic doesn't just float on top of the ocean, so we're also using vertical trawling to see how things change the deeper we go. For more info check out the gallery tab above or sail over to the expedition website for details and see who else is aboard!

Your donation helps support my spot on the trip!
Here's a video from the 2013 expedition (with fun music): 



About Me











Hi! I'm Orestis. Some of my friends call me ""Island Time"". I live in the SF Bay Area and love to sail! I've been involved with several previous projects in the past like Project Kaisei, the Plastiki Expedition, and Spirit of the Sea, to raise awareness about ocean plastics and the dangerous impacts they are having our on marine ecosystems.I really enjoy teaching sailing and taking people out on the water, especially if it's their first time. I've worked as a youth sailing instructor, teaching kids all the skills they need to sail their own boat, and also helping them learn about ocean environmental stewardship. 
I've been a proud member of the world renowned CAL Sailing Club for several years, which is a local cooperative, volunteer run club in Berkeley CA that makes sailing accessible for everyone.I am very excited to be participating in the Sea Change Expedition. It has been dream of mine to be able to take part in some serious research efforts and help make a greater impact. My goal is to bring home an even deeper understanding of the issues surrounding plastic pollution, and help share with my local community by developing educational programs and citizen science projects that get more people involved with stopping plastic pollution.

Go Tell it on the Mountain
 Indigenous people I know well, friends of Baltazar, organized among 120 families in four communities to help themselves last year:  A community leader was given an opportunity by Ecuador's environment ministry to see sustainable water projects in Colombia.  Mariano Toazo came back inspired to help his friends. 
Families each dedicated one member daily to assist with manual channelization of Andean glacier melt water into a new reservoir to water their cattle. All permission for their communities' share of the water was granted by the environment ministry; the project is legally sound.
Their goal was to improve a community pasture, to raise more funds via higher milk sales to nearby Riobamba, to offer more livestock production in their part of the foothills, to achieve a sustainable food source for their children; the project is socially sound.
They achieved their goal, almost; no one helped them ensure that the project is environmentally sound.    The Final Challenge Enthusiasm cannot get them through their final financial planning:  Mariano's group was certain the environment ministry would guide them through the project, but it didn't happen. Their channels are eroding the fine, volcanic soils; they see the problem and they know the environment ministry cares as much as they do. But sadly, financial resources in government cannot be steered to community projects. I felt I could help and raised $5,000 from my retirement savings; the goal was 1000 m of PVC tubes and one valve to control water flow and seal it from eroding the delicate soils. I and others have the luxury of planning ahead.
Some in the poorer parts of the world plan for survival; they care about the earth, but cannot plan for the unforeseen problems. My friends didn't get into this bind on their own. Climate warming is drying their pastures and even threatening the glaciers that have up to now sustained life in the foothills.

I am hoping to count on my friends for the next $5,000 to safely carry the water the next 1000 m to Mariano's friends' pastures.
Protect the environment and the future for some wonderful families.     Thank you.

</div></div>","Hi! 

I am Natalie Swain, a senior at UC Berkeley and for the last two months I have been interning abroad at an NGO in Madrid, Spain called Asociación CONI. 
CONI's main goal is the
international cooperation for development in Guatemala, through:





The native support within comprehensive
development initiatives aimed at social promotion of disadvantaged population
groups such as women, children, indigenous peoples, youth at risk, etc.


The creation and strengthening of local
networks for training and promotion of human capital that is aimed at
generating sustainable and independent development.



What is this campaign for?
In a few words:
In my last three weeks as an intern at CONI I want to raise money to donate  120 HELPS Gravity Water Filters in order to help equip the 120 families living in Chahilpec with access to year-round clean drinking water.

In a few more words:
CONI has been working with the community of Chahilpec since 2013 after the director of the school there reached out to CONI for help designing a comprehensive development program. 


The first step of the program was to equip the school with all the basic necessities such as furniture, notebooks, backpacks, blackboards, pens, etc., and now that we have provided them with those materials, the next step in the Strategic Plan is the provision of safe drinking water,
both at school and at home. 


Currently the community is drinking rainwater, collected from the sheet metal roofs of their homes that are often oxidized, which leads to Chahilpec residents often drinking water which carries bacteria and would not be considered sanitary by any health standards.

There are 120 families who live in Chahilpec, and in order to bring clean drinking water to the whole community we must raise enough money to buy each family a 
HELPS Gravity Water Filter for families to be able to filter the water they currently drink from the roofs of their homes.
  
How much money is needed?
We need $4,320 to purchase 120 HELPS Gravity Water Filters in order to provide clean drinking water for the entire Chahilpec Community.


Each Gravity Water Filter costs $36 USD.
There are 120 families who live with unsanitary drinking water in Chahilpec.
Therefore, $36 x 120 = $4,320 goal.


Our Reach Goal



If we reach our goal and raise $4,320 we will continue to campaign and raise an additional $3,275 to buy a complete potable water system for the Chahilpec School.
The system includes pipes to run the water across the school grounds, hand sinks for the children and faculty, and toilets with running water from the filtration system to replace their current outhouses.





History of Chahilpec + CONI





The Families of the Chahilpec Community 


The village of Chahilpec is a community of Mayans living  in a rural area of Guatemala. There are 29,525 communities like this in Guatemala, who live far removed from the rest of the country (to give you an idea, they do not even speak Spanish, they only speak the Mayan language of their ethnicity: Q'ekchí'). The Guatemalan government does not have sufficient means to provide for all its people, so these communities often do not have access to basic health and education services.
About 120 families live in the community of Chahilpec, with just about 300 children, and only 58 of these kids were enrolled in school in 2013. The school had no resources, materials, or proper equipment, so in most cases parents preferred to take their children to work with them versus leave them in school.
In 2013, the director of the Chahilpec School, Pablo William, contacted CONI to ask for help. He had heard about CONI through another ongoing project a few miles away in another community. During the second half of 2013 there were two CONI technician visits to the community to understand their needs, and work with the parent committee on a possible collaboration. As a result of these visits, CONI designed in collaboration with the community, a comprehensive development program, with a term of 5 to 10 years.The plan aims to tackle various aspects of the residents school and home lives, which are ordered from highest to lowest priority in accordance with the vision the parents have for the community: school equipment, drinking water at school and at home, kitchen equipment for the high school, improved stoves (for cooking fire) in homes, equipment and training to provide a community health clinic (primary care clinic / pharmacy), build a module for school classrooms, equip the library with materials, construction of recreational areas and school sports fields, adult pre-professional training, implementation of a microcredit program and a revolving fund for productive projects in the community.


Our Progress in Chahilpec So Far:

In 2014, CONI began work on the Chahilpec Strategic Plan. In February, CONI received a grant from the Roviralta Foundation for €8,000 to equip the school with furniture, notebooks, backpacks, blackboards, pens, etc. The new materials had an immediate effect on school enrollment. After seeing the improvements done to the school, parents began to enroll their children in droves and today there is now 121 kids enrolled in the Chahilpec School, up from the 58 children enrolled  in 2013.

What if you like the work CONI is doing, but don't have money to give?

<b>A vision of simple action, solution, and community access.<br/></b>Our vision at Hives Across The Americas
 is to provide the general public with an opportunity to be part of the 
solution. By reaching out to create a renewed private, public, and 
commercial interest in both this 10 year epidemic of life loss, as well as 
helping to reintroduce to both the public and private sectors, the lost art of 
personal Bee Keeping, and provide healthy low cost organic and 
pesticide free pollination services for commercial fields and 
crops across the Canadian Maritimes, and Northeastern United States to 
start. That is just the beginning. Our intention is to provide a Bee 
Ranch and Preserve, a sanctuary if you
 will, where, with mother natures assistance and the utilization of our 
own acreage and bee keeping experience, we will organically grow and 
cultivate healthy Queen bees and their colonies utilizing  
Newfoundland Honey Bees, very probably the last vestige of healthy and pesticed free honey bees in North America. <div>
<br/><div>
<b>Reaching out to the public every way possible</b><br/><div>Hives Across The Americas will be active as a grass roots organization reaching out to the public and commercial interaction by reaching out publicly through 
community enthusiasm organizations, youth groups, agriculture groups and
 communities, street fairs and expositions, as well as other civic 
venues, which will allow us to create public and commercial interest, 
education, and knowledge of this global epidemic and the opportunity of 
solution based actions. We want all ages of men and women, girls and boys, private 
and commercial to have the opportunity to enjoy and reap the benefits of
 these amazing and delicate creatures.<b><br/><br/><b>How we are going to ""grow"" bees ?</b><br/></b>Our
 initial placement will include building up to approximately 700 home 
site bee hives within the Bee Preserve in which we will organically grow
 Queen Bees and their worker colonies. The expected population of bees in
 those hives will be approximately 20 to 30 thousand healthy, organically
 grown Newfoundland honey bees in each. We will also be reaching out and
engaged with local farmers and growers to provide low cost organic hives
 to their fields and crops providing all services including maintenance, 
relocation and transportation of those hives as well. Our initial start 
on commercial hives will be a build up to approximately 1500 off site hives.  <br/><br/>Along
 with the physical placement, Hives Across The Americas will be taking 
advantage of any opportunity to re-stimulate public interest, not only 
in the crisis we are now seeing, but also in the 
personal hives or hobby of Bee Keeping in the private sector, not 
leaving out commercial interest and applications as well. We can begin 
that public campaign by reaching out to civic and commercial venues to 
bring forth presentations at schools, agriculture youth groups, civic 
organizations, enthusiast groups, street fairs and farmers markets, agriculture businesses as well as farms.  Our goal will be to cultivate a desire
 to learn and carry on interest in the amazing world of the bee and all 
that it does for us as humans on this planet. <br/><br/><div style="""">

with chemicals. Another factor is the Varroa mite which lives on the 
bee itself as well as in the hive. These very same chemicals have created a
 very high tolerance in these mites which makes them almost impossible 
to kill. The Varroa mite is causing devastation within these hives thus
 ever increasing the spread and rate of Colony Collapse Disorder. These

they think of the illegal trade.</p>

being butchered alive and sold in an illegal meat trade, but don’t want to give
up your day job, become an activist, wave rainbow banners or write letters to
your local politicians?Great!  Because we have a solution that helps you
help us save these amazing creatures; without having to go any further than your
computer, laptop or smart phone….

What We Need...All you have to do is a
make a donation (of any size) to help us reach our target of $10,000 and we’ll
do the rest.  What’s the rest?  Well, we’ll fly around the country to ask
scientists, politicians, activists, tour operators and traditional owners their
thoughts on the unsustainable hunting of our sea turtles and dugongs, and what
they think of the illegal trade.
Sound boring? Well that’s
ok, because we’re also going to sneak around with night vision, film
the trade with hidden cameras, chase poaches around remote islands and creeks
in a busted up tinny and a few other cool things that we can’t disclose right
now…all to make sure our sea turtles and dugongs can stay safe and happy.
Okay, sounds good so far but where does the
money actually go?  Your money will help
us cover flights, accommodation and some equipment costs to make sure we get to
our interviews on time and into the trade hotspots.  Just to make sure your money goes even
further we won’t pay any of the crew and we’ll make them eat beans and rice for
days on end…..

couple of freaking amazing oceanic creatures from extinction and bumping up your ocean karma?  Well, that depends on how much you chuck in
the tin, but there’s heaps of unique prizes on offer here to get you started.Whats The Impact?This documentary aims to expose the truth about the unsustainable harvest of sea turtles and dugongs in Australia.  It seeks to question the role of traditional hunting in a contemporary setting and discover how or if it can persist into the future; without costing the existence of two incredible species.The campaign to follow will pressure the government, regulators and community groups to change current legislation, enforcement standards and conservation goals to ensure that turtle and dugong populations are safeguarded into the future.  By highlighting the flaws of our current system, and taking lessons from indigenous ranger programs abroad, we believe this campaign will be able to offer realistic solutions to the complex problems at hand.  Risks & ChallengesCan we promise that this one campaign will completely stop the slaughter of sea turtles and dugongs in Australia? No, but we can promise that this campaign will speak loudly for those that can not, and that we will fight tooth and nail to change the laws that currently allow for the slaughter.  Every movement must start with one voice, as every ocean must begin with a single drop.  Help us be the drop that saves Australian sea turtles and dugongs.Other Ways You Can Help Can't afford to donate?  Thats ok, there's plenty of ways you can help change the future for Australian sea turtles and dugongs.  Perhaps you could donate a skill set like web or graphic design or animation, be one of our film crew, provide free legal advice, be our eyes on the water and report any cruel or illegal activities through our Price Per Dozen website.Help spread the word by liking us on Facebook and encouraging others to do so, write to politicians asking them to ban the hunting of threatened and endangered species, start the conversation with friends and colleagues and get them onboard!Incentives       GoPro Black  Dave Williams Art                PADI Open Water Dive CoursePete Bethune - Whale Warrior               Dugong Art                               Mirage Snorkel Set                            Dive Torch                      Turtle Books (1 of 4)                                                                         Cristal D'Arques",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

These communities have incredibly important, on-the-ground knowledge and strategies, which can provide profound benefits to both our local and global adaptation and transformation efforts. These communities are creating the solutions, now we need to learn how to share them.</p><p><b>What's holding us back?</b></p><p>Unfortunately, the value of local knowledge and community-based adaptation efforts is often overlooked or misunderstood by planners, practitioners, and government.  In addition, small communities often lack the resources necessary to connect with these groups to finance, develop, and expand upon their efforts and knowledge.  Finally, communities are often limited in their capacity to share their knowledge with other communities. The result is that we are unable to learn from, share information with, or provide feedback to other communities engaged in similar crucial adaptation efforts.</p><p><b>What needs to happen?</b></p><p>1) We need to recognize the value of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, and community-based responses to climate change so they can become a part of our global climate change dialog.</p><p>2) We need to build the tools to connect practitioners and communities, so together we can develop strategic and replicable responses to climate change.</p><p>3) We need to build the capacity in communities to share and access important knowledge and information. This type of knowledge exchange will facilitate more rapid and effective climate adaptation.</p><p><b>How do we get there?</b></p><p>Our solution has three parts:</p><p>A Film - Designed with a general audience in mind, our documentary film will tell intimate, human-based stories of people and communities adapting their lives to a changing climate. Our film will follow successes, challenges, and demonstrate the inherent value of localized knowledge, indigenous perspectives, and adaptation efforts. And unlike many climate change films that lead with messages of fear, ours will lead with positive examples of success and hope. By offering practical and positive ways forward - those based on the efforts of everyday people - we hope to inspire people all over the world to take action in their own communities.</p><p>Toolkit - Geared toward planning and policy practitioners, as well as communities, our toolkit will facilitate a deeper understanding of how to support community-led climate responses from both sides. It will provide guidance to professionals not familiar with community-based climate responses, with the goal of developing more strategic approaches and replicating successful practices.  The toolkit will be published online and available for free for public use. </p><p>Media Trainings - Included in the documentary, and aimed at the community level, we will provide low-cost film trainings, to help communities share their stories and success around the world, to propel innovation, experimentation, and adaptation. This exchange of knowledge will help participants reduce the risks of climate change in their own communities.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/561551/files/20140506141026-peoplearesaying.jpg?1399410626"" src="""" style=""""/></p></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><p><b>Finally, the nice things people are saying about us: </b></p><p>Our Place on Earth was featured in Ensia Magazine in their ""notable"" section, alongside the great UN project Momentum for Change.  You can read the article here:  <a href=""http://ensia.com/notables/#notable9179"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ensia.com/notables/#notable9179</a></p><p>“Our Place on Earth has an incredibly strong vision.  With their workshops and toolkit, they’re focused on the value of community participation and engagement, which is absolutely critical.  And I like that they’re trying to do something different with their film – to document intimate, personal, and inspiring portraits of climate change success.  It’s so important to show people a positive way forward – to demonstrate solutions.  Please help them get this message out there.  It's one we really need to hear."" </p><p>- Mikell O'Mealy<br/><br/>USAID Climate Change Advisor</p><p>*******</p><p>""Humans have always had to experiment with ways to adapt and survive, and in the process we've generated extensive and sophisticated local knowledges about the human-environment relationship.  But now, with the scale of global climate change, the knowledge being produced through adaptation experiments all over the world needs to be disseminated as rapidly as possible.</p><p>Our Place on Earth promises not only to tell these promising adaptation stories through film and other media, but also to build a toolkit where case studies in adaptation can be accessed, modified, and then applied in other contexts.

What happens if we help you exceed your goal?Not only will we be elated, but the pledges that come in, after we exceed our goal, will go towards including more locations, holding more workshops and making it an even better film. We'll also include some awesome stretch goal rewards that we'll announce when we reach that point.   
A NOTE FROM THE TEAM – a little more about the projectWhat is out there?Right now, there are communities around the world adapting to the impacts of a changing climate. These communities have incredibly important, on-the-ground knowledge and strategies, which can provide profound benefits to both our local and global adaptation and transformation efforts. These communities are creating the solutions, now we need to learn how to share them.What's holding us back?Unfortunately, the value of local knowledge and community-based adaptation efforts is often overlooked or misunderstood by planners, practitioners, and government.  In addition, small communities often lack the resources necessary to connect with these groups to finance, develop, and expand upon their efforts and knowledge.  Finally, communities are often limited in their capacity to share their knowledge with other communities. The result is that we are unable to learn from, share information with, or provide feedback to other communities engaged in similar crucial adaptation efforts.What needs to happen?1) We need to recognize the value of local knowledge, indigenous perspectives, and community-based responses to climate change so they can become a part of our global climate change dialog.2) We need to build the tools to connect practitioners and communities, so together we can develop strategic and replicable responses to climate change.3) We need to build the capacity in communities to share and access important knowledge and information. This type of knowledge exchange will facilitate more rapid and effective climate adaptation.How do we get there?Our solution has three parts:A Film - Designed with a general audience in mind, our documentary film will tell intimate, human-based stories of people and communities adapting their lives to a changing climate. Our film will follow successes, challenges, and demonstrate the inherent value of localized knowledge, indigenous perspectives, and adaptation efforts. And unlike many climate change films that lead with messages of fear, ours will lead with positive examples of success and hope. By offering practical and positive ways forward - those based on the efforts of everyday people - we hope to inspire people all over the world to take action in their own communities.Toolkit - Geared toward planning and policy practitioners, as well as communities, our toolkit will facilitate a deeper understanding of how to support community-led climate responses from both sides. It will provide guidance to professionals not familiar with community-based climate responses, with the goal of developing more strategic approaches and replicating successful practices.  The toolkit will be published online and available for free for public use. Media Trainings - Included in the documentary, and aimed at the community level, we will provide low-cost film trainings, to help communities share their stories and success around the world, to propel innovation, experimentation, and adaptation. This exchange of knowledge will help participants reduce the risks of climate change in their own communities.Finally, the nice things people are saying about us: Our Place on Earth was featured in Ensia Magazine in their ""notable"" section, alongside the great UN project Momentum for Change.  You can read the article here:  http://ensia.com/notables/#notable9179“Our Place on Earth has an incredibly strong vision.  With their workshops and toolkit, they’re focused on the value of community participation and engagement, which is absolutely critical.  And I like that they’re trying to do something different with their film – to document intimate, personal, and inspiring portraits of climate change success.  It’s so important to show people a positive way forward – to demonstrate solutions.  Please help them get this message out there.  It's one we really need to hear."" - Mikell O'MealyUSAID Climate Change Advisor*******""Humans have always had to experiment with ways to adapt and survive, and in the process we've generated extensive and sophisticated local knowledges about the human-environment relationship.  But now, with the scale of global climate change, the knowledge being produced through adaptation experiments all over the world needs to be disseminated as rapidly as possible.Our Place on Earth promises not only to tell these promising adaptation stories through film and other media, but also to build a toolkit where case studies in adaptation can be accessed, modified, and then applied in other contexts. This is precisely the tool needed to transmit the new knowledge we must rapidly acquire if we hope to find equitable and just ways for the world's population to live on a hotter planet. ""-Stephen ZavestoskiPhD Sustainability Director College of Arts & Sciences Co-Chair, Environmental Studies University of San FranciscoProject team Nuin-Tara Key is a research and policy consultant in climate change and urban development. She is lead researcher for the practitioner’s toolkit and a technical consultant and producer for the documentary. Tom Miller is a filmmaker, artist, and owner of PrettyGoodProductions, a film production company with a focus on social justice issues.

<p>My wife, Carolina Barcelos Carneiro de Oliveira Miller died as a result of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) in August 2011.  She was only 25.  Like many, I wasn't aware that epilepsy could be fatal.  Carolina had been diagnosed with epilepsy in her teenage years and took medication daiy to supress any seizures.  In fact during our 5-6 years together, she only had 2 seizures, with one being tragically fatal.  Since that most horrific tragedy, I have been working tirelessly to raise epilepsy awareness in Carolina's honor.<br/><br/>I've come to find out that 50,000 people die in the US every year from epilepsy related causes. And that recent studies prove that 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy in their lifetime.  1 in 10 will have a seizure.  Very alarming numbers that need to be communicated.  Epilepsy isn't given the proper attention in terms of awareness and research funding.  Most people remain sorely limited in their knowledge regarding epilepsy while 65 million people live with it everyday.</p>
<p>And so everyday I work to change the way the worlds sees and understands epilepsy.  <br/><br/>I actively run a very successful Facebook page and series of concerts with international touring artists that are streamed all over the world.  That series is called Candlelight Concerts for Epilepsy Awareness.  In March 2013, it reached a national level with 50 Concerts in 50 States for Epilepsy Awareness and included such performers as Eric Clapton, Garbage, Colbie Callait, Aimee Mann, Rita Coolidge, Imagine Dragons, Macklemore, They Might Be Giants and literally hundreds more.  More info can be found on the website at <a href=""http://www.candlelightconcert.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.candlelightconcert.org</a> and on the Facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/candlelightconcert"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/candlelightconcert</a>, which has well over 10,000 likes at present and reaches over 200k people per week with the content published and produced.  Again, all in the name of raising awareness and spreading facts about epilepsy.  Also for the climb specifically - <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/epilepsyclimb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/epilepsyclimb</a></p>
<p>In August of 2013, on the 2 year anniversary, I ran the first <strong>Taking Epilepsy Awareness to New Heights</strong> campaign - and climbed Mt Kilimanjaro and ""turned it purple.""  I reached the summit on the anniversary of Carolina's passing.  Again, in the name of raising awareness.  Between my three Facebook pages, the updates of the journey reached tens of thousands of people - hopefully helping to inspire, teach, fight stigmas and move forward messages about epilepsy beyond the ""epilepsy community.""  On that summit date, hundreds of users also engaged the campaign by sharing images, changing their profile pictures to an image I'd created (""Today I'm Taking Epilepsy Awareness to New Heights"") and reached easily into the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>That effort was documented as the central theme in a documentary about epilepsy being created by Epilepsy Film/Brain Quake.  More on that to come.  The Director of Photography, Ayaz Asif, joined me on that journey.  His photography is simply stunning and many of his stills can be seen on Facebook at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/AyazAsifPhotography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/AyazAsifPhotography</a></p>

<p>It's my goal on the three year anniversary of Carolina's passing, to once again Take Epilepsy Awareness to New Heights.  Again with Ayaz documenting.  I'm hoping to lead a group of about 10-20 persons with epilepsy, epilepsy advocates, passionate supporters and caregivers this time (not doing it solo as with Kilimanjaro) along the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.  Machu Picchu is a 7 day trek and this funding campaign is for to tour and flight costs for myself and Ayaz.  We have the majority of the gear needed, but I'm including a very small budget for that as well, and adding in the % taken by IndieGogo.  Anything beyond what our expenses are, will be donated to the epilepsy charities I consistantly work with.</p>
<p> From the 2013 campaign...</p>

<p>This fundraising effort is specifically to cover our costs - travel (about $1500 *2), climbing group fees (about $1000 *2), equipment (about $400 *2) and incidentals.  We will NOT keep a single penny.  Any overages after costs will be donated to the various epilepsy charities I work with.</p>
<p>Please check out some of the perks that you would receive if you were so kind to support me in this effort.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In terms of awareness, this will be a significant effort.  As with the Candlelght Concerts for Epilepsy Awareness, I will shout this story from the mountaintops (quite literally) to all media outlets who will listen.  With the concerts, we've had coverage in all local Philadelphia/New Jersey media and some very high-profile pieces in USA Today and across many digital media outlets, both in the US and internationally.  We've been in print, on TV and on radio and continue to do so.  We're even featured in some upcoming documentaries about epilepsy. This will continue to tell that story - in the hope to really change the way the world sees &amp; understands epilepsy through more media coverage.</p>

<p>I will climb around the anniversary of Carolina's passing.  It's my hope to be at the summit on the anniversary, which is August 22nd as we did with Kilimanjaro in 2013.</p>
<p>I will release press releases, do interviews and take EVERY opportunity to talk to ANYONE and use this effort to share the facts and information about epilepsy.</p>
<p>I will also continue to promote very heavily and continuously on Facebook, which will reach people in the hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>We all want to live a good life. Most want to help create a better world. More and more are hearing the call to live in close relation with Nature, and to learn first hand what it means to provide for the very essentials of life: food and medicine, shelter, clothing, community.</p>
<p>By sheer Fortune or good Karma, we were given the opportunity to inhabit a small portion of our Mother Earth. We received the stewardship of 10 hectares of agricultural land in the Misiones province, in northeastern Argentina, where the world famous Iguazu falls are located.</p>
<p>We have settled this land with no facilities; there is no house, no electricity, gas stoves, or phone signal…. We do enjoy drinking pure spring water, firewood cooking, bathing in the river, and all the surprises that living outdoors entails.</p>

We all want to live a good life. Most want to help create a better world. More and more are hearing the call to live in close relation with Nature, and to learn first hand what it means to provide for the very essentials of life: food and medicine, shelter, clothing, community.
By sheer Fortune or good Karma, we were given the opportunity to inhabit a small portion of our Mother Earth. We received the stewardship of 10 hectares of agricultural land in the Misiones province, in northeastern Argentina, where the world famous Iguazu falls are located.
We have settled this land with no facilities; there is no house, no electricity, gas stoves, or phone signal…. We do enjoy drinking pure spring water, firewood cooking, bathing in the river, and all the surprises that living outdoors entails.
The garden is growing, as well as the fruits of our manual creative labor, as we learn to make our own furniture, shelter, even kitchen utensils!
Sharing our learning process is one of the main priorities, so the idea came to host a natural building workshop, in which we can reach out to locals.
People in this province –mostly from European descent- have not embraced the ancient wisdom of the original inhabitants of this land, the Guarani Nation. Specifically, no one builds with mud anymore… the norm is wooden plank houses, which offer no insulation against the weather, decay very fast in this weather, and add to the rate of deforestation of the region.
Even though it is a natural paradise, this is an impoverished province, and rural people struggle to meet their needs, seeing no options other than to cut down the jungle in order to grow highly chemicalized tobacco, tea and yerba mate, and monocultures of pine trees and eucalyptus.
 What We Need & What You Get
As we have dedicated our lives to this project, we have had to -temporarily- surrender other conventional modes of fundraising (e.g. jobs!).
In order to host the workshop, build a small cabin and take one huge step towards self-reliance, we will need some manual tools (enough for workshop attendants) and building materials (mainly sand, metal roofing, nails and such).
We are committed to building as much with natural materials as possible, harvesting what we can from where we are, such as the clay, stone, bamboo...
We are intending to grow enough food to supply for the people attending the workshops, so as the veggies grow we need to sustain ourselves and continue to buy seed and groceries...
One of the main goals is to establish a food forest to restore the fields, so some of the funding will go to buying fruit and native hardwood trees, always aimed at increasing the diversity.

<b>ABOUT US</b>
</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><a href=""http://www.gyccghana.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghana Youth Climate Coalition (GYCC)</a> is a youth led non-governmental organization
founded in 2011 with the aim of mobilizing, educating, inspiring and empowering
the youth to become agents of change and also advocate on climate change and
environmental related issues of concern in Ghana. </b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
Ghana Youth Climate Coalition is made up of a team of dedicated youth who have
a passion for the environment. Even
though the activities of the organization have mostly been self-funded, the
team’s passion for the environment has been a form of inherent motivation for in mobilizing a group of like-minded individuals to pursue projects and
activities to fulfill the objectives of the organization. <b>These successfully
organized series of projects predominantly aim at achieving environmental
awareness and education.</b> Notable among these projects are the
Green Initiative Tour, One Tree One Life Initiative and World Environmental Day
Celebrations, which have primarily been in the form of campaigning and
awareness creation, general clean up exercises and mass tree planting exercises
in the Ashanti Region and Some parts of Western Region. GYCC, which is now
one of the largest proactive youth led environmental organizations in Ghana, in partnership
with the Ghana Youth Environmental Movement (GYEM) and Technology without
Boarders-Ghana (TeoG) organized the Power-Shift Summit 2014 and the Recycle-up
Summer Camp 2014 respectively. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Power-Shift Summit 2014, was the largest
youth led environmental summit in Ghana, which brought together over 500
participants who were educated on how to take a stand for climate and
environmental justice in Ghana. The Recycle-Up Summer brought together 30
senior high school participants from different schools throughout the Ashanti
Region, who were trained and mentored to develop innovative solutions to the
current plastic waste management problems that Ashanti Region is facing. The
participants with the most innovative and feasible solutions were then given a
seed fund to start up their initiatives. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p><b>We are currently soliciting for support to expand the
scope of our activities to cover additional four regions in Ghana in the year
2015. Hence the Climate Change Awareness and Youth Empowerment, which will be
an all year project come 2015.</b></p>
<h2><b>WHY
CLIMATE CHANGE AWARENESS AND YOUTH EMPOWERMENT?</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p><b>One of the United Nations’
Millennium Development Goals states that “Environmental Sustainability” must be
ensured. We at GYCC believe that, ongoing education and awareness creation
around environmental issues is the only way possible to achieve this goal.</b>
Thus, the Climate Change Awareness and Youth Empowerment campaign will help
Ghana achieve a climate literate youth who will be proactive and innovative in
advocacy for climate fairness as well as in mitigating and adapting to climate
change in Ghana.</p>
<h2><b>WHAT
WE WILL ACHIEVE</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>We will build a network of youth activists
throughout the country through awareness creation and training seminars and
making available educational materials to target groups as well as forming and
engaging ""green clubs"" and chapters in second cycle institutions and tertiary
institutions throughout five regions in Ghana</b>, namely Ashanti, Northern,
Central, Western and Greater Accra Regions. We believe that, with a common
voice, we can also make key demands from our leaders for a more pragmatic
effort in dealing with climate change effectively. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Trees play an important role in addressing
climate change and assisting our agricultural areas to be more sustainable.
They can also assist in preventing salinity and soil erosion, provide shade,
shelter, food and habitat to native animals. <b>With your support, we hope to plant
one thousand (1,000) trees throughout the aforementioned five regions in Ghana.
</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>WHAT
WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></h2>
<p align=""justify""><b>We
at GYCC are doing this work on a volunteer basis just like how we have gone
about our previous projects. Many of us have already devoted not only time, but
personal resources from the very inception of the organization. However, we
cannot do it alone. </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p>Through this campaign, <b>we hope
to raise a total of $6000 to cater for not only the transportation of members
to and from 5 regions of Ghana but to also fund training, educational and
awareness creation materials which would be made available to target groups.</b>
A projector will be required to facilitate presentations and educational
seminars. <b>Part of the funds will be used for the tree planting exercise of
which its major expenses include the buying of one thousand (1,000) seedling to
be planted in various selected communities and schools and one hundred (100) sets of
planting implements</b> for the planting process as well as transporting
seedlings and volunteers to selected locations. Provisions for monitoring of
seedlings to make sure they grow well  will also be made.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
want you to be 100% assured that, your donation will result in noticeable
social and environmental change. To ensure this, our team will send you updates
on our progress via email. We want to extend our gratitude for your generous
support by offering unique perks for donations.</p>
<h2><b>OUR
CHALLENGE</b></h2>
<p><b>From
January through November 2015, GYCC will collaborate and partner up with
different groups throughout five regions in Ghana, to organize, educate, train
and recruit a generation of youth environmental activist</b>. GYCC will extend the
formation of Green Clubs and Chapters in various Senior High Schools and
Tertiary Institutions across the country. This will be a way of promoting youth
action against climate change at the grassroots.</p>
<p>The
project will eventually create a network of individuals drawn from second cycle
and tertiary institutions, other youth groups, networks and associations as
well as communities that are hardest hit by the effects of climate change, who
will work together to preserve the future for generations to come. </p>
<p>Our
task is no less than ensuring a sustainable future where a healthy environment
is the foundation for a sustainable economy and healthy communities. <b>Our past
experiences in related projects makes us capable of overcoming the challenges
that we shall face along the way. However, we cannot overcome all the
challenges without your support.</b> Will you donate to support youth leaders to take
a united and more pragmatic effort in achieving a green economy in Ghana?</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is the challenge?</strong></p>
<p> Despite the vital role as our planet´s life support system, the Amazon is still under threat from logging, mining and slash and burn traditions. Huge areas have been destroyed, and lack of resources force people to live on as little as $2 a day. Official statistics show that 60% of the children suffer from malnutrition.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>crees</strong> foundation is a conservation and sustainable development not-for-profit organisation, that works to reduce poverty and protect biodiversity in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Our mission</strong></h3>
<p>crees` sustainable community project was founded as a response to these challenges in the Amazon. Through a combination of local knowledge and scientific research, we seek to protect the biodiversity of the forest while helping the local community improve their health and living standard through sustainable practices.</p>
<p>With help from the local community leader Reynaldo Ochoa (-watch the video in our gallery!)  and the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, we have created a model that enables the community to benefit from the rainforest in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>Over the last three years the innocent foundation has helped us with our mission, but our funding ends March 2013. We have created a blueprint of our model, but to scale this up and inspire communities all over Amazon, there is a lot more work to do. That is why we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How do we meet the challenges?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We build biogardens</strong> with local families to combat malnutrition using sustainable practices. crees provides resources and knowledge to produce organic fresh fruit, herbs and vegetables, ordinarily not included in diets at all, in their own backyards. These go straight to the family table and provide extra income from the surplus. In stage two we want to support up to 30 biogardens with roofs protecting them from rain, leeched soil and flooding.</p>
<p><strong>We plant agroforestry plots</strong> with local farmers where native Amazon trees are planted alongside banana crops. This is a sustainable wood and crop production alternative, which conserves surrounding forest from logging activity, and protects species biodiversity. It also creates carbon credits that can be sold to provide a further income for the project to invest in more trees.  </p>
<p><strong>We build knowledge and capacity </strong>through one to one training and workshops on small enterprises, sustainability and resource management.</p>
<p><strong>We take the lessons learned </strong>with us into stage two. Now we want to strengthen the foundation of the project, and make expertise and resources more accessible by:</p>
<p>- Building a nursery that can house seedlings, fertilizer and provide a place where expertise and resources are readily available.</p>
<p>- Supporting the Technical Institute with a course in Natural Resource Management</p>
<p>- Helping families create a co-op for their agroforestry plots and biogardens - strenghtening internal cooperation and<span> enhancing revenue by collectively supplying local lodges and tourist establishments.</span></p>
<p>- Building roofs for up to 30 of the biogardens</p>
<p>- Planting up to 50 hectares of agroforestry plots</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So far we have:</strong></p>
<p>- Positively affected the lives of 500 people</p>
<p>- Built 57 biogardens</p>
<p>- Planted 15 agroforestry plots</p>
<p>- Planted 10,000 trees</p>
<p>- Positively sequestrated more than 55 tons of carbon from the atmosphere</p>
<p>- Undertaken one to one training and capacity building workshops that build local expertise</p>
<p>- Built biogardens with the local primary school and planted agroforestry plots with the local Technical Institute</p>
<p>We are well along the path to our ultimate goal, a self-dependent, economically and environmentally sustainable future for the Manu community. However, there´s still a lot of work to be done, and to make the community truly sustainable we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we can do with your help!</strong></p>
<p>We have finished stage one, which has been a milestone in itself. Now we need to ensure that the platform we have built is developed and ready to inspire others.</p>
<p>With your help we can scale up and:</p>
<p>- Plant up to 10 more biogardens a year</p>
<p>- Build up to 30 roofs for the biogardens</p>
<p>- Plant up to 50 hectares of agroforestry plots</p>
<p>- Kickstart the most commited families to create a co-op for the agroforestry plots and biogardens.</p>
<p>- Build a nursery where we can produce seedlings and organic fertilizer, a place providing readily available resources, tools, and expertise</p>
<p>- Hold more workshops to support local knowledge on sustainability, small enterprises and resource management</p>
<p>- Develop the local Technical Institute with a course in Natural Resource Management and Eco-tourism, supporting both general Peruvian and local expertise on sustainability</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By donating you will help generate healthier and more positive guardians of the forest, ensure sustainable development for the people of the Manu Biosphere Reserve, and enable us to fully develop our model of sustainable agriculture, so we can do our bit to create a more sustainable Amazon.</p>

<p>Plastic can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Yet even after that much time, plastic remnants can still plague our ecosystems. As plastic degrades it breaks into  tinier plastics called micro-plastics. These micro-plastics get into our food supply, fish, animals, and ecosystem in ways not seen to the human eye. In turn, they disrupt digestion and can sometimes cause toxic effects in living organisms. While recycling can help reduce this effect, it is not a consistent solution.     <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456379883/m8ygtc7imhn1iec4dzau.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Not many people recycle. In fact, 4 out 5 people don't recycle any items from their bathrooms. And even then, the items that do end up in a recycling bin rarely actually get re-purposed... Collecting recyclables isn't cheap either—it uses about 50 to 60 percent of the budget of a typical curbside recycling program. In addition, most recycling programs are costly, burn more energy for the trucks to pick up the recycled items, and take a long time to process. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456810196/mwl5uvqq3kqkj3ub4axb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Hi. My name is Benjamin Stern, and I am the CEO and Founder of Nohbo. On Friday, February 19th, I got the deal of a lifetime on Shark Tank with Mark Cuban. My journey first started 2 years ago when I was 14. The idea for a single use, bottle-less shampoo ball seemed so simple. I was shocked to find there was no one on the market selling this kind of product. So I sought out to make my own. I have learned that the process of starting a business requires a lot more than just an idea. It takes tenacity and courage to pursue a dream.</p>
<p>I ask of you the environmentalist, the traveler, the outdoorsman, and of course the bathers such as myself, to please help us fund this Indiegogo campaign, so we can change this industry for the better!</p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<b>What are the ingredients in Nohbo?</b><br/><b></b><p>Nohbo is made from sulfate-free and paraben-free materials. Our shampoo is made with all-natural ingredients derived from plants.</p>
<b>I recycle already. Why do I need Nohbo?</b><p>Great question! When one recycles a plastic bottle, only 10-20% of it can actually be successfully recycled. The rest ends up slowly decaying in landfills and oceans. Plastic bottle manufacturing also uses 25% of the world’s supply of crude oil, leading to an increase in global warming conditions. Our high quality, eco-friendly shampoo balls eliminate the need for further negative environmental impact because no plastic is manufactured for our products. Nohbo is also TSA-compliant, making it perfect for traveling!</p>
<b><b>How many Nohbo shampoo balls are needed to wash my hair?</b></b><br/>Nohbo balls are single-use, so only one ball is needed per shampoo wash.<br/><br/><b><b><b>I have long hair. Will one ball be enough? I have short hair. Can I cut a ball in half</b>?</b></b><br/>Only one Nohbo ball is needed to clean your hair. We also don’t recommend cutting a Nohbo ball in half, as the ball won’t create a good enough lather for a sufficient wash.<br/><br/><b><b><b>Is Nohbo safe for colored hair?</b></b></b><br/>Nohbo is sulfate-free, making it much softer on colored hair than typical shampoo.<br/><br/><b><b>Does Nohbo test its products on animals?</b></b><br/>No, Nohbo is an animal and cruelty free product, and its ingredients are derived from plant-based materials.<br/><br/><b>What do you have planned for Nohbo in the future?</b><br/>We are developing a conditioner ball, body wash ball, and shaving cream ball! With a successful launch on Indiegogo, we can ramp up development of these exciting products.<br/><b><br/><b>When will my Nohbo balls be shipped</b>?</b><br/>Mid to late summer 2016<br/><br/><b><b>Who should I contact for wholesale or media inquiries?</b></b><br/>Please use the contact form on our website at <a href=""http://nohboball.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nohboball.com</a>.<br/><br/><b>Why did your cost increase? </b><br/>Our cost increased due to our initial small order size but will decrease as the popularity of Nohbo shampoo balls grows.<br/><p></p>

No more of those nasty rings of who-knows-what accumulating under the bottles in your shower. With Nohbo, you don’t need a bottle at all. Just grab a Nohbo ball before your shower and use it like any other shampoo. It’s cleaner, easier, and better for the planet.




Nohbo takes the guesswork out of travel: 7 day trip = 7 showers = 7 Nohbo balls. It’s that easy. No more travel-sized plastic containers. No more worrying about bottles leaking in your luggage. Nohbo balls are always light and dry — take as many as you need!

Hiking with heavy liquids, you always risk ending up with a pack full of soapy clothes. Since Nohbo balls are dry until exposed to water, you can pack light and confident. Plus, you’ll leave your favorite places just as beautiful as you found them. Explore your world waste-free with Nohbo’s compostable packaging.
Why Nohbo?






Plastic can take up to 1,000 years to decompose. Yet even after that much time, plastic remnants can still plague our ecosystems. As plastic degrades it breaks into  tinier plastics called micro-plastics. These micro-plastics get into our food supply, fish, animals, and ecosystem in ways not seen to the human eye. In turn, they disrupt digestion and can sometimes cause toxic effects in living organisms. While recycling can help reduce this effect, it is not a consistent solution.     
Not many people recycle. In fact, 4 out 5 people don't recycle any items from their bathrooms. And even then, the items that do end up in a recycling bin rarely actually get re-purposed... Collecting recyclables isn't cheap either—it uses about 50 to 60 percent of the budget of a typical curbside recycling program. In addition, most recycling programs are costly, burn more energy for the trucks to pick up the recycled items, and take a long time to process. 




Hi. My name is Benjamin Stern, and I am the CEO and Founder of Nohbo. On Friday, February 19th, I got the deal of a lifetime on Shark Tank with Mark Cuban. My journey first started 2 years ago when I was 14. The idea for a single use, bottle-less shampoo ball seemed so simple. I was shocked to find there was no one on the market selling this kind of product. So I sought out to make my own. I have learned that the process of starting a business requires a lot more than just an idea. It takes tenacity and courage to pursue a dream.
I ask of you the environmentalist, the traveler, the outdoorsman, and of course the bathers such as myself, to please help us fund this Indiegogo campaign, so we can change this industry for the better!

Risks, Challenges, and Costs:


We will incur a lot of start-up costs to produce the Nohbo balls. Expenses will include distribution, packaging materials, and manufacturing costs. 

Our first trial runs have been successful, but require further investment to develop and perfect the correct composition of our product. 







FAQ:
What are the ingredients in Nohbo?Nohbo is made from sulfate-free and paraben-free materials. Our shampoo is made with all-natural ingredients derived from plants.
I recycle already. Why do I need Nohbo?Great question! When one recycles a plastic bottle, only 10-20% of it can actually be successfully recycled. The rest ends up slowly decaying in landfills and oceans. Plastic bottle manufacturing also uses 25% of the world’s supply of crude oil, leading to an increase in global warming conditions. Our high quality, eco-friendly shampoo balls eliminate the need for further negative environmental impact because no plastic is manufactured for our products. Nohbo is also TSA-compliant, making it perfect for traveling!
How many Nohbo shampoo balls are needed to wash my hair?Nohbo balls are single-use, so only one ball is needed per shampoo wash.I have long hair. Will one ball be enough? I have short hair. Can I cut a ball in half?Only one Nohbo ball is needed to clean your hair. We also don’t recommend cutting a Nohbo ball in half, as the ball won’t create a good enough lather for a sufficient wash.Is Nohbo safe for colored hair?Nohbo is sulfate-free, making it much softer on colored hair than typical shampoo.Does Nohbo test its products on animals?No, Nohbo is an animal and cruelty free product, and its ingredients are derived from plant-based materials.What do you have planned for Nohbo in the future?We are developing a conditioner ball, body wash ball, and shaving cream ball! With a successful launch on Indiegogo, we can ramp up development of these exciting products.When will my Nohbo balls be shipped?Mid to late summer 2016Who should I contact for wholesale or media inquiries?Please use the contact form on our website at Nohboball.com.Why did your cost increase? Our cost increased due to our initial small order size but will decrease as the popularity of Nohbo shampoo balls grows.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

I live with my family in a remote part of the Amazonas Region in Peru. For decades, we have been protecting 100 hectares of beautiful cloud forest, one of the most fragile and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Our conservation area is called the Berlin Forest Private Conservation Area (ACP Bosque Berlin). By protecting the forest, not only do we protect the rare plants and animals that live there, we also ensure the water supply for nearby communities.</p><p><b>Monkeys in trouble</b></p><p>But we are fighting an urgent threat. Just outside the borders of our protected area there is a 5 hectare patch of forest that is home to a family of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys, one of the most endangered species in the world and only found in this part of Peru. The monkeys have no way of leaving the tiny forest patch because a few years ago the surrounding forest was cut down and converted to pastures for grazing. The current owners of the forest patch say that they might cut it down to create more pastures. To make matters worse, at the beginning of 2014, poachers killed 5 monkeys, leaving behind only 6 members of the family. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/603760/files/20140525181539-Sam_Shanee.jpg?1401066939"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>However, there is still time to act. Beyond empathy for the monkey family, there are important reasons why we urgently need to protect them:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Since they are so isolated, they are easy to see and give us the unique chance to raise awareness among the local community about the importance of protecting this species in the wild. </b>Without local support, this species will disappear. Many of my neighbours don't even know how special and rare these monkeys are, nor that this species does not harm crops. I therefore want to create local pride for these monkeys, make clear that hunting them is not only illegal but will eventually make them go extinct, and that we have to protect our forests to give these and other animals their space to live.</li>
<li>
<b>The forest patch gives us an important chance to study them. </b>A big part of the challenge of protecting the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is that we know very little about them. This patch of forest allows scientists to study them and learn how we can improve conservation efforts for the species all across the region.</li>
<li>
<b>I will experiment with creating a conservation corridor. </b>If the forest patch is secure, I can start working with neighbouring landowners to plant trees that in the long run, would allow the monkeys to have access to more food and move between their patch and my conservation area. In the small part of Peru where these monkeys still exist, many of them are found in isolated forest patches just like this group. Without contact with other groups, inbreeding eventually leads to their death. If we can learn how we can reconnect these forest patches and create corridors for them to move, we can take great steps towards preventing this species from going extinct. </li>
</ul><p><b>With the help of your donations, I can achieve the following:</b><br/></p><ul><li><p><b>The current owner of the 5 hectares is willing to rent us the forest patch in order to conserve it for the next 20 years. In return, we have agreed to pay him 100 Peruvian Nuevos Soles a month (approx. 25 USD). We would enter into a legally binding contract in which he agrees not to cut down any trees or otherwise disturb the forest patch (e.g. noise-generating activities, burning of nearby areas etc.).  At the same time, we will be allowed to use the area for research and educational purposes. I am particularly happy about this arrangement because it means more local involvement in conservation, as well as safety for the monkeys. Should the owners change (e.g. because the current owner sells the land), the new owners would still be legally obligated to abide by the conservation agreement. The contract will be renewable, so after the 20 years are up, we can either renew the agreement, or even work with the owner to create a new private conservation area. </b></p></li></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595312/files/20140521132248-Indiegogo_Map_Peru.png?1400703768"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595238/files/20140521125546-Indiegogo_Map_Berlin_y_monos.png?1400702146"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Cost Breakdown</b><br/></p><p>100.- Peruvian Nuevos Soles a month = 1200.- Soles a year, totalling 24,000.- Soles over 20 years. That equals approximately 8600.- USD over 20 years. I therefore set my funding goal at 10,000.- USD, which will help absorb any exchange rate fluctuations and cover the legal costs of creating the conservation agreement. <span>Any additional funds will be used for research and safeguarding the area.</span></p><p><b>Meet the monkeys</b><br/></p><p>Yellow-tailed woolly monkeys <i>(Oreonax flavicauda)</i> are large, copper-brown New World primates found only in Peru, in primary cloud forests at elevations between 1,500-2,700m. They are one of the world’s most endangered monkeys because of rapid habitat loss and hunting. Scientists estimate that over 50% of their cloud forest habitat has been destroyed. By now, they are so rare that they have been listed as one of the 25 most endangered primate species on earth. This is why it is so important to raise awareness amongst local communities across the region about the urgency of protecting them, by stopping any hunting and the destruction of the forests that they live in.

     para que lo protejamos por los siguientes veinte años. Hemos acordado que se le pagaría 100 Nuevos
     Soles mensuales (aprox. 25 USD). Crearíamos un contrato legal vinculante
     que inscribiríamos en Registros Públicos, en el que se comprometería a no
     talar ningún árbol ni permitir alguna actividad que pueda generar algún
     daño a los monos, <span>como
     actividades ruidosas y la quema de zonas cercanas dentro de su propiedad.
     Asimismo, nos permitiría utilizar el área para investigación y educación

I live with my family in a remote part of the Amazonas Region in Peru. For decades, we have been protecting 100 hectares of beautiful cloud forest, one of the most fragile and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Our conservation area is called the Berlin Forest Private Conservation Area (ACP Bosque Berlin). By protecting the forest, not only do we protect the rare plants and animals that live there, we also ensure the water supply for nearby communities.Monkeys in troubleBut we are fighting an urgent threat. Just outside the borders of our protected area there is a 5 hectare patch of forest that is home to a family of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys, one of the most endangered species in the world and only found in this part of Peru. The monkeys have no way of leaving the tiny forest patch because a few years ago the surrounding forest was cut down and converted to pastures for grazing. The current owners of the forest patch say that they might cut it down to create more pastures. To make matters worse, at the beginning of 2014, poachers killed 5 monkeys, leaving behind only 6 members of the family. However, there is still time to act. Beyond empathy for the monkey family, there are important reasons why we urgently need to protect them:

Since they are so isolated, they are easy to see and give us the unique chance to raise awareness among the local community about the importance of protecting this species in the wild. Without local support, this species will disappear. Many of my neighbours don't even know how special and rare these monkeys are, nor that this species does not harm crops. I therefore want to create local pride for these monkeys, make clear that hunting them is not only illegal but will eventually make them go extinct, and that we have to protect our forests to give these and other animals their space to live.

The forest patch gives us an important chance to study them. A big part of the challenge of protecting the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is that we know very little about them. This patch of forest allows scientists to study them and learn how we can improve conservation efforts for the species all across the region.

I will experiment with creating a conservation corridor. If the forest patch is secure, I can start working with neighbouring landowners to plant trees that in the long run, would allow the monkeys to have access to more food and move between their patch and my conservation area. In the small part of Peru where these monkeys still exist, many of them are found in isolated forest patches just like this group. Without contact with other groups, inbreeding eventually leads to their death. If we can learn how we can reconnect these forest patches and create corridors for them to move, we can take great steps towards preventing this species from going extinct. 
With the help of your donations, I can achieve the following:The current owner of the 5 hectares is willing to rent us the forest patch in order to conserve it for the next 20 years. In return, we have agreed to pay him 100 Peruvian Nuevos Soles a month (approx. 25 USD). We would enter into a legally binding contract in which he agrees not to cut down any trees or otherwise disturb the forest patch (e.g. noise-generating activities, burning of nearby areas etc.).  At the same time, we will be allowed to use the area for research and educational purposes. I am particularly happy about this arrangement because it means more local involvement in conservation, as well as safety for the monkeys. Should the owners change (e.g. because the current owner sells the land), the new owners would still be legally obligated to abide by the conservation agreement. The contract will be renewable, so after the 20 years are up, we can either renew the agreement, or even work with the owner to create a new private conservation area. 
Cost Breakdown100.- Peruvian Nuevos Soles a month = 1200.- Soles a year, totalling 24,000.- Soles over 20 years. That equals approximately 8600.- USD over 20 years. I therefore set my funding goal at 10,000.- USD, which will help absorb any exchange rate fluctuations and cover the legal costs of creating the conservation agreement. Any additional funds will be used for research and safeguarding the area.Meet the monkeysYellow-tailed woolly monkeys (Oreonax flavicauda) are large, copper-brown New World primates found only in Peru, in primary cloud forests at elevations between 1,500-2,700m. They are one of the world’s most endangered monkeys because of rapid habitat loss and hunting. Scientists estimate that over 50% of their cloud forest habitat has been destroyed. By now, they are so rare that they have been listed as one of the 25 most endangered primate species on earth. This is why it is so important to raise awareness amongst local communities across the region about the urgency of protecting them, by stopping any hunting and the destruction of the forests that they live in. You can read more about the monkeys here, and find lots of beautiful imageshere.
My NGO allies
Two conservation organizations are helping me with the campaign and implementing the project:Conservamos por Naturaleza is an initiative of the Peruvian Society for Environmental Law (SPDA). Conservamos por Naturaleza supports private and community-based conservation areas. With their expertise in communication and legal aspects of conservation, they will support me with project planning, legal issues, the crowd-funding campaign, negotiating with current land-owners and raising awareness about the project.
Neotropical Primate Conservation is an NGO founded in 2007 to protect South American primates, in particular the yellow-tailed woolly monkey. They are an important player for primate conservation in the area and they have been helping grassroots conservation initiatives in Peru for the past decade. They will support me with the technical aspects of the project, including planning the conservation corridor, advice on reforestation, and other issues to protect the monkey family.Donations from the New England Biolabs Foundation and the Rufford Small Grants Programme have made it possible for me to launch this Indiegogo campaign. ESPAÑOLSoy Leyda Rimarachin.

<h2><span>Pura Vida!</span></h2>
<p><em>Pura vida is more than an expression in Nosara, its a way of life; a way of life that we are determined to preserve.</em><strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong>Thanks for checking out our campaign page, I’m <strong>Carl Kish</strong>, the <strong>Sustainability Director for Safari Surf School</strong> and the <strong>Hotel Casa Tucan</strong> in blissful <strong>Nosara, Costa Rica</strong>. After implementing community development initiatives in surf tourism destinations for over a year, I’ve developed a keen interest in this culturally rich surf and yoga community, nestled in the lush jungle of the Ostional Wildlife Refuge. During my research for alternative fuels in Costa Rica as a consultant for Safari Surf last May, I read about <strong>Ryan King, a biologist and college instructor who is an expert in small-scale biodiesel production</strong> and has spent over a decade researching and writing articles about sustainability and environmental issues. Ryan’s article about his small-scale biodiesel processing plant in Monteverde, Costa Rica - where he supplied a school’s entire fleet of buses with biodiesel by collecting used cooking grease (<strong>waste vegetable oil, or WVO</strong>) from local restaurants - inspired me to spark a discussion about setting up a similar system in Nosara. Six months later and our idea has finally come to fruition. Over the course of three weeks, Ryan and I aim to <strong>create an innovative way to produce biodiesel</strong> at Safari Surf’s headquarters — the soon to be Sustainable Surf Tourism Certified, Hotel Casa Tucan — starting at the end of January. Converting WVO into biodiesel has been around for quite some time, however none of the established models have been <strong>energy independent, carbon negative, and closed-loop (zero waste)</strong>. Safari Surf and Casa Tucan have been generous enough to supply Ryan and I with accommodations and transportation within the country to get supplies, but <strong>we need your help to make this unique, self-sustaining biodiesel system a reality</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Our fundraising goal is budgeted for</strong> the construction of the shelter, the biodiesel system and the biochar system, as well as researching and testing the use of homemade reagents in the conversion process as a substitute for imported, toxic and expensive chemicals such as methanol. With the combined usage of the “<strong>greasercycle</strong>,” a stationary bicycle connected to a pump which mixes the fuel as you pedal, as well as a <strong>biochar heat transfer system</strong>, this <strong>innovative model can run completely off-grid. Considering how much the power goes out in Nosara</strong>, especially in the rainy season, along with limited outside access during emergency situations such as seasonal flooding or earthquakes, having a fuel source that is independent from imported resources and power could potentially be a <strong>lifesaver</strong>. Your contributions will not only help Nosara, but also the larger cause for finding a small-scale sustainable fuel solution. Once the research has been completed and the model is tested, <strong>we will make this process completely transparent and available free of charge</strong>. Our hope is that communities and biodiesel producers all over the world will experiment and enhance this model even more. The project’s focus will be driven towards biofuel production with positive ecological externalities, and take advantage of open source hardware and collaborative design. The support provided by donations will allow us to create a replicable, one of a kind biodiesel system as well as confirm the purity of our homemade reagents and final products with full laboratory analysis. <strong>We envision this being a catalyst for change in sustainable living</strong> and we hope it will inspire others to implement, experiment, and improve on this model.<strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>

<p><em>History of the project and team members’ stories.</em><strong><strong><br/><br/><span>Carl Kish:</span><br/></strong></strong><em>Sustainability Director for Safari Surf School &amp; Hotel Casa Tucan.</em></p>
<p>My interest in alternative fuel was sparked when I heard about the Greasebus ski shuttle in Portland, Oregon, which is run entirely on waste vegetable oil (WVO). This fascination traveled with me when I studied abroad in New Zealand, and after many hours of research and trials, I was able to help initiate the conversion of Queenstown Resort College’s shuttle van to biodiesel (I also wrote a business plan for setting up a Greasebus service in the alpine town for a term paper). I have a passion for surfing, the outdoors, and helping people, which is why I love working on projects such as this. Beginning with my senior year internship with the Center for Surf Research (CSR) at San Diego State University, I began traveling and helping surf tourism destinations to become Sustainable Surf Tourism Certified. The inspiration for this project first started when I was researching biodiesel in Fiji as a consultant for Tavarua last January, and I discovered that coconut oil processed into biodiesel was an emerging market in Fiji. A year later, the small heart-shaped island in the Pacific is commencing trials on running their lifeblood (massive generators) on biodiesel.<br/><br/>Safari Surf and Casa Tucan joined the CSR’s Sustainable Surf Tourism Certification Program in late April and I was sent there for three weeks as a consultant to develop their Sustainability Management System and outline a path to certification. As I was researching alternative fuel resources in Costa Rica, among a myriad of other topics, I came across Ryan King’s article about his small-scale biodiesel processing plant in Monteverde, Costa Rica, where he was able to supply a local school’s entire fleet of buses with biodiesel after collecting used cooking grease (waste vegetable oil - WVO) from local restaurants. His story beckoned me to at least see if it was possible to implement something similar in Nosara.  After months of discussion, going back and forth about his research and various logistical matters, we decided on a place and a time for this project derived purely from passion to launch. Considering the current biodiesel situation in Nosara, where local restaurants can pay to transport their WVO 500 km round trip to a large biodiesel processing plant in Cartago to trade 1 liter of biodiesel for 4 liters of WVO, the monetary cost and carbon footprint of this process counteracts the environmental benefits of using biodiesel. Thus, this new locally sourced system will be better for the community economically.<br/><br/>After my initial stint in Nosara, I have been leading the sustainability efforts for Safari Surf from San Diego since June, as one of the owners, Tim Marsh, lives here along with our Digital Media Director, Greg Gibson. I’m extremely passionate about sustainability management in how it results in smart, ethical business practices - it just makes more sense, its the natural evolution of how an operation should well, operate. Managing every aspect of our business so that it provides the greatest positive impact on the community and the environment, is an incredibly rewarding job and I’m that much more fortunate to be given this freedom to seek out and initiate projects such as this one. Housing the system at the Hotel Casa Tucan, will provide biodiesel fuel for our shuttle van and third party shuttle vans, which transport guests from major airports to Nosara. Power outages are a normal occurrence in Nosara and back-up generators consume mass amounts of fuel. In emergency situations (recent earthquakes, annual flooding), when access to Nosara is severely inhibited, as it is a small community with dirt roads about an hour from the nearest city, the model we are developing can serve as lifesaver with local access to fuel for the generators. If this project is successfully replicated, the community’s dependence on imported fossil fuels would drop drastically.<strong><strong><br/><br/><br/><span>Ryan King:</span><br/></strong></strong><em>Teacher, environmental science writer.</em><strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong>I began researching biofuels and local resource production after several years of studying and publishing reports in global change science.  While working as a naturalist guide and school teacher in Costa Rica, I realized that the majority of ecotourist destinations provided very few environmental restoration programs appropriate for the extreme conditions of modern ecological decline and economic downturn.  <br/><br/>My personal interest with small-scale biodiesel and biochar systems has been geared towards development of integrated energy systems that provide an environmentally beneficial external impact.  This may be accomplished by using locally rendered reagents, common materials and equipment, and accounting for all side streams of biofuel production.  Additionally, these designs should be able to function without grid-tied electricity or energy derived from fossil fuels.  <br/><br/>My articles are most often published on the <a href=""http://www.mongabay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mongabay.com</a> conservation website and have been featured by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The Post Carbon Institute’s Energy Bulletin, Biochar-International.org, Earthknowledge.net, Ecoearth.info, Dominical Days, and many others.  </p>
<p><strong><strong><br/><span>Safari Surf School, Hotel Casa Tucan &amp; Nosara:</span><br/><br/></strong></strong>Safari Surf School has been sharing its “stoke” and passion for surfing for over 13 years and is still going strong! We are a socially and environmentally conscious, sustainability-driven business that enjoys bringing two different cultures together for one amazing experience full of new friendships and a lifetime of memories for our guests.<br/><br/>You will obviously be thrust into the Latin culture and introduced to the incredible spirit and vibe that is “Pura Vida”…which translates to “Pure Life”. There is a reason that Costa Rica was voted one of the “Happiest” countries in the world and it is very evident when you meet and greet the local people. Our town of Nosara embodies all of what makes Costa Rica the most desirable place to visit on vacation. It’s like a journey back in time…where people wave at you as you pass by and greet you with a smile, always willing to help, where old cultural ways integrate seamlessly with the new “wave” of today’s younger generation. <br/><br/>The “other” culture that you will be immersed in while visiting us is the “Surf Culture”. This culture is really a mindset, a lifestyle and you will be living and breathing the entire time you are with us in Nosara. What makes Nosara and Safari Surf so attractive to people is that everything we do revolves around the art and passion that is wave riding! Our instructors are all very accomplished surfers with years of experience and training. They enjoy meeting new friends and making lasting friendships with all who come through our “doors”. Each instructor is extremely well-trained and educated in the art of teaching surfing, safety, lifeguard skills and first aid / first response.<br/><br/>Hotel Casa Tucan has been home to Safari Surf School clients since its inception in 2000. The Hotel Casa Tucan was one of the original hotels in the Playa Guiones area. In 2005, Safari Surf School, along with some surf school clients, purchased the Hotel Casa Tucan and slowly have refurbished and built a fantastically cozy slice of paradise just steps from one of the most beautiful beaches in all of Costa Rica. We hope to be achieve Sustainable Surf Tourism Certification by the Center for Surf Research and Sustainable Tourism Certification by the Costa Rican Tourism Board this May.<br/><br/>From our hotel Casa Tucan to our surf program, Safari Surf employs 99% local people who live and have families in Nosara. We strive for a sustainable existence in the community by educating, employing, and giving back to the local people.<br/><br/><strong>Safari Surf  on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/safarisurfschool"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href=""http://twitter.com/safarisurfer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a></strong><br/><strong>Casa Tucan on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/casatucan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>

Pura vida is more than an expression in Nosara, its a way of life; a way of life that we are determined to preserve.Thanks for checking out our campaign page, I’m Carl Kish, the Sustainability Director for Safari Surf School and the Hotel Casa Tucan in blissful Nosara, Costa Rica. After implementing community development initiatives in surf tourism destinations for over a year, I’ve developed a keen interest in this culturally rich surf and yoga community, nestled in the lush jungle of the Ostional Wildlife Refuge. During my research for alternative fuels in Costa Rica as a consultant for Safari Surf last May, I read about Ryan King, a biologist and college instructor who is an expert in small-scale biodiesel production and has spent over a decade researching and writing articles about sustainability and environmental issues. Ryan’s article about his small-scale biodiesel processing plant in Monteverde, Costa Rica - where he supplied a school’s entire fleet of buses with biodiesel by collecting used cooking grease (waste vegetable oil, or WVO) from local restaurants - inspired me to spark a discussion about setting up a similar system in Nosara. Six months later and our idea has finally come to fruition. Over the course of three weeks, Ryan and I aim to create an innovative way to produce biodiesel at Safari Surf’s headquarters — the soon to be Sustainable Surf Tourism Certified, Hotel Casa Tucan — starting at the end of January. Converting WVO into biodiesel has been around for quite some time, however none of the established models have been energy independent, carbon negative, and closed-loop (zero waste). Safari Surf and Casa Tucan have been generous enough to supply Ryan and I with accommodations and transportation within the country to get supplies, but we need your help to make this unique, self-sustaining biodiesel system a reality.Our fundraising goal is budgeted for the construction of the shelter, the biodiesel system and the biochar system, as well as researching and testing the use of homemade reagents in the conversion process as a substitute for imported, toxic and expensive chemicals such as methanol. With the combined usage of the “greasercycle,” a stationary bicycle connected to a pump which mixes the fuel as you pedal, as well as a biochar heat transfer system, this innovative model can run completely off-grid. Considering how much the power goes out in Nosara, especially in the rainy season, along with limited outside access during emergency situations such as seasonal flooding or earthquakes, having a fuel source that is independent from imported resources and power could potentially be a lifesaver. Your contributions will not only help Nosara, but also the larger cause for finding a small-scale sustainable fuel solution. Once the research has been completed and the model is tested, we will make this process completely transparent and available free of charge. Our hope is that communities and biodiesel producers all over the world will experiment and enhance this model even more. The project’s focus will be driven towards biofuel production with positive ecological externalities, and take advantage of open source hardware and collaborative design. The support provided by donations will allow us to create a replicable, one of a kind biodiesel system as well as confirm the purity of our homemade reagents and final products with full laboratory analysis. We envision this being a catalyst for change in sustainable living and we hope it will inspire others to implement, experiment, and improve on this model.
Greasy Gifts:
Help us achieve our dream and you won’t regrease it!Our fundraising goal is budgeted for: 

Constructing the system’s shelter, which will elevate it above the floodplain and protect it from the elements. Where possible, we will repurpose as many building materials from our local landfill to cut down on costs and our impact, but we will need to purchase some new items for critical parts of the structure. Ryan and I will be doing most of the labor, but we will be seeking help (where appropriate) from volunteers in the community as well as voluntourists.

Researching and testing designs for the grease-pump-bicycle and the biochar-heat-transfer systems as well as investigating the chemistry of ethanol fermentation, distillation, and purification for biodiesel production. Methanol prices have increased globally, and biodiesel producers would benefit from our ethanol research.  To our knowledge, no biodiesel producers have openly shared the proper chemical analysis of biodiesel produced by non-industrial (homemade) reagents.  Thorough chemical analysis is expensive but crucial to biodiesel production.   A substantial portion of the funding we seek will be used to pay for laboratory testing, ensuring that other biodiesel producers will be confident to adopt our innovative approach.

Airfare, accommodation and transportation are being generously provided by Safari Surf and Casa Tucan.
Support our cause and we’ll send you something special in return:Check out the ""Perks"" sidebar to the right of this page. For the $3,000 & $5,000 perks, please refer to the Sustainable Surfer Package details on Safari Surf's website.
If we are unable to reach our goal, any funds we accumulate will still go to where they are needed, which is the bare minimum materials/resources necessary to get this project off the ground, which is to literally to build a foundation that will elevate the processing plant off the ground to protect it from flood damage. Once we have a shelter to protect the system from the elements, then we can allocate the rest of our funds to research and the actual system itself.
“I Heard It Through The Greasevine”
Help spread the word so we can reach our goal!We understand if you are unable to contribute, we greatly appreciate your interest and hope that if you believe in the positive scope of this project, you will support us through another medium. Please post our project to all your social media outlets, email our project link to friends and family and ask them to spread the word, talk to your co-workers about it etc. Anything will help. Thank you!

History of the project and team members’ stories.Carl Kish:Sustainability Director for Safari Surf School & Hotel Casa Tucan.
My interest in alternative fuel was sparked when I heard about the Greasebus ski shuttle in Portland, Oregon, which is run entirely on waste vegetable oil (WVO). This fascination traveled with me when I studied abroad in New Zealand, and after many hours of research and trials, I was able to help initiate the conversion of Queenstown Resort College’s shuttle van to biodiesel (I also wrote a business plan for setting up a Greasebus service in the alpine town for a term paper). I have a passion for surfing, the outdoors, and helping people, which is why I love working on projects such as this. Beginning with my senior year internship with the Center for Surf Research (CSR) at San Diego State University, I began traveling and helping surf tourism destinations to become Sustainable Surf Tourism Certified. The inspiration for this project first started when I was researching biodiesel in Fiji as a consultant for Tavarua last January, and I discovered that coconut oil processed into biodiesel was an emerging market in Fiji. A year later, the small heart-shaped island in the Pacific is commencing trials on running their lifeblood (massive generators) on biodiesel.Safari Surf and Casa Tucan joined the CSR’s Sustainable Surf Tourism Certification Program in late April and I was sent there for three weeks as a consultant to develop their Sustainability Management System and outline a path to certification. As I was researching alternative fuel resources in Costa Rica, among a myriad of other topics, I came across Ryan King’s article about his small-scale biodiesel processing plant in Monteverde, Costa Rica, where he was able to supply a local school’s entire fleet of buses with biodiesel after collecting used cooking grease (waste vegetable oil - WVO) from local restaurants. His story beckoned me to at least see if it was possible to implement something similar in Nosara.  After months of discussion, going back and forth about his research and various logistical matters, we decided on a place and a time for this project derived purely from passion to launch. Considering the current biodiesel situation in Nosara, where local restaurants can pay to transport their WVO 500 km round trip to a large biodiesel processing plant in Cartago to trade 1 liter of biodiesel for 4 liters of WVO, the monetary cost and carbon footprint of this process counteracts the environmental benefits of using biodiesel. Thus, this new locally sourced system will be better for the community economically.After my initial stint in Nosara, I have been leading the sustainability efforts for Safari Surf from San Diego since June, as one of the owners, Tim Marsh, lives here along with our Digital Media Director, Greg Gibson. I’m extremely passionate about sustainability management in how it results in smart, ethical business practices - it just makes more sense, its the natural evolution of how an operation should well, operate. Managing every aspect of our business so that it provides the greatest positive impact on the community and the environment, is an incredibly rewarding job and I’m that much more fortunate to be given this freedom to seek out and initiate projects such as this one. Housing the system at the Hotel Casa Tucan, will provide biodiesel fuel for our shuttle van and third party shuttle vans, which transport guests from major airports to Nosara. Power outages are a normal occurrence in Nosara and back-up generators consume mass amounts of fuel. In emergency situations (recent earthquakes, annual flooding), when access to Nosara is severely inhibited, as it is a small community with dirt roads about an hour from the nearest city, the model we are developing can serve as lifesaver with local access to fuel for the generators. If this project is successfully replicated, the community’s dependence on imported fossil fuels would drop drastically.Ryan King:Teacher, environmental science writer.I began researching biofuels and local resource production after several years of studying and publishing reports in global change science.  While working as a naturalist guide and school teacher in Costa Rica, I realized that the majority of ecotourist destinations provided very few environmental restoration programs appropriate for the extreme conditions of modern ecological decline and economic downturn.  My personal interest with small-scale biodiesel and biochar systems has been geared towards development of integrated energy systems that provide an environmentally beneficial external impact.  This may be accomplished by using locally rendered reagents, common materials and equipment, and accounting for all side streams of biofuel production.  Additionally, these designs should be able to function without grid-tied electricity or energy derived from fossil fuels.  My articles are most often published on the www.mongabay.com conservation website and have been featured by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The Post Carbon Institute’s Energy Bulletin, Biochar-International.org, Earthknowledge.net, Ecoearth.info, Dominical Days, and many others.  
Safari Surf School, Hotel Casa Tucan & Nosara:Safari Surf School has been sharing its “stoke” and passion for surfing for over 13 years and is still going strong! We are a socially and environmentally conscious, sustainability-driven business that enjoys bringing two different cultures together for one amazing experience full of new friendships and a lifetime of memories for our guests.You will obviously be thrust into the Latin culture and introduced to the incredible spirit and vibe that is “Pura Vida”…which translates to “Pure Life”. There is a reason that Costa Rica was voted one of the “Happiest” countries in the world and it is very evident when you meet and greet the local people. Our town of Nosara embodies all of what makes Costa Rica the most desirable place to visit on vacation. It’s like a journey back in time…where people wave at you as you pass by and greet you with a smile, always willing to help, where old cultural ways integrate seamlessly with the new “wave” of today’s younger generation. The “other” culture that you will be immersed in while visiting us is the “Surf Culture”. This culture is really a mindset, a lifestyle and you will be living and breathing the entire time you are with us in Nosara. What makes Nosara and Safari Surf so attractive to people is that everything we do revolves around the art and passion that is wave riding! Our instructors are all very accomplished surfers with years of experience and training. They enjoy meeting new friends and making lasting friendships with all who come through our “doors”. Each instructor is extremely well-trained and educated in the art of teaching surfing, safety, lifeguard skills and first aid / first response.Hotel Casa Tucan has been home to Safari Surf School clients since its inception in 2000. The Hotel Casa Tucan was one of the original hotels in the Playa Guiones area. In 2005, Safari Surf School, along with some surf school clients, purchased the Hotel Casa Tucan and slowly have refurbished and built a fantastically cozy slice of paradise just steps from one of the most beautiful beaches in all of Costa Rica. We hope to be achieve Sustainable Surf Tourism Certification by the Center for Surf Research and Sustainable Tourism Certification by the Costa Rican Tourism Board this May.From our hotel Casa Tucan to our surf program, Safari Surf employs 99% local people who live and have families in Nosara. We strive for a sustainable existence in the community by educating, employing, and giving back to the local people.Safari Surf  on Facebook & TwitterCasa Tucan on Facebook

Greasology:Turning grease into biodiesel explained.

Collecting and filtering WVO
Traditional Appleseed Biodiesel System
Closed-Loop (Zero Waste):


Wash Water & Algae: The wash water can be reused to grow algae (Chlorella vulgaris), and the algae can be used as a natural cleaning ingredient in our greywater irrigation systems. Greywater is toilet, shower and sink water (used water) that is filtered and repurposed to irrigate our gardens. We are pleased to be using a non-toxic cleaning ingredient (algae) as there is no risk of any contaminants seeping into the soil and reaching the ocean, which is huge relief since we are only a few hundred meters from the beach.


Glycerine, a natural byproduct of making biodiesel can be used to make soap and since it is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), when mixed with water it can be poured on the dirt roads in Nosara to keep the dust down instead of using smelly and expensive molasses, which they currently use.


Biochar can be used in our soils and heat generated from making the biochar can be used to heat our biodiesel systems so there is no power needed to do so.

The “Greasercycle” or grease-pump-bicycle eliminates the need for power in the mixing process because a stationary bicycle is connected to a harbor freight pump, which pumps the WVO, ethanol and lye to mix them and make the biodiesel. This “Greasercycle” replaces the traditional 1.5 horsepower pump to make our system run completely off-grid with the addition of the biochar heating element.

<h2><b><u>Conservation
Haven On Nusa Penida</u></b></h2>
<p>If we do say so ourselves we think our Nusa
Penida bird sanctuary is pretty amazing. The project has received kudos and
recognition for organizations around the world and it belongs to the Wildlife
Land Trust’s network of sanctuaries.  On top of that each year 300 to 400 <a href=""http://www.fnpf.org/get-involved/volunteer-in-indonesia/volunteer-in-bali-on-nusa-penida"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">volunteers</a>, from
Indonesia and across the world, come to Nusa Penida to get involved in our
programs. Some stay a few days, some stay for months.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379129/files/20140218202854-Nusa_Penida_island__1_.jpg?1392784134"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>The sanctuary – the first in Indonesia to be
established in an inhabited area – was specifically set up to help save the
Bali starling, one of world’s most endangered birds and the province’s emblem.  Today the sanctuary, which covers Nusa Penida
and two small nearby islands is home to at least 100 Bali starlings. When the
project was started in 2006 there were estimated to be fewer than 10 such birds
surviving in the wild.</p>
<p>It’s all possible because we were able to
persuade the island’s 46 villages to introduce traditional regulations – which
govern day-to-day life – to protect the birds from poachers and wildlife
traders. No mean feat in a country where endangered birds can fetch thousands
of dollars on the black market.</p>
<p>We have set up a conservation center – which
is currently upgrading to new premises - where we breed birds and also rehabilitate
and release ex-captive endemic birds. We were very excited when our first lot of captive-bred Bali starling chicks were born at our center late last year - we plan to release some of the half dozen healthy new arrivals into the wild later on.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379132/files/20140218203423-DSC02853.JPG?1392784463"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We have a nursery at the center, and have
grown thousands of saplings to help restore the islands’ degraded forests. Each
year we give away tens of thousands of saplings to the local community for
free.</p>
<p>In return for the support of the community
we run development projects, including a pilot farming project, conservation and
English language classes, an education center, and provide scholarships for
school students – ensuring more than 60 local students can attend high school
or university each year. These projects not only improve community well-being,
but enable local people to get involved in conservation.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We can do all of this work more effectively,

take seedlings across the island to help replant the forest
transport volunteers and our staff to project sites

and to the field for bird and turtle monitoring visits
bring villagers to our English club, conservation education classes and the courses we run teaching ways to make a living that are environmentally-friendly
We would simply be able to do so much more – quicker and
better – on the 200km2 island with a multi-use classroom on wheels.
Right now we only have motorbikes. When we need something
bigger we have to hire a vehicle. On remote Nusa Penida, which is 40 minutes by
boat from Bali, that can be expensive. And if it happens to be a holiday or
ceremonial day – there are many in Bali, religion is an integral part of daily
life – then forget it.
About Us
Our projects respect the interdependence of wildlife, habitat and local
communities and are holistic and sustainable. 
We run projects in Bali and Kalimantan, including wildlife
rehabilitation, the breeding and release of critically endangered birds, and reforestation.
Our community development work includes environmental education, and teaching
sustainable environmentally-friendly ways to make a living.
FNPF – which has been operating since 1997 – receives no government
funding. We have won the support of donors from around the world, including the
like of the Humane Society International (Australia), Boeing, US Fish and
Wildlife Service, Australia’s Taronga Zoo’s Conservation …  Check out some of our media coverage - we have featured in National Geographic, the Sydney Morning Herald,  Scientific American, and in-flight magazines by Jetstar among many, many others.
Conservation
Haven On Nusa Penida
If we do say so ourselves we think our Nusa
Penida bird sanctuary is pretty amazing. The project has received kudos and
recognition for organizations around the world and it belongs to the Wildlife
Land Trust’s network of sanctuaries.  On top of that each year 300 to 400 volunteers, from
Indonesia and across the world, come to Nusa Penida to get involved in our
programs. Some stay a few days, some stay for months.
The sanctuary – the first in Indonesia to be
established in an inhabited area – was specifically set up to help save the
Bali starling, one of world’s most endangered birds and the province’s emblem.  Today the sanctuary, which covers Nusa Penida
and two small nearby islands is home to at least 100 Bali starlings. When the
project was started in 2006 there were estimated to be fewer than 10 such birds
surviving in the wild.
It’s all possible because we were able to
persuade the island’s 46 villages to introduce traditional regulations – which
govern day-to-day life – to protect the birds from poachers and wildlife
traders. No mean feat in a country where endangered birds can fetch thousands
of dollars on the black market.
We have set up a conservation center – which
is currently upgrading to new premises - where we breed birds and also rehabilitate
and release ex-captive endemic birds. We were very excited when our first lot of captive-bred Bali starling chicks were born at our center late last year - we plan to release some of the half dozen healthy new arrivals into the wild later on.We have a nursery at the center, and have
grown thousands of saplings to help restore the islands’ degraded forests. Each
year we give away tens of thousands of saplings to the local community for
free.
In return for the support of the community
we run development projects, including a pilot farming project, conservation and
English language classes, an education center, and provide scholarships for
school students – ensuring more than 60 local students can attend high school
or university each year. These projects not only improve community well-being,
but enable local people to get involved in conservation.We can do all of this work more effectively,
efficiently and successfully with a mobile classroom using a multi-use vehicle.

<p><strong><u>THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT REMAINING CORAL REEFS IS TO EMPOWER LOCAL PEOPLE</u>  to become ‘enlightened’ stewards of their environment.</strong> Traditional societies were often responsible stewards, aware that their actions would affect future generations, but the modern world has undermined these traditions and, like tropical rainforests, tropical coral reefs are in rapid a downward spiral. </p>
<p><strong>I'm Norm</strong>, Australian, 20years in Indonesia. You'll find everything you need to know about me at: <strong><a href=""http://www.greenworldbali.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.greenworldbali.com</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href=""http://www.baliecolodge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.baliecolodge.com</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>For more than 20 years I've worked on the practical issues of achieving greater sustainability.</strong> My first reef conservation campaign was in the Whitsunday Islands on the Great Barrier Reef in the 90's. Anchor damage was the problem and we solved it with No-Anchor Zones marked by the same marker buoys we're now installing in Raja Ampat. </p>
<p>The last 2 years I've been connecting with the Papuan people who live on Raja Ampat's truly unique islands. I've surveyed a lot of locations and our time to protect what's left is vey limited.  <strong>In Raja Ampat we are very fortunate to be able to work fast and over a very large area with the active network of locally-owned guesthouses called homestays. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Papuans are sad about the deteriorating condition of their coral reefs and fisheries but until now they have felt powerless to stop the decline.</strong> The Government supports local people taking responsibility for protecting and managing their natural resources and, for the first time, this  LPA program empowers them to do just that. </p>
<p><strong>Once people are empowered to take their first steps towards greater sustainability they tend to continue down that path. </strong>Stopping fishing &amp; anchoring are the first (big) steps in a process that will lead to greater long-term sustainability for Raja Ampat's extraordinary marine environment. </p>
<p><strong>During 2017, I gave my time and my family's boat to proving this program would work.</strong> With generous funding from an American donor, Bill Price, and in cooperation with the Homestay Association, <strong>we proved the concept.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We now have 17 widely-scattered Locally Protected Areas (LPA's) protected by local rules ('SASI') and clearly defined by marker buoys. If you decide to help us we'll be able to create another 50-60 Locally Protected Areas during 2018. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We're using a business-like approach,</strong> meaning... For the greatest benefit to the environment, and tangible results for the donors, I'm making sure that <strong>the Raja Ampat LPA Program is very good value for money. </strong></p>
<p>Example: <strong>The new LPA at Beser Bay, with 10 marker buoys, cost US$3,500. </strong>This exceptionally beautiful protected area covers around <strong>50hectares</strong> including extensive coral reefs, small islands, seagrass beds, mangroves and sandy lagoons.</p>
<p><strong>The homestays inside the Beser Bay LPA are incentivized to continually enforce the no-fishing &amp; no-anchoring rules because it's good for their ecotourism businesses. </strong>They want to protect their natural resources and, backed by local rules, this is their first chance to stop damaging activities. </p>
<p><strong>That’s $70 per hectare to stop all fishing &amp; anchoring which, are two of the biggest threats.. </strong>with daily enforcement of the rules by empowered and incentivized local people. We don’t know of any other organization that can equal this value for money.</p>
<p><strong>With the funds raised by this campaign we will protect some of the World's most diverse coral reef ecosystems.  We need your help now to save some of the best coral reefs left anywhere in the World.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's tangible!</strong> Our <strong>Locally Protected Areas (LPA's) are clearly defined with signposted marker buoys.</strong> If you can make your way to Raja Ampat you'll be able to see the results for yourself. </p>
</div><div>
<p><u><strong>WE'VE PROVEN THE PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE</strong></u>  and as funds become available <strong>we will expand it rapidly to create another 50-60​ Locally Protected Areas</strong> scattered around Raja Ampat. To achieve this goal our crowdfunding target is <strong>US$150,000</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN?</u> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Raja Ampat is the prize gem of the 'Coral Triangle', it's a super-diverse tropical marine environment </strong>still surviving in relatively good shape. It has been protected from industrial-scale fishing <strong>but it is still suffers daily damage from unsustainable fishing &amp; anchor damage</strong>, plus excessive numbers of divers, the Crown of Thorns Starfish and water pollution. Raja Ampat is now experiencing a development boom but, <strong>if we act quickly, we still have time</strong>. </p>
<p>Conservation International has spent millions of dollars creating Marine Protected Areas (MPA's) in Raja Ampat but the reality is <strong>coral reefs continue to be damaged and over-exploited</strong> on a daily basis. Large scale fishing has been stopped but down <strong>at the local level where the daily damage is occurring unsustainable fishing continues completely unregulated so no-fishing zones are critical</strong> to rebuilding reef-fish stocks. </p>
<p>Raja Ampat is a group of islands with virtually no roads so everybody, and everything, travels by boat. Liveaboard dive boats have a code of conduct for anchoring in deep water away from reefs but the many day-trip tour boats, private yachts, local cargo and passenger boats and local fishermen have no such code. <strong>Uncontrolled anchoring is destroying corals in Raja Ampat every day so no-anchor zones are critical</strong> to their preservation. </p>
<p><strong>Raja Ampat is now considered the best diving location in the World</strong>, partly at least, because most other places have been trashed. The dive industry and Conservation International enthusiastically promote Raja Ampat's gorgeous coral reefs, amazing biodiversity and stunning scenic beauty but make no mistake... <strong>Raja Ampat’s remaining coral reefs are not safe! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our priority is the daily threats that are emptying reefs of fish and destroying their glorious coral structure. Unrestricted fishing and the terrible damage done by anchors are two urgent threats that are stopped when locals declare a new LPA (Locally Protected Area). </strong></p>
<p>There are a number of threats to coral reefs so there’s no simple ‘magic bullet’ solution for their long-term survival. <strong>We've usually waited too long, by the time we've begun to act, the damage has already been done. If we really want to save coral reefs, first, we have to SAVE WHAT'S LEFT from further exploitation and damage.</strong> Once an area has effective protection local people can start working on the other problems.</p>
<p><u><strong>OUR RESULTS SO FAR</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>During 2017 we facilitated the creation of 15 locally protected areas</strong> where the two major threats, fishing and anchors, are now banned.<strong> The LPA's are mostly ‘house reefs’ at locally-owned homestays (small guesthouses) but we’ve also protected a 1.6km (1mile) long tidal inlet which is an important reef shark nursery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In January 2018 the first dive resort joined the program</strong>, protecting its own house reef and providing the marker buoys for three adjacent homestays. Also in January, we installed marker buoys at <strong>our first community reef project</strong> protecting 1km of coral reef and adjacent mangroves.</p>
<p><strong>There are now 17 Locally Protected Areas (LPA's) scattered around Raja Ampat and with your support we will continue the work protecting beautiful coral reefs <i>before</i> it's too late. </strong></p>
<p><u><strong>THE RAJA AMPAT HOMESTAY ASSOCIATION</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>The Homestay Association network is critical to the people and natural environment of Raja Ampat. The Association has the greatest potential to bring urgently needed economic development to the islands and it is the only realistic way we can see to facilitate widespread environmental protection (by local people).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Homestay Association recently won a significant UN Award</strong> but it remains a ‘work in progress’ that needs your business, so if you’re thinking of visiting Raja Ampat and you want to get a real feel for this extraordinary place, please consider the homestays. The locations are stunning, the accommodations are simple, the food is great. <strong>The Association has many lovely homestays shown on its excellent website:</strong> <strong><a href=""http://www.stayrajaampat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stayrajaampat.com</a></strong> </p>
<p><u><strong>ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF LOCALLY PROTECTED AREAS (LPA's) </strong></u> </p>
<p><strong>I use a practical approach to the way I pitch the program to local people</strong> and communities. <strong>It is obvious that a protected ‘house reef’ is good for a homestay ecotourism business</strong> (or resort) so that’s an easy sell, although local fishermen do require some convincing. </p>
<p><strong>The government doesn't regulate small-scale local fishermen so fisheries are suffering from <i>‘The Trajedy of the Commons’</i>, whereby a lack of regulation means anybody can take anything,</strong> so reef fish catches have dramatically declined. It means a fisherman will take undersize fish or lobsters or anything else because..<i> <strong>‘if I don’t take it, somebody else will’. </strong></i></p>
<p><strong>We explain to fishermen that LPA's become much-needed nurseries for reef fish, improving their livelihood over time. </strong>Once a Locally Protected Area is declared local people are empowered, with backing from Government, to refuse entry to fishermen from other areas.</p>
<p><u><strong>THE FUTURE</strong></u></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Empowering local people to take charge of their environment, giving them the right to refuse access to outsiders and to stop unsustainable exploitation by their own people, provides the necessary foundation for a sustainable future</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Once a Locally Protected Area is declared it becomes the responsibility of the homestay owners and the community.</strong> They are responsible for maintenance of the buoys and enforcement of the rules. <strong>The future belongs to local people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our website: <a href=""http://www.greenworldbali.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.greenworldbali.com</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We will post news on new LPA's as they’re created. We’ll post videos and photos as well as up to date information on our progress. </strong></p>
<p><u><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>The greatest risk we face now is the small size of the program but as it grows we expect it to become stronger.</strong> If we do all the planned locations this year <strong>we will spend 2019 following-up and supporting the Homestay Association to take ownership of the LPA Program. </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are always challenges...</strong> Will the buoys be well-maintained? What happens if a boat hits a buoy? How long will the chains last? What happens if a buoy disappears? Will everybody abide by the rules? How do we get majority compliance? Can we monitor ecosystem changes after declaring the protected areas? Can the LPA Program be extended to address other threats coral reefs?</p>
<p>Solving these, and other, ongoing challenges is all about commitment and that's the whole point... <strong><i>The only people who are continually incentivized to deal with ongoing, day-to-day challenges, are the people who live on-site. </i>Real protection &amp; effective conservation has to be done by local people, applying local rules, to protect their local, natural resources. </strong></p>
<p>There are always a bunch of reasons why we can't act, but <strong>inaction, or inadequate action, has already cost us most of the World's coral reefs. </strong>We keep talking.. having endless meetings, seminars and doing research but on a global scale, science has not saved the reefs and the experts are often just chronicling the demise of our coral reefs.<strong> <i>Governments and big NGO's talk a lot about empowering local people but in reality, it almost never happens. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Working with local people we are taking action, right action, practical &amp; effective action, right down here at the local level. </strong>We're protecting as many reefs as we can, as cheaply as we can, and as fast as we can. </p>
<p>Based on experience around the World so far... <strong>It won't be governments or giant NGO's that save what's left of our coral reefs. If coral reefs are to be saved, it will be by local people who've been empowered to manage and protect their local reefs, for now, and for future generations. </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>'BUSINESS AS USUAL' IS THE GREATEST DANGER TO CORAL REEFS</u>  The sad reality is that all around the World coral reefs are dead and dying. </strong>Clearly, whatever we've done so far to save them, mostly, it hasn't worked. </p>
<p><strong><u>WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW!</u> </strong>We are doing what few others will do, we are helping local people to take charge, and we're doing it fast! </p>

The LPA's are mostly ‘house reefs’ at locally-owned homestays (small guesthouses) but we’ve also protected a 1.6km (1mile) long tidal inlet which is an important reef shark nursery. 
In January 2018 the first dive resort joined the program, protecting its own house reef and providing the marker buoys for three adjacent homestays. Also in January, we installed marker buoys at our first community reef project protecting 1km of coral reef and adjacent mangroves.
There are now 17 Locally Protected Areas (LPA's) scattered around Raja Ampat and with your support we will continue the work protecting beautiful coral reefs before it's too late. 
THE RAJA AMPAT HOMESTAY ASSOCIATION
The Homestay Association network is critical to the people and natural environment of Raja Ampat. The Association has the greatest potential to bring urgently needed economic development to the islands and it is the only realistic way we can see to facilitate widespread environmental protection (by local people).
The Homestay Association recently won a significant UN Award but it remains a ‘work in progress’ that needs your business, so if you’re thinking of visiting Raja Ampat and you want to get a real feel for this extraordinary place, please consider the homestays. The locations are stunning, the accommodations are simple, the food is great. The Association has many lovely homestays shown on its excellent website: www.stayrajaampat.com 
ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF LOCALLY PROTECTED AREAS (LPA's)  
I use a practical approach to the way I pitch the program to local people and communities. It is obvious that a protected ‘house reef’ is good for a homestay ecotourism business (or resort) so that’s an easy sell, although local fishermen do require some convincing. 
The government doesn't regulate small-scale local fishermen so fisheries are suffering from ‘The Trajedy of the Commons’, whereby a lack of regulation means anybody can take anything, so reef fish catches have dramatically declined. It means a fisherman will take undersize fish or lobsters or anything else because.. ‘if I don’t take it, somebody else will’. 
We explain to fishermen that LPA's become much-needed nurseries for reef fish, improving their livelihood over time. Once a Locally Protected Area is declared local people are empowered, with backing from Government, to refuse entry to fishermen from other areas.
THE FUTURE

Empowering local people to take charge of their environment, giving them the right to refuse access to outsiders and to stop unsustainable exploitation by their own people, provides the necessary foundation for a sustainable future.
Once a Locally Protected Area is declared it becomes the responsibility of the homestay owners and the community. They are responsible for maintenance of the buoys and enforcement of the rules. The future belongs to local people.
REPORTING, KEEPING YOU POSTED... 
We will report regularly on Indiegogo and...

Our website: www.greenworldbali.com 
We will post news on new LPA's as they’re created. We’ll post videos and photos as well as up to date information on our progress. 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The greatest risk we face now is the small size of the program but as it grows we expect it to become stronger. If we do all the planned locations this year we will spend 2019 following-up and supporting the Homestay Association to take ownership of the LPA Program. 
There are always challenges... Will the buoys be well-maintained? What happens if a boat hits a buoy? How long will the chains last? What happens if a buoy disappears? Will everybody abide by the rules? How do we get majority compliance? Can we monitor ecosystem changes after declaring the protected areas? Can the LPA Program be extended to address other threats coral reefs?
Solving these, and other, ongoing challenges is all about commitment and that's the whole point... The only people who are continually incentivized to deal with ongoing, day-to-day challenges, are the people who live on-site. Real protection & effective conservation has to be done by local people, applying local rules, to protect their local, natural resources. 
There are always a bunch of reasons why we can't act, but inaction, or inadequate action, has already cost us most of the World's coral reefs. We keep talking.. having endless meetings, seminars and doing research but on a global scale, science has not saved the reefs and the experts are often just chronicling the demise of our coral reefs. Governments and big NGO's talk a lot about empowering local people but in reality, it almost never happens. 
Working with local people we are taking action, right action, practical & effective action, right down here at the local level. We're protecting as many reefs as we can, as cheaply as we can, and as fast as we can. 
Based on experience around the World so far... It won't be governments or giant NGO's that save what's left of our coral reefs. If coral reefs are to be saved, it will be by local people who've been empowered to manage and protect their local reefs, for now, and for future generations. 
'BUSINESS AS USUAL' IS THE GREATEST DANGER TO CORAL REEFS  The sad reality is that all around the World coral reefs are dead and dying. Clearly, whatever we've done so far to save them, mostly, it hasn't worked. 
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND WE HAVE TO DO IT NOW! We are doing what few others will do, we are helping local people to take charge, and we're doing it fast!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a group of students at the University of Tennessee looking to give back to our community by contributing time and money to the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SevierHumaneSociety/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sevier County Humane Society</a>, to help lost and surrendered animals get the homes they deserve. We chose to help this non-profit because we all have a deep love for animals, have prior experience with Humane Societies by adopting animals of our own, and have felt a connection to help those affected by the tragic<a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/12/28/month-after-historic-fire-gatlinburg-rebuilds/95936774/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Gatlinburg wildfires</a>.</p>
<p>The Sevier County Humane Society is a 501(c)3 non-profit and was founded in 1974 with the mission of helping abandoned, homeless, and surrendered animals, and is a no-kill shelter. After the wildfires, they treated and rehabilitated all of the hurt and burned animals that they received, and, out of 400 animals, the University of Tennessee Veterinaries only had to euthanize two cats who were beyond hope.</p>
<p>The Sevier County Humane Society operates primarily on donations and community support. All contributions are used to create a safe, healthy, and comfortable environment for their animals, especially after the tragic wildfires took away the shelter that many abandoned animals temporarily call home.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Since the Gatlinburg wildfires, the Sevier County Humane Society has been temporarily located at the Sevier County Fairgrounds with limited resources and volunteers because the previous location had smoke damage and deemed unsafe to house the animals at the moment. Just recently, the Sevier County Humane Society was given short notice to leave the fair grounds and were forced to move back into their old shelter.</p>
<p>After the wildfires, the Sevier County Humane Society took in over 400 animals when people were unable to reach their homes because the City of Gatlinburg was evacuated and shut down. After the city was reopened, 97% of these animals were reclaimed.</p>
<p>The Sevier County Humane Society has done everything they can to keep their shelter running even though they have faced many obstacles. Having to relocate from the location they've had for years to a temporary location, being forced to leave a temporary location and move back to an unsafe shelter, and now they will have to build a temporary shelter and a brand new permanent shelter. This is where we need your help!</p>
<p>The new building is going to cost over a million dollars, but we want to get this project started! With your help, we are going to fund the building of one wall for a new shelter so that we can help these poor animals get the proper housing and supplies they need as quickly as possible. Every dollar that you donate will go to the well being animals during this stressful process of constantly changing envoirnments.</p>

Millions of people lack basic access to clean water. Together, we can change that.
Imagine heat and sweat under the blazing sun of mid-Summer.Imagine being the thirstiest you've ever been.Now, imagine drinking a glass of dirty water from a drainage ditch.That's the everyday reality for many people living in the remote parts of Nicaragua.There
is no substance more
vital to life on this planet than water. Despite our vast advances in
science and technology, it remains one of the few things for
which there can be absolutely no compromise and no substitute. In Nicaragua alone, nearly 1.5 Million people have no access to clean water. Nicaraguans in remote villages are forced to drink from contaminated wells and polluted streams. Their only water sources are filled with deadly amoebas and bacteria.THE PLANWith your contributions, we propose the following:1. Establishment of water packaging and distribution hubs in affected regions to get free, clean water to people as quickly as possible.2. Hiring members of the local community to package and distribute clean drinking water to areas with the greatest immediate need.3. Funding for the surveying and planning of sustainable, sanitary well-water systems in affected communities.4. Use funding in excess of our goal for additional immediate and sustainable water solutions, and provide direct support for other local NGOs.The project is simple.  We deliver water to affected communities NOW.We help build sustainable water infrastructure for the long term.THE TEAM

<p><b>Our Environment is Changing</b></p>
<p>Years of resource mismanagement and growing levels of consumerism are taking their toll. 80% of what we produce is used once and then discarded. Turning things around will take nothing short of a complete shift in the supply chain from raw materials to disposal.</p>

<p><b>Our Vision – Take the Next Step With Us</b></p>
<p>We can change the world, a step at a time. Take the next step with us. We’re asking for your help to provide the financing we need to continue to market and grow our listing and member base.</p>
<p>Our near term plans include launching the “eco-flyer” program, and the Green Pages Directory mobile app. </p>
<p>The long-term plan is to build Green Pages Directory into a global database, making it the biggest and most widely used tool for environmental change in the world.</p>
<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>What will my funds go towards?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The $100,000 contribution level will go towards continuing to market and grow our listing and member base, build our mobile app and launch our eco flyer program. Currently, we have 12,000 listing globally but we know that, with your support, we can grow our directory and community even more significantly in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>More importantly, your funds will help businesses and consumers around the world easily find information on the certified solutions, products and services that they need to live and operate more sustainably.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our larger vision is to expand the GreenPages Directory into the largest database globally, helping to grow a healthy, clean and green economy worldwide. Each contribution is substantial to help us grow our database,  magnifying the positive effects our innovative platform has already had on citizens, organizations and our planet.</p>
<p><b>What has the GreenPages Directory achieved so far?</b></p>
<p>For the first time ever, our streamlined, sustainability-focused platform has made complex and in-depth information about sustainable products, services and practices easy to understand and use. We are also offering an open space for businesses of all sizes – from entrepreneurs to multinational corporations – to share best practices on creating a more sustainable economy in our community.  End-users can learn about the important issues facing industry, comment on listings and benefit from searching and browsing our database.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To date, we have built a directory with over 12,000 listings spanning all business sectors making our platform relevant for the entire economy. We have also built a network of key non-profit and NGO supporters in our community such as Nature Canada, the Pembina Institute, the Sierra Club and the Worldwatch Institute – all who share their industry knowledge to support more informed and progressive choices.</p>
<p>The comprehensiveness and depth of our listings is unparalleled in the world.  Most importantly, our directory is contributing towards helping businesses and consumers green our global supply chains and protect our oceans, ecosystems, drinking water and natural resources.</p>

FAQ
What will my funds go towards?

The $100,000 contribution level will go towards continuing to market and grow our listing and member base, build our mobile app and launch our eco flyer program. Currently, we have 12,000 listing globally but we know that, with your support, we can grow our directory and community even more significantly in 2015 and 2016.
More importantly, your funds will help businesses and consumers around the world easily find information on the certified solutions, products and services that they need to live and operate more sustainably.


Our larger vision is to expand the GreenPages Directory into the largest database globally, helping to grow a healthy, clean and green economy worldwide. Each contribution is substantial to help us grow our database,  magnifying the positive effects our innovative platform has already had on citizens, organizations and our planet.

For the first time ever, our streamlined, sustainability-focused platform has made complex and in-depth information about sustainable products, services and practices easy to understand and use. We are also offering an open space for businesses of all sizes – from entrepreneurs to multinational corporations – to share best practices on creating a more sustainable economy in our community.  End-users can learn about the important issues facing industry, comment on listings and benefit from searching and browsing our database.


To date, we have built a directory with over 12,000 listings spanning all business sectors making our platform relevant for the entire economy. We have also built a network of key non-profit and NGO supporters in our community such as Nature Canada, the Pembina Institute, the Sierra Club and the Worldwatch Institute – all who share their industry knowledge to support more informed and progressive choices.
The comprehensiveness and depth of our listings is unparalleled in the world.  Most importantly, our directory is contributing towards helping businesses and consumers green our global supply chains and protect our oceans, ecosystems, drinking water and natural resources.

But it’s not just about kayaking, or accomplishing some sort of world record. My first visit to the Amazon in 2008 as a part of Team Easy Living (which achieved a still-held, record-setting win in the Great Amazon River Raft Race) was eye-opening.

Let’s take a look at the statistics:  </p><p>• To make one ton of paper towels 17 trees and 20,000 gallons of water are polluted. <br/>• In the U.S. we currently use more than 13 billion pounds of paper towels each year and that number is growing steadily. This equals more than 3,000 tons of paper towel waste in the U.S. alone. <br/>• Globally, discarded paper towels result in 254 million tons of trash every year. <br/>• As many as 51,000 trees per day are required to replace the number of paper towels that are discarded every day. <br/>• If every household in the U.S. used just one less 70-sheet roll of paper towels, that would save 544,000 trees each year. <br/>• If every household in the U.S. used three less rolls per year, it would save 120,000 tons of waste and $4.1 million in landfill dumping fees.</p><h2>Our Product - Bambu</h2><p><strong>The Alternative Green Project with Bambu</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473276685/hliiksrogjxnfccmxgew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> There are over 1200 species of bamboo on this planet. <strong>Bambu</strong> is manufactured from the bamboo species, <strong> </strong><strong>moso</strong><strong> bamboo</strong>, which is not eaten by pandas.

How absorbent is Bambu? Here is a video showing a real time test

What can you use Bambu for?
- Clean dusty area : Bambu will absorb dust and any small particles.- Clean your House : Kitchen area, Living room and restroom.- Clean any Drip : Water, sauces, oil, soda and more!- Clean your skin : From dirt, oily and greasy stain. - Clean your Electronics : Computer, tablet and phone. - Clean your pets : Dogs, Cats, Birds :)
 

Bambu Vs Cotton ragsWith that said, here is something to think about;Bambu Vs Paper towelThe paper towel industry is the third largest contributor to global warming. We owe it to ourselves, and the environment, to fully commit towards reducing waste through the elimination of paper based routines. Although the U.S. has taken great strides in “going green,” personal consumption of paper is rising higher than ever. Have you ever considered the impact your own usage of paper products has on the world? Let’s break it down even further and solely focus on our paper towel consumption.  Paper towels have long ruled as the choice of habit, even when high-speed hand dryers or dish cloths are present. Yet they are one of the most wasteful things we spend our money on and dispose of every day without regret. It was hard to imagine that something as paper towel usage could cause such a devastating environmental impact – so we did some research. Let’s take a look at the statistics:  • To make one ton of paper towels 17 trees and 20,000 gallons of water are polluted. • In the U.S. we currently use more than 13 billion pounds of paper towels each year and that number is growing steadily. This equals more than 3,000 tons of paper towel waste in the U.S. alone. • Globally, discarded paper towels result in 254 million tons of trash every year. • As many as 51,000 trees per day are required to replace the number of paper towels that are discarded every day. • If every household in the U.S. used just one less 70-sheet roll of paper towels, that would save 544,000 trees each year. • If every household in the U.S. used three less rolls per year, it would save 120,000 tons of waste and $4.1 million in landfill dumping fees.Our Product - BambuThe Alternative Green Project with Bambu There are over 1200 species of bamboo on this planet. Bambu is manufactured from the bamboo species,  moso bamboo, which is not eaten by pandas. So do not worry we didn't take any food from all the pandas in the world :)We found a better alternative for cleaning cloth that can provide an eco-friendly solution to many of our modern requirements. Bambu is quite simply, a wonderful, green resource that is hugely beneficial both to the way we want to live our lives and to the environment.The fiber is filled with micro gaps and micro-holes which allows for better moisture absorption and repel any Bacteria. You can rest easy knowing that after each wash, no bacteria will remain on Bambu.Bambu is naturally antibacterial and anti-fungal because of a bacteriostatic agent unique to bamboo plants called ""bamboo kun"" which also helps Bambu resist harboring odors.Manufacturing of Bambu

Bambu is weaved for 5 cycles using our advanced air jet loom machine to get the best and strongest finished product so it can last for years!
Facts about Biodegradable Bambu material

Bambu is 100% natural and biodegradable which gives conscientious consumers real peace of mind. Once you have no further use for Bambu you can rest easy, knowing that it will return to the Earth leaving a minimal environmental impact. It is so much better to enjoy a product that has a small environmental footprint and leaves barely a trace.

<p>I'm a Year 2 student at University of Wales, Trinity St David in Carmarthen and I study Outdoor Education.  As part of our second year, we are required to run an expedition in the UK on an entirely self sufficient basis but do not get any substantial support from the establishment we pay £7500 a year to!  I want to run the best expedition this uni has ever seen in one of the iconic parts of our contry - Snowdonia National Park.  I want to prove to our uni that the sky's the limit and that as students we're able to be innovative and creative beyond the ordinary!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>I need funding for fuel costs to Snowdonia from Carmarthen, West Wales.  I also need to buy bits of equipment such as bouldering crash pads, food and maps for the expedition.  I had worked this out as being around £350, but with indiegogo putting a minimum of £500 I will invest the extra money in either renting a van to use for the duration of the expedition, or putting it toward better quality safety equipment.</p>
<p>If we don't meet the full £500 then I intend to use whatever we have made to put toward fuel costs, expedition food and equipment for the group!</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Rob Simkins...
I'm a Year 2 student at University of Wales, Trinity St David in Carmarthen and I study Outdoor Education.  As part of our second year, we are required to run an expedition in the UK on an entirely self sufficient basis but do not get any substantial support from the establishment we pay £7500 a year to!  I want to run the best expedition this uni has ever seen in one of the iconic parts of our contry - Snowdonia National Park.  I want to prove to our uni that the sky's the limit and that as students we're able to be innovative and creative beyond the ordinary!   What We Need I need funding for fuel costs to Snowdonia from Carmarthen, West Wales.  I also need to buy bits of equipment such as bouldering crash pads, food and maps for the expedition.  I had worked this out as being around £350, but with indiegogo putting a minimum of £500 I will invest the extra money in either renting a van to use for the duration of the expedition, or putting it toward better quality safety equipment.
If we don't meet the full £500 then I intend to use whatever we have made to put toward fuel costs, expedition food and equipment for the group!
    The Impact I'm one of the thousands of students nowadays who is paying well over the odds for my education, all of us are being left short changed by a system that isn't fair, and does not provide value for the vast amounts of money the taxpayer is paying now, and we will have to pay later in our lives.  The changing nature of my chosen course means that our year is the first year to have transport support withdrawn from this module which severely limits the range of activity and areas we can access in order to make this once in a lifetime chance a memorable one.

    Risks & Challenges In terms of risks - of course there is an element of risk in mountaineering, but that's what adventure is all about!  Identifying the risks and working to overcome them, which is down to my planning and ability as expedition leader - and I am 110% confident that I am capable of doing so.

boat, then built a tiny skiff powered with a Seagull outboard engine. It got us
to and from Hanson Island, but the trips were definitely risky.  After that, we used a succession of bought and borrowed
boats with outboard engines in various states of repair that got us to the mid
1990s.  Then a wonderful English
couple introduced by the Born Free Foundation came to visit.  After a tour of the area in our “old

increasingly difficult to keep the <i>June
Cove </i>running, because of a succession of costly issues with the engine. This
year we’ve decided to ‘bite the bullet’ and replace the old engine with a new
one that will keep our project going for many years to come. The purchase cost
of the engine is around $30,000, but we think the final cost, after

<div>Orangutans are endangered, having declined by over half in the last 60 years alone due to destructive and unsustainable human activities. Today, only an estimated 50,000 Bornean Orangutans are left in the world. This is important because these Orangutans live only on the island of Borneo and are found nowhere else on earth. Once this species is lost from Borneo they will be globally extinct forever! Without serious and immediate conservation action this possible fate could become a reality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Orangutans and their habitat are in desperate need of protection from human activities that are rapidly destroying their rich rainforest ecosystems. Orangutans are directly threatened by hunting and habitat loss, logging, mining and land clearing for oil palm plantations and small-scale agriculture. Many National Park Buffer Zones, areas surrounding the park, have been designated as plantation concessions, thereby destroying important blocks of habitat for endangered and threatened species, and leaving the surrounding communities with few income alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture and illegal logging inside the National Park.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But here's the problem - how can one protect something if they don't know it's in trouble? How can one help save something that is disappearing if they don't know how? Education is key to conservation. We all can learn to live more sustainably, or become educated on a global problem we never knew existed. This is true for the communities surrounding Gunung Palung National Park (where we work!) in Indonesian Borneo.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is still hope for orangutans and their habitat - don't let them disappear!</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Program (that's us!), known locally in Indonesia as Yayasan Palung, works on the ground, at the forefront of the battle to save this magnificent species, the orangutan, and it's habitat, while strengthening the communities and lives of the people living around Gunung Palung National Park. With over a decade of experience in developing and implementing environmental education programs for adults and children alike, we are building knowledge and capacity within communities to protect the orangutan and Gunung Palung National Park, while also strengthening the economic survival of local communities.   </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2 class=""Style5"">Where Is This Happening?</h2>
<p class=""Style5"">Gunung Palung National Park, located in Indonesian Borneo, represents one of the most important blocks of orangutan habitat left in the world. It is home to one of the only remaining viable wild populations, with an estimated 2,500 orangutans, as well as other endangered wildlife, such as gibbons, Malayan sunbears, proboscis monkeys, pangolins, and tarsiers. The wild orangutan population outside of the park's protected area, in the two regencies of Ketapang and Kayong Utara, is roughly equal to the population inside the park itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Are Trying To Accomplish</strong></h2>
<p>We are raising money to continue our work, building on 14 years of conservation education and action through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing and expanding our school and youth group education programs, exposing local children from Borneo to the wonders of rainforest biodiversity in their own backyard.</li>
<li>Providing university scholarships to help build Indonesia's next conservation leaders.</li>
<li>Helping Indonesian communities obtain community rights to their forests and learn optimal forest management models.</li>
<li>Building increased knowledge on actionable steps communities can take to better protect orangutans, their landscape and develop their capacity to withstand environmental changes.</li>
<li>Producing weekly radio programs, raising awareness and calling local people to action.</li>
<li>Helping local communities develop income alternatives to cutting down the rainforest of Borneo, strengthening communities' economic capacity, while also preserving the forest for generations to come. </li>
</ul>
<p>By donating to GPOCP today and helping us reach our fundraising goal you will be helping to directly protect orangutans and Gunung Palung National Park, preserving incredible and endangered wildlife, and strengthening rural communities for generations to come.</p>
<p><strong>Our target is $10,000, but anything and everything we receive goes directly into our invaluable work - you can contribute any amount you like.</strong></p>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<h2>What Else Can I Do?</h2>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to GPOCP today you can still help - spread the word about our program and about orangutans to as many people as you know!</p>

</div></div>","Here's the Deal
Orangutans are endangered, having declined by over half in the last 60 years alone due to destructive and unsustainable human activities. Today, only an estimated 50,000 Bornean Orangutans are left in the world. This is important because these Orangutans live only on the island of Borneo and are found nowhere else on earth. Once this species is lost from Borneo they will be globally extinct forever! Without serious and immediate conservation action this possible fate could become a reality.
 
Orangutans and their habitat are in desperate need of protection from human activities that are rapidly destroying their rich rainforest ecosystems. Orangutans are directly threatened by hunting and habitat loss, logging, mining and land clearing for oil palm plantations and small-scale agriculture. Many National Park Buffer Zones, areas surrounding the park, have been designated as plantation concessions, thereby destroying important blocks of habitat for endangered and threatened species, and leaving the surrounding communities with few income alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture and illegal logging inside the National Park.
 
But here's the problem - how can one protect something if they don't know it's in trouble? How can one help save something that is disappearing if they don't know how? Education is key to conservation. We all can learn to live more sustainably, or become educated on a global problem we never knew existed. This is true for the communities surrounding Gunung Palung National Park (where we work!) in Indonesian Borneo.
 
There is still hope for orangutans and their habitat - don't let them disappear!
 
Who We Are
Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Program (that's us!), known locally in Indonesia as Yayasan Palung, works on the ground, at the forefront of the battle to save this magnificent species, the orangutan, and it's habitat, while strengthening the communities and lives of the people living around Gunung Palung National Park. With over a decade of experience in developing and implementing environmental education programs for adults and children alike, we are building knowledge and capacity within communities to protect the orangutan and Gunung Palung National Park, while also strengthening the economic survival of local communities.   
 

Where Is This Happening?
Gunung Palung National Park, located in Indonesian Borneo, represents one of the most important blocks of orangutan habitat left in the world. It is home to one of the only remaining viable wild populations, with an estimated 2,500 orangutans, as well as other endangered wildlife, such as gibbons, Malayan sunbears, proboscis monkeys, pangolins, and tarsiers. The wild orangutan population outside of the park's protected area, in the two regencies of Ketapang and Kayong Utara, is roughly equal to the population inside the park itself.
 
What We Are Trying To Accomplish
We are raising money to continue our work, building on 14 years of conservation education and action through:

Continuing and expanding our school and youth group education programs, exposing local children from Borneo to the wonders of rainforest biodiversity in their own backyard.
Providing university scholarships to help build Indonesia's next conservation leaders.
Helping Indonesian communities obtain community rights to their forests and learn optimal forest management models.
Building increased knowledge on actionable steps communities can take to better protect orangutans, their landscape and develop their capacity to withstand environmental changes.
Producing weekly radio programs, raising awareness and calling local people to action.
Helping local communities develop income alternatives to cutting down the rainforest of Borneo, strengthening communities' economic capacity, while also preserving the forest for generations to come. 

By donating to GPOCP today and helping us reach our fundraising goal you will be helping to directly protect orangutans and Gunung Palung National Park, preserving incredible and endangered wildlife, and strengthening rural communities for generations to come.
Our target is $10,000, but anything and everything we receive goes directly into our invaluable work - you can contribute any amount you like.
 
What Else Can I Do?
Even if you can't contribute to GPOCP today you can still help - spread the word about our program and about orangutans to as many people as you know!
If you think you can help us and our cause in other ways please don't hesitate to contact us at yayasanpalung@gmail.com

(CAER) has been a Dream and Goal of mine for over 18 years. I studied Environmental Engineering and Physics at Humboldt State University hoping to make a difference in the planet and the lives of people! I found myself in Corporate America focused strictly on profit and the bottom line… Then I became the bottom line, I was downsized!! Disgusted with Corporate America I sought my original ideals and goals thus CAER was born. Two years and every dime we had went into research on how we can change the energy industry. How can we reduce our dependency on heavy polluting fuels, recycle waste into fuel and reuse the byproducts that came out of that process? Well we did it and our first BioFuels Project is ready for its launch! Your donation will change how we as a fuel dependent society structure our fuel system and take the control out of the big corporations and put it into the hands of the local economies and communities!!</p>
<p>Our Project is centered on recycling and reusing what we are currently wasting and creating a synergistic approach that is focused on balance, and not strictly profit! Everywhere we went for investors they wanted control over our company mission and demanded high profit margins, which went against our company vision.  We want to lower prices in the market, and give back to the local communities!! We at CAER feel it is our responsibility to find better alternatives to what we are doing to our environment and <em>YOUR donation is critical to keeping the integrity of this project.  </em>We are bringing back the balance of business, for the community and the planet!! Once we complete this project we can help others implement this process in any wine region, and any country in the world!!

<p>We are seeking $1,000,000.00 in startup funding for this project. We have trimmed and refined the process so that we can get the project done for much less than originally estimated.  CAER will take 30,000 tons of biomass that can be diverted from the landfill, or areas of farms that are a dumping ground for this biomass to slowly decay. This biomass will be recycled into high end compost, and much needed Biofuel for the local area. The compost will be used to reinfuse the soil for local farms and the fuel to provide relief from high priced petroleum products. This synergistic approach is what CAER, Inc. is all about. This project will save valuable space in the landfill, create a boost to farmers’ crop yields, and produce Biofuel that is clean and less expensive than our current petroleum option. We will need seed separators that can deal with wine press waste. Seed presses to extract the oil. Tractors and compost turners are needed for the processing of the skins and stems into compost. Finally mobile industrial grade biodiesel processors will be purchased to produce 250,000 gallons of biodiesel in the first year. There will need to be land and substructure that can handle trucks for dumping off the waste material and loaders to move it around. We will need a covered main processing building and an office for administration work.</p>

Disgusted with Corporate America I sought my original ideals and goals thus CAER was born. Two years and every dime we had went into research on how we can change the energy industry.

Well we did it and our first BioFuels Project is ready for its launch! Your donation will change how we as a fuel dependent society structure our fuel system and take the control out of the big corporations and put it into the hands of the local economies and communities!!

<p><strong>Introducing Tare Market, Minnesota's first zero waste store!</strong></p>
<p>Born out of a need for a local resource to help people reduce their waste and overall carbon footprint, we are excited to open our permanent location in South Minneapolis to better serve our community.</p>
<p>At Tare Market, customers can bring their own containers (or borrow some from us), to shop our robust bulk selection. We will offer shelf stable foods, health and beauty items, and household sustainable living products (e.g. reusable straws, bulk cleaners, and compostable dish brushes). All items at Tare Market will be free of non-recycled plastic, and as local and organic as possible. We strive to find the high quality products that are good for you and for the planet, and work with vendors to reduce upstream waste as well. Tare Market will also offer classes and events for members of the community to come together and learn strategies to improve the health of our planet.</p>

<p>Did you know that every plastic toothbrush you have ever used is sitting in a landfill, not decomposing? Yep. And that even most of the food we throw away doesn't break down (see the story about the 25 year old petrified guacamole).</p>
<p>Most of the trash in a landfill does not decompose because it is covered, compacted, and not exposed to oxygen. Instead, trash becomes preserved under tons and tons of other trash. This process causes landfills to off-gas large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and contributes to the contamination of surrounding soil and groundwater.</p>
<p>Imagine, instead, that your toothbrush came in a paper sleeve and was made of bamboo. The bamboo could be thrown in your backyard compost bin, along with your food scraps, and the paper sleeve could be recycled. By using a toothbrush made from natural materials, you avoid putting any waste into the landfill, saving communities of it's negative ramifications. Plus, you can make nutrient-rich compost to feed your garden and plants!</p>

<p>Shopping at Tare Market makes living a low waste lifestyle easy! We vet all of the products we carry (and their producers!) so you know you are only buying high quality products that are good for the environment and for you. While some of our products come in compostable or recyclable (plastic-free) wrapping, we are continuing to find ways to offer as many products as possible in bulk or with absolutely no packaging! To shop our bulk selection of goods, simply bring your own bags and containers, or borrow our returnable jars, tare them, and fill up on as much or as little as you want.</p>

<p>The founders of Tare Market, Kate and Amber, wanted to live more sustainably by creating less waste, but felt that they had limited options in the Twin Cities. While they would find eco-friendly resources here and there, a place they could go that fulfilled most or all of their waste-free needs did not exist. At community events, they continuously heard from locals that they wanted greater access to food and products that were good for them AND package-free.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2018, Kate and Amber decided to start Tare Market. They began by holding pop-ups around the Twin Cities and were floored by the overwhelmingly positive response from community members. Requests for a brick and mortar store where people could shop waste-free on a regular basis were frequent! After six months of concept-testing Tare Market, Amber and Kate are ready to take the next step and open a permanent retail space in Minneapolis. </p>

<p>Zero waste markets have started popping up all over the world, but the U.S. has very few, and none that exactly fit the Tare Market model. We would be the first store of our kind in the U.S., and the very first package/waste free store in Minnesota. Of course, with any new idea or venture there is risk, so we have tried to mitigate that risk by popping-up around the Twin Cities to test out our business model. Since our first pop-up in August 2018, Tare Market has reached over 1,000 customers, and counting, and successfully launched our online shop. We have had an overwhelmingly positive response from consumers, asking for more zero waste options and more access. We believe that this model with be successful here in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>To further support or model and expand our reach, Tare Market plans to continue to pop-up several times a year in new areas of the Twin Cities to grow the zero waste movement locally. We feel that these pop-ups will create a community across the Twin Cities of committed and motivated individuals. </p>
<p>Tare Market will offer educational classes for the Twin Cities community, with high-quality speakers. Classes will include speakers, DIY activities, meeting space for book clubs, and more. </p>

Because we crushed our crowdfunding goal and hit our first stretch goal of an additional $1,500, we have set a second stretch goal for another $1,500 to help us strengthen our offerings in the health and beauty section of our space. This is an area that our customer base has been asking for. At Tare Market, we really want to meet people where they are at and not shame anyone who creates waste. We believe that the more people involved in this movement, the bigger our impact will be.
This additional $1,500 will help us bring zero waste makeup into our space, including mascara, blush, eye shadow, lipstick, foundation, and more. We are sourcing these items from zero waste and low waste manufactures who offer their items in bulk, glass, or refillable compacts. Help us get there by donating today! 
Introducing Tare Market, Minnesota's first zero waste store!
Born out of a need for a local resource to help people reduce their waste and overall carbon footprint, we are excited to open our permanent location in South Minneapolis to better serve our community.
At Tare Market, customers can bring their own containers (or borrow some from us), to shop our robust bulk selection. We will offer shelf stable foods, health and beauty items, and household sustainable living products (e.g. reusable straws, bulk cleaners, and compostable dish brushes). All items at Tare Market will be free of non-recycled plastic, and as local and organic as possible. We strive to find the high quality products that are good for you and for the planet, and work with vendors to reduce upstream waste as well. Tare Market will also offer classes and events for members of the community to come together and learn strategies to improve the health of our planet.


...because we are not okay with images like these and we know you aren't either.
Did you know that every plastic toothbrush you have ever used is sitting in a landfill, not decomposing? Yep. And that even most of the food we throw away doesn't break down (see the story about the 25 year old petrified guacamole).
Most of the trash in a landfill does not decompose because it is covered, compacted, and not exposed to oxygen. Instead, trash becomes preserved under tons and tons of other trash. This process causes landfills to off-gas large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and contributes to the contamination of surrounding soil and groundwater.
Imagine, instead, that your toothbrush came in a paper sleeve and was made of bamboo. The bamboo could be thrown in your backyard compost bin, along with your food scraps, and the paper sleeve could be recycled. By using a toothbrush made from natural materials, you avoid putting any waste into the landfill, saving communities of it's negative ramifications. Plus, you can make nutrient-rich compost to feed your garden and plants!

Shopping at Tare Market makes living a low waste lifestyle easy! We vet all of the products we carry (and their producers!) so you know you are only buying high quality products that are good for the environment and for you. While some of our products come in compostable or recyclable (plastic-free) wrapping, we are continuing to find ways to offer as many products as possible in bulk or with absolutely no packaging! To shop our bulk selection of goods, simply bring your own bags and containers, or borrow our returnable jars, tare them, and fill up on as much or as little as you want.


The founders of Tare Market, Kate and Amber, wanted to live more sustainably by creating less waste, but felt that they had limited options in the Twin Cities. While they would find eco-friendly resources here and there, a place they could go that fulfilled most or all of their waste-free needs did not exist. At community events, they continuously heard from locals that they wanted greater access to food and products that were good for them AND package-free.
In the summer of 2018, Kate and Amber decided to start Tare Market. They began by holding pop-ups around the Twin Cities and were floored by the overwhelmingly positive response from community members. Requests for a brick and mortar store where people could shop waste-free on a regular basis were frequent! After six months of concept-testing Tare Market, Amber and Kate are ready to take the next step and open a permanent retail space in Minneapolis. 





Vote with you dollars for a  system that doesn't create waste and helps move the world towards a brighter, greener future. By backing this campaign, you are doing just that!
In addition to our personal investments and a loan, we are hoping to raise $15,000 to help us bring package-free shopping to the Twin Cities. The funds will be used to purchase 100 bulk bins, inventory, nut and coffee grinders, and a refrigerator for our brick and mortar space. If we reach that, we have set flex goals so we can provide even more zero waste resources! Every little bit helps us (and the planet!) and we appreciate anything you can give. 


We have some amazing perks for you for donating! You can chose to pick-up your reward at our launch party (exact date TBD) in South Minneapolis or have us ship your item(s).
The Rewards:
Here are just a few examples of our rewards! Check out all of the rewards on the right side of this webpage.
$20 - Zero Waste Vegan E-Cookbook - Download a copy of @tinyyellowbungalow's brand new e-guide ""The Zero Waste Vegan Cookbook"". This one of a kind digital cookbook includes a month’s worth of healthy, low waste, and plant based recipes!
$65 - Zero Waste Coffee Experience - Join local coffee roaster SK Coffee at their roastery in LynLake. There, you'll experience and learn about coffee roasting, tasting, and how SK Coffee is aspiring to be zero waste. Take home 340 grams of coffee in your Tare Market cloth bag or bring your own jar to fill with beans. Date of event to be determined by purchaser(s) and SK Coffee.
$99 - Zero Waste Market Kit - This kit provides you with tools to help you reduce waste while shopping your local market. It’s also a great starter kit for the new zero waster, and makes a great gift for friends and family interested in living more sustainably!





Zero waste markets have started popping up all over the world, but the U.S. has very few, and none that exactly fit the Tare Market model. We would be the first store of our kind in the U.S., and the very first package/waste free store in Minnesota. Of course, with any new idea or venture there is risk, so we have tried to mitigate that risk by popping-up around the Twin Cities to test out our business model. Since our first pop-up in August 2018, Tare Market has reached over 1,000 customers, and counting, and successfully launched our online shop. We have had an overwhelmingly positive response from consumers, asking for more zero waste options and more access. We believe that this model with be successful here in the Twin Cities.
To further support or model and expand our reach, Tare Market plans to continue to pop-up several times a year in new areas of the Twin Cities to grow the zero waste movement locally. We feel that these pop-ups will create a community across the Twin Cities of committed and motivated individuals. 
Tare Market will offer educational classes for the Twin Cities community, with high-quality speakers. Classes will include speakers, DIY activities, meeting space for book clubs, and more. 


We so appreciate you and your support, even if it is not monetary! Here are some other ways that you can help launch Tare Market:

<h3>My name is Leandra Taylor; I’m the Coordinator for the Merge Coalition in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I wanted to share with you why I believe in the Emerging Leaders Program—and why I believe it needs your support.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504050345/taeo6sj0yd29fkv6cndx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>2016 Emerging Leader Leandra Taylor.</i></p>
<p>I’m an Army brat. I grew up behind the tall, iron gates that border the perimeter of Fort Carson Army Base in Colorado Springs. Nature was my escape and my place of solace and happiness—but nature meant exploring the flowers and weeds in the Base’s Iron Horse Park, where my dad, his pants wrinkled from a day's work, dried sweat fanning out in white ripples on his tan shirt and the smell of his Degree deodorant preceding him, would take me and my brother to play. I can still remember the dry, feathery texture of dandelion seeds on my tongue as I tasted the desiccated flower—it was like eating a spider web—and gawking at the Rockies beyond the gate in their magnificent glory. I never imaged that I might one day reach their summits.</p>
<p>My first “real” outdoor experience came on my first weekend in Albuquerque. After graduating from Baylor University with a B.S. in Environmental Science, I’d moved to New Mexico to work as a data management assistant for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. Friends had invited me to hike La Luz Trail to the crest of the Sandia Mountains. The 14-mile hike was both physically challenging—the altitude was killing me; I had to take a break every few switchbacks—and exhilarating. I’ll never forget the tawny brown gravel of the trail, the thorny cholla plants that crowded its edges, or the breathtaking views from the top, the scaly towers of the Sandia peaks ringing the purple sky.</p>
<p>I’ll also never forget the stares. Apparently, I, too, was a sight to see, an African-American woman out hiking amid the desert foliage.</p>
<p>“I’ll be sure to always hike with a white friend,” I said to my partners after yet another hiker gawked at me. “Maybe people won’t be so suspicious.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the beautiful vistas, I’d never felt more at home. But as hiker after hiker stared at me, I also didn’t feel welcome.</p>
<p>After the hike, I posted pictures of my trip. My family and friends were astonished. They couldn’t believe I’d been hiking, either.</p>
<p>What I’d experienced on the hike was awe, and joy; though I didn’t realize it at the time, hikes like that would also become a place for healing. But the most extraordinary thing was the reactions—of the other hikers, and of my family and friends. People of color don’t hike!</p>
<p>With that one hike, a passion was born in me, a desire to get people of color into the outdoors and change the narrative of who’s outside. The reason my family reacted the way they did, the reason the other hikers stared, was because we’re not used to seeing people of color outside. Think about it: when was the last time you saw a photo of an African-American woman hiking in the pages of your favorite outdoor magazine?</p>
<p>After that hike, I decided I would be that black face outside. I would be that black voice demanding space in the outdoors, sparking conversations about inclusion—or more accurately about being invited, but not feeling included.</p>
<p>But I didn’t understand how hard the work would be. Though I was slowly emerging as a leader in the conservation movement, conversations about the lack of diversity, especially racial diversity, in the outdoors were wearing me out. I often felt as though I were fighting to validate my presence outside. The work was exhausting.</p>
<p>The Emerging Leaders Program took place around the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. For three days in advance of SHIFT, 33 other young people like myself gathered in Jackson, WY, to discuss outdoor recreation and our public lands. Though we represented many different perspectives and backgrounds, we were united by our love for being outside, and for protecting the places in which we liked to play.  </p>

<p>An integral part of The Emerging Leaders Program, and of SHIFT, is storytelling: creating a space of mutual respect for one another by sharing the stories of how we’ve come to fall in love with these places, and why we believe they need to be protected. Late one dark, magical evening, on one of the first nights of the program, I sat in a circle at the Teton Science Schools with my fellow Emerging Leaders. The room was cozy with warmth, as if a fire were burning in the room, as we shared our stories about what had inspired us to get into this field.</p>
<p>The conversations were electric with passion, and the breadth of stories blew my mind. One leader, a woman whose quiet grace belied her strength, began by saying that while she understood the conservation movement, she didn’t identify with it.</p>
<p>“I fought to keep a new industrial factory from being built in my community and killing my neighbors, my family, my friends,” she said. “Nobody listened.”</p>
<p>“If conservationists don’t care about my community, why should I care about public lands?”</p>
<p>She was fighting for basic rights for her community. The program for her was not about protecting public lands; it was an opportunity to network and grow as a leader so that she could be a powerful voice for her community.</p>
<p>Her words shook me. The conservation and environmental justice movements are often viewed as separate issues. Now I understood how important the relationship between them actually is.</p>
<p>As an army brat, I’d often lacked a sense of place; the transient lifestyle makes it difficult to truly connect to people. So I was surprised when two fellow Emerging Leaders shared stories about their childhoods—they, too, were army brats, with struggles and emotions similar to mine. After the storytelling circle had ended, we talked. Before my dad boarded the bus to deploy to Iraq, he’d promised me and my brothers we’d go to Iron Horse Park when he returned. My new friends understood he’d said that to comfort us. Crying and bonding over the stories we shared, we realized the bond we’d just discovered would never be broken.</p>
<p>On the third day of the program we transferred to SHIFT, where we were featured as panelists, panel hosts, moderators. As we shared our stories and experiences with the “veterans” of outdoor recreation and conservation, they listened. Individually and collectively, our voices rippled through the SHIFT conference, setting the tone for the changes we wanted to see.</p>
<p>As I contributed to the conversations, I felt heard as I’d never been heard before. I went from being empowered to in power, networking and seeking paths to achieve the changes I want to see in my communities and around the nation.</p>

</div></div>","The Problem:
The family Coffee farms in the Los Santos region of Costa
Rica produce some of the finest coffees in the world. But the
consequences of common agricultural practices is the destruction of top soil,
deforestation, and erosion!! 
Our Response:
We founded Santos Projects and Tours in 2003, it was the final project of
two business-tourism students at Cartago Community College in Cartago, Costa
Rica. Santos Tours arranges and supervises high school and college students as
short-term, home-stay guests in 6 key communities to introduce project-based
green technologies â€“ Some of our projects include building ecostoves, compost
toilets, ecobricks (using plastic bottles stuffed with plastic bags to create
construction bricks), and furthering international awareness of the ecological
concerns in this beautiful region of Costa Rica. 
Slowly, we are transforming the mentality and sustainability of our coffee
culture communities to be more environmentally conscious.
Our Next Step:
To further our commitment to sustainability and increase our demonstration
of the value and viability of green practices, we want to bring certified
biodiesel technology to our farmers to further increase their ability to
preserve their livelihood for future generations. We lead by example.
With your help we intend to provide the first example of practical biodiesel
transportation in these communities.
Our roots in this region, and the trust we have earned through our volunteer
projects gives us tremendous exposure and credibility. We are ready to take the
next step by demonstrating the possibility of carbon-neutral communities.
Our plan is to purchase a reliable Chevy express Diesel or similar 15 passenger 4x4 and convert it to biodiesel. We will use it to transport our
student volunteer groups to and from their projects and between these mountainous
communities. We would also use this demonstration vehicle in our additional
eco-tourism projects throughout this beautiful region. 
Our volunteers partner company, International Student Volunteers, (www.isvonline.org) has already
demonstrated their belief and confidence in our abilities by providing us with
the biodiesel production technology, whereby we are able to transform
previously discarded oil from small restaurants into what is definitely the
cheapest and cleanest fuel source available. We will be able to demonstrate
carbon-neutral transportation as a legitimate, reliable, and viable alternative

<p>My name is Elena Couce, and as many people do, I truly fell in love with the oceans when I started scuba diving. I was driven to learn all I could about them, and now I work as a coral reef scientist at the University of Bristol, trying to understand how climate change is affecting our oceans. In the last few years I have spent thousands of hours conducting research on a computer. Now I feel it is time to leave the computer behind and begin field research and exploration, in order to understand how things really are in the oceans and to share these insights with others.</p>
<p>On January 16th 2014 I will begin a 14-month expedition cycling along the coast of a tropical region in Southeast Asia known as The Coral Triangle. With the help of other researchers and adventurers I will be documenting the extraordinary biodiversity region that is the underwater equivalent of the Amazon. It harbours more species than any other marine environment on the planet, including 76% of all coral types and more than 3000 species of fish. And, like the Amazon and other natural wonders of the world, the Coral Triangle is under grave threat.</p>
<p>I will cycle through the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to document the state of their coral reefs and of the communities that depend on it; to share my academic knowledge and learn from local people and organisations; to engage with local and western schools to share our findings, raise awareness and instil into as many children as possible a sense of wonder about our oceans and the amazing creatures that live in it.</p>

<p>During my tour I will visit marine reserves and conservation projects in the coast, carry out interviews with conservationists, scientists and local people to find out what is happening, go snorkelling and scuba diving, and take photos and videos --both in and out of the water-- to share my journey with the world, through my <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cycling-the-coral-triangle/cyclingcoraltriangle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website and blog</a>.</p>
<p>I won't always be alone. Several people will join me as I go along at different times in the route. There is also a
<a href=""http://cyclingcoraltriangle.org/abt/the-support-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support team</a> back home, working to make the most of this opportunity to raise awareness for marine conservation. It includes people who work in science engagement and education (who will help make it possible for schools to follow the trip), people who work in the media field, a professional photographer, and even an artist, among others.</p>

They all want to get the message out, tell the stories of the lands and waters they protect, of the life in them, and the work that still needs to be done.</p>
<p>We will also raise money to help with marine conservation in the area.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Green Driving Challenge</span></p> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Introducing The Green
Driving Challenge – an eco-driving game that makes it fun and easy to reduce
your carbon footprint. </p>
<p><b>The objective is to get
better mileage than your car’s city and highway mileage ratings</b>. It’s
like a Fitbit for your car that helps you save money and protect the
environment. Players are rewarded for accomplishments such as saving their
first $10 on gas, averting 500 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub>, and reducing fuel
consumption by 10%.</p>
<p>Once you’ve plugged an
On Board Diagnostics (OBD) scanner into your car’s data port, you can turn on your
mobile device and head out on the road. The GDC app does the hard work for you.
It collects driving data from your trips, crunches the numbers and yields
personal, easy-to-read information. </p>
<p>The Green Driving Challenge
is safe, responsive, engaging, and downright habit-forming. Most users
will be delighted to watch their carbon footprints shrink, and as a bonus,
they'll save between $150 and $300 on gas per year.</p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461590387/general_GDC_cn7rtd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Check out this great review at <a href=""http://automoblog.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Automoblog.net</a> to learn more about how it works. <br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Eco-Driving</h3>
<div></div>
<b>So, what is eco-driving? </b>Vehicle maintenance and anticipation, paying close attention to the roadway environment and to other vehicles are at its core. When possible, eco-drivers time their trips to avoid traffic congestion, avoid unnecessary idling and rapid acceleration, and try to maintain reasonable and consistent speeds. It’s not difficult! The trick is to keep at it, and most players will reduce fuel use by 5 to 25%.</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461590510/eco-driving_image_xedysr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>By playing the game, you'll learn why most truck drivers and millions of people all over the world are already eco-driving.</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How it Works</h3> <p></p>
<p>After you initially plug in the OBD scanner into your vehicle’s OBD port, using the <b>GDC</b> app is as easy as 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p><b>First</b>, press connect on the GDC app before you start a trip; <b>second</b>, hit the road; and, <b>third</b>, go to the website and check out your results.</p>
<p>The app uploads the trip data, evaluates the numbers and gives players crucial driving information, from dollars saved to improved MPG to carbon dioxide reductions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461590736/OBD_scanner_kvigib.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

</div><div><b><br/></b></div></div>","The Green Driving Challenge 

Introducing The Green
Driving Challenge – an eco-driving game that makes it fun and easy to reduce
your carbon footprint. 
The objective is to get
better mileage than your car’s city and highway mileage ratings. It’s
like a Fitbit for your car that helps you save money and protect the
environment. Players are rewarded for accomplishments such as saving their
first $10 on gas, averting 500 pounds of CO2, and reducing fuel
consumption by 10%.
Once you’ve plugged an
On Board Diagnostics (OBD) scanner into your car’s data port, you can turn on your
mobile device and head out on the road. The GDC app does the hard work for you.
It collects driving data from your trips, crunches the numbers and yields
personal, easy-to-read information. 
The Green Driving Challenge
is safe, responsive, engaging, and downright habit-forming. Most users
will be delighted to watch their carbon footprints shrink, and as a bonus,
they'll save between $150 and $300 on gas per year.



Check out this great review at Automoblog.net to learn more about how it works. 
   Eco-Driving

So, what is eco-driving? Vehicle maintenance and anticipation, paying close attention to the roadway environment and to other vehicles are at its core. When possible, eco-drivers time their trips to avoid traffic congestion, avoid unnecessary idling and rapid acceleration, and try to maintain reasonable and consistent speeds. It’s not difficult! The trick is to keep at it, and most players will reduce fuel use by 5 to 25%.
By playing the game, you'll learn why most truck drivers and millions of people all over the world are already eco-driving.

How it Works 
After you initially plug in the OBD scanner into your vehicle’s OBD port, using the GDC app is as easy as 1, 2, 3.
First, press connect on the GDC app before you start a trip; second, hit the road; and, third, go to the website and check out your results.
The app uploads the trip data, evaluates the numbers and gives players crucial driving information, from dollars saved to improved MPG to carbon dioxide reductions.


    
It’s fun to get better gas mileage than your car’s MPG ratings. Players also can choose whether to join or form a team and whether to compete head-to-head against selected players. 
Although GDC is played while driving, it is safe. One of the tenets of eco-driving is to pay close attention to the road, so the app does not allow players to check their progress during the trip. 


Our Goal 
As of May 25, ten drivers have provided data from 1,648 trips covering 38,147 miles. They averted 3,974 pounds of CO2 emissions and saved $538 by using less gas. As we gather data, we are polishing the prototype, building a team, and searching for others equally passionate about arresting climate change.
Your support will help us improve the game, refine the Android app, and begin developing an iOS version.

Risks & Challenges 
Data. We need millions of miles of driving data from many different cars and drivers to help us calibrate measurement tools and set game rewards. More data will help us understand differences in driving styles, improve eco-driving feedback, and learn what inspires drivers to to record every trip. 
Feedback. Driver feedback is crucial to improving the app. We’ll try to answers questions such as:



What features do players like the most? 

What proportion of players want to join or form teams?

What proportion of players want to compete head-to-head with other drivers?

How often will players want updates? 


What functions should we add to the website?



Communication. Because GDC is unique, it can be challenging to describe — it’s an app, a service, and a game. We need to persuade people that GDC makes it easy to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions. Another key to attracting users is communicating that eco-driving with GDC makes driving less stressful.

<p>Project results will be shared with the <a href=""http://www.arctic-council.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arctic Council</a>, a high level intergovernmental forum to promote cooperation, coordination and interaction among the eight Arctic nations, with the involvement of Arctic Indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic.<br/></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples will have lessons not
only for the Arctic’s scientific community, but also for all Arctic fishermen,
Arctic communities, industry operating in the Arctic, and Arctic governance
systems including national, regional and local governments. </p>
<p>The project will detail changes in the
following river systems:</p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryChief Mickey Stickman is alarmed over the
changes he sees in the Yukon River king salmon. The fish are smaller and fewer
than before, putting his community’s food supply and traditional practices at
risk. Indigenous communities across the Arctic are sounding this alarm; if the
salmon are in trouble, we could be too.
Chief Stickman has rallied Arctic
indigenous communities from Canada, USA, Norway, Finland and Russia to work
with Western scientists to design a study that would explore:



how salmon—an important food
source—is changing across the Arctic,


what implications these changes
have on communities and the environment, and;


what we can learn from Indigenous perspectives on ecosystem health and freshwater
systems.


Funding is needed for an October 2015
workshop that will bring Indigenous community members from the Yukon, Tena and Kamchatka Rivers together to share knowledge and
concerns of Indigenous communities across the Arctic. 
The project will be reported to the Arctic Council, the preeminent
international body for cooperation in the Arctic.

Any
money raised beyond our goal for the October workshop will be used to fund subsequent workshops and meetings.

   What We Need 
We are asking for $75,000 in funding to support a first workshop to be held in October 2015 in Fairbanks, Alaska. 
The project is a three step process
working towards co-producing a “Salmon Peoples of Arctic Rivers” assessment
that brings scientific and traditional knowledge together to identify how
freshwater ecosystems are changing, how this affects communities and what
actions can be done to protect salmon and communities. 


The October 2015 workshop will:



Bring together 24 traditional
knowledge holders and community representatives from across the Arctic


Create space for communities to
share wisdom, oral histories, observations, stories, prophecy and other
information about salmon and changes in their communities


Gather knowledge and observations
on changes in salmon populations and how this affects their communities


Develop questions for the
scientific research community


Develop common goals for an
Arctic-wide assessment


Develop an understanding of how
their traditional knowledge will be used in such an assessment


Survey participants on the
design and effectiveness of the workshop to inform future workshop design


Host a dialogue amongst
indigenous peoples, creating an important first step in the process of
co-producing an assessment using both traditional and scientific knowledge.


Specifically funding will support:
Economy air travel and hotel
accommodation for 24 village elders, subsistence fishermen and other knowledge
holders and participants from communities to attend workshops $47,180.


Four participants from: Arctic Athabaskan Council $4,280, Saami Council $11,080, Aleut International Association
$5,580, Inuit Circumpolar Council $5,580, RAIPON $16,380, Gwichin Council International
$4,280.

Staff and administrative costs
$10,200



Background research, recruiting participants, agenda development,
facilitating the discussion at the workshop to align with current research on
the relationship between traditional knowledge and science, and producing
meeting transcripts and analysis $3,000


Travel for technical advisor and student intern: $2,100


Student labour (indigenous and non-indigenous students) including designing
and conducting participant survey to gauge workshop success, data collection on
site, meeting set up and preparations, transcribing 10+ hours of materials,
document management: $4,200


Logistics costs $16,620



Honoraria and per diem for
attendees: $7,320


Translation and interpretation
services at workshops: $3,000


Catering: $1,500


Room rental: $800


Facilitation
at workshop: $4,000








This is the first of three two-day workshops for this project. The other two workshops, to be held in 2016 and 2017, will bring traditional knowledge holders and scientists together to further develop the design of a final assessment. Any money raised beyond our goal for the October meeting will be used to fund the subsequent meetings. This first stage is especially important because it engages communities and traditional knowledge holders from the outset of a study— laying the ground-work for an assessment that is co-produced by both traditional knowledge and western science. It is the first of many steps to find policy solutions that support how communities prepare and adjust for effects of climate change.
  The Impact

Project results will be shared with the Arctic Council, a high level intergovernmental forum to promote cooperation, coordination and interaction among the eight Arctic nations, with the involvement of Arctic Indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic.
Indigenous peoples will have lessons not
only for the Arctic’s scientific community, but also for all Arctic fishermen,
Arctic communities, industry operating in the Arctic, and Arctic governance
systems including national, regional and local governments. 
The project will detail changes in the
following river systems:



Yukon/Kuskokwim (Canada and
USA; territories used by Athabaskan, Gwich’in and some Inuit)


Kamchatka River (Russia;
territories used by Koryak, Itelmen, Even, Evenki Aleut and Chukchis)


Deatnu/Teno River (Finland and
Norway; territories used by Saami)





The project has real opportunity to influence management decisions (such as fishing practices, regulatory measures, legislation, and conservation) both locally, regionally and nationally across the Arctic



Who is behind this?
The project is led by Chief Mickey Stickman of the Arctic Athabaskan Council and is informed by a project steering committee consisting of the following people and organizations that represent indigenous peoples of the Arctic and are Permanent Participants of the Arctic Council: 
Annette Watson, Arctic Athabaskan Council technical advisor
Gunn-Britt Retter, Saami Council 
Victoria Sharakhmatova, Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North 
Jim Gamble, Aleut International Association


Carolina
Behe, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Alaska
Tom Barry, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Secretariat
This project is also important because it engages communities and traditional knowledge holders from the outset of a study— laying the ground-work for an assessment that is co-produced by both traditional knowledge and western science.

Video 04:44 minutes     GENIUS-OM COMPACTORGeniusOm is a start-up which has patented the solution for the disposal of rubbish: a device able to compact most type of waste. Its appearance is similar to most household appliances making it suitable for schools, hospitals, airports, planes and ships.The machine has been conceived to sort waste in different categories: paper, metals, undifferentiated and wet waste.There are three available models at the moment suitable for domestic, condominiums and hospital employment, which will all be using the same patented mechanism.The domestic version is the same size of a common household appliance. The machinery has different section for each type of waste and compacts each one, making it possible to throw waste away once a week rather than on a daily bases.Special filters for wet waste are also provided. Moreover, the company is planning a generator able to transform organic waste into energy. ZERO WASTEThe GENIUSOM machinery was developed for domestic and urban use. It reduces significantly the amount of urban waste, making the disposal and separate collection of wet, plastic, metal and paper waste possible. PATENT COMPACTOR THREE TYPES OF GENIUSOM COMPACTORThe device can be used in both a domestic and public environment. The downsizing of different waste is done by the same machinery.Due to its reduced handy and technological size it can be considered just like any other household appliance and therefore essential for public and domestic comfort.The size of the two modesl  for public use varies depending on its employment, in schools, hospitals, restaurants, hotels and condominiums. COMPANY DESCRIPTION AND TARGET MARKETGeniusOm was funded to provide a real solution to the disposal of community waste. Its objective is to develop, produce and sell a selection of compactors for the separate collection of waste.The devices will have a great price/performance ratio. Even if the prototype is still to be produced, the main project and the specification of the product are completed.The company commends a team of engineers, experts in measuring and control systems and in the production of industrial machineries.The key to the success of GeniusOm is in the ability of the team to handle and create a wide variety of innovative products and to subsequently sell it with a good price/quality ratio to a wide market.The co-founders of GeniusOm are valued experts, whose experience will generate a synergy in support of modern society. A RADICAL SOLUTION TO THE VOLUME AND SEPARATE COLLECTION OF WASTEOPERATING PRINCIPAL OF THE MACHINARYCompressing machinery powered by compressed air, for domestic and community waste, with a unique press air-operated.The power derives from an air compressor, made of a surface with five, variable, sections joint to a pneumatic piston, which when activated allows the compression of all the waste found in the sections of the device.The result is a  compacting of urban and domestic waste and a separate collection of wet waste, plastic, paper, metals and even glass in a separate section. The compressed waste is collected separately at the bottom of the device. FIELD OF BUSINESS AND PRODUCTSThe main field of business of GeniusOm consists in the production and selling of waste compactor.The company’s aim is to be become part of the household appliances market with an innovative solution for separate waste collection.Thanks to its patented project, GeniusOm will produce a domestic compactor and a bigger version appropriate for public places such as hospitals, hotels, restaurants, schools, universities, etc. COMPETITIONThe models proposed by competitors have some clear disadvantages, first of all they are rotating compactors, that provide the transition and compression of waste via opposite cylinders, positioned in the top part of the device. The sensor is activated by the machinery when it detects waste or hand-operated, but the most important detail is the ability of the device to compress just one residue at a time.Moreover these models have a single narrow slot in for waste making its employment highly uncomfortable for the user. At the moment the market is composed by companies that produce and sell:Hand operated compactors, which can be placed on a wall, envisage the user to compress a whole bag of waste at a time by placing it under the lever, this is a cheap but clearly inconvenient solution.Single compressing bins which make the purchase of various units, for different refuse, compelling and do not, however, compress a large quantity of waste.Single section, electric compactors which do not solve the separate waste collection problem.Prototype models of separate waste collection compactors, which we consider our direct competitors, which are pricey solutions and do not guarantee the compression of all types of waste. GENIUSOM UNIQUE COMPACTOR FOR ALL WASTEThis innovative device, represents a practical solution and a radical change to the problem of domestic and community waste solving the problem at its source.The machinery, by compacting all kinds of community waste, solves the problem of waste disposal at its origin.Our product, allows the compression of all waste and can really represent a revolution in the way community waste is handled.It represents the ultimate and concrete solution to high amounts of refuse and separate waste collection.THE GENIUSOM MACHINERY WAS INVENTED FOR DOMESTIC AND URBAN USETHE MACHINE HAS BEEN CONCEIVED TO SORT WASTE IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES: PAPER, METALS, UNDIFFERENTIATED AND WET WASTE.THERE ARE THREE AVAILABLE MODELS SUITABLE FOR DOMESTIC USE, CONDOMINIUMS, SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS, RESTAURANTS, HOTELS, MALLS, STATIONS, PORTS, AIRPORTS, PLANES AND SHIPS. ALL THE MODELS USE THE SAME PATENTED MECHANISMTHE MACHINERY, BY COMPACTING ALL KINDS OF COMMUNITY WASTE, SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF WASTE DISPOSAL AT ITS ORIGIN.THIS INNOVATIVE DEVICE, REPRESENTS A PRACTICAL SOLUTION AND A RADICAL CHANGE TO THE PROBLEM OF DOMESTIC AND COMMUNITY WASTE SOLVING THE PROBLEM AT ITS SOURCE. fig.1fig.2 ZERO WASTEGENIUSOM UNIQUE COMPACTOR FOR ALL WASTE. STORYGeniusOM Compactor, Luca Falace's Invention and Patent COSTS INCURRED BY LUCA FALACE FROM THE YEAR 2013 TO THE YEAR 2016 AND FOR HIS INVENTION GENIUSOM COMPACTOR PROJECTInvestment total cost of 53,000 euros incurred only by Luca Falace: patent fees, events, contacts, marketing, company ', processing drawings and documents, prototype simulation, project presentations, marketing, participation in events, participation and personal presence in awards and awarded prizes, etc. GENIUSOM COMPACTOR Certification and Summary  THE YEAR 2014 For all these reasons the Geniusom Patent has received considerable and important awardsin the Green Economy field:   GENIUSOM PRIZE ECOMONDO 2014 WITH THE ACCESSION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC AWARD FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTGeniusOM Compactor, Luca Falace's Invention and PatentGeniusom Prize Ecomondo 2014 THE YEAR 2015 FINANCING FUNDS NOW APPROVEDGENIUSOM COMPACTOR,

<h3>Rhino Conservation, Expansion ranges and Protection Project</h3>
<p><strong>Be a part of saving this ancient and endangered species from extinction. This is a conservation project with a wider social impact and community initiative</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are raising money to assist in Phase 1 of the establishment of a rhino sanctuary in Botswana.</strong></p>
<p>The actual project site is a designated wildlife reserve, registered non profit and has the President of Botswana’s endorsement. The continued plunder of the rhino due to illegal poaching is well documented and is set to continue until every single rhino has been slaughtered unless a comprehensive and disruptive plan is put into place. As intelligent people, we all understand that arresting the demise of the rhino is going to take more than setting aside land and providing armed guards for the rhino.</p>
<p>The Hokoyo Board have the experience and skills needed to not only ensure the conservatory has the ideal habitat, ecosystem and conditions for the rhino, they also have direct experience in securing government participation, community outreach and buy in, local capacity building, early warning systems, disruptive technology and communication, protection and sustainable business modeling.</p>
<p>The team are all African, who are experts in their field and have operated extensively in Africa. All are donating their time and experience because they know if something is not done soon, by them, there will be no future for the rhino.</p>

<p>Hokoyo Wildlife Foundation is a Southern African not for profit foundation. Julie Anne Edwards, Hokoyo’s founder is one of the Rhino Girls, who rode bicycles from Edinburgh to Victoria falls, Zimbabwe to raise money to save the rhino.  Still true to her mission, Julie established the Hokoyo Foundation in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist in the ethical conservation of the Rhino and Africa's unique wildlife and cultural heritage.</li>
<li>Help our communities to develop skills that improve their individual lives, nurturing in a spirit of compassion, dignity and respect towards one another and our natural world.</li>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This initial phase 1 of the project is to raise money to support the feasibility study of the site in Botswana, including sending experts to assess the site, the finalizing of the business plan, local community and champion engagement and consultation.</p>
<p>Included will be the identification of local community capacity building and assessing local resources for the building of community based warning systems and conservation education. Building a sustainable project includes the creation of recurrent sources of self-generated funding and strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>Through resourceful planning, time donated and literally working off the smell of an oil rag, we have brought the amount we need for this phase down to £1000,00. We appreciate this is a big ask, but we are creating an amazing model that will be the future of conservation.</p>
<p>However, anything over and above the money raised will go directly into the project and towards the next phase of the project.</p>

<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everybody can contribute financially. Increasing the global awareness of the illegal trade in Rhino horn is an important element in the fight against the extinction of the Rhino.</p>
<p><strong>Please log on with either Facebook or Twitter and share this project. On Twitter we are using the hashtag #StopPoaching</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a corporate sponsor too. Because we are approaching the project in phases and ensuring a sustainable business plan is built, the project presents an ideal opportunity for corporate sponsorship.</p>

<p><strong>Impact Positif</strong></p>
<p>Depuis que l'ère industrielle a commencé, l'humanité n'a cessé d'avoir un impact négatif sur notre planète. Aujourd'hui dans notre monde en expansion, les techniques et les moyens évoluent enfin vers la possibilité d'avoir un impact non seulement neutre, mais positif sur notre planète et son écosystème.</p>
<p>En 2008 lors d'une conférence sur l'estime de soi, j'ai été touché par l'importance de la responsabilité que nous avons sur les différents problèmes que nous rencontrons. En plus simple, si nous savons que quelque chose est négatif et destructeur pour nous ou notre environnement et que nous ne faisons rien, notre estime de nous va diminuer. Depuis ce jour, je ramasse les déchets que je trouve sur mon chemin.</p>
<p>Bien sûr, je n'étais pas comme cela avant et mon parcours professionnel fut longtemps dans les plaisirs éphémères que sont l'hôtellerie et la restauration. Aujourd'hui je me suis rendu compte que je pouvais avoir un impact beaucoup plus important en aidant les personnes à avoir une vie meilleure et ultimement je me rends compte que ma mission est encore plus belle en amenant aujourd'hui ce projet d'<strong>Impact Positif</strong>.</p>
<p>En 2012, j'ai entendu parler des gyres de plastique dans nos océans et ai aussi suivi une formation avec comme orateur Peter H. Diamantis. Il nous a expliqué le levier qu'il avait utilisé pour la création du Ansari XPrice permettant le développement des futurs voyages commerciaux dans l'espace.</p>
<p>En mettant toutes ces données ensemble, je me suis rendu compte qu'il fallait aujourd'hui créer un levier suffisant pour soulever l'intérêt non seulement des particuliers mais aussi des entreprises afin d'avoir dans un futur proche un impact positif sur notre planète.</p>
<p><strong>Pourquoi vous impliquer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>En contribuant</strong> à ce projet, vous allez permettre la mise en place d’une compétition avec un prix qui récompensera l'entreprise, l'équipe ou la collectivité qui trouvera le moyen de:</p>
<p>1) Récupérer le plastique à la surface de la mer et à 100 mètres au-dessous du niveau marin avec le taux de récupération le plus élevé et le plus grand rendement de récupération en respectant la faune et la flore marine.</p>
<p>2) Être en mesure de transformer tout ce plastique en énergie facilement transportable et utilisable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Presque 80% des 250 milliards de kilos de plastique produit chaque année ne sont pas recyclé. Au lieu de cela, il est déposé dans des décharges souvent à ciel ouvert et il est facilement emmené vers les océans, endroit où il s'accumule dans un tourbillon de déchets marins, parfois appelé gyre. Une de ces gyres, appelée aujourd'hui communément  ""continent de plastique"" a été découverte par hasard par le navigateur Charles Moore en 1997. Au retour d'une course à la voile entre Los Angeles et Honolulu, l'explorateur avait décidé de prendre une route habituellement évitée par les marins, au centre de la gyre du Pacifique Nord, où les pressions sont hautes et les vents faibles. ""Jour après jour, je ne voyais pas de dauphin, pas de baleine, pas de poisson, je ne voyais que du plastique"", se souvient-il.</p>
<p>Plusieurs expéditions ont été menées dans cette zone de 3,4 millions de km2, que l'on surnomme le ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" (la ""grande poubelle du Pacifique""). On y dénombre 334 271 fragments de plastique par km2 en moyenne, avec des pics à 969 777 fragments par km2. La masse de plastique y est six fois plus élevée que celle du plancton, pour un poids estimé de plusieurs dizaines de milliers de tonnes à plusieurs millions, selon les études.</p>
<p>La pollution plastique marine se développe à une vitesse de 5 milliards de kilos chaque année. Le plastique se dégrade aussi plus lentement en milieu marin en raison de la réduction de l'exposition aux rayons UV et des températures plus fraîches.</p>
<p>Les déchets qui peuplent les océans proviennent en effet à 80 % des terres, portés par le vent ou les rivières – le reste tombant des navires de commerce. Jusqu'alors, les débris flottants étaient détruits par les micro-organismes, mais cela n'est plus le cas avec l'arrivée des plastiques, essentiellement du polyéthylène, du polypropylène et du PET, qui constituent 90 % des déchets maritimes. Or, ces quantités ne cessent d'augmenter.</p>
<p>Les animaux peuvent se tromper facilement et confondre le plastique avec des aliments, ils ingèrent cette matière toxique, qui peut alors se déplacer dans la chaîne alimentaire et peut nuire à l'homme. Toute la chaîne alimentaire est affectée puisque les plus petits morceaux sont ingérés par des oiseaux, de petits poissons qui seront à leur tour mangés par de plus gros... Ainsi, Greenpeace estime qu'à l'échelle de la Terre, environ 1 million d'oiseaux et 100 000 mammifères marins meurent chaque année de l'ingestion de ces plastiques.</p>
<p>La pollution plastique océanique présente également une menace qui pèse sur les collectivités côtières et le tourisme, la navigation et l'industrie de la pêche.</p>
<p>Aujourd'hui la réglementation, la fiscalité et l'interdiction des produits en plastique spécifiques ne suffisent pas à empêcher l'entrée dans l'océan de ces tonnes de déchets et ne tient pas compte du fait que la pollution plastique marine restera dans nos océans pendant des centaines, voire des milliers d'années.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Comment rendre ce projet concret.</strong></p>
<p>Afin d'avoir un levier suffisant, le montant idéal du prix que nous devrions pouvoir proposer devrait être de $10'000'000. C'est le montant qui a été utilisé pour le Ansari XPrice permettant aux 26 équipes combinées de créer une nouvelle industrie qui a généré jusqu’à aujourd’hui plus de 1,5 milliards d’investissement dans l’industrie publique et privée du voyage spatial.</p>
<p>Ce projet étant bien plus grand que je ne pourrais jamais l’être, j’ai besoin de votre aide à tous les niveaux et la moindre contribution que vous pouvez apporter sera une pierre supplémentaire inestimable.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez aider de différentes façons, la première étant en faisant passer ce message et en encourageant les gens à venir s’investir avec vous dans ce projet.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez aussi nous aidez en utilisant vos différentes compétences.</p>

Gestion d’une fondation
Toutes autres aides dont vous pourriez avoir l’idée
 
Afin de récolter les fonds suffisants, j’utiliserai différentes plateformes de « crowfunding » c’est pourquoi le montant de don que je désire atteindre sur Indiegogo est de $ 100'000. Montrons que les contributeurs utilisant Indiegogo sont les plus responsables et qu’ils peuvent s’engager pour bien plus que les autres.
Quand l’objectif de $10'000’000 sera atteint, la plus grande partie des fonds seront utilisés comme prix pour les équipes engagées dans la compétition.

The Sky Tap ProjectThe Sky Tap Project was created to build full-scale units of a ground breaking technology designed to condense invisible water vapor in the clear sky to produce clouds within minutes.                         This is the pre-requisite to producing reliable precipitation; and has never been done before. The proof of concept prototype, utilizes uniquely designed wave guides and particle acceleration principles to project an electronic wave which imparts a static electric charge to aerosols at a distance of up to several kilometers, instantly creating condensation nuclei.And can be seen on this time compressed video of the proof of concept prototype, below: Scientific Support for this TheoryThe scientific support for the theory of an electrical influence on water droplets to increase condensation has been published by many atmospheric physicists over the past 60 years, but a viable method of demonstrating the effect in nature has never been found because of a missing key element.  (Visit our website to read more on this theory.)A recent discovery has made it possible to create a device which has the ability to condense atmospheric humidity and generate clouds in minutes at dew point temperature altitude, which is where a gas will turn to a liquid if condensation nuclei are present. Throughout history, the scientific community has often been skeptical of the most amazing technologies and declared them to be impossible, offering little or no support. Virtually all ground breaking discoveries were ridiculed by the most notable scientific experts of the day, and yet they have changed our world in tremendous ways for the better. Just as the technology of the Sky Tap Project will accomplish; if we can develop it and demonstrate it to the world. How Would This WorkDeveloped at full scale, with 10 times greater output capacity than our prototype, a number of portable devices would demonstrate the capability of generating continuous cloud banks to provide controlled shade to the surface of the planet. By producing shade over cities, this will both reduce energy costs for air conditioning in hot climates and reflect solar radiation back into space to reduce heating of the surface and also cool the oceans.              Once the cloud banks have absorbed significant water vapor, due to the hygroscopic effect that is created, they can then be impacted again by the same technology to induce precipitation. This offers total control of the precipitation event as to the timing, location, duration, and volume; providing a viable means to access large quantities of fresh water for arid regions. The controllability of the technology means that there are little or no unintended consequences from its operation.              The technology is also effective far inland away from the coast, by utilizing humidity from evap-transporation from vegetation or evaporation.

<p>I have worked in the travel industry for 20 years, I am currently a Flight Attendant with a large commercial carrier; over the past four years I have been working on and have developed a patent pending product that is sure to revolutionize the current marketplace moreover, approximately 80% of our product is developed by <strong>US vendors, suppliers and eco-friendly manufacturers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simply ask yourself:</strong> What is the first thing people ask for when they step onto an aircraft?</p>

Simply ask yourself: What is the first thing people ask for when they step onto an aircraft?
Answer:  A pillow and a blanket. 
As you walk through the terminal on any given day you will see numerous people either carrying their own bed pillow, a u-shaped beanbag pillow in their arms/hands or clipped onto their luggage and I’ve even seen them on the tops of people’s heads and my first impression: that’s unhygienic and cumbersome, we live in a Hands-Free society...There has to be a better way!

The Dream Butler TM Carry-all with Pillow, Blanket and Lapboard was created because I realized there was nothing on the market that consolidated all the in-flight needs of the traveler in one convenient carry-on bag...something that would virtually provide for hands-free travel. I collaborated and consulted with co-workers, friends and business associates (numerous Flight Attendants, a Chiropractor, and an Industrial Manufacturer) and many, many others.

What We Need & What You Get
  Now that the research and development phase of this project has been completed we are at the phase where we NEED to raise FUNDS for the marketing and media campaign initiative. 

Consequently, we have met with a representative of the QVC Home Shopping Network and they ""LOVE"" the product but here’s the thing, in order to have your product launched/showcased in that manner: you must supply an extremely large amount of inventory. 

 

It takes an enormous amount of capital to produce that level of inventory and time for the product to be manufactured and then be processed through the Quality Assurance department.

 

An infusion of capital in the form of 250,000.00 from various donors and/or Angel Investor would help to launch this important product into the marketplace.  

 

The funds will be used not only for initial inventory but will also help launch a media marketing ad campaign to get the word out.  

We have been able to use this platform to support numerous American Owned and Operated Businesses and allow us to work with manufacturers who are eco-friendly by developing chemical-free memory foam products and manufacturers who recycle and use bio-degradable materials as a ""green choice"" alternative.  
My pledge is to continue to do this (approximately 80% of start-up and development cost was used/spent with US vendors and suppliers) to support this effort.
Here is a short list of USA suppliers and vendors we have worked with in developing this product. 
Legal Zoom, Quick Patents, Federal Express, UPS, USPS, Delaware Division of Revenue, ZZ House-graphics and printing, U-Line, Print Craft, NCFI Polyurethanes, B.J. Con-Sew, General Labels, Bekaert Textiles USA, Jackie Tumaian Photography just to name a few...

But remember - even if you can’t make a contribution, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
 

Equally as important, spreading the word and share the campaign via the Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs and forums--basically anywhere and everywhere.

<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Do your have your own quiet place in a park, by the water or in a nature reserve? </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> A place that you frequently visit to breathe, wind down and recharge? Maybe it’s under a tree in the park close to work or up on that mountain ridge not far from your home or in the still part of the trail along the river. Most people can, if they start being aware of the value of silence, find small or big green spaces with relative silence and stillness. Some of these places are close to home or work, some are further away. But, no matter where they are, these places can have an enormous impact on our well-being, health and ability to focus and function as a human being.  And importantly, green, quiet spaces in or close to cities and communities are also important for the biodiversity, sustainability and appeal of our cities and communities.  </span><br/></p>
<p>We are all today flooded with information and entertainment; for decades we have lived in an ever expanding age of information. But maybe we are, as the Swedish Future Trend firm Kairos Future has suggested, now moving into  “the age of concentration”. To thrive in the world today we need to be able to focus and focus is connected to inner and outer silence. The increasing interest in meditation, mindfulness and the need to find time for recovery and stillness indicates that maybe the “age of concentration” is not that far away. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/636696/files/20140609132038-TEXTNutshell.gif?1402345238"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>THE ORIGINAL. </b></b>More than 15 years ago, in 1998, the original Guide to Silence was published. The purpose was twofold. <br/></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622074/files/20140602235715-GuideToSilenceThreeCover.gif?1401778635"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The first  was to show the way and let more people experience the extraordinary silence and wilderness of the Swedish mountains. The second (but not secondary) purpose was to provide a guide to inner silence, stillness and new perspectives. The Guide to Silence is a guide book without facts - you won’t find the name of the mountains, lakes or trees. Instead it’s a guide to increased awareness and presence, to lower levels of stress.  It is a guide to being in nature and experiencing nature fully. But, the book’s audience wasn’t limited to only those lucky enough to hike in the Swedish mountains. The beautiful photography from one of Sweden’s most well known nature photographers, Bo Kristiansson, which accompanies  the short text makes the Guide to Silence a compelling work also from the sofa. To just read the book in a calm setting can lower stress levels and provide new perspectives. Thus the Guide to Silence has found an audience  around the world and we have sent guidebooks across Europe, the U.S. as well as to China.  You will find a limited edition of the original Guide to Silence included in our perks. </span></p>

</p><p><b>THE RESTART. </b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">In 2013 the Guide to Silence project restarted, and the focus is now green spaces close to or in cities that offer relative silence and stillness. The remote silent wilderness areas you might go to once or twice a year are valuable. But the green relative silent spaces we can access daily have a different and more frequent value. One important part of the project is now to work with local communities, park services, counties and national organizations to identify, describe, increase access to and protect these places and walks that offer relative silence and valuable nature experiences.  This work started 2013 in the northern part of Stockholm and is now growing to other parts of the city and beyond the Swedish borders. The aim is to spread the Guide to Silence concept internationally and this Indiegogo campaign is an important first step towards this goal.  A Guide to Silence for the world's cities and towns will enable people to find new dimensions of their home town. But the Guide to Silence will also be a resource for the tourist or business traveler who needs a break, a different perspective and a moment of stillness when away from home.</span></p>

These are some of the 15 themes:  <i>“outer silence and inner limits”, “inner silence and focus”, “awareness, presence and absence”, “seeing without labels”, “different perspectives”, “acceptance and disturbance”, “in the now and goals” and “the cultivation of awe”</i>. Being in nature has provided a form of meditation and mindfulness training long before these concepts where invented. We want to simplify, demystify and give more people the opportunity to find new energ<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">y and perspective on everyday life.  A still, quiet place in nature can help us find the inner stillness.  </span></p>
<p><b>The second</b> purpose is to help you find and identify your own place, space in nature that offers relative silence and stillness. This could be in a park, by the water, or in a nature reserve. You may have favorite places close to home or work but what happens when you travel?  How can we find places in the world where we can experience stillness and connect to nature?  The Explorers Guide to Silence will show you how the silence of a green space are affected by obvious things as roads and other human activities, but also how less obvious things as trees, a creek, an elevated spot, a dense greenery,the moss on the ground and the weather can affect the silence. The Explorers Guide will invite you to find a different path or just leave your normal path in search for places of silence and new experiences of nature.How can we ensure that these places are protected so the relative silence and stillness we experience  can also be experienced by future generations?  It can be a place that ought to be noticed precisely because of its silence.  But importantly finding your own quiet place should be about experiencing, not measuring. Nature is never totally quiet, the sound of the wind, running water or birdsongs are part of the natural soundscape.</p>
<p><b>The third</b> purpose is connected to <i>the power of spreading ideas and creating change</i>. The green relative silent spaces in a large city or a small community are important for both human well-being/health and biodiversity.  The Explorers Guide to Silence will help people to experience and identify the value of silent green spaces in their own neighborhoods all over the world. Some of these silent places in nature you might want to keep to yourself other places are very public and should be shared. At the same time as The Explorers Guide is published, a web platform will be launched so we can begin to grow a community of people who are willing to share ‘their’ places as well as their experiences.  This is also away to increase the value of silent still green areas and can help us protect them for future generations. </p>
<p><b>Note.</b> But just like the original Guide - this is also a guide to inner silence and thus it is also a guide that you can sit down with in a comfy chair, read a paragraph, take a deep breath and find an inner stillness.</p><p><b>FACTS ABOUT THE EXPLORERS GUIDE </b></p>

<p></p><p></p></div>","Do your have your own quiet place in a park, by the water or in a nature reserve?  A place that you frequently visit to breathe, wind down and recharge? Maybe it’s under a tree in the park close to work or up on that mountain ridge not far from your home or in the still part of the trail along the river. Most people can, if they start being aware of the value of silence, find small or big green spaces with relative silence and stillness. Some of these places are close to home or work, some are further away. But, no matter where they are, these places can have an enormous impact on our well-being, health and ability to focus and function as a human being.  And importantly, green, quiet spaces in or close to cities and communities are also important for the biodiversity, sustainability and appeal of our cities and communities.  
We are all today flooded with information and entertainment; for decades we have lived in an ever expanding age of information. But maybe we are, as the Swedish Future Trend firm Kairos Future has suggested, now moving into  “the age of concentration”. To thrive in the world today we need to be able to focus and focus is connected to inner and outer silence. The increasing interest in meditation, mindfulness and the need to find time for recovery and stillness indicates that maybe the “age of concentration” is not that far away. THE ORIGINAL. More than 15 years ago, in 1998, the original Guide to Silence was published. The purpose was twofold. The first  was to show the way and let more people experience the extraordinary silence and wilderness of the Swedish mountains. The second (but not secondary) purpose was to provide a guide to inner silence, stillness and new perspectives. The Guide to Silence is a guide book without facts - you won’t find the name of the mountains, lakes or trees. Instead it’s a guide to increased awareness and presence, to lower levels of stress.  It is a guide to being in nature and experiencing nature fully. But, the book’s audience wasn’t limited to only those lucky enough to hike in the Swedish mountains. The beautiful photography from one of Sweden’s most well known nature photographers, Bo Kristiansson, which accompanies  the short text makes the Guide to Silence a compelling work also from the sofa. To just read the book in a calm setting can lower stress levels and provide new perspectives. Thus the Guide to Silence has found an audience  around the world and we have sent guidebooks across Europe, the U.S. as well as to China.  You will find a limited edition of the original Guide to Silence included in our perks.

THE RESTART. In 2013 the Guide to Silence project restarted, and the focus is now green spaces close to or in cities that offer relative silence and stillness. The remote silent wilderness areas you might go to once or twice a year are valuable. But the green relative silent spaces we can access daily have a different and more frequent value. One important part of the project is now to work with local communities, park services, counties and national organizations to identify, describe, increase access to and protect these places and walks that offer relative silence and valuable nature experiences.  This work started 2013 in the northern part of Stockholm and is now growing to other parts of the city and beyond the Swedish borders. The aim is to spread the Guide to Silence concept internationally and this Indiegogo campaign is an important first step towards this goal.  A Guide to Silence for the world's cities and towns will enable people to find new dimensions of their home town. But the Guide to Silence will also be a resource for the tourist or business traveler who needs a break, a different perspective and a moment of stillness when away from home.

THE BIG PURPOSE AND GOAL. The overall goal of the Guide to Silence project is to produce guidebooks for cities around the world - which will enable and inspire people to find and just be in relatively quiet natural surroundings - which is positive for well-being, health and ability to focus and function as humans - which can encourage cities, agencies and landowners to care for, protect and develop the relative quiet green space that exists.THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF THIS INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN...
…is to produce and publish THE EXPLORERS GUIDE TO SILENCE. This is an innovative expansion of the original guide, this time with a threefold purpose.The first purpose is to expand from the original guide with suggestions, tips and ideas on themes that provide new dimensions for your walk or visit in nature. These are some of the 15 themes:  “outer silence and inner limits”, “inner silence and focus”, “awareness, presence and absence”, “seeing without labels”, “different perspectives”, “acceptance and disturbance”, “in the now and goals” and “the cultivation of awe”. Being in nature has provided a form of meditation and mindfulness training long before these concepts where invented. We want to simplify, demystify and give more people the opportunity to find new energy and perspective on everyday life.  A still, quiet place in nature can help us find the inner stillness.  
The second purpose is to help you find and identify your own place, space in nature that offers relative silence and stillness. This could be in a park, by the water, or in a nature reserve. You may have favorite places close to home or work but what happens when you travel?  How can we find places in the world where we can experience stillness and connect to nature?  The Explorers Guide to Silence will show you how the silence of a green space are affected by obvious things as roads and other human activities, but also how less obvious things as trees, a creek, an elevated spot, a dense greenery,the moss on the ground and the weather can affect the silence. The Explorers Guide will invite you to find a different path or just leave your normal path in search for places of silence and new experiences of nature.How can we ensure that these places are protected so the relative silence and stillness we experience  can also be experienced by future generations?  It can be a place that ought to be noticed precisely because of its silence.  But importantly finding your own quiet place should be about experiencing, not measuring. Nature is never totally quiet, the sound of the wind, running water or birdsongs are part of the natural soundscape.
The third purpose is connected to the power of spreading ideas and creating change. The green relative silent spaces in a large city or a small community are important for both human well-being/health and biodiversity.  The Explorers Guide to Silence will help people to experience and identify the value of silent green spaces in their own neighborhoods all over the world. Some of these silent places in nature you might want to keep to yourself other places are very public and should be shared. At the same time as The Explorers Guide is published, a web platform will be launched so we can begin to grow a community of people who are willing to share ‘their’ places as well as their experiences.  This is also away to increase the value of silent still green areas and can help us protect them for future generations. 
Note. But just like the original Guide - this is also a guide to inner silence and thus it is also a guide that you can sit down with in a comfy chair, read a paragraph, take a deep breath and find an inner stillness.FACTS ABOUT THE EXPLORERS GUIDE 


Launch: The Explorers Guide to Silence will be launched in the end of September 2014 in English and Swedish. The first edition will be offered as an e-book with an accompanying audio extension (the audio part of the book will include ideas and instructions that are great to listen to as a start of a walk or on your way to your silent place). 


The funding: The funds collected in this Indiegogo campaign will be used for final text production, photos, maps, audio production and layout.
