<li>We are getting more men involved in the public discussion about depression and mental illness. In a nutshell, <b>we are fighting stigma</b>.<br/>

</li> <li>$1000 goes directly toward the audiobook production. Professional quality and strong voice acting is paramount to the success of this media. This price is mid-range, and the details of audiobook costs are found in the Gallery tab.</li>
<li>Any extra funds will go toward marketing at Indie book sellers.<br/>

Unlike any book I've read on depression.""-Joseph Earsom


The Gist

We are getting more men involved in the public discussion about depression and mental illness. In a nutshell, we are fighting stigma.

There are few books specifically about Male Depression, a secretive yet prevalent disease that affects the majority of Americans either directly or indirectly. Those books that do exist are primarily written by healthcare professionals - not by the survivors.

That lack of material exists not because of an absence of a market but because very few men are willing to talk about it. Suicide rates among men are at an all-time high.

I successfully published the memoir Van Gogh in Peppers to fill that void, battling against the stigma in a new way. Reviewers have been overwhelmingly positive (on Amazon, for instance). Prior to publication, the book went three rounds with editor Amy Butcher of ArtsyFartsy Copyediting.



“Christopher's honest, authentic, and courageous journey battling depression and other linked problems, such as dysfunctional relationships, self-defeating thoughts, anger, unhealthy lifestyle habits and substance abuse, normalizes what other men face and signals that they are no longer alone.”-Rachel Dack, MS, LCPC, NCC
  Exactly What The Book Needs
 The book is evolving from online distribution (Amazon.com and Barnes&Noble.com) to universal distribution (Indie book sellers and mainstream brick and mortars). This will allow our mission to reach more men (and their families) in need.
We are also finishing an outstanding audiobook performed by stage actor Henry McNulty (excerpt available below).  $250 moves us from Createspace to Ingram Spark, allowing book stores to order copies with a reasonable margin. This includes purchasing the necessary ISBN from Bowker and the associated fees at Ingram.
 $1000 goes directly toward the audiobook production. Professional quality and strong voice acting is paramount to the success of this media. This price is mid-range, and the details of audiobook costs are found in the Gallery tab.
Any extra funds will go toward marketing at Indie book sellers.
 If we don't meet our entire goal, we press on. We're on a mission to save lives, restore families, and offer solidarity - and that won't stop. Ordered Perks will still be shipped out, no problem.







""Your book provides an excellent format for a discussion on depression in men

    The Big Why
 While considering contributing to this campaign, bear in mind its goals:  

to encourage men with mental health concerns to begin “talking about it”


 to showcase symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder that are not considered “depressive” by the general public (anger, anxiety, substance abuse)
to tell a great story, appealing to men (and their loved ones) of any reading level

to give 2% of sales from all media toward mental health advocacy (already in action here)

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi y'all! The Playful Trainer here! I am so excited to share this campaign with you!</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a certified personal trainer and life &amp; health coach on a mission to make the world a healthier, more playful place!</li>
<li>I have written a book ""The Playful Journal""! It takes readers on a 12-week journey to discover their inner playfulness, develop healthier habits and make the ultimate lifestyle change to living a truly healthy life. I have been self-producing the journal at home for my clients, however I want to bring this message to a broader audience all over the world!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the campaign in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am raising $3000 to self-publish about 1000 hard copies my book. Books will be used in my training program, sold at gyms and bookstores, and also sold online. </li>
<li>If you donate $15 or more,  you will receive a free copy of ""The Playful Journal""!</li>
<li>Any funds raised over my goal will go towards promotion, advertisement and my book launch event. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why the message, why the book?:</p>
<ul>
<li>I became a health and fitness coach to help others achieve not only physical health, but a healthier mental state as well. </li>
<li>I have first-hand experience with the battles of poor body image, and the desire to earn validation and love from others based on the way I looked. I learned the hard way that this is not where health comes from. I had to love myself and value myself first in order to truly achieve mental and physical health. I feel that God truly wants me to share my journey with others in order to help them make those positive lifestyle changes that lead to better health and a more fulfilling life. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Whew! Here we go...</p>
<ul>
<li>As you may know, I just recently left my 9-5 job to pursue this message and build my company ""The Playful Trainer"" - I'm steppin' out in faith!</li>
<li>I am confident that God placed this dream on my heart for a calling greater than myself.  Opening myself up to help others often invites negative feedback and haters... but I'm fearless. I have my higher power on my side and we are ready to rock this!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I completely understand if you cannot contribute financially to this campaign. Here are a couple ways you can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with all of your family and friends! Indiegogo makes sharing campaigns on social media super easy!</li>
<li>If you know someone struggling with poor body image or self-worth, low self-esteem, unhealthy habits, in need of encouragement to make healthy lifestyle changes, please share this project with them! </li>
<li>I can certainly always use prayers!</li>
</ul>

Here's the campaign in a nutshell:

I am raising $3000 to self-publish about 1000 hard copies my book. Books will be used in my training program, sold at gyms and bookstores, and also sold online. 
If you donate $15 or more,  you will receive a free copy of ""The Playful Journal""!
Any funds raised over my goal will go towards promotion, advertisement and my book launch event. 


The Impact
Why the message, why the book?:

I became a health and fitness coach to help others achieve not only physical health, but a healthier mental state as well. 
I have first-hand experience with the battles of poor body image, and the desire to earn validation and love from others based on the way I looked. I learned the hard way that this is not where health comes from. I had to love myself and value myself first in order to truly achieve mental and physical health. I feel that God truly wants me to share my journey with others in order to help them make those positive lifestyle changes that lead to better health and a more fulfilling life. 


Risks & Challenges
Whew! Here we go...

As you may know, I just recently left my 9-5 job to pursue this message and build my company ""The Playful Trainer"" - I'm steppin' out in faith!
I am confident that God placed this dream on my heart for a calling greater than myself.  Opening myself up to help others often invites negative feedback and haters... but I'm fearless. I have my higher power on my side and we are ready to rock this!


Other Ways You Can Help
I completely understand if you cannot contribute financially to this campaign. Here are a couple ways you can still help!

Share this campaign with all of your family and friends! Indiegogo makes sharing campaigns on social media super easy!
If you know someone struggling with poor body image or self-worth, low self-esteem, unhealthy habits, in need of encouragement to make healthy lifestyle changes, please share this project with them! 
I can certainly always use prayers!

<h2><strong>Why am I writing this book.....</strong></h2>
<p>The short answer is.....it's a dream of mine !  I am not an author but I consider myself an artist . I am a photographer by trade but in my spare time I love to paint with acrylics and oils more than anything.  Originally I wanted to write this book about 20 years ago.  I remember sitting in my car with my laptop, watching my youngest son practice flag football, when I started writing this exact story.  Unfortunately after that day I never wrote again.  Life takes over and we set our dreams aside, however now is the time to make my dream come true. </p>
<p>The story is based off a dream I had over 20 years ago, a very vivid dream.  I have always been a person who dreams in detail and I actually remember most of my dreams after I wake up.  This story is one that has stuck with me for a long time as you can see.  I recently decide that is was time!  Time to start this book and share it with the world.</p>
<p>I am very excited about this book because it will be so much better now than it would have been if I had wrote it 20 years ago.  The characters are much more complex, the storyline is more exciting, the twists and turns will keep you wanting more!  I am hoping that this will be a 3 book series.</p>
<h2>The Story.....</h2>
<p>Maria is a beautiful, middle aged woman who wakes up from a coma that she has been in for about a month.  She learns that she has amnesia from being in a tragic car accident.  The family doctor puts Maria on medication to help with her memory loss but is told she may never recover her past memories.  As time goes on, she learns he has a loving and protective husband, a housekeeper who is not only a friend but a mother figure, and a small group of devoted 'friends.'  From the very beginning she struggles to figure out how to live a normal life again.  Struggling to trust the people around her, she starts questioning everything when she comes across old photographs, hidden rooms in her house and questionable stories from her 'friends.'  Eventually Maria learns about her true medical condition, her husbands criminal business in human trafficking and her former life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>My Goal.....</h2>
<p>My goal is to self-publish versus traditional publishing.  Self-publishing is more costly for me upfront but it provides me with more control over what happens with my book such as the platforms it will be sold on and the marketing of the book.  I plan on having hard copies printed, ebooks made and eventually audio books.  The printed book will be 6x9.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Potential Book Cover.....</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600981062/og45ustjocndgivpsuzi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Money raised will go towards the following.....</h2>
<p>1.  <strong>The Editor</strong> - To revise and publish book.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>The Cover Design of my Book</strong> - the mockup you see currently is a possible cover.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>The Layout Design</strong> - for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats).</p>
<p>4.  <strong>The Copyediting for My Book</strong> - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book</strong> - when I ultimately publish.  Goal date is by January 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges.....</h2>
<p>The risks are minimal.  My book is a little over half way written.  I am determined to finish writing within the next month or two so that I can move on to having it edited and formatted.  The main risk is if something would happen to me to where I could not finish the book or that I have to find another way to help fund the book.</p>
<h2>A Big Thank You !.....</h2>
<p>First I want to say thank you for considering my campaign!  When I started to write this book all I thought about was that I was going to make my dreams come true, I started writing, got through a few chapters and realized I needed to research the costs and the best ways to publish.  I never considered the price tag of putting my book out into the world!  I also found out the unbelievably low chance I had of a traditional publishing house accepting and printing my book without a literary agent.  I have thought about many options to save money, such as binding the book myself, developing a new and unique way to print my book but the fact is that there are no low cost options.  Self-publishing is the cheapest way to go for my first book. </p>
<p>Thank you again for helping me!  I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>

<p>Hi I'm Fergal and I've never done anything like this before, but after a few family scares and lots of soul searching about life and family and how life is not a dress rehearsal and all that lark, I decided I'd like to do something positive, something constructive, I was chatting to my mum whilst busy tinkering along in the kitchen and noted the old tattered orange copy book that only comes out at  Christmas or that time of year when the jams need to be made during the summer and autumn, now I've never had much interest in baking but this day I decided i'd give my mother a hand and in conversation and much questioning about the history of the old tattered copybook the seed was planted.</p>
<p>Now this book was handwritten by my Granny back in the late 20's and thirties, with not only her recipes but other people from the same era and locality, I'm sure many of these recipes are unique for the small Irish town I come from...</p>
<p>I'd like to create a book that immortalises those recipes  bring them to life in a book that is easy to follow by young and old, full of pictures and tips on how to make a good cake and a fine jam, be it strawberry, gooseberry, marmalade or indeed a unique Christmas cake and variants of it.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for in this campaign is not only to raise funds to publish the book but to bake the contents and make sure that these recipes are given the due care and respect they deserve before publishing and sharing with the world, so that when the book does make it to the shelf, it is of the highest quality and the imagery of the contents will make your mouth water and ooze with a temptation to bake whats there.</p>
<p>I'm looking for £4000 to create, bake and publish this unique book of variants of  60 odd recipes from a generation that is no longer with us.</p>

Now this book was handwritten by my Granny back in the late 20's and thirties, with not only her recipes but other people from the same era and locality, I'm sure many of these recipes are unique for the small Irish town I come from...
I'd like to create a book that immortalises those recipes  bring them to life in a book that is easy to follow by young and old, full of pictures and tips on how to make a good cake and a fine jam, be it strawberry, gooseberry, marmalade or indeed a unique Christmas cake and variants of it.
What I'm looking for in this campaign is not only to raise funds to publish the book but to bake the contents and make sure that these recipes are given the due care and respect they deserve before publishing and sharing with the world, so that when the book does make it to the shelf, it is of the highest quality and the imagery of the contents will make your mouth water and ooze with a temptation to bake whats there.
I'm looking for £4000 to create, bake and publish this unique book of variants of  60 odd recipes from a generation that is no longer with us.

Some of the money will go into purchasing the ingredients and to bring the recipes to life,  Some will go towards a specialist to put these recipes together for those finer touches... not sure my 80-year-old mum is able anymore.
I would like to film the process get it up on youtube and ensure the photographs are of the highest quality, leaving the publishing, editing and refining of the book for the remainder.
 Any monies left over from this will be donated to fighting blindness.
Anyone who donates and pending how much will get a copy of the book so I'd like to do this justice not only for Granny but for you guys as well.
Indeed if you can't donate to the funds but you have publishing, editing, youtube baking experience all help is welcome to make this a success...I'm Looking forward to the challenges and culinary journey ahead...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In it, Job, a very rich and godly man, lost all his material possessions, all his children, and his health in a matter of minutes. Adding pain upon pain, his wife gave him no support and his three closest friends condemned him rather than consoled him. Job very much wished to meet-up with God and present his arguments against God Himself. Yet, even God seemed to be ignoring Job.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">When God eventually came, His response to Job’s questions and pleas was rather unexpected and intriguing. And Job’s final words to God were</p><p style=""margin-left:120px;"">“I had only heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes. I take back everything I said …”.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">So, what could have God possibly said to Job to make him take back every ‘sound’ argument he previously prepared?</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Can a child, whose parents are going through a divorce and doesn’t understand why this is happening to her, eventually say to God “… now I have seen you with my own eyes… “? Or can the 7 year old, who is punished by his parents for a fault he didn’t commit relate to Job’s story? Or as Job was continuously asking the reason for his suffering, is it possible to explain the ‘why’ of a child for his mother’s death?  </p><p> </p><p>In July 2014, I took up on the task of teaching this book to children aged 7 – 9 years at a Sunday school, at which I have been serving for more than five years. The book contains tough and seemingly contradictory concepts, which made the challenge of teaching the book of Job to children very daunting. Yet, with the grace of the God of Job I began.</p><p>My journey of teaching (and learning) the book took around 15 Sundays. Every week’s lesson was very lively, beautifully challenging, and highly enlightening for all of us. By using the book of Job as our torchlight, we were able to understand: the mystery of unmerited misery; how to console our friends who are sad; maintaining hope and integrity amidst suffering; and even rejoicing in the middle of all the pain we are facing.</p><p>I documented each of the role plays, stories, games, puzzles, audio-visuals, home take exercises and activities I used for all the lessons. I hoped that one day, I would be able to compile all these and publish it as a parents’ guide. That day has never been this closer. Moreover, the compilation evolved into both a parents’ guide and a story book.</p><p><strong>Story book  </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532337994/gzfgadmuhrikgjwyk4xp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Children aged 6 – 10 were read paragraphs of the story of Job and they made drawings for each of these paragraphs. These drawings were then used to develop concepts for the illustrations of the story book. These concepts were further refined maintaining the initial concepts so that the children reading the story can relate to it.</p><p><strong>Story of Job – Parents’/Teachers’ guide</strong></p><p>The parents’ guide, that can also be used by Sunday school teachers, comprises of 14 lessons. By tapping into the world of childhood, that of games, puzzles, role plays, and activities, it allows parents to teach the different concepts addressed by the book of Job.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532338086/o8cvfss69bmt6czqz3jz.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The guide also contains a complementary CD based on the last chapters of the book of Job. These are the chapters at which God started responding to Job, taking him on a tour of His creation and the CD contains an audio-visual representation of God’s response. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532338184/qe3roqvoawzksnuuivtz.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>What have we done so far?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Text – The lessons have already been conducted with children and their effectiveness proven. In addition, the book has passed through multiple proof readings by an early childhood education expert and a veteran Sunday school teacher.</li>
<li>Illustration – For each of the paragraphs of the story, a minimum of four concept drawings were done by children. Based on the commonalities of the children’s drawings, all the illustrations for the storybook were then drafted, refined, and completed.</li>
<li>Design - Numerous revisions were made on the design, resulting in a beautiful final production-ready package, thanks to the talented graphic designer and awesome creative director.    </li>
<li>CD (God spoke CD) – High quality footages and images were sought for, corresponding to the different elements that God mentions while responding to Job. The narration has already been recorded, the CD edited and finalized. </li>
</ul><p><strong>What remains?</strong></p><p>The final stride – production</p><p>The objective of this campaign is to cover the production cost for 5000 copies of this package. By doing this, it is my aim to significantly reduce the retail price to as low as $4 per package.

In it, Job, a very rich and godly man, lost all his material possessions, all his children, and his health in a matter of minutes. Adding pain upon pain, his wife gave him no support and his three closest friends condemned him rather than consoled him. Job very much wished to meet-up with God and present his arguments against God Himself. Yet, even God seemed to be ignoring Job.When God eventually came, His response to Job’s questions and pleas was rather unexpected and intriguing. And Job’s final words to God were“I had only heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes. I take back everything I said …”.So, what could have God possibly said to Job to make him take back every ‘sound’ argument he previously prepared?Can a child, whose parents are going through a divorce and doesn’t understand why this is happening to her, eventually say to God “… now I have seen you with my own eyes… “? Or can the 7 year old, who is punished by his parents for a fault he didn’t commit relate to Job’s story? Or as Job was continuously asking the reason for his suffering, is it possible to explain the ‘why’ of a child for his mother’s death?   In July 2014, I took up on the task of teaching this book to children aged 7 – 9 years at a Sunday school, at which I have been serving for more than five years. The book contains tough and seemingly contradictory concepts, which made the challenge of teaching the book of Job to children very daunting. Yet, with the grace of the God of Job I began.My journey of teaching (and learning) the book took around 15 Sundays. Every week’s lesson was very lively, beautifully challenging, and highly enlightening for all of us. By using the book of Job as our torchlight, we were able to understand: the mystery of unmerited misery; how to console our friends who are sad; maintaining hope and integrity amidst suffering; and even rejoicing in the middle of all the pain we are facing.I documented each of the role plays, stories, games, puzzles, audio-visuals, home take exercises and activities I used for all the lessons. I hoped that one day, I would be able to compile all these and publish it as a parents’ guide. That day has never been this closer. Moreover, the compilation evolved into both a parents’ guide and a story book.Story book  Children aged 6 – 10 were read paragraphs of the story of Job and they made drawings for each of these paragraphs. These drawings were then used to develop concepts for the illustrations of the story book. These concepts were further refined maintaining the initial concepts so that the children reading the story can relate to it.Story of Job – Parents’/Teachers’ guideThe parents’ guide, that can also be used by Sunday school teachers, comprises of 14 lessons. By tapping into the world of childhood, that of games, puzzles, role plays, and activities, it allows parents to teach the different concepts addressed by the book of Job.The guide also contains a complementary CD based on the last chapters of the book of Job. These are the chapters at which God started responding to Job, taking him on a tour of His creation and the CD contains an audio-visual representation of God’s response.  What have we done so far?
Text – The lessons have already been conducted with children and their effectiveness proven. In addition, the book has passed through multiple proof readings by an early childhood education expert and a veteran Sunday school teacher.
Illustration – For each of the paragraphs of the story, a minimum of four concept drawings were done by children. Based on the commonalities of the children’s drawings, all the illustrations for the storybook were then drafted, refined, and completed.
Design - Numerous revisions were made on the design, resulting in a beautiful final production-ready package, thanks to the talented graphic designer and awesome creative director.    
CD (God spoke CD) – High quality footages and images were sought for, corresponding to the different elements that God mentions while responding to Job. The narration has already been recorded, the CD edited and finalized. 
What remains?The final stride – productionThe objective of this campaign is to cover the production cost for 5000 copies of this package. By doing this, it is my aim to significantly reduce the retail price to as low as $4 per package. Hence, your contribution will allow a quality package to be available to more families, for whom it might otherwise have been expensive to buy. More so, you are partners in a project which aims to simplify and breakdown difficult and challenging concepts to children.And if more funds are secured, I’ll work on other segments of the project: translations into another local language and English, so that it reaches even more families; and even preparing the next book in line, which I’m currently teaching :). The TeamNatan Tilahun - Project Developer Suleiman Shifaw – Creative Director: The very first person to support this project, refine the initial concept, design, layout and provide creative directions.

<h3>Why Fairies?</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Persephone Vandegrift. I am an award-winning screenwriter, playwright, filmmaker and have been a loyal fan of the fairy realm since a little girl. I've been writing fairy stories for many years and am passionate about publishing a book series that inspires, amuses, intrigues, and entertains other fairy fans around the world. We know you're out there! </li>
<li>Contributing to The Very Fairy Series will bring this long-awaited dream to fruition. The only path open to us to achieve this is self-publishing. Our goal is to get our 1st book, Rosehip: A Very Curious Fairy, to its feet, out into the world, and generate enough interest that will help us publish the rest of the series. All books in the series will be published as an ebook and print. </li>
<li>Knowing this series will be in the hands, the laps, on the nightstands, bookcases, and on the Kindles, will be a dream come true for me, my illustrator, and fairy fans worldwide. Supporting campaigns creates an unforgettable community. Fans of the series will always be with us every step of the way. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are the fairy funds going?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every penny of the $3K raised will be invested in the 1st book, Rosehip: A Very Curious Fairy.</li>
<li>Costs: The initial expense is hiring someone to format Rosehip (ebook and print files) - costs @ $600. We also would like to pay our illustrator for his amazing and tireless hard work, and help cover the administrative, advertising and marketing costs ($900).</li>
<li>We'd like to be able to hire a website designer and a social media/book marketing professional ($1500) so we can focus on finishing the rest of the books in the series.  </li>
<li>I have written/produced two of my short films (All Things Hidden and The Last Light) by crowdfunding. We could not have done that, or continue to try and achieve these dreams, without the world's support. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fairy Perks...Did we mention those?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have an array of fun fairy perks! We'll have original artwork by Rosehip illustrator, Kristijan Vostner, hand-made items, pillows, totes, cakes, fairy wands, shirts, and yes, even FAIRY HOUSES! </li>
<li>We want to make this fun, imaginative, creative, inspiring, and worthwhile. We want it to be something you all will look forward to seeing out there. We want you to be able to point and say - '<u>I helped make that happen</u>.'</li>
<li>We know raising funds isn't easy. If we don't raise the entire amount, whatever we raise will put towards getting Rosehip available for purchase. Whatever Perks were picked up will be fulfilled, and if we have to wait on the website, marketing, etc. then that's what we'll do! </li>
<li>If you have any services you'd like to offer us, we'd be fairy relieved for any help. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fairy Stretch-Goals &amp; Outreach...</h3>
<ul><li>We'd love the series to be successful and have a positive, inspiring impact. The more we raise, the more we can do! If we can meet and beat our goal, we'd love to do a few more fairy things:</li></ul>
<p>        <strong><u> If we can raise over $3K:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We'd LOVE to animate the stories! And everyone we've talked to about the series wants us to animate it too!  </li>
<li> Hire a composer to create magical music while reading the ebook! </li>
<li>To take the book into schools and bring a little magic to kids and help them create their own fairy houses and pictures. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Very Fairy Impact</h3>
<p>For centuries, writers have given us a plethora of magical, intriguing, and timeless stories of fairies, elves, gnomes, trolls, pixies, brownies, devas, ballybogs, selkies, will o'wisps, merpeople (the list could go on). Those stories are what inspired me to write my own. Whether you've had a run-in with a fairy or not, their lore is enchanting, quirky, and mysterious.  This is what I aim to capture in The Very Fairy Series.  </p>
<ul><li>
<u>What this series has to offer?</u> The stories are engaging, positive, interactive, humorous, and thoughtful. The artwork is truly exceptional. Print books will include coloring pages so that you can feel like you are a part of the story and add your color to the world. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Fairy Challenges</h3>
<p>Finding a traditional publisher over the past couple years has been impossible. Self-publishing allows the impossible to become possible. The product is available immediately and no more waiting for permission to see the light of day. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fairy Help</h3>
<p>We realize not everyone can contribute funds. You can help the series by sharing the campaign link around the world via email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn - or wherever you find a fairy friend!</p>

<p>Youth Speaker.  Pastor.  Business Owner. Author.  Husband.  Father.  I have spent the last 20 years of my life working specifically with youth and young adults. As a former Youth Pastor, I know how important it is for students to grab hold of their own faith. I started a non-profit speaking ministry called Passion for Christ Ministries 15 years ago because I am passionate about two things. I am passionate about Jesus and what He has done in my life, and I am passionate about students. </p>
<p>Todays youth are caught in the middle ground of life.  They are not little kids anymore and are growing in their responsibilities.  They are not quite adults able to make every choice for themselves. They have so many voices speaking into their lives at one time and often it can hard to determine which voice is really from God. This is why I believe this book is so important for every student to read. It is packed full of fun illustrations, engaging stories, and practical day to day action steps to help facilitate growth in their walk with God. </p>
<p>How is this book unique?  Most devotionals are short maybe a paragraph or a page leaving students wanting something more in depth.  Each chapter of Rise Above the Noise will take you further than your average devotional, give you more content, and yet will not be so long that you cannot finish it before you go to school each morning.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Durale Harper and I am a person who has seen life from the bottom and now I am striving to be the best person I can be. This book is so important to me, because I want people to see that it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from, life happens to everyone, but it's how you stand back up and keep moving forward.  Any supporter who helps with this venture will be supporting me in helping to encourage lives of others through my story.  I know we can say this is just another book and in a way it is, but how many people would be very transparent and give you their life on a platter, in order for you to be encourage to keep going? I am hoping that someone would take the chance on me and help me impact the lives of others.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>All funding goes to publishing the book and to help build a website to support it.</li>
<li>People who support me will not only get a signed copy of the book, but the chance to be at one of the book events that is set up for the book.</li>
<li>If my goal is missed, then the funds that are donated will go directly to helping me publish the book.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe my calling is to make a positive Impact on this world.  What that looks like, I am still trying to figure out, but God put this book on my heart to share with the world, I just need some help to get it out there. </li>
<li>I have yet to fail in anything I have done, since I have let God take the lead in my life.  He has allowed me to do so much to serve others in this world and I am grateful that he has chosen me like many others to do so. </li>
<li>The one thing about me is I'm not afraid to ask for help.  There was a time in my life, where I let pride and stubbornness take over and I tried to do it myself, but those days are over.  I need help and it takes people who are willing to take chances on others like myself to impact the world in a positive way.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It can be hard to step out and trust people, this is something I know for certain, but I never stop losing faith in people.  Sometimes in life, people just need that one break, that one opportunity to reach that next level and I'm hoping that people are willing and open to take that chance with me.  the only risk that I see ahead of me, is getting help and getting the book in front of people who need to be encouraged and inspired. </p>

<p>Rounding out the Sir Robert Watson-Watt research team are Blake Parnham, Rick Parnham and Bruce Richard.</p>
<p>The news of the discovery of the memorabilia collection was so exciting, it captured the attention of a regional newspaper:</p>

Three years ago, I wrote these books while my late husband was going through chemotherapy to explain to my young daughter her dad’s cancer.Prior to writing this story, I searched online for books, blogs and at the library for the right words to explain such a serious situation in a simple way for my daughter to understand. I didn't find anything and it created a desire to make something for others.Your support of this project will mean:  other parents or caregivers may never have to struggle or search for the right words to say to their child, and children will have a story that can help them understand what their parent is going through.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Cooking with Keish project is designed to provide food formulas which eliminate the typical triggers for chronic migraines.  As a chronic migraine sufferer since the age of twelve, I began a real journey in trying to determine the cause of the misery in my life AKA The Migraine.

I was filled with unstoppable energy and impenetrable confidence for almost a week. I declared that I was going to write a book titled ""Hip Hop and Weed Saved My Life"" to anyone who would listen. The book would be a memoir beginning in childhood, portraying events that caused me to lose my voice and self-esteem. It would follow me through the important experiences of young adulthood and end with my moment of mania, which I believed at the time to mean my voice had come back to me. After all, I could not stop talking.</p><p>When mania faded and reality returned, I was embarrassed. My other declarations were that I would become a rapper and a skateboarder: two feats that require daring and bravery, traits that I had been missing for some time. It was not that these dreams were not true. They were but, without the hyper-confidence of a manic mindset, self-doubt returned and depression set in.</p><p>I wrote chapters to my memoir, planning on fulfilling my promise. I wrote poems and songs, too. Rhyme and rhythm come easily to me, which is why writing rap verses was an attractive avenue. I spent many years as a painter, and writing poetry feels like painting. I use my subconscious to place words on paper (like strokes on canvas) and they become pictures, layered and subjective. <br/><br/>Eventually, I realized that hip hop and weed did not save my life. They did, however, keep me alive when life felt its most difficult. I graduated college with a 3.9 GPA and stepped into the world with little belief in my ability to accomplish anything that was not required of me. It was time to make my own goals and deadlines, but I was failing miserably. My anxiety was through the roof. My body followed suit, and I fell through the attic floor of my new apartment and sustained injuries that will affect me for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>Injured and lacking company, I filled my days with music and television. I fell in love with Drake, like I had fallen in love with celebrities before him. The attraction here, however, was musical and lyrical. His voice gave me the comfort of a warm blanket. I listened to my favorite tracks on repeat during three months of bedrest. I took up smoking pot, and found that the drug + bass beats (especially Drake's) acted much like Xanax (which I had never taken). I found a place of peace, a place without worry. When I was stoned, my anxiety and depression were less severe. I could shake the tendency to wish I was dead, which was obviously a huge relief. I had not faced my fears, but I got better at hiding them.<br/><br/>I started to avoid making artwork about myself when my teenage years were closing. I heard the call of my Jesuit university to lead a life of service, and turned my creative focus to Louisiana's dying coast. I stopped listening to pop and hip-hop, genres that I loved, and kept my radio tuned to jazz, following the opinion of my boyfriend at the time. </p><p>At some point, I lost myself. I lost my ability to stand up for myself or form my own opinions. I lost the healing benefits of creativity when I refused to manifest the feelings inside of me. I also lost self-compassion, if I ever had it. </p><p>The poems that I wrote in post-mania depression were inspired by the loss of a lover. For months and months he did not leave my mind, so I dedicated many words of him. Ultimately, the poems of<i> Heartworm</i> are about me. The poems are a record of grief and growth. They contain my secrets, my insecurities, my mistakes, my pain and my longings. This book is the work of art that I avoided making for years, the memoir that I no longer have to write, a picture of obsession and addiction, and the confession of a woman who relied too heavily on love songs. These poems saved my life. <br/><br/>Each poem in <i>Heartworm</i> is named after a song that I have been obsessed with at some point in my life. They are songs that gave me confidence, helped me mourn, and kept me company.

“All of the police officers & support staff who heard Sophie were in absolute awe of her brave journey through life. It is stories from inspirational speakers like Sophie that stay with you forever. Sophie on behalf of Surrey Police you’re inspirational, thank you!”Clinton Blackburn, Supt Ops, Co-Chair of Surrey Police LGBT Staff Support Network

“Sophie Cook is playing, I think, a fabulous role in driving a diversity and inclusion message using the power of football and its attraction into an audience that maybe wouldn’t be receptive to those messages – and that’s an area we’ve been very happy to help with.”Nathan Homer, Barclays Global Sponsorship Group

“Brilliant isn’t a word I use very often but what you did and said was just that. A truly memorable presentation that was enthralling and your journey is just incredible.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the author of five previous books: <i>Mal Occhio: The Underside of Vision</i> (North Point Press: 1981), <i>Dream Streets: The Big Book of Italian American Culture</i> (Harper &amp; Row: 1989), <i>Una Storia Segreta: The Secret History of Italian American Evacuation and Internment During World War II</i> (Heyday Books: 2001), <i>Esty: A Novel/Memoir</i> (Sanniti: 2012), and <i>Branded: How Italian Immigrants Became ‘Enemies’ During WWII </i>(Sanniti: 2016). I have also reprinted the first two under my own Sanniti Publications imprint: <i>The Big Book of Italian American Culture</i> (Sanniti: 1996), and <i>Mal Occhio</i> (Sanniti: 2008).</p>
<p>    Publishing books under a small imprint is not easy; bookstores shy away and publicity is hard to come by. Nonetheless, controlling a book all the way from conception to design to printing has its rewards, mainly that the writer’s concern can focus on the integrity of the end product, rather than the market. So I am trying, once again, to publish <i>Earth Breath </i>under my own Sanniti Publications imprint.</p>
<p>     To be sure, no one person can do this alone, so by joining me once again, you can help by acting as the book’s primary encouragers, readers and supporters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sample from the blog <i>Earth Breath</i>:</p>
<p>…at some point, as I observed how I was breathing, and how it still seemed to be something like, ‘I am breathing, this body is pulling oxygen in from outside and pushing carbon dioxide out to somewhere else,’ a changed perception, momentary but very real, occurred. It suddenly felt as if it were not “I” who was drawing in air from the outside, but as if the exchange were simply transpiring of itself; more, as if outside and inside were “not two” as the saying goes. As if there were not just an individual self seizing a few quarts of oxygen from the air outside, but something very much larger pulsing in a rhythm with others. As if a kind of universal rhythm were in play. And that that rhythm, which included all else in its pulsations, was breathing me. And I it. Hence the power of the above image of the earth, each year breathing in, and breathing out: earth breath.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In times past, book publishers often relied on “angels,” wealthy donors who wanted to associate themselves with the gentile world of publishing. Now you, as a supporter of small publishing, can become an “angel” for this book—helping to get <i>Earth Breath</i> into print and also into the hands of hundreds of readers.</p>
<p>   I have the book designed and it’s ready to be printed. With a modest initial print run of only 100 copies, with the rest to be printed on demand, I figure I need about $1200.00 to begin with. The virtue of a “print-on-demand” operation, of course, is that I don’t have to keep an inventory of hundreds of books in my living room.</p>
<p>   Here’s how you can help. Any donation, from $25 up, is gratefully accepted. For a donation of $50.00, you get an autographed copy of the book. For $100.00, you get two autographed copies (give them as gifts). For $150.00, you get the two autographed copies and are mentioned in print on the <i>Acknowledgments</i> page as a <strong>Sponsor</strong>. Each person who gives $200.00 will receive the two copies and be mentioned in print as a <strong>Patron</strong>. Beyond that, a $300 donation gets you the two books and acknowledgement as an <strong>Angel</strong>.</p>
<p>NB: in order to be acknowledged in the printed book, the donation must be received before we go to press in July. If there is a second or third printing, we should be able to acknowledge donors who miss this initial deadline. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Frankly, I’m not sure what the impact of this book of past blogs will be. But in this age of historical amnesia, especially in America, perhaps it can provide some historical perspective on our politics, our crises like global warming, our food habits, and our ways of thinking. It can also  demonstrate the power of one person’s work in the aggregate and over a wide range—something that blogs appearing one at a time cannot do. I hope it will also provide an example that writing and thinking a matter through are still things of value in our 140-character culture.  </p>
<p>   The shared method of bringing this book out might help in this endeavor, confirming that there is still a reading audience for thoughtful, carefully-crafted opinion that credits its sources. And trying something new this time—“print-on-demand,” whereby a book only gets printed when it is ordered—will be exciting, both for this book, and, if it works out, for future ones. It means that the amount I need to raise initially is far less, besides putting me in touch with Ingram (the POD printer), a major book distributor. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Though there are risks in any publishing venture, I think my experience in producing two previous books,<i> Esty</i> and <i>Branded</i>, via crowd-sourcing on Indiegogo gives me a leg up for this project. I know what the costs will be, and what the distribution challenges are, though in this case, my use of Ingram, a major distributor, for printing, should help. So should the audience I already have on my blogsite, distasiblog.blogspot.com. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone understands that money is tight and prices are rising these days. But even if you can’t contribute monetarily, you can still help get the word out. Indiegogo has share tools that allow you to spread the word on the web via social media. More personally, you can tell your friends about the book, and about this campaign. You can suggest it as a great book for bookstores, colleges and libraries. Every bit of help, no matter its size or reach, will be greatly appreciated. Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h3>Jack Be Nimble...</h3>
<p>is important to me as a writer because children of color need to first, know their history and they also need to see representations of themselves in places that are scarce for people of color. This is a story of a little boy who comes from a family of men who bond and build relationships over the game of baseball dating back generations since Jackie Robinson was drafted in the 1940's.

is important to me as a writer because children of color need to first, know their history and they also need to see representations of themselves in places that are scarce for people of color. This is a story of a little boy who comes from a family of men who bond and build relationships over the game of baseball dating back generations since Jackie Robinson was drafted in the 1940's. He is aware of how important the game of baseball is to his family for that reason, but has no idea how much it would impact his own life. He wants to continue this family tradition, but he knows he has some large cleats to fill and that scares him. This is a story of tradition, relationships between men of color and perseverance.

<h3>The Backstory</h3>
<p>One day at about 6am, I was sitting at my desk and wrote the first stanza in the book, ""I was so sleepy, I was so tired."" I didn't know where the story was going, but kept writing to see what would happen. Soon the story began to evolve as I added different elements. After many iterations, edits and changes, I found the story I wanted to tell.</p>
<p>Often when I write, I am writing to my children. I ask myself, ""What lesson do I want my children to learn?"" After having <i>Conquer Your Dragons</i> edited, I knew that this was a powerful story to share with young people and adults alike. Each of us has our own set of challenges, and <i>Conquer Your Dragons</i> gives us the hope that we can overcome each of them. It is also a fun and exciting story. </p>
<p>After completing the book, I knew that I needed to publish it. I turned to my buddy Darrin Haggard and asked him to sketch out some drawings for the story. As always, Darrin didn't disappoint, he has absolutely done a stunning job on these illustrations. For more info on Darrin, visit his website: <a href=""http://www.darrinlhaggard.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.darrinlhaggard.com</a>.</p>

<p><i>This is a mock up of what the book will look like.</i></p>
<p>Soon after the editing of the book, I knew I wanted to share this story in other ways. I have always been a people-person and have enjoyed public speaking, therefore, I decided to create a keynote presentation on this message. I have spoken in front of several audiences and the feedback has been great. For more information on Conquering Your Dragons with Adam Friday Woods, please see this video on the program: <a href=""https://adamfridaywoods.com/program-description"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://adamfridaywoods.com/program-description</a></p>
<p>Thank you for all of the support and love. I feel the encouragement and the overall good vibes. I hope to be able to one day spread this important message, through this book and keynote presentation, to millions of people around the world. </p>

<h3>New to Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Indiegogo's platform of raising money for indie projects like this is amazing. By pre-ordering the book in this manner, your contributions will allow indie artists like me to publish this book and get this message out to people all over the world. As a trade off for your help, I have created some great perks only available through Indiegogo. Contributors will have the first editions of the book and other items before anyone else. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>The book manuscript is edited and finished. Darrin is working hard on finishing the illustrations. He is almost done. Once the pictures are done and after the end of this campaign in December, I will work with book designers to get this to press. I expect that the book will be available by March 2018, but hopefully sooner. I will begin shipping everything to you along with the book at this time. I know it's a long time to wait, but am working with all vendors involved to get these items to you as quick as possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where will the funds go?</h3>
<p>My campaign goal of $3500 is simply a minimum for this kind project. I hope to raise well past that. The majority of the funds will be used for printing, shipping, other production costs, admin costs, and illustrations. The rest of the money will be used to spread this message and to get the book into as many bookstores and schools as possible.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Folded Notes</strong> (<i>Inspired by true events</i>)</p>
<p>Bath 1898, Catherine embarks on a trip with her mother to Lahore in India to meet her father who is posted at the Punjab University. There, her path crosses with Kharak, a recently qualified engineer from Lahore who works for the Indian Railways, and a mutual friendship blossoms. In disapproval, her father with the help of a colonial engineer conceive a plan to avert her from falling in love with him by managing to get him sent away to work in another British colony. He manages to leave two notes for her before departing. Realising that her feelings for him are overwhelming, she leaves Lahore following him to Mombasa without her parent’s knowledge.  Little does she know that, not only will the colonial engineer be there as Kharak’s supervisor, but as her pursuer. With everything to lose, hope is what she has, to enable her to triumph in expressing her enduring love for him.</p>
<p><u>The author    </u>                </p>
<p>I was born in Nairobi, Kenya, lived in Australia for five years and currently reside in England. My first indie book titled, 'The Secrets of The Indian Hockey Dribble' was a tribute to my late father who was a double hockey Olympian.</p>

<h3>The Founder</h3>
<p><strong>Lauren Kimble</strong></p>
<p>I created this platform to deal with the raw moments of event planning. Where could a vegan bride or an Eco-conscience party planner turn for inspiration? Being in the event industry for ten years I realize that there is a misconception about event planning being full of glitz, glamour and everything going according to plan.</p>
<p>However, the blood sweat and tears that go into turning a vision into realty, are often overlooked. Yes, the finished product looks amazing however, I wanted to give readers real stories from real people about the good, bad, and in between of planning a vegan event. I also wanted to give readers a raw glimpse into the inspiration behind the businesses they might use/hire for various aspects of their events.</p>
<p><strong><i>Special Honor</i></strong></p>
<p>I also created Fil Magazine in honor of my grandmother. Growing up I remember how much she loved to write. Unfortunately her dream of writing a book was not realized before her passing.</p>
<p><i><strong>Where did I get the name for the magazine?</strong></i></p>
<p>My grandmother's favorite animal was an elephant hence the name Fil, which means elephant in Iceland. When creating Fíl Magazine it was important for me to ensure that an allocated portion of the magazines proceeds go towards helping elephants in need throughout the world.</p>
<h3><strong>How The Money Will be Used</strong></h3>
<p>So why $50,000? We want to make sure we are creating a magazine with integrity. We make sure that no animals are harmed and that we are reducing our carbon footprint as much as possible. With that in mind, our magazine will be published using sustainable printing methods  versus traditional printing which increases the price. The bulk of the funding will go towards printing the first and second issue, which includes print production and shipping costs. We will also be paying our contributors, photographers, editors, etc.  Lastly, it will go towards an office space where we can host workshops and events.  Other fees include: IndieGoGo fees, marketing, editing, web design/hosting development, marketing, and design administrative services/supplies.</p>
<p>Fil Magazine will be independently distributed to select bookstores, vegan shops internationally, and via online retailers as well as our own website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We make sure that our features and vendors are value living or in transition to a vegan lifestyle.  By creating awareness that you can have a stunning event without harming animals, it is our hope that there will be a shift in the way individuals view the event planning industry.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>Even if you cannot support us financially, we appreciate you spreading the word. Please share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other avenues where you feel individuals will be inspired by what we are doing at Fil Magazine.</p><p>Don't forget to check out our website <a href=""http://www.myfilmag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.myfilmag.com</a></p><p>Thank you all so much in advance for every like, share, and contribution.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Let’s talk about representation and being heard as individuals! As Asian Americans who grew up in the Bay Area, we saw a gap in the way our stories were packaged and shared with the rest of the world. In a society where <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, a wonderful film that we love, is deemed a pivotal moment that brought Asian storytelling to the rest of the world, we can’t help but feel like there’s still much more to be done and many more stories to tell. We have to keep the momentum going. To be Asian is so many things and it can look so many different ways. Our community shouldn’t be painted with one broad stroke. Since modern society moves slowly to address gaps in representation, we decided to create a project to tell the stories we’ve been missing. We want to foster deeper connections with the people around us. We’re committed to changing <i>our</i> narrative - one story at a time. Our visual storytelling platform aims to highlight the different perspectives, cultures and individual experiences that go beyond a label of our identities. We invite you to join the conversation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The founders of <strong>More Than Asian</strong>, Lawrence Ricardo and Alex Hallmark, are passionate about filling a gap in Asian-American representation. Our goal with this project is to drive the conversation through a series of topics that are relatable and relevant to the Asian-American community and their allies. In preparation for a formal launch, we are in the development stage of profiling, photographing and conducting written interviews of Asian American young adults as they tell their individual stories. The more stories we share to the world, the more of a permanent place we create for ourselves as Asian Americans.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the integrity of this kind of storytelling, funding is needed to sustain this project long-term. Please support us in creating a platform for content that focuses on real Asian-American identities and experiences.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are extremely grateful for our dedicated team of creatives who are working completely pro bono because of our shared passions and goals for the Asian-American community. However, developing an important passion project such as this requires more than the love and support of our friends, family and community. We want to be able to sustain this project long-term, so we need the financial stability for all inevitable costs of operations including printed collateral, transcribing interviews, productivity software, and most importantly, paying for the domain and subscription of our storytelling website platform. In the next phase, we want to elevate our platform by hiring consultants and creatives that will be instrumental in pushing our project to the next level.</p>
<p>We are appreciative and thankful of everyone’s contributions and support. As a thank you, the MTA team will write and sign a MTA-branded and handwritten card and will highlight you on the legacy wall of our website.</p>
<p>To those who have contributed to our success so far, thank you! We look forward to launching this project to represent you and our community.</p>
<h3>What We've Done So Far</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed the brand, messaging and creative direction of our project, including designing distinct logo marks and brand elements. </li>
<li>Brought on a talented photographer and graphic designer who will help bring our stories and brand to life visually.</li>
<li>Paid a one-year subscription for our website domain and host: morethanasian.com</li>
<li>Pinpointed more than 15 individuals who are interested in telling their individual stories of living as Asian Americans. </li>
<li>Pinpointed more than 10 individuals who have expressed interest in helping sustain our project on a creative and management level. <br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Reason For Being</h3>
<p><strong>More Than Asian</strong> is a conversation starter focused on Asian American identities and experiences, drawing connections within communities and individual spaces. We visually stimulate and empower our audience through positive, open and diverse storytelling.</p>

<h3>What's been going on?</h3>
<p>For me, Laura Lobo, ""wearing a lot of hats"" has always meant more than just a cute gimmick for the video you just watched. My whole life has been exciting and filled with a variety of roles and experiences. With many ""ups"" and a good handful of ""downs"" too, I've always felt blessed to be alive, learning and growing by making astute observations along the way. This collection of valuable insights has clearly resonated with other adventuresome dreamers.</p>
<p>During the past 12 years, my speaking and training career has revealed just how useful these tips and perspectives have been for people in all walks of life and at any age. Now they are finally collected into one volume, ""Give Your Talent Wings"" which exists only in an edited manuscript form on the date of this campaign launch, November 4, 2019. It's time for some page design, cover art and printing! Ready? Set? Go!</p>
<h2>The POWER of synergy</h2>
<p>Teamwork and community are inarguably the best tools for getting a job done right. Now that this book is getting published, it's thrilling to include YOU in the process. You are Part of a Miracle by joining my side, encouraging me and reinforcing what a worthwhile endeavor this is!</p>
<p>After having researched several options, my valuable advisors and I are ready to make use of our relevant business experience. Our next steps behind the scenes will be to choose the best printer, select appropriate options, and get designs and layouts for the cover and pages, lickety-split. We just need to know that we've got readers!</p>
<p>By jumping in now, prior to printing, you can help us do two very important things, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the best pricing on the initial print run, accumulating a large order (Goal: 500 books)</li>
<li>Drive awareness for <i>Give Your Talent Wings</i>, to exceed the goal and reach more readers - paving the way for more successful performers, artists, speakers and dreamers to achieve their full potential and generate innovative successes that make the world better for all of us!</li>
</ol>
<p>So enough about ""ME"". From now on it's ""WE"". This is about ALL OF US creating a movement and reaching a world in need with a message of hope and encouragement. Giving wings to talent that would otherwise be under-expressed. It's a revolution worth fighting for!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's really this simple. Your willingness to be Part of a Miracle is valuable in ways that money alone can't buy. Let's break it down with just a few details:</p>
<ul>
<li>With only 250 of you pledging to order two copies of the Limited Edition first-run book, we get there in an instant! You might even want to be part of our Generosity Perk, with one book for you, and one copy to be used as a promotional give-away prize at a neighborhood concert or performance next year.</li>
<li>Maybe two Limited Edition books isn't in your budget right now. That's no big deal. Honestly! When you sign up for even the minimum $2 perk, you'll get a digital download (MP3) of the inspiring original song Part of a Miracle and be included in our online community of support. Observe as awareness for this movement grows and watch as lives are transformed into higher levels of creative expression and positive collaboration!</li>
<li>The fun is only now beginning! We've got some creative events to plan together, both in Minnesota and Florida, and you get to help decide how these play out! Just be sure to accept the invitation to our facebook community.</li>
<li>For those super enthusiastic participants with deeper pockets, personalized music-driven experiences and book study groups will be formed, adding to a more sizzling wow factor!</li>
<li>Then, if for some odd reason we don't reach our entire goal, please know that we are prepared to modify the printing strategy, still keeping our promise to deliver finished books to those who jumped in with participation pledges. The adjustment from color pages to black &amp; white pages will make it possible for us to print a smaller volume and still fulfill our delivery expectations. Either way, the cover of the book will be dynamic, colorful and exciting for this one time Limited Edition first-run collectable version of <i>Give Your Talent Wings</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Maybe you know someone first hand who could use some practical guidelines and supportive advice in their creative pursuits. Is it your nephew? Your church's worship leader? Your neighbor? Maybe it's YOU.</p>
<p>In all reality, who DOESN'T have an unfulfilled dream on the back burner?</p>
<p>With <i>Give Your Talent Wings</i> and its accompanying study guides, hope resurges and winning strategies unfold. Communities feel the effects of authentic leaders rising to the fulness of their own potential. Conversations shift from ""what's the problem?"" to ""how are we going to solve it?""</p>
<p>With so much division in our nation and in our world, simply starting the right conversations is a critical need!</p>
<p><i>Give Your Talent Wings</i> comes with a long term plan to keep the right dialogues going. In 2020, we will be rolling out a limited time offer for free online training of leaders willing to facilitate study groups, which will ensure the activation and implementation of the unique and valuable lessons buried deep in the pages of these thought-provoking materials. Each person's experience of <i>Give Your Talent Wings</i> is bound to be completely unique, yet by sharing our take-aways and building close-knit accountability teams, the learning will come to life before our eyes!</p>
<p>This truly is a creative revolution. Let's be part of growing this momentum together!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With such a commitment to teamwork, it seems like the risks are minimal. Our advisors and team are ready for the challenges of page layout, cover design and publishing, so we hope that we are overwhelmed with a high volume of eager readers.</p>
<p>Staying open and transparent with all of you during the next several weeks will be easy using video and email. If you decide not to stay plugged in, just opt out. We aren't going to spam you to death. You'll still be appreciated and your perks will be provided as soon as they are available!</p>
<p>If you want to use these perks as holiday gifts, that's awesome. In the event that our set up, proofreading and printing process gets dragged out, we will provide beautiful and colorful gift certificates in time for the stocking stuffing and tree decorating occasions. Be assured that we'll do our best to have the real thing ready by the holidays, yet we don't want to compromise on quality just because of the hectic season's fast approach. Thanks for understanding!</p>
<p>Practically speaking, the greatest risk for you as a participant might be exposure to more videos of my lovable cats than you would care to see. I'll have to ask you to be patient with me as I struggle to curb these urges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just get the word out and make some noise about this!</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools, and especially once we are beyond the first 1/3 of our goal.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, I am a native Spanish speaker. I wrote what you are about to read, therefore, please forgive me for any mistakes I may have made. I respect the English language and I apologize for any grammar or spelling problems. THANK YOU :)<br/></p> <ul>
<li>My name is Andrea Amosson, I am a Chilean and I currently live in Texas with my husband and two  boys. I am an author and I have written 2 books in Spanish: a novel and a short stories collection. My novel, Rictus, has been described as ""an original, attractive and well delivered narrative voice"" by the critics. It was published in Chile four years ago. I am a journalist and I have graduate studies in literature. </li> <li>My husband is an American and he claims to be my #1 fan, only that he can't read my books! I wish to share my writing not only with him, but with everybody. My novel Rictus has literary merit according to the critics; because it is an honest attempt to brake with masculine stereotypes in writing and it has a woman as a protagonist: a young undertaker who feels compelled to find out why another woman died. <br/>
</li> <li>With your help, I believe we will add an interesting piece of work to the English speaking market. You will also help me with my writing career here in the U.S. Rictus took me five years: from first to last page, I broke a leg, got married, became a mom, changed countries 3 times.  My novel has meaning for me and I hope it can have meaning for you too. And because the book goes about life, work, mystery, romance, suspense, humor, only an independent editor could see the value in it, beyond commercial criteria.

</div></div>","Short Summary
First of all, I am a native Spanish speaker. I wrote what you are about to read, therefore, please forgive me for any mistakes I may have made. I respect the English language and I apologize for any grammar or spelling problems. THANK YOU :) 
My name is Andrea Amosson, I am a Chilean and I currently live in Texas with my husband and two  boys. I am an author and I have written 2 books in Spanish: a novel and a short stories collection. My novel, Rictus, has been described as ""an original, attractive and well delivered narrative voice"" by the critics. It was published in Chile four years ago. I am a journalist and I have graduate studies in literature.  My husband is an American and he claims to be my #1 fan, only that he can't read my books! I wish to share my writing not only with him, but with everybody. My novel Rictus has literary merit according to the critics; because it is an honest attempt to brake with masculine stereotypes in writing and it has a woman as a protagonist: a young undertaker who feels compelled to find out why another woman died. 
 With your help, I believe we will add an interesting piece of work to the English speaking market. You will also help me with my writing career here in the U.S. Rictus took me five years: from first to last page, I broke a leg, got married, became a mom, changed countries 3 times.  My novel has meaning for me and I hope it can have meaning for you too. And because the book goes about life, work, mystery, romance, suspense, humor, only an independent editor could see the value in it, beyond commercial criteria. After a long search and plenty of rejections, I got a publishing contract for the Spanish manuscript. And the book sells really good. So it was a win win for all of us!
Nowadays Orange Production, an independent publishing house here in the U.S., is about to launch my short stories collection in English. ""TOLD FROM THE HIPS"" (http://www.amazon.com/Told-Hips-stories-Andrea-Amosson-ebook/dp/B00SXHEHRO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422892459&sr=8-1&keywords=told+from+the+hips) Please visit the link, where you can download a fragment of the book and verify the quality of my writing.

Our blog & seasonal publications captures this lifestyle of motherhood by featuring ‘mama bloggers’, articles on motherhood, home design, food, fashion, travel, careers and by featuring the creative works of other moms to be sold on our etsy store. 
We want more than anything to redefine how the lifestyle of motherhood is portrayed and to encourage the fact that a mothers place is not only in the home but also in the world...simple as it should be...
We need your help to turn this blog into a seasonal publication where we feature the creative works, passions, pursuits and ideas of mothers all over the world in hopes empower women and let them know that their creativity matters.
Funding & Gratitude

To begin our publication we are looking at a start-up costs being close to $30,000 for the first year. (It says $80,000 but this is incorrect!!)  This will cover the first few months of salary for our staff, a venue for our workspace, the initial cost of materials & supplies for the as well as any additional cost that come across when starting a small business.
If we don't reach our initial goal, ALL funds raised will go straight to our business start-up, and we hope to find the additional funding through a business investment or loan.
To show our gratitude we really want to make every contributor feel like they are part of the experience. Whether its a handwritten thank you card, a free copy of our books, a gift basket expressing our gratitude...all the rewards are listed to the side. Our desire is to further keep community & involvement going, because this is what our business is all about.

   Risks & Challenges



 

A major challenge we face is not raising enough money to complete the project to the full grandeur.

If this were to be the case, we would seek out loans or investment. If it comes down to it, we will even start out smaller depending on how much funding we receive. 
Please help support this lifestyle of motherhood by following our blog, Simple As It Should Be!

<p>Israel and the
United States often speak of their shared values, but when it comes to African
refugees their practices are in stark contrast. Asylum seekers in Israel are denied the basic rights of refugees, and the government has employed various policies to pressure asylum
seekers to leave – including indefinite arbitrary detention, refusal to review asylum claims, denial of basic state-services, intimidation, and coerced deportation. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Although the refugees and asylum seekers come
from different places, they share a common experience of loss and hope. </b>Whether
fleeing ethnic cleansing and genocide in Sudan or the brutal military regime in
Eritrea, <b>they yearn for a normal life and a temporary safe haven</b> where they can live until the situation in their home country improves. In spite of experiencing
horrific perils on their way to Israel such as being smuggled, kidnapped and
tortured in the Sinai desert, and sometimes shot at by the Egyptian border police, they receive
little sympathy and consideration from Israeli policy makers. African refugees and asylum seekers in Israel are treated as a security threat
and a demographic stain on the ethnic and religious character of the state. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">African asylum seekers make up a mere 0.5% of Israel's population, and the construction of the Sinai border fence in 2012 reduced the flow of migrants by 99%, but policy makers continue to inflame demographic fears while refusing to acknowledge the crises in Africa that made them refugees.  The government's most recent policy forces African asylum seekers to make a seemingly impossible choice: deportation or indefinite imprisonment.</p>

<p>ARDC is an Israeli
grassroots nonprofit organization founded in 2004 by both African asylum
seekers and Israelis. Its mission is to enable and ensure that all refugees and asylum seekers
in Israel are free from persecution, live in dignity, and have the opportunity to
realize their aspirations. Through a myriad of initiatives that are essential
to the community, ARDC implements projects that assist, support, and
empower African asylum seekers in Israel. <b>These initiatives include, but are
not limited to, assistance in applying for refugee status and
relocation, technical support on visa issues, higher education consultations,
vocational training, language courses, leadership building, reconciliatory
dialogue, and awareness raising and advocacy. </b></p>
<p>ARDC employs a
unique methodology that prioritizes asylum seeker participation and
leadership in all activities of the organization. Asylum seekers play key roles
in all operations including governance, management, project planning, and
implementation. Asylum seekers are board members, project
managers, coordinators, community mobilizers, and translators. The ARDC is the only organization in Israel with an asylum seeker in the role of Executive Director. This close
connection and inclusion of the African refugees and asylum seekers has allowed the ARDC to map, design, and implement projects that genuinely meet the
most pertinent needs of this community. </p>
<p>ARDC delivers notable results with minimal
resources. In 2014, with only 5 full-time staff and 200 volunteers, it assisted
more than 2,000 asylum seekers among whom 1,288 entered the asylum process, 103
reunited with family abroad, 315 improved their Hebrew and English language
skills, 125 received assistance with higher education, 150 received tutoring
support, 30 gained skills and knowledge vital to community leadership, 71
received psycho-social therapy for trauma, and 21 were empowered through income-generation.
Over the course of its short existence the ARDC has served an astounding 10,000+
individuals from various African countries.</p>

My name is Brandon and I am a nearly 32 year old entrepreneur, aspiring author, husband, and step daddy to two adventurous little boys. I am currently in the middle of getting an incredible, inspirational memoir from my journals, heart, and mind into your very hands. This developing book follows love, friendship, and adventure on a quest around the world on the pursuit to discover the recipe to organic <strong>happiness</strong>. </p>
<p>Genre will be memoir, adventure travel, backpacking, inspirational, and self help.</p>
<p>Countries covered will be USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium.</p>

<p>Having chosen to self publish I now find myself running a full time business essentially, and as we know, with any business comes expenses. The content of the book is just about in the can and ready to be sent off to editing. I have already paid $225 for wide distribution (ebook+ hard copy) through a company known as fastpencil.com. In addition, I have paid about $300 towards Facebook advertisement. Here are now my upcoming financial obstacles that I am facing, hence the opportunity for donation:</p>
<p>Editing- I have found an editor that will edit the entire manuscript (90-95K words) for 0.02 cents/word, which will total around $2,000+ tax.</p>
<p>Legal review and paperwork- I have a copyright attorney that I have already had a free consultation with, however I am looking at $1,000 more for further content review, Publishing LLC development and additional legal paperwork.</p>
<p>Website development- I have arranged a professional to create a full web page with mobile friendly options and book ordering capabilities...this is going to cost $1,200.</p>
<p>Advertising- as a self publisher I am responsible for ALL advertising! Obviously investment cost is endless for advertising, but I would like to start between $500-1,000.</p>

<p>Clearly my expenses outnumber the amount requested on this campaign, but I am just seeking any support that anyone is willing to throw my way. The process of writing this book has been life changing, and I know the final product will entertain, challenge, and inspire not only the WORLD, but YOU greatly!</p>

<p>However, it is not all about money! I cannot stress how much I need everyone to SHARE SHARE SHARE- everything, anything book related- share it!

About the Author
Hello, my name is Maureen Croissant Prairie. I am a published author of Rock and Roll, Crash and Burn: The Driver Story, my memoir from the time I spent with the band 'Driver'.
 I have been involved in the entertainment industry since childhood and 
now, as an author, I like to write novels based on the 'behind the

About the Book


MacKenzie Ferguson, or Mac as he’s called, grows up in the
spotlight, ‘born on stage and incubated by the spotlight’ as his father boasts.
His parents are both theatrical actors and have explained to their only child
that performing is like ‘make believe’. Mac grows up often conflicted by the
‘make believe world’ and the ‘real world’.
As a young child in Scotland, Mac has worked in the
advertisement and entertainment industry; posing for printed advertisements and
catalogues; acting in commercials and having bit parts in movies. The outgoing
child grows into a dark, conflicted teen when his best friend convinces him to
form a rock band, which takes him to super stardom. Mac’s professional career
is filled with controversy and danger.
Mac’s personality changes once again to a considerate,
loving man when he meets the love of his life, Lesley. The couple has it all;
love, rock and roll, fame and popularity. Their beautiful love story turns to
tragedy and horror when their lives become exposed to treachery and heartbreak.
What We Need & What You Get
 Any funds I receive through this campaign will be used to offset publishing, marketing, shipping and launch costs. If my goals are not entirely reached, any funds received will continue to go towards offsetting these costs as well.
I am offering perks to anyone who pledges a minimum of $25 CAD. For pledges of at least $25 CAD, you will receive a personalized, autographed book of The Real World of Make Believe!  AND for pledges of at least $50 CAD, I will send you a personalized, autographed copy of both books, The Real World of Make Believe.... AND........Rock and Roll, Crash and Burn: The Driver Story!!!!!!!!!    The Impact Storytelling and literary works have been the backbone of societies all over the world. It is a way of expressing, fantasizing, stress reduction, education and passing on history. I am honoured to be given the gift of writing, a gift I enjoy very much.
I have attained success when I published my first full length book, Rock and Roll, Crash and Burn: The Driver Story. This book is being sold in selected Chapers/Indigo and Coles bookstores; in smaller local bookstores and through Amazon Kindle. I am invited on a regular basis to hold signing events at these and other locations. I have received positive reviews from critics all over the world.
I have also had a short story published in an anthology. My piece Of Days Gone By was published in Voices of Thunder.
I feel I have captured the same intensity with The Real World of Make Believe as I have been known for in my previous work.    Risks & Challenges  The challenges I face is my geographic location and therefor using Indiegogo as well as other social media to help spread the word and allow a larger population to have the opportunity to experience my books.    Other Ways You Can Do to Help
I understand that not everyone can contribute! You can still be part of my Campaign team by spreading the word, share my links, send me a friend request on fb (Maureen Croissant-Prairie) and message me that you saw my Campaign on Indiegogo so I can send links and updates that you can share on your pages.

<h3>7Vientos - Revival</h3>
<p>7Vientos (7V) is a small, independent publishing company based in Chicago, IL and Mexico City, Mexico. After a hiatus (caused by new careers, editions to families, and shifting responsibilities) 7V is back with two new books! But! Danny and Kolin need your help getting them from our hard drives into your hands. </p>
<p>The Project - Continuing the Vision<br/>7V first published Rey Andújar's <i>Saturnario / Saturnalia</i> in its signature hardcover flip style in 2012. Since then we've sold out (!!) but we still have people looking for copies of the book, so we're bringing it back! This time as an English-only paperback featuring a brand new, completely redone translation. Even if you already have the first edition, you're going to want this new version. The new, improved translation lends new understanding and interpretations of Rey's fantastic stories. If you weren't lucky enough to get your hands on the first edition, then this second edition is perfect for you, too. You can't lose!</p>
<p>Héctor Torres is a Venezuelan writer who has been chronicling the ups and downs of everyday life in Caracas for the last two decades. His book <i>Caracas Muerde: Crónicas de una guerra no declarada </i>was originally published in Venezuela in 2012. Since then the situation in Caracas and in the rest of the country has worsened to an almost unimaginable degree. Torres' stories of hope and heartbreak, pain and fear, death and redemption are even more poignant now than ever before. 7V will bring this edition to life as a hardcover flip version in the original Spanish with English translation under the title <i>Caracas Muerde: Chronicles of a Relentless City</i>. </p>
<p>Your support will help us make these two new books a reality and continue our goal of bringing the works of underrepresented Latin authors to a wider, English-speaking audience. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Publishing isn't an inexpensive proposition and to realize this project, we need $25,500. This money will cover the cost of the author's rights, translation, interior and cover design, proofreading and editing, printing, and marketing of both books. It will also allow us to fly Héctor Torres from Caracas to Chicago for the book release party and book tour!*</p>
<p>By helping us fund this project, you'll receive exclusive perks you won't find anywhere else. There will be stickers; limited edition prints of the book cover art; tickets to a dinner in Chicago with Héctor Torres*, Rey Andújar, and the 7Vientos team; and even a special stretch goal.</p>
<p>While we don't want to think about the possibility of not reaching our goal, should we fall short, there's still a lot we can do! Given enough money, we'll fund the complete publication of one or the other of the books. Anything left over will be put directly into completing the other book as soon as we're able to generate enough funds to make up the difference. </p>
<p>Should we overshoot our goal, any additional funds will be put toward the next project. We have a few things in the hopper--so this additional money will help us get those projects into the light of day that much more quickly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we don't expect any significant roadblocks to realizing this project, we would be foolish to think there could never be any. 7Vientos has a successful track record in this space. Since 2010 we've published four books, three hardcovers in translation and one as a Spanish-only paperback. We've made our mistakes, learned our lessons, and now we know the ropes pretty well. There could always be crashed hard drives, delays in production, boxes lost in shipping, or printing errors. The good news is the texts are 95% complete and saved in multiple locations - with backups!</p>
<p>The second edition of <i>Saturnalia</i> has already been translated, edited, and laid out. Aside from finalizing the cover design, it's ready to print.</p>
<p><i>Caracas Muerde</i> is 80% finished. All that's left is a final review of the text in both English and Spanish, the interior layout, and the cover design. That might sound like a lot, but we're experts at this. Both books will be 100% ready to ship to the printer before the end of the year. </p>
<p>*<i>Héctor's travel to the US is dependent upon securing his visa for travel. The book launch, tour, and speaking engagements we're planning should qualify him for a business-related visa, but these are uncertain times. We will do everything in our power to secure the necessary documents. </i></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help with funding, you can still help spread the word! Post links to this campaign on your Facegram and Instabook! Twit about it with hash browns or whatever! This site has some great share tools, so check them out and scream it from the mountaintops, or if you don't live by any mountains, head up to the top floor of a tall building and tell the world about this awesome project!</p>

7Vientos (7V) is a small, independent publishing company based in Chicago, IL and Mexico City, Mexico. After a hiatus (caused by new careers, editions to families, and shifting responsibilities) 7V is back with two new books! But! Danny and Kolin need your help getting them from our hard drives into your hands. 
The Project - Continuing the Vision7V first published Rey Andújar's Saturnario / Saturnalia in its signature hardcover flip style in 2012. Since then we've sold out (!!) but we still have people looking for copies of the book, so we're bringing it back! This time as an English-only paperback featuring a brand new, completely redone translation. Even if you already have the first edition, you're going to want this new version. The new, improved translation lends new understanding and interpretations of Rey's fantastic stories. If you weren't lucky enough to get your hands on the first edition, then this second edition is perfect for you, too. You can't lose!
Héctor Torres is a Venezuelan writer who has been chronicling the ups and downs of everyday life in Caracas for the last two decades. His book Caracas Muerde: Crónicas de una guerra no declarada was originally published in Venezuela in 2012. Since then the situation in Caracas and in the rest of the country has worsened to an almost unimaginable degree. Torres' stories of hope and heartbreak, pain and fear, death and redemption are even more poignant now than ever before. 7V will bring this edition to life as a hardcover flip version in the original Spanish with English translation under the title Caracas Muerde: Chronicles of a Relentless City. 
Your support will help us make these two new books a reality and continue our goal of bringing the works of underrepresented Latin authors to a wider, English-speaking audience. 

What We Need & What You Get
Publishing isn't an inexpensive proposition and to realize this project, we need $25,500. This money will cover the cost of the author's rights, translation, interior and cover design, proofreading and editing, printing, and marketing of both books. It will also allow us to fly Héctor Torres from Caracas to Chicago for the book release party and book tour!*
By helping us fund this project, you'll receive exclusive perks you won't find anywhere else. There will be stickers; limited edition prints of the book cover art; tickets to a dinner in Chicago with Héctor Torres*, Rey Andújar, and the 7Vientos team; and even a special stretch goal.
While we don't want to think about the possibility of not reaching our goal, should we fall short, there's still a lot we can do! Given enough money, we'll fund the complete publication of one or the other of the books. Anything left over will be put directly into completing the other book as soon as we're able to generate enough funds to make up the difference. 
Should we overshoot our goal, any additional funds will be put toward the next project. We have a few things in the hopper--so this additional money will help us get those projects into the light of day that much more quickly. 

Risks & Challenges
While we don't expect any significant roadblocks to realizing this project, we would be foolish to think there could never be any. 7Vientos has a successful track record in this space. Since 2010 we've published four books, three hardcovers in translation and one as a Spanish-only paperback. We've made our mistakes, learned our lessons, and now we know the ropes pretty well. There could always be crashed hard drives, delays in production, boxes lost in shipping, or printing errors. The good news is the texts are 95% complete and saved in multiple locations - with backups!
The second edition of Saturnalia has already been translated, edited, and laid out. Aside from finalizing the cover design, it's ready to print.
Caracas Muerde is 80% finished. All that's left is a final review of the text in both English and Spanish, the interior layout, and the cover design. That might sound like a lot, but we're experts at this. Both books will be 100% ready to ship to the printer before the end of the year. 
*Héctor's travel to the US is dependent upon securing his visa for travel. The book launch, tour, and speaking engagements we're planning should qualify him for a business-related visa, but these are uncertain times. We will do everything in our power to secure the necessary documents. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help with funding, you can still help spread the word! Post links to this campaign on your Facegram and Instabook! Twit about it with hash browns or whatever! This site has some great share tools, so check them out and scream it from the mountaintops, or if you don't live by any mountains, head up to the top floor of a tall building and tell the world about this awesome project!

</h3> <p>As a father and a kid at heart, I have always enjoyed books for children, they are informative and super creative, with influence from my first born, and childrens movies, I came up with this character and have a few great artistic people to help me bring this character to page:<br/></p> <ul> <li>I am Josh Mihal, Father, film maker, writer, kid at heart and artist.</li> <li>This Campaign is to add yet another great story to the plethora of kids books out there, with a fun character to allow kids to become more familiar with what they do in certain situations, like waking up and getting ready for the day, which is a glimpse into the first part of the first book .</li> <li>With so many people that have children and those who just enjoy reading the creative children's books themselves, I feel that this should reach its goal in no time, once those who are interested feel they can relate to what the main character is doing.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Your Contributions and Perks<br/>
</h3> <p>To be totally transparent so all cards are on the table, we will list the funds needed and where they are going, as well as of course the fun perks that you will receive for contributing:</p> <ul> <li>So for the not so fun part, the listing of the funds, We have totaled everything to just under $1,000.00, Yes expensive but worth it.</li>
<li>First I'm paying the illustrator that creates such great work, total for the finished pages of full color is $210.00 which is 11 more great illustrations and 3 illustrations as perks for the campaign.<br/>
</li>
<li>Self Publishing through <a href=""http://www.blurb.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.blurb.com,</a><a href=""http://www.blurb.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>total for that is $359.80 and that makes 20 books at $17.99 a book, that includes 12 full color pages and two black and white pages and the front and back color covers, size will be standard portrait (7.75 x 9.75), Softcover (Its $10 more for hard cover and though I'd prefer hard cover, I want to eventually sell these at a reasonable price, it's not that I care to make  profit, I just don't have the funds to buy nearly $30 books, all willy nilly like). The pages will be standard 80# semi-matte, The price also includes the websites logo on the back of the book, this could easily help gather more customers for a great self-publishing company. I want to turn it into a digital book as well, but that will just be free because I can do it by hand, well by computer, using Adobe Pdf creator, also converting the file into .cbr file format, so that it can be read on other ebook/comic book readers. I also want to start a website for the main character, to have other media outlets, (maybe a cartoon, but that's just a dream), I know i would like to do printable activity sheets for kids and an interactive online story, but all that is after the book is finished. $60 for 5 medium sized posters for promotional work. $80.00 for a table at Sac-anime Convention, where I will also be selling printed sketches of the main character (with permission from the illustrator of course). $70.00 for 20 bumper stickers from vistprint.com (to help with further promotion of the book). $20.00 for 100 postcards of the Main image of little Tyke, printing from visitprint.com. The remaining funds will be used for gas for getting back and forth when printing out more post cards (if needed) and other promotional use.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>All right, so now comes the fun stuff, PERKS!</li>
<li>What to give, what to give? <br/>
</li>
<li>We have of course copies of the finished book, Crocheted Tykes, bumper stickers with the title image on it, postcards with images (only available via this campaign, choice between three) of little tyke not included in the book, digital copies of the finished book, two signed copies of the the finished book (may only include my signature as the writer, unless i can get it to the illustrator as well, which i will try, but who is located in the UK, so this book is being created between continents, how neat), of course lots of thank yous and once the campaigns, no matter what the out come is I will be adding a video to thank everyone for their contributions and have details of the what's to come.<br/>
</li> <li>If the goal is not reached, which I don't see not happening with all those gorgeous people awaiting to contribute, than the funds that were gathered will be used to just create as many copies of the books as I can afford and promoting as much as I can, to gather more of a following and more potential buyers.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Tyke Impact</h3> <p>When thinking up Tyke and his zany (soon to come) adventures, I had in mind myself as a child and my son, who is now 2 years old, what can Tyke do to help children learn? Then it came to me, just daily things you would normally do, get dressed, brush your teeth, eat a healthy meal, get a good night sleep, so by adding in the Tyke as the child like fun factor and the knowledge of daily duties, Little Tyke was born:</p> <ul> <li>As contributors, you are making a huge impact, not only on the creation of something great, but on the world, I feel the children (and some adults) of the world could benefit from the creation of this book.</li> <li>My only successful project, that is even close to the same vein as a children's book, is the comic book I did, which is nothing like ""Little Tyke"", it's more adult in nature, as in scariness. I also write weekly, mainly short film scripts and wanting to make a longer book, many chapters, but that's just not in my currently. Writing Little Tyke is a great experience and will lead into even greater projects, some of which you as contributors will see, here on Indiegogo.<br/>
</li> <li>Why can't I just fork over the cash to get this book done already? Good question, because like most of the world, I lack the funds, so I'm relying on beautiful people such as yourself to lend me a hand, no one got where they are with out some kind of help, that's all I'm asking for is, a little help.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges (or fun &amp; fun)<br/>
</h3> <p> Okay as much as I'd like to call all risks &amp; challenges just fun &amp; fun, we all know there is so much involved in the creation of anything, so there is risk, I'm putting my name out there, to catch a dream and the Challenges will be not making the first book into a novel, since there is so much Tyke can do and say, sure he's a mouse so he's tiny, but he has a big heart and is full of adventure. Some real challenges will be doing all the promoting and keeping on track.<br/></p> <ul> <li>You might wonder, wait, I've been with you a long for the ride so far, I'm getting out my credit card to contribute, then I read ""keeping on track"" and now I'm leery about contributing. I don't blame you but keep reading.<br/>
</li> <li>So, I, such as many people did not grow up with a normal childhood, sure it was all starlight and mud-pies, up until My father passed when i was 12 so you think that's a lot for 12 year old to take right, but there's more, 2 years pass and i lose my older brother, Wow, how did you cope? I didn't I mainly shut down inside, yet was always putting up a brave front, feeling the need to be the rock of the family, and to this day, i still do so, I also found out I suffered for going on 22 years now from PTSD, but wait Josh I don't remember you saying anything about being in the military, well I was but that's not what the PTSD is from, it's from never dealing with the trauma of my father and brothers passing, Then the hurdle of school and becoming a working stiff, many mood changes and an even more sad portion of my life, I'm still here. Life finds a way. So no matter what hurdles life throws at you, if you can't jump them (i'm no athlete), just slowly climb over or under, either way pass them as best as you can. Ask for help if you need it, but you're not finished yet. Just keep that in mind. So as with all the challenges I've faced in my day to day life, I've over come those and I can overcome the challenges presented before me in this campaign.<br/>

 As a father and a kid at heart, I have always enjoyed books for children, they are informative and super creative, with influence from my first born, and childrens movies, I came up with this character and have a few great artistic people to help me bring this character to page:  I am Josh Mihal, Father, film maker, writer, kid at heart and artist.

<h4>Why Am I Doing This?</h4>
<p>I'm doing this because I love teaching and I really love teaching people something they are actually interested in learning! While teaching my classes at Udemy I have heard from many students who tell me how the class has changed their lives and how happy they are to finally realize their dream of making and selling their own video games. That is a very pretty crazy and exciting thing to hear the first time a message like that crosses your inbox! My hope is that this book will help others live out their dreams as well!</p>

<h4>What is Gamesalad?</h4>
<a href=""http://gamesalad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gamesalad Creator</a> is a modern 2D game development kit (GDK). Over 750,000 developers in 189 countries around the world use it and it has been used to make 70 of the top 100 games in the U.S. Apple App Store.<p></p>
<p>One of the highlights of Gamesalad is that you <b>DO NOT</b> need to learn how to write traditional computer programming code to make your games. Gamesalad offers a simple, yet full featured, drag and drop interface that lets you build commercial quality games much quicker than learning traditional programming. Once you are familiar with Gamesalad you will be able to prototype a game in a few days and complete the entire project in as little as a few weeks instead of the typical months or years in could take to develop a game with another GDK.</p>

</ul>
<p>If the goal of my campaign is reached I should be able to cover all of those areas. Of course if the full amount is not met I will still use what money is raised to cover as much of the above as possible.</p>
<p>In these days of fast and easy self publishing there are a lot of books released that are 'less than professional' and I don't want my book falling into that stack. It's not fair to you to ask you to read a book that is poorly designed and full of typos and bad clip art. I can be a perfectionist and will make sure this book as good as it can possibly be.</p>

<ol>
<li>Apex Legends is a small independent publisher - this crowdfunding campaign will allow me to <b>raise capital needed to fund the first printing</b> of the book and generate the funds necessary to do a <b>proper book launch</b> designed to spread the IndyCar message beyond core fans</li>
<li>Gives <b>you</b> the opportunity to purchase unique, pre-sale perk packages with <b>exclusive items</b> such as books signed by Josef Newgarden</li>

</div><div>
<h3>Why A Crowdfunding Campaign?</h3>
<p>Related to the points above, the objective is to raise funds to support a strong book launch for <i>Josef, The IndyCar Driver</i>.  Apex Legends is an independent publisher working to get non-conventional content about the world of motorsports in the hands of not only passionate race fans, but also a new audience for the sport.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Funding will be used for two purposes - printing the initial run of books and more importantly, advertising &amp; promotions.</span></p>
<ul><li>I have set the goal at <b>$10,000</b> - based on prior experience this is the amount required for the first round of printing and a basic digital ad campaign </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>We can do so much more! </b> This story has the chance to make a much bigger impact.  Josef and I both believe so strongly in its potential that we want to be sure we can make an impact with an audience beyond the core IndyCar fan! </li></ul>
<ul><li>If the initial goal isn't achieved the majority of funds will go towards printing a limited run of books and fulfilling perks.  Any remainder will go towards advertising</li></ul>

<p>Ever since I can remember I have always loved telling stories and 
illustrating characters. As a kid I loved exploring the colorful action 
filled pictures of comic books and reading science fiction and fantasy 
books, which led me to pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Animation and 
working on graphic novels and film editing. It was only when my wife and
 I had two children of our own that I saw the importance of using my 
talents to teach children the moral values and life lessons that I had 
been taught to me by my mother and father as a child. God has always 
given me a desire to use my art for storytelling. It has always been a 
dream of mine to produce art forms that have strong entertainment and 
moral values. Though I have worked on many projects, this is my first 
fully finished book. Thanks to my wife for all her support, to my family
 for standing behind me, and too you the reader for supporting my dream!<br/></p> <p></p>King Grumpylib and the Grumpy town of Fairness is a humorous family 
friendly children's book that teaches kids life long lessons about 
fairness, working hard and contentment. Adults will laugh and children

<br/></span><span><br/></span>En bok om kärlek</h3><p>Jag grundade <i>Good News Magazine </i>för att sprida konstruktivt engagemang och medveten optimism. För att visa på att vi människor är födda goda och att vi alla har den lågan inom oss. Men den behöver näring, den behöver syre och vi alla behöver bli påminda om den. Om vår godhet. <br/><br/>Under åren jag arbetat med magasinet har jag märkt att det inte räcker med magasinet och att i det lyfta fram de goda exemplen. Av alla hundratals samtal jag haft efter mina föreläsningar, av alla tusentals mail, brev och meddelanden jag har fått, växte en övertygelse sig starkare inom mig. För när jag har betraktat samhällen, våra liv, medmänniskor jag mött, vardagshjältar vi skrivit om, mina men även andras barn, hur världen ser ut, hur vi har det, naturen och så mycket mer så har jag mer och mer insett att vad vi skriver för lite om, vad vi pratar för lite om, är något jag vid några få gånger, i mina texter, nuddat vid men aldrig fördjupat mig i. <br/><span><br/></span>De flesta, i Sverige är det nog över en halv miljon personer, som via mina texter, radio, tv och tidningar fått ta del av min bakgrund känner delvis till hur jag gjorde för att överleva fysisk och psykisk misshandel. Hur jag gjorde för att stå emot all ondska jag som barn utsattes för. Vad jag alltid sagt höll mig, min själ och min kärna vid liv var framför allt två  drömmar. Drömmar som blev min trygghet under en period där allt annat kändes som ett helvete. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Men ovanstående är bara en del av sanningen. Den andra delen, den som få, kanske ingen, känner till, är att det framför allt var tron på kärleken, som höll mig vid liv. Med det menar jag; det som höll min låga tänd, som höll min själ intakt. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433796338/dpisljeg82hljzhvshy5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Plats: Babels bibliotek i Palma, Mallorca. Jag tillbringade över 100 timmar på den platsen och det mesta av boken skrevs där. Babel blev lite av mitt andra hem.)<br/><br/>Jag skapade Good News Magazine för att hjälpa andra att lyckas med samma sak. Och jag har nu skrivit boken <i>Den Enda. </i> Där jag skriver om det som livet egentligen för mig handlar om; kärlek. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433795614/gdsrdwhg0kl4nx4empcu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Grunden till omslaget. Illustratör: Yanella Ekman)<br/><br/>Boken är först och främst en kärlekshistoria om Elma och Nathaniel.  Två vackra själar med både sår och ärr. I dem finner vi lågan vi alla har. Den jag så mycket försökt, genom magasinet och med mina föreläsningar, att påminna oss om. De är lika starka som sköra. Lika hela som trasiga. Boken är en resa två människor gör för att en dag komma hem. Ett hem de delvis först måste finna inom sig själva, ett hem de senare enbart kan bygga tillsammans, och där grunden är kärlek, respekt och omtanke. För varandra, till varandra och för livet. <br/><br/>Vem är då Elma? Elma är kvinnan som räddade min själ. Elma kanske är du. Elma och Nathaniel kanske är en helhet av alla pusselbitar jag samlat i varje möte, med varje medmänniska, som genom åren korsat min stig. Är jag Nathaniel? Kanske. Men spelar det någon roll? Kanske är allt fiktion. <br/><br/>Jag är övertygad om att du kommer att känna igen dig. Att något inom dig kommer att le, något inom dig kommer att skratta och något inom dig kommer att gråta. Min förhoppning är att få dig att se det vackra i dig. Men även det vackra i vår värld. Det vackra du kan dela med någon annan. Min förhoppning är också att hjälpa dig att öppna ditt hjärta. Och kanske någonstans på vägen, genom Elmas och Nathaniels kärlek, vill jag hjälpa dig att läka din själ. <br/><span><br/></span>Precis som med <i>Good News Magazine</i> vill jag att <i>Den Enda</i> sprids. Därför vänder jag mig nu till dig med denna vädjan: Om du tror på det jag gör, om du tror att mina texter kan hjälpa någon, om du tror att en bok om kärlek skriven av någon som idogt försökt motbevisa en hel bransch genom att sprida optimism och framtidstro kan vara samhället till nytta, någon som vänt totalt mörker till något positivt, om du anser att kärlek är något vi aldrig kan skriva, prata eller få för mycket av, om du vill hjälpa mig att bidra till en bättre och vackrare värld... köp <i>Den Enda</i>.

<span><span><span><br/></span><p>""Vem av oss vet egentligen vem vi låter som, vem av oss vet om vem vi till och med liknar. Många av oss har ibland till och med svårt att se likheterna mellan oss själva och våra föräldrar. Skulle vi känna igen våra egna ord från någon annans mun? Skulle vi i stunden känna igen banden mellan oss och en främling som precis dykt upp i våra liv? Jag inbillar mig att det finns de som kan. Kanske den som lever med alla sinnen öppna, lever i nuet, kan det.Kan jag? tänkte Nathaniel för sig själv. </p>
<p>'Nathaniel, hur är det?', frågar Jenny vänligt. Han är tyst. Sitter i det ögonblicket och tittar ut. Blicken är långt borta. Han betraktar träden. Och känner nästan som om de betraktar honom, som om det fanns ett budskap han behöver förstå, ta till sig. Som om något stort håller på att hända i hans liv. 'Ditt liv vänder nu' hör han sin egen röst säga inne i huvudet. <br/><br/>'Jorden anropar Nathaniel', säger Yasmine högt. Han hör, vänder sig om och ler. Men i stället för att fråga vad det är frågade han om någon ville ha mer kaffe.</p>
<p>******<br/>Elma är trött. Nästan som om hon tömt sig helt på energi. Hon tror att det kan vara den långa körningen som satt sina spår. Vin har hon inte druckit mycket av. Hon ursäktar sig därför och går och sätter sig på altanen. Alla förstår att hon behöver det och låter henne vara för sig själv. Solnedgången lyser genom trädens kronor. Det är en magisk kväll för att sitta där och njuta av den. Hon sätter sig på trappan, men upptäcker snabbt att det är lite kyligare än hon hade föreställt sig. En blus och en tunn kofta över den är allt hon har på överkroppen. Hon fryser men vill ändå sitta där en stund. I sin ensamhet. </p>
<p>Genom de stora fönsterpartierna har alla som befinner sig inne i huset en fantastisk vy över tomten och sjön, så då även över altanen. Nathaniel står lutad mot köpmansdisken som fungerar som köksö. Nästan som en staty står han där orörlig och med en blick som hans vänner skulle ge vad som helst för att kunna tolka. Medan han dricker sitt kaffe betraktar han kvinnan som sitter ensam på hans altan. En främling skulle de flesta anse. Vad hon för många skulle vara i hans värld. Ett kort möte men inget mer. I en värld där ett cv för många tycks säga mer om en person än vad ögonen gör. Men för Nathaniel är det ögonen som avslöjar vem du egentligen är.</p>
<p>Kanske är det så att för många kan det ibland vara svårt att förstå hur en människa kan träffa någon för en kort stund, några få timmar och se en mening i det mötet. Hur några timmar i en främlings sällskap kan förvandlas till saknad, till längtan och i viss mån till kärlek. Att hon sedan kan gå i veckor, månader, kanske till och med år, och ha ett så starkt minne av mötet att hon skulle göra vad som helst för att få uppleva det igen. När man lyssnar på din egen inre röst, när man betraktar bilder i ens minne, har man själv en främling som berört en så? Även om man valde annan väg att gå. Men om man erkänner det för sig själv, lyser lågan än?<br/><br/>Kanske behöver man leva i nuet. För om man inte lever i nuet kan det vara svårt att förstå hur ett möte med en främling kan ha någon känslomässig betydelse. Den som inte är en sökare och inte heller tror på kärleken, kommer ha än svårt att förstå. Om hon följer en kalender där dagarna är fyllda med måsten, med förväntningar, med krav, med anpassning, med begränsningar, kan det vara svårt, nästintill omöjligt, att förstå. Därför att hon inte är där, i stunden. Hon är konstant på väg någonstans. Livet är för henne en rak sträcka med bestämda hållplatser där hon går på och av. Hon befinner sig i en känslomässig dimma där alla ser in, men ingen ser ut. Hon är kanske lyckligt ovetandes om att hon befinner sig där. Hon kanske till och med är nöjd med att ha det så. 'Varför komplicera saker?' frågar hon sig. 'Livet är förpliktelser' säger några andra.</p>
<p>Det är när hon befinner sig där, i dimman som begränsar henne att leva exakt som hon vill, så som hon önskar, som många verkar ha kloka råd att komma med om hur hon tar sig ur. Råd på hur hon slår sig fri. Men kloka råd i sådana situationer är som kattguld för en farao. <br/><br/>Nathaniel tänker på hur mycket svårare det är att förstå hur två människor kan leva år under samma tak och inte känna varandra på djupet. Han tror att de flesta hellre skulle tillbringa några få timmar med någon som verkar förstå, som ser en för att denna vill se och inte först och främst är ute efter att bli sedd. Som ser en därför att hen kanske själv har samma erfarenheter, samma längtan, som kanske själv känner samma tomhet. Än att leva ett liv med någon som aldrig har förstått en. Han tror att många skulle vilja möta den som från början vet om hur hen skulle älska en, utan att man behöver lära ut det. Han anser att många hellre skulle vilja möta den personen en kort stund, ett möte, än att gå år i tystnad och hoppas på att den man lever med, ska lära sig.</p>
<p>Så kanske är detta möte betydelsefullt, kanske är kramen mer än bara två armar som håller om mig. Och kanske bör jag lära mig att leva mer i nuet, säger han tyst till sig själv där han står. <br/><br/>Det är stor skillnad på att vara vid liv och att leva. Att leva kräver fler aktiva val. Det kräver mer mod och kanske lite vacker galenskap. Medan Nathaniel betraktade Elma växer känslan inom honom. Den om att han vill leva, att det får räcka med att bara hålla sig vid liv. Han förstår att han under ett helt liv hållit sig just vid liv. Men att han aldrig riktigt levt. Något inom honom säger att mängden tid inte varit avgörande. Och att kärlek inte är något man kan planera in i en kalender. Den kommer när den kommer. Och när den kommer har man följande alternativ att välja mellan: Att vara i stunden och bejaka kärleken med allt vad den innebär, eller att lära sig att leva med frågan: 'Tänk om?'.<br/><br/>Jenny förstår och ser vad som håller på att hända. Hon har både under middagen och under Elmas långa monolog, betraktat honom. Hon är berörd av magin i stunden. Magin som enligt henne bara själsfränder kan skapa för andra att njuta av. Och hon har verkligen njutit. Alla runt bordet har det.</p>
<p>Elma sitter och funderar på om gjort bort sig. Hon minns inte allt hon sagt. Men har hon förolämpat Nathaniel i hans eget hem? Har hon betett sig dumt mot Nelson? Borde hon gå in och be om ursäkt? Hon skäms, och det rejält. Men samtidigt tänker hon att det inte är fel att tycka till. Hon menade inget illa, intalar hon sig själv. Hon betraktar träden, känner vördnad och förstår att hon behöver låna dem sin röst. I alla möjliga och omöjliga situationer. 'Kanske blir detta första och sista gången jag är här. Att jag aldrig lär mig', beklagar hon sig för sig själv. Minuterna går, solen ska snart försvinna bortom horisonten och ännu en dag är snart till ände. Universum har sin gång, och vi människor är för små för att bestämma dess kurs eller mål. </p>
<p>'Vad tänker han på?', undrar Jenny när hon hastigt kastar en blick mot sin vän som fortfarande står och betraktar Elma. Jenny är på väg att be honom komma och sätta sig bredvid henne för att de ska få några minuter tillsammans. Men precis när hon ska till att ropa vänder han sig om och går iväg. Efter en kort stund kommer han ut från ett av sovrummen med en filt i handen. Han häller ut kaffet han knappt hunnit röra och fyller på nytt. Sedan går han ut.<br/><br/>Elma sitter och fryser men vill ändå inte gå in. Trots den kalla kvällen njuter hon av att sitta där ensam med tomten och solnedgången framför sig. Ensam på en altan till ett hem som tillhör mannen hon så länge tänkt på. Så länge drömt och fantiserat om. Ljudet av altandörren som öppnas tar en hundradels sekund av hennes uppmärksamhet, men hon bryr sig inte om att vända sig om för att se vem det är. Några få sekunder senare, utan att hon ens hört stegen, lägger någon en filt över hennes axlar. Van att Jenny finns där för henne utgår hon ifrån att det är hon. Filten är varm och doftar gott och därför drar hon den till ansiktet för att känna dess doft bättre. En doft hon känner igen, men hon kan inte exakt placera när eller vart hon känt den. Hon drar den runt sig och värmen kommer snabbt tillbaks. </p>
<p>Ett enkelt tack är allt hon säger, fortfarande utan att se sig om. När en hand sträcks fram och erbjuder henne en kopp kaffe blir hon varse att hon misstagit sig. Hon tittar upp och ser att det är Nathaniel som sitter där på huk bredvid henne. Elma tar koppen med sina båda händer, vilket leder till att filten ramlar av hennes axlar. Nathaniel tar upp den och lägger den på nytt runt hennes axlar. En rörelse han gör långsamt och Elma kan nästan svära på att han tar lite extra tid på sig, att han tar ett djupt andetag när han är som närmast henne, bara några få centimeter från hennes hår. </p>
<p>Deras blickar, som är så talande, möts. Så mycket de vill säga till varandra, så mycket de behöver få säga till varandra, men vad ska de med ord till när deras själar säger allt. Hon sitter på första trappsteget av en bredd altantrappa där minst fem eller sex personer kunde sitta bredvid varandra. Hennes kropp är vänd mot sjön. Nathaniel sitter på huk vänd mot henne. Han ger henne ett varmt, delvis bekräftande, leende. Som för att säga 'Tack för dina ord'. Hon ser det, förstår det, blir glad och bekräftar med samma känsla i sitt leende och med en lätt rodnad på kinderna som säger honom att hon är något generad. Han reser sig upp och går sedan tillbaks in. Hon sitter kvar, nu lite varmare i kropp och själ. Leendet han gett henne vill inte överge henne, hon är glad över att han verkar stolt över att hon finns där. </p>
<p>Varken Elma eller Nathaniel lägger märke till att Jenny står vid ett av de stora fönstren och betraktar dem. Varken de eller någon annan ser tårarna i hennes ögon. För vad Jenny ser och upplever har berört henne djupt. Hon ser en man och en kvinna, hennes två vänner, som är som gjorda för varandra. Två där allt runtomkring dem verkar omfamna dem. Hon ser, hon ler och lovar sig själv att alltid finnas där för dem. Omedveten om vilken resa de har framför sig, omedveten om hur hon ska komma att påverka den.""</p>

<br/><br/><br/></span></div><p><br/></p><br/><p></p></div>","En bok om kärlekJag grundade Good News Magazine för att sprida konstruktivt engagemang och medveten optimism. För att visa på att vi människor är födda goda och att vi alla har den lågan inom oss. Men den behöver näring, den behöver syre och vi alla behöver bli påminda om den. Om vår godhet. Under åren jag arbetat med magasinet har jag märkt att det inte räcker med magasinet och att i det lyfta fram de goda exemplen. Av alla hundratals samtal jag haft efter mina föreläsningar, av alla tusentals mail, brev och meddelanden jag har fått, växte en övertygelse sig starkare inom mig. För när jag har betraktat samhällen, våra liv, medmänniskor jag mött, vardagshjältar vi skrivit om, mina men även andras barn, hur världen ser ut, hur vi har det, naturen och så mycket mer så har jag mer och mer insett att vad vi skriver för lite om, vad vi pratar för lite om, är något jag vid några få gånger, i mina texter, nuddat vid men aldrig fördjupat mig i. De flesta, i Sverige är det nog över en halv miljon personer, som via mina texter, radio, tv och tidningar fått ta del av min bakgrund känner delvis till hur jag gjorde för att överleva fysisk och psykisk misshandel. Hur jag gjorde för att stå emot all ondska jag som barn utsattes för. Vad jag alltid sagt höll mig, min själ och min kärna vid liv var framför allt två  drömmar. Drömmar som blev min trygghet under en period där allt annat kändes som ett helvete. Men ovanstående är bara en del av sanningen. Den andra delen, den som få, kanske ingen, känner till, är att det framför allt var tron på kärleken, som höll mig vid liv. Med det menar jag; det som höll min låga tänd, som höll min själ intakt. (Plats: Babels bibliotek i Palma, Mallorca. Jag tillbringade över 100 timmar på den platsen och det mesta av boken skrevs där. Babel blev lite av mitt andra hem.)Jag skapade Good News Magazine för att hjälpa andra att lyckas med samma sak. Och jag har nu skrivit boken Den Enda.  Där jag skriver om det som livet egentligen för mig handlar om; kärlek. (Grunden till omslaget. Illustratör: Yanella Ekman)Boken är först och främst en kärlekshistoria om Elma och Nathaniel.  Två vackra själar med både sår och ärr. I dem finner vi lågan vi alla har. Den jag så mycket försökt, genom magasinet och med mina föreläsningar, att påminna oss om. De är lika starka som sköra. Lika hela som trasiga. Boken är en resa två människor gör för att en dag komma hem. Ett hem de delvis först måste finna inom sig själva, ett hem de senare enbart kan bygga tillsammans, och där grunden är kärlek, respekt och omtanke. För varandra, till varandra och för livet. Vem är då Elma? Elma är kvinnan som räddade min själ. Elma kanske är du. Elma och Nathaniel kanske är en helhet av alla pusselbitar jag samlat i varje möte, med varje medmänniska, som genom åren korsat min stig. Är jag Nathaniel? Kanske. Men spelar det någon roll? Kanske är allt fiktion. Jag är övertygad om att du kommer att känna igen dig. Att något inom dig kommer att le, något inom dig kommer att skratta och något inom dig kommer att gråta. Min förhoppning är att få dig att se det vackra i dig. Men även det vackra i vår värld. Det vackra du kan dela med någon annan. Min förhoppning är också att hjälpa dig att öppna ditt hjärta. Och kanske någonstans på vägen, genom Elmas och Nathaniels kärlek, vill jag hjälpa dig att läka din själ. Precis som med Good News Magazine vill jag att Den Enda sprids. Därför vänder jag mig nu till dig med denna vädjan: Om du tror på det jag gör, om du tror att mina texter kan hjälpa någon, om du tror att en bok om kärlek skriven av någon som idogt försökt motbevisa en hel bransch genom att sprida optimism och framtidstro kan vara samhället till nytta, någon som vänt totalt mörker till något positivt, om du anser att kärlek är något vi aldrig kan skriva, prata eller få för mycket av, om du vill hjälpa mig att bidra till en bättre och vackrare värld... köp Den Enda. Köp den till dig och/eller till någon du värnar om.

Kort utdrag ur boken:

""Vem av oss vet egentligen vem vi låter som, vem av oss vet om vem vi till och med liknar. Många av oss har ibland till och med svårt att se likheterna mellan oss själva och våra föräldrar. Skulle vi känna igen våra egna ord från någon annans mun? Skulle vi i stunden känna igen banden mellan oss och en främling som precis dykt upp i våra liv? Jag inbillar mig att det finns de som kan. Kanske den som lever med alla sinnen öppna, lever i nuet, kan det.Kan jag? tänkte Nathaniel för sig själv. 
'Nathaniel, hur är det?', frågar Jenny vänligt. Han är tyst. Sitter i det ögonblicket och tittar ut. Blicken är långt borta. Han betraktar träden. Och känner nästan som om de betraktar honom, som om det fanns ett budskap han behöver förstå, ta till sig. Som om något stort håller på att hända i hans liv. 'Ditt liv vänder nu' hör han sin egen röst säga inne i huvudet. 'Jorden anropar Nathaniel', säger Yasmine högt. Han hör, vänder sig om och ler. Men i stället för att fråga vad det är frågade han om någon ville ha mer kaffe.
******Elma är trött. Nästan som om hon tömt sig helt på energi. Hon tror att det kan vara den långa körningen som satt sina spår. Vin har hon inte druckit mycket av. Hon ursäktar sig därför och går och sätter sig på altanen. Alla förstår att hon behöver det och låter henne vara för sig själv. Solnedgången lyser genom trädens kronor. Det är en magisk kväll för att sitta där och njuta av den. Hon sätter sig på trappan, men upptäcker snabbt att det är lite kyligare än hon hade föreställt sig. En blus och en tunn kofta över den är allt hon har på överkroppen. Hon fryser men vill ändå sitta där en stund. I sin ensamhet. 
Genom de stora fönsterpartierna har alla som befinner sig inne i huset en fantastisk vy över tomten och sjön, så då även över altanen. Nathaniel står lutad mot köpmansdisken som fungerar som köksö. Nästan som en staty står han där orörlig och med en blick som hans vänner skulle ge vad som helst för att kunna tolka. Medan han dricker sitt kaffe betraktar han kvinnan som sitter ensam på hans altan. En främling skulle de flesta anse. Vad hon för många skulle vara i hans värld. Ett kort möte men inget mer. I en värld där ett cv för många tycks säga mer om en person än vad ögonen gör. Men för Nathaniel är det ögonen som avslöjar vem du egentligen är.
Kanske är det så att för många kan det ibland vara svårt att förstå hur en människa kan träffa någon för en kort stund, några få timmar och se en mening i det mötet. Hur några timmar i en främlings sällskap kan förvandlas till saknad, till längtan och i viss mån till kärlek. Att hon sedan kan gå i veckor, månader, kanske till och med år, och ha ett så starkt minne av mötet att hon skulle göra vad som helst för att få uppleva det igen. När man lyssnar på din egen inre röst, när man betraktar bilder i ens minne, har man själv en främling som berört en så? Även om man valde annan väg att gå. Men om man erkänner det för sig själv, lyser lågan än?Kanske behöver man leva i nuet. För om man inte lever i nuet kan det vara svårt att förstå hur ett möte med en främling kan ha någon känslomässig betydelse. Den som inte är en sökare och inte heller tror på kärleken, kommer ha än svårt att förstå. Om hon följer en kalender där dagarna är fyllda med måsten, med förväntningar, med krav, med anpassning, med begränsningar, kan det vara svårt, nästintill omöjligt, att förstå. Därför att hon inte är där, i stunden. Hon är konstant på väg någonstans. Livet är för henne en rak sträcka med bestämda hållplatser där hon går på och av. Hon befinner sig i en känslomässig dimma där alla ser in, men ingen ser ut. Hon är kanske lyckligt ovetandes om att hon befinner sig där. Hon kanske till och med är nöjd med att ha det så. 'Varför komplicera saker?' frågar hon sig. 'Livet är förpliktelser' säger några andra.
Det är när hon befinner sig där, i dimman som begränsar henne att leva exakt som hon vill, så som hon önskar, som många verkar ha kloka råd att komma med om hur hon tar sig ur. Råd på hur hon slår sig fri. Men kloka råd i sådana situationer är som kattguld för en farao. Nathaniel tänker på hur mycket svårare det är att förstå hur två människor kan leva år under samma tak och inte känna varandra på djupet. Han tror att de flesta hellre skulle tillbringa några få timmar med någon som verkar förstå, som ser en för att denna vill se och inte först och främst är ute efter att bli sedd.

<p>Official Synopsis: </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><i>Lyme Light is a dark comedic off-beat memoir about a girl who was an extraordinary musician but terrible at flirting. Lyme Light is the story of a girl who spent her life fighting against her startling past and loneliness by immersing herself in the fictional world of reruns of Roseanne and Beverly Hills 90210. Lyme Light is the story about a girl who had 13 credits left to graduate on the Dean's list from Columbia University, was playing indie rock shows in New York City and meeting with some of the top record labels in the country, when her world was obliterated by the click of a throw away camera and the smallest bite of a tick.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><i>Lyme Light takes you into the world of losing and regaining memories, the ability to walk again, talk again, and adjust to a life of I.V.'s to the heart and endless hours in hyperbaric chambers. It seamlessly combines disease ridden delusions, falling in love, and early 90s television nostalgia all into one heartbreaking story.</i></p>

<p>Greetings from Blue Bones LLC!  We’re a two-family partnership that was
formed to publish the first formal collaboration of two young creatives – a
non-fiction hardcover book called “The Ice-Blue Bones of Telluride: A Dinosaur
Discovery.” </p>
<p>“The Ice-Blue Bones” is the true
story of the first dinosaur fossils found in the upper watershed of the San
Miguel River in southwestern Colorado. Sylvan Bald is the young hiker who
discovered the fossils along a popular canyon trail. Encouraged by a mentor and his teachers, he wrote a children’s
book about his experience, and partnered with his childhood friend, Ting Taylor
– the emerging artist and animator who illustrated the book – to bring it to
press.</p>
</div> <div> <h4>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h4> <p></p>
<p>We’re seeking $7500 in contributions to offset the cost of
the first two printings of the book. (Small print runs of hardcover books are
pricey – but the results are worth it!) All funds contributed up to the request amount will be used to
pay for book design, printing costs, and marketing efforts such as placing advertisements
and contacting bookstores, shops, and other museums. </p>
<p>Any contributions generously offered thereafter will
go into the college funds of the author and artist!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><b>Not to Mention the Perks...</b></h4>
<p>In addition to our grateful appreciation, we’re offering
some goodies, too! Please check out our list of perks to the right, which range
from a “shout out” in the credits of a custom animation by Ting, to a private

Alaska’s Inside Passage - The Vanishing Wilderness</strong>.</p><p>For Ackerman, the book is a personal one. Through frequent visits to Tongass with his wife Rose, Ackerman fell in love with the natural beauty of the region. The landscape and macro photography expert hopes that his images will animate the stunning allure of the Tongass region, while also creating a passion for preserving one of the world’s last intact rainforests.</p><p>“Why is this preservation so important, why am I so passionate, dare I say possessive about this particular wilderness area?” Ackerman asked. “First and foremost, and I wish to be very clear — this region’s prime features are disappearing rapidly due principally to our planets cyclical   warming and cooling that's been happening for eons.

Alaska’s Inside Passage - The Vanishing Wilderness.For Ackerman, the book is a personal one. Through frequent visits to Tongass with his wife Rose, Ackerman fell in love with the natural beauty of the region. The landscape and macro photography expert hopes that his images will animate the stunning allure of the Tongass region, while also creating a passion for preserving one of the world’s last intact rainforests.“Why is this preservation so important, why am I so passionate, dare I say possessive about this particular wilderness area?” Ackerman asked. “First and foremost, and I wish to be very clear — this region’s prime features are disappearing rapidly due principally to our planets cyclical   warming and cooling that's been happening for eons. However, pace of warming has been accelerated by carbon-based greenhouse gases generated by fossil fuels for at least the past few hundred years.”Ackerman notes that the Inside Passage has been further affected by the clear-cutting of millennial trees in the Tongass National Forest (one of earth's last remaining temperate rainforests), contamination of shoreline and streams, melting & receding glaciers and fish and a quickly declining wildlife population.“This kind of climate change can be prevented, slowed — or even stopped,” Ackerman added. “However, that may not happen anytime soon, so I felt compelled to use my God-given talent as a photographer to document and record The Inside Passage and its associated wilderness areas before it disappears.”Through the use of black-and-white photography, Ackerman captured the stark and dramatic moods of the Inside Passage.

Risks & ChallengesOne of the biggest challenges of launching any reading material is the part where people don't like taking a risk on a writer they've never heard of. That's a rough part.The risk this raises is that I print a pallet-full of books and they just sit around.I'm running the risk that I won't raise enough lucre for the print run either.Which is why, as much as possible, I'll be keeping in touch with all you cool cats.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are organizers in the current movement for the Liberation of all Black people with a sense of optimism around the possibilities of political education and story sharing - if we can just get those stories and those ideas out there. </p>
<p>Todd St Hill is a writer and photographer contributing to the Chicago Defender, Jacobin Magazine, and Socialist Worker. Todd is also a Chicago based antiracist organizer participating in a number of local and national grass roots campaigns to increase police accountability in communities of color, to end the criminalization of young people of color, as well as developing political education materials pertaining to the history of the Black Radical Tradition and building and sustaining independent political organization. </p>
<p>Alyxandra Goodwin is a mother, a writer, a researcher, and activist. Her writing and activism are centered around the momentum and challenges of building power for Black people towards self-determination. Her research currently focuses on racialized capitalism, examining how the extractive practices of the finance industry are exacerbating oppressions.  </p>
<p>Left OUT magazine seeks to create more space for a new generation of Black working class and poor leftists, antiracist activists, political thinkers, and intellectuals.  By providing a space for the stories, experiences, and political and cultural analysis of Black working class people to marry with anti-racist, Black Leftist political thought on paper and online literature, we can challenge each other in our communities and challenge the status quo. Black people define culture socially and politically and LEFT OUT will be a tool for us to claim that space. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To fund the publication of our magazine - which is the cost of production, shipping, and most importantly paying our contributing writers, researcher, and photographer - we are raising $20,000. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates will receive the first issue of LEFT OUT and their name in the acknowledgements section of the publication. Want to contribute, but not necessarily interested in receiving a copy of the magazine? Reach out to us about donating your issue or subscription. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For us, the idea of LEFT OUT Magazine follows a long line of Black left publications (like ""The Crisis"", and ""The Crusader""). LEFT OUT  attempts to provide more space for the an array of Black working class and poor people to find one another, debate, and converse in order to advance the struggle for Black Liberation and the liberation of the entire working class and poor from capitalism.  We want the ideas shared through LEFT OUT to influence conversations between Black people and used as a tool to educate each other and contribute to grass roots struggle. We genuinely believe that each generation must advance its political project and pursue different approaches and perspectives. LEFT OUT Magazine is our contribution to the collective political project of fighting for a better world. Your contribution will help build the foundation of this platform.  </p>
<p>Alyxandra has experience in journalism, non-profit communications, blogging, and writing and editing for online publications. Her broader understanding of the relationship between social justice and social media, along with her sharp focus on Black struggle and freedom will push writers to produce strong and accessible commentary and analysis that is relevant to the reader. These pieces have the intent to push, challenge, and affirm the reader - all things that are possible through an engaging editing process. These skills, along with the project management and outreach skills between Todd and Alyxandra, will push this editorial project to publication. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is that we are embarking on an ambitious project. We know that launching a magazine is no small feat and even when we think we've covered all of our bases, there will likely be things along the way in the production process we didn't think of. Thankfully, we're organizers and this wouldn't be the first time we come up against a challenge or a need to make a way. </p>

<h3><strong>M4F ORIGIN STORY</strong></h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Every so often a book comes along that has the power to foster powerful change in the way people think. Packed with heart and wisdom gained from four U.S. Supreme Court and three Arizona Supreme Court appearances, author Morgan Joseph Langan brings forward such a book:</p>
<p> <u>A MANUAL FOR FREEDOM – THE PEACEFUL SOVEREIGN’S PATH</u> (M4F)</p>
<p>M4F was borne of adversity when a bank using fraudulent paperwork, invoked non-judicial foreclosure to evict Morgan and his family from their home --using nine fully-armed sheriff deputies. Additionally, they had invested over $2 million dollars and 7 years of their lives building their home into Grace Grove Retreat Center where they have guided hundreds of individuals through life transforming experiences. None of this mattered to the banks. The law did not require them to answer my questions while local courts accepted the bank's fraudulently recorded documents as proof of title. </p>
<p>As you witness in the video, Morgan is peacefully explaining that the matter was in the Supreme Court. You witness his disbelief that a Yavapai County Sheriff held more power over his land than the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan honestly believed that Article lV of our Constitution meant that he and his family were secure in their home against this unreasonable and unlawful seizure. The Manual outlines how this situation highly motivated him and has now placed him in a unique role to lead by example of what not to do!  However, even Morgan's harsh lessons will shine the light for others seeking sovereignty. The manual outlines a simple step by step ""Sovereignty Process"" so that others may chose their own unique and more graceful path toward this freedom.</p>
<p>Holding to his belief in the Supreme Law of the Land and holding rightful title, his journey was not always easy and required thousands of hours of research on Equity and the Law. Discovering this distinction was the key that not only redeemed the family home, it is the grail to lead America back onto a peaceful path.</p>
<p>Using foundational principles of equity, justice, honesty, and good faith, he shares in M4F how he won his beloved property back using Equity. His book lays out the path to peaceful sovereignty, founded in trust law, equity maxims and the Constitution. You'll learn in the manual how to become self-governing so that together “We The People,” may actively form “a more perfect Union,” just as the Founding Fathers intended in their revolutionary Constitution.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>LEAVING YOUR LEGACY</strong></h3>
<p>Ever wondered how the wealthiest people in America manage to own nothing and control everything at the same time, protecting their assets from seizure in spite of massive corporate losses and frauds associated with their wealth? Morgan's manual reveals secrets of how this is possible and makes the knowledge available to all Americans in open-sourcing fashion.</p>
<p>M4F is the distillation of thousands of hours of Morgan’s personal research, court appearances, document preparation and fellowship with some of the most brilliant law researchers of our time. Through this process, Morgan beat the banks using the rules adopted by our founders. The manual describes his lessons (like don't try to beat them at their own game) and methods to claim the hidden system of equity guaranteed in Article 3 of the Constitution. Equity is the power  predatory banking enterprises are attempting to usurp this has allows them to destroy our economy without going to jail. Are you convinced they are too big to fail? Protect your family,  assets and legacy now.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your contribution begins your path to true understanding of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as an inherent, unalienable right guaranteed in the constitution.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>All donors receive a book plus a one-month membership with a series of webinars on the basics of Trust Law. </strong> Excitingly, your contribution connects us in civil discourse and in sharing our knowledge with each other as we journey together towards the constitution’s vision of ‘a more perfect union’ as spiritual and constitutional sovereigns.</li>
<li>Your contribution supports our vision to reach those who seek to fulfill a leadership role during these leaderless times by giving us the needed funds for advertising, TED Talk design and a book promotional tour.</li>
<li>Additionally, litigation is very expensive, even if you are self litigating, it is very time consuming. Your contribution will allow M4F to support a crack staff of voracious researchers and document writers to help us expand our efforts to beat the banks even at their own game.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you believe, as we do, that asserting inherent Constitutional powers and freedoms are important, please contribute to the M4F IndieGoGo by contributing then taking advantage of our perks. You’ll become a member of our growing family, one of the ""early adaptor"" on the ground level as our founders were. You’ll be helping us spread the word that <strong>there is an alternative</strong> to being governed by over 60 million laws, statutes, rules, ordinances, etc., where ignorance of any of them can result in great loss to your estate, reputation and even lead to your imprisonment.</p>
<p>We know how difficult this is to believe for many of you who have worked hard your entire life. It’s terrible to learn your future is not as secure as you thought. The bank officers responsible for criminal activities rarely get jailed and banks continue to pay millions in civil and criminal fines for manipulating markets and interest rates. It’s still great business for them to break the law and just pay fines.</p>
<p>The 2008 Great Recession showed the banks  an efficient method to sweep up assets. Millions of homes were foreclosed, illegally and most through non-judicial foreclosures happening so fast the homeowners didn’t know what hit them. All without punishment.</p>
<h3><strong>AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We the people of America have an extraordinary opportunity that has never existed in the history of mankind</strong> – the opportunity to actively correct the imbalance of good and evil. Although we are experiencing a very dark time, a time when we have been manipulated into giving away our unalienable rights, a time when our inherent power appears taken from us. However, there are beacons of light reaching through our history guiding us  – the hour to choose is now upon us. </p>
<p>Do we have the strength and courage to co-create HEAVEN on earth? To draw upon the Constitution and reclaim our unalienable rights? Or do we allow the banks to continue their greedy, destructive, criminal practices? I understand that in many ways, this seems impossible; some say the banks are too big and have too much power.  But many others, and I, have won key battles. We have chosen to reclaim inherent rights, to stand-up to the banks, to bring forth the Constitution as our foundational Law, and yes you can win too. United we can beat the banks at our game. By choosing to correct the balance of law and equity, we each fulfill our life purpose. We do our part to create a more balanced, harmonious society where each of us can live out the true American Dream.</p>
<p><strong>If you love America and the values that make it special, order your copy of M4F and learn to do your part in blocking the banks from grabbing your assets for pennies on the dollar.</strong></p>
<p>Ignorance of the law is no protection from predatory banks and a complicit government. Get smart. Get <u>A MANUAL FOR FREEDOM – THE PEACEFUL SOVEREIGN’S PATH</u>.</p>
<h3><strong>CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>No two people are alike and so no two sovereign solutions will be alike. When first reading M4F the methods Morgan outlines will seem complex, because they are. There are no quick solutions to asserting your freedom from a system designed to enslave you. Your success with the book and courses will be driven by your own passion to stay the course to sovereignty.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is a way of life, one requiring dedication and ongoing vigilance. Sovereignty is a title and a practice not a destination; one must always be competent and confident to defend these multiple titles. M4F is meant to be the beginning of a journey, an open source tool. We welcome your participation and input!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>SHARING IS AS IMPORTANT AS DONATING</strong></h3>
<p>Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sharing is caring.</strong> Let's get the word out and make some noise for positive change by becoming self-governing by defeating our out of control banking system and doing our duty to uphold and live by the supreme law of the land, 20 equity maxims and trust law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Please use the IndieGoGo share tools</strong> to get the word out to friends and family about <u>A MANUAL FOR FREEDOM - THE PEACEFUL SOVEREIGN'S PATH</u>. Become a leader demonstrating that a better way is possible for your community.</li>

Mark heads up the team's creation of M4F educational programs to help you better learn and understand trust law and how to implement it to help you reclaim your constitutional rights and greatly improve the quality of your life.

WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS

Your contribution begins your path to true understanding of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as an inherent, unalienable right guaranteed in the constitution.

All donors receive a book plus a one-month membership with a series of webinars on the basics of Trust Law.  Excitingly, your contribution connects us in civil discourse and in sharing our knowledge with each other as we journey together towards the constitution’s vision of ‘a more perfect union’ as spiritual and constitutional sovereigns.
Your contribution supports our vision to reach those who seek to fulfill a leadership role during these leaderless times by giving us the needed funds for advertising, TED Talk design and a book promotional tour.
Additionally, litigation is very expensive, even if you are self litigating, it is very time consuming. Your contribution will allow M4F to support a crack staff of voracious researchers and document writers to help us expand our efforts to beat the banks even at their own game.

So, if you believe, as we do, that asserting inherent Constitutional powers and freedoms are important, please contribute to the M4F IndieGoGo by contributing then taking advantage of our perks. You’ll become a member of our growing family, one of the ""early adaptor"" on the ground level as our founders were. You’ll be helping us spread the word that there is an alternative to being governed by over 60 million laws, statutes, rules, ordinances, etc., where ignorance of any of them can result in great loss to your estate, reputation and even lead to your imprisonment.
We know how difficult this is to believe for many of you who have worked hard your entire life. It’s terrible to learn your future is not as secure as you thought. The bank officers responsible for criminal activities rarely get jailed and banks continue to pay millions in civil and criminal fines for manipulating markets and interest rates. It’s still great business for them to break the law and just pay fines.
The 2008 Great Recession showed the banks  an efficient method to sweep up assets. Millions of homes were foreclosed, illegally and most through non-judicial foreclosures happening so fast the homeowners didn’t know what hit them. All without punishment.
AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY
We the people of America have an extraordinary opportunity that has never existed in the history of mankind – the opportunity to actively correct the imbalance of good and evil. Although we are experiencing a very dark time, a time when we have been manipulated into giving away our unalienable rights, a time when our inherent power appears taken from us. However, there are beacons of light reaching through our history guiding us  – the hour to choose is now upon us. 
Do we have the strength and courage to co-create HEAVEN on earth? To draw upon the Constitution and reclaim our unalienable rights? Or do we allow the banks to continue their greedy, destructive, criminal practices? I understand that in many ways, this seems impossible; some say the banks are too big and have too much power.  But many others, and I, have won key battles. We have chosen to reclaim inherent rights, to stand-up to the banks, to bring forth the Constitution as our foundational Law, and yes you can win too. United we can beat the banks at our game. By choosing to correct the balance of law and equity, we each fulfill our life purpose. We do our part to create a more balanced, harmonious society where each of us can live out the true American Dream.
If you love America and the values that make it special, order your copy of M4F and learn to do your part in blocking the banks from grabbing your assets for pennies on the dollar.
Ignorance of the law is no protection from predatory banks and a complicit government. Get smart. Get A MANUAL FOR FREEDOM – THE PEACEFUL SOVEREIGN’S PATH.
CHALLENGES

No two people are alike and so no two sovereign solutions will be alike. When first reading M4F the methods Morgan outlines will seem complex, because they are. There are no quick solutions to asserting your freedom from a system designed to enslave you. Your success with the book and courses will be driven by your own passion to stay the course to sovereignty.
Sovereignty is a way of life, one requiring dedication and ongoing vigilance. Sovereignty is a title and a practice not a destination; one must always be competent and confident to defend these multiple titles. M4F is meant to be the beginning of a journey, an open source tool. We welcome your participation and input!

SHARING IS AS IMPORTANT AS DONATING
Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:


Sharing is caring. Let's get the word out and make some noise for positive change by becoming self-governing by defeating our out of control banking system and doing our duty to uphold and live by the supreme law of the land, 20 equity maxims and trust law.

Please use the IndieGoGo share tools to get the word out to friends and family about A MANUAL FOR FREEDOM - THE PEACEFUL SOVEREIGN'S PATH. Become a leader demonstrating that a better way is possible for your community.

Yours for Greater Freedom,

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>The author, Joyce Ng was traveling to New York on one of her first consulting assignments.  She was a recent college graduate and as a young adult, witnessed a major event that forever changed her life.  On 9/11, when the first plane crashed into the North Tower, she was trapped on the 13th floor of the hotel. The plane's landing gear fell onto the roof of the hotel, and the building caught on fire.  While the hotel was burning, debris was falling around the area and she witnessed people getting killed or injured.   Joyce, and many others, had to flee the burning building.  For Joyce, witnessing a devastation at young age left a devastating impact.   There is not a day that goes by that she doesn't think about 9/11.</p>
<p>On a mission to help others, she has founded a non-profit to unite 9/11 survivors from the hotel and bring awareness to the trauma and plight from everyone who witnessed terrorist attacks.</p>

There's swearing, there's blood and gore, there's sex, there's questionable choices by the characters (and probably the author), what happens in these pages isn't black and white, it's all a touch of gray depending on your pov.

Why Saul Bishop? It's a pseudonym and honestly I think it sounds cooler. So why should you contribute money to this campaign? I don't know but I'll try to convince you anyway. Writing is my salvation. When I look at the world and all of the challenges that we face, the things that inspire us and the things that knock us down, it's writing a story and getting into the lives of my characters that fills me up with hope and meaning. I write to be a better person, it's as simple as that.My funding goal is $2000. -$700 for the cover done by the extraordinary folks at www.bookflydesign.com-$900 for profession editing services also at www.bookflydesign.com-$400 for advertising to get the word out on Facebook and TwitterThe cover is scheduled to be completed in late June and the editing is scheduled to be done in mid August. My tentative release date for the novel in both digital and print form is the first week in October. I'm currently on page 140 after three months of writing and I should finish by June, my projection for book length is 60-75k words and 240 to 300 pages, I'm well ahead of my August editing deadline and will have no problem finishing. I highly suggest that everyone thinking about donating go check out the wonderful work being done by the folks at www.bookflydesign.com They're worth every penny and then some.To be honest, this is all a bit awkward for me, I never ask for money, I'm usually a do-it-yourself kind of guy. That said, I really want to do this right, I want the finished product to look nice with an outstanding cover that welcomes and intrigues the reader and I want it to read like a professional piece of writing, my prose is pretty fun but I can't wait until I get the opportunity to re-write everything after it's been edited by a professional 3rd party. I believe in the story I'm writing. Hannah, The Huntress is a celebration of the tropes that I love, if you read it you're going to see some old friends that you'r familiar with. The characters are purposefully diverse because I believe that's important in modern storytelling and the protagonist is the most nuanced and delightful female lead that I could imagine, because I love strong women main characters with weapons and questionable supernatural backstories that beat the hell out of people. It's also a book for the over 18 crowd, because we need those too. There's swearing, there's blood and gore, there's sex, there's questionable choices by the characters (and probably the author), what happens in these pages isn't black and white, it's all a touch of gray depending on your pov. Initially I started writing a YA novel but quickly realized that isn't how I write, I enjoy four letter words too much, so essentially what I then wrote was a YA novel for grown-ups, Hannah, The Huntress still feels a bit like your classic teenage coming of age story but it veers off into Rated R land quick. So I hope that's your thing and that you'll enjoy the book.And last! I think the book is going to be a hell of a lot of fun to read! I'm having a blast writing it, I hope you have a great time reading it as well. The best way that I can think of to convince you to fund this project is to let the story speak for itself, so pleas follow the link below and it will take you to my blog where you can read the prologue and the 1st five chapters for yourself. That's about 70 pages of story and essentially the end of Act 1 where everything gets crazy. Do keep in mind that's it's a rough draft and that there may be some discrepancies in the story that will be fixed in future edits.Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the story and I'd appreciate it if you'd pre-pay for a book and some cool goodies.All The Best,Ken Henningsen, Alias: Saul Bishophttp://chronicleofsaul.blogspot.com/2016/03/hannah-huntress-prologue-and-chapters-1.htmlCover examples by James T.

<h3>What is a ""USAP""?</h3>
<p>If you use a smartphone, odds are that you have taken a handful of ""USAPs"" yourself. USAP stands for ""unedited smartphone aesthetic pic(s),"" -- as well as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/USAPzine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a community of smartphone photographers and their shockingly incredible body of work</a>.</p>

</div><div>It was some ungodly hour on December 3rd, 2014 when Kayleigh Cox was messing around with images she had taken on her phone and feeling frustrated by the process of Instagram and the culture of filters. Her pictures were good as they were. Editing was unnecessary for most of the photos and the hallmark square-cropped look that Instagram was known for would often destroy the composition of most smartphone photography. There were too many steps. She wanted a place to post raw smartphone images with likeminded photographers.<br/><br/>She created the Facebook group ""unedited smartphone aesthetic pics"" to start dumping what was mostly an archive of interesting photos featuring subjects and scenery from her iPhone 4s. After adding other photographers, Kayleigh never thought the group would amount to anything special. The group now has 8,117 members -- and that is just of this morning, with numbers growing every day.
<p>""I think the 'aesthetic movement' in the modern art scene amongst millennial artists and Internet meme-makers may have had something to do with the immediate popularity, meaning that I never had to do much advertising to get it to take off. Apparently, the space for unedited smartphone aesthetic pics was, in fact, already desired and needed by weird art kids like me all across the country and world,"" Kayleigh writes.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are already going ""viral"" (thanks for the term, Mom) -- we just don't have the funds to cover printing and to pay each artist featured as well as staff.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Anyone can participate in submitting to be featured in the USAP mag by posting in the facebook group or by contacting us personally. You don't even need a smartphone, as proven by our avid flip phone photographers. </span></p>
<p>There are enough people and submissions already involved that we could, hypothetically, be putting out issues on a monthly basis. But that's only if we have the funds and resources. <br/> </p>

</div><div>At this point, the creative work as well as the less creative work that is already going towards this first issue has been done for the low, low cost of <i>free</i>. The staff behind the magazine are students, professionals, published writers, curators, and artists. We would love to pay our staff.<br/><br/>Megan Lazarou, Director of Print of IQ Total Source, quoted the first issue with associated costs to cost $4,000 and $6,000 for a 50 page magazine with more than 50 images.  If there is anyone reading this with access to affordable printing -- email us.<p></p>

</div></div>","What is a ""USAP""?
If you use a smartphone, odds are that you have taken a handful of ""USAPs"" yourself. USAP stands for ""unedited smartphone aesthetic pic(s),"" -- as well as a community of smartphone photographers and their shockingly incredible body of work.


by Vim Ala
It was some ungodly hour on December 3rd, 2014 when Kayleigh Cox was messing around with images she had taken on her phone and feeling frustrated by the process of Instagram and the culture of filters. Her pictures were good as they were. Editing was unnecessary for most of the photos and the hallmark square-cropped look that Instagram was known for would often destroy the composition of most smartphone photography. There were too many steps. She wanted a place to post raw smartphone images with likeminded photographers.She created the Facebook group ""unedited smartphone aesthetic pics"" to start dumping what was mostly an archive of interesting photos featuring subjects and scenery from her iPhone 4s. After adding other photographers, Kayleigh never thought the group would amount to anything special. The group now has 8,117 members -- and that is just of this morning, with numbers growing every day.
""I think the 'aesthetic movement' in the modern art scene amongst millennial artists and Internet meme-makers may have had something to do with the immediate popularity, meaning that I never had to do much advertising to get it to take off. Apparently, the space for unedited smartphone aesthetic pics was, in fact, already desired and needed by weird art kids like me all across the country and world,"" Kayleigh writes.



by Angus Lang***You can check out the public page on Facebook, or email me at usapzine@gmail.com if you want to be added. Otherwise, you have to know someone to get in. It's sort of like a club. You probably already are friends with a USAPer on facebook. 
So, why am I reading this? 

You're reading this because you have the potential to participate in the genesis of the next big art magazine. What we have online in the form of hundreds of thousands of photos in a weird secret facebook group, we want to print onto glossy paper and put it on your coffee table. Kind of like Juxtapoz or Hi-Fructose, but more intimate and less high-brow. The less brows, the better.


by Westin Lohne


We are already going ""viral"" (thanks for the term, Mom) -- we just don't have the funds to cover printing and to pay each artist featured as well as staff. Your contributions would go directly into the pocket of the photographers, of the small team behind USAP, and to cover the cost of printing a magazine.
Anyone can participate in submitting to be featured in the USAP mag by posting in the facebook group or by contacting us personally. You don't even need a smartphone, as proven by our avid flip phone photographers. 
There are enough people and submissions already involved that we could, hypothetically, be putting out issues on a monthly basis. But that's only if we have the funds and resources.  
How can I participate in ""the genesis of the next big art magazine""? 




by Julianna Salguero
At this point, the creative work as well as the less creative work that is already going towards this first issue has been done for the low, low cost of free. The staff behind the magazine are students, professionals, published writers, curators, and artists. We would love to pay our staff.Megan Lazarou, Director of Print of IQ Total Source, quoted the first issue with associated costs to cost $4,000 and $6,000 for a 50 page magazine with more than 50 images.  If there is anyone reading this with access to affordable printing -- email us.

by Matt StortoAlthough all of our current submitters are not expecting pay at this point, guess what? We want to pay them, too! Any photographer featured in the mag will get paid. This is the highest priority behind the magazine itself being printed and distributed. The more money donated to this campaign, the more money we give the artists. 
To break that $8,000 number down:



~$4,000-$6,000 goes to working with Megan Lazarou to print at least 1,000 copies of USAP Mag. 


This is the first hurdle we have to jump. Once we're here, the rest goes to:


$1,000 ----> Paying roughly 50 artists about $20 to be featured in the magazine. 


Anything leftover? ---> Paying our staff of professional publishers, writers, curators, editors, and all-around balls of sunshine. 


We also picked $8,000 because that's about where our member number is as of today. If everyone in the group pitched in $1, we could have this magazine by tomorrow. 
The magazine itself will be well designed, consciously curated, and of high quality. The whole idea of USAP is turning out a high quality product via low quality devices. But when it comes to a physical product, it ain't gonna be cheap.

<b>Snow Leopard Publishing</b> - We want to roll out a program that allows authors to pick their own contracts, ensuring that they get a good deal that works for them. We want to end authors having to jump through hoops to get a literary agent then having to pay that agent 15% of royalties. Snow Leopard also offers a unique ""Profits to Authors Program"" that lets authors ""invest"" in the company and earn even higher royalties in return. This program is very popular with our current authors and is growing and evolving as we grow.</li>
<li>
<b>Centum Press</b> - We want to give every flash fiction and short story author the money he or she deserves. We don't pay flat fees or tell authors that the exposure they get is payment enough. We pay authors who are published in our anthologies real royalties, and we believe that the royalty checks that we send out will be sizable for short story and flash fiction contributions. Each contributing author becomes a member of the team and we all work together to make the authors a decent profit.</li>
<li>
<b>Wizards Keep Publishing</b> - We just acquired this imprint, and we plan to relaunch it in April with a ""Book Family Program"" that will allow new authors to write and traditionally publish series. So many publishers won't even touch series or trilogies written by new authors, but we are going to guarantee any author who publishes with us that we will publish, if he or she so chooses, all of the books in his or her series or trilogy as long as the series continues to meet our guidelines.</li> </ul> <p>The art and literature of a society is where it's true beauty lies.

<li>Give authors a fair compensation for their flash fiction and short stories rather than giving them less than we'd spend on a cup of coffee. </li>

<h3>The First Chapter of 'Only If I'</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Today she was wearing a shade of cool blue eye
shadow against black mascara making her look icy, chilly even. Bubblegum lip
gloss accentuated her features and she appeared to be in benign repose while
sitting on the passenger side of his Nissan Nismo. Life was good. Every man
wanted a bombshell by his side and Kendrick was no exception. Oakley shades
covered her aqua eyes and her pale blond hair fell in bacon-like crinkles past
her shoulders shielding her breast. When he looked over at her the first word
that came to mind was elegant. Gold bangles and a matching gold Michael Kors
watch was her wrist wear. A smooth tan French Connection dress with a dark
brown blazer over it defined the elegance.</p>
<p>  He liked his car to smell manly
but each time Amanda rode with him she left it smelling like Just Cavalli or
her second favorite Gucci Premie’re. Amanda was 20 years old and her family
came from Texas though she was raised right here in South Florida.</p>
<p>  Somewhere on Wiles Road a Mexican
had a dark rust colored pick-up truck pulled over with several watermelons on
its bed. A cardboard sign had eight dollars written on in it in huge sloppy
permanent marker. Kendrick pulled over.</p>
<p>  “Hola Que Paso,” Kendrick hopped
out speaking in fluent Spanish. Sure he was as black as an ink pen but in South
Florida being bi-lingual was almost mandatory. The land was filled with Cubans,
Dominican Republicans, Haitians and Jamaicans. It seemed only twenty percent of
South Floridians were natural born Americans.</p>
<p>  “Bueno Bueno. Mucho acuka,” the
older Hispanic man replied while handling him a cut off piece to sample. “La
Mujer,” through the window he offered a sample to Amanda that she respectfully
declined.</p>
<p>  “Acuka ci, tres,” three was a lot
of watermelon for a guy who lived alone. Knowing how much his mom &amp; little
sister also favored the fruit he naturally bought them some also.</p>
<p>  When he’d gotten out the car John
Legend was singing, when he re-entered the I-Pod was terminated and Power 96
was pumping some hard techno dance joint. Ken started bouncing in the driver
seat, snapping his fingers and shaking his arms. This is the guy everyone loved
to be with. He wasn’t perverted, he didn’t use a B or an F every other word and
he was very down to Earth. Everyone accepted Ken, the Blacks, the Whites, the
elders and even the kids.</p>
<p>  At 21 years old he was already a
successful small business owner. Perhaps the entrepreneur genes were inherited
from his father Larry, an owner of a 6 figure surveillance company that
installed residential security systems.</p>
<p>  At 12 years old Kenny was making
dot coms for mom and pop stores and self-employed boutique owners. Skipping two
grades he was already a freshman. By 16, he had a nice savings from his website
business, lucrative report card money and holiday gifts.</p>
<p>  South Florida is made of 3
counties and it seems Dade always got the attention from tourist because of the
main attraction South Beach. That’s why Kenny started a tourist’s website for
Ft. Lauderdale, right from his bedroom. It was a matter of networking with
hotel owners, restaurants, club owners and convincing them why they should
advertise on his site. When you walked into a place and showed them a printout
of a counter saying your site had over 2 million hits to date and averaged
40,000 per month it wasn’t much more convincing you had to do.</p>
<p>  That netted the funds for his
3,100 sq. ft. home out in Weston, 2 bed 2bath with a pool in the back that he
enjoyed doing laps in. Amanda also enjoyed the patio whenever she was over,
mostly sun-tanning. </p>
<p>  “Every time we pull up at your
mom’s house it reminds me of the old sitcom Full House,” Amanda stated with her
soft, stress-relieving voice. “The architecture in San Fran is way different
than ours so I don’t mean in that way, but like- you feel safe here, homey,
it’s comfortable you know.”</p>
<p>  “That’s why they pay the
expensive HOA fees sugar,” he replied as he exited his sports car showing a
pearly white smile.</p>
<p>  The Home Owners Association, scam
to rake in the dough or was it actually worth it? These were the rules you had
to abide by in order to live in this gated community. Break your bones to keep
up with the mortgage on a six figure home and a guy gives you a set of rules to
live by, the consequences of breaking them being a lien on your house. It
sounds shabby but no one wants their property value to drop because the
Wilkinsons’ decided to paint their house lime green with hot pink roof
shingles. Or cause Billy three doors down likes to fix on his hot rod in the
driveway with his shirt off and light blue jeans full of grease and oil stains.</p>
<p>  A bronze Mini Cooper S Paceman
was parked in the driveway next to a silver Infiniti truck, indicating Catrina
his 17 year old sister was home. She was a little on the heavy side.</p>
<p>  The bi-racial couple stepped into
the house, Ken with a palm planted on the small of Amanda’s back.</p>
<p>  “Smells like Belgian waffles in
here,” Ken stated.</p>
<p>  “That’s your sister in their
burning down the house. Two in the afternoon and that girl is making waffles
and eggs,” Kierra replied.</p>
<p>  “Brain food ma,” Ken sat on a bar
stool resting his arms on the granite countertop that resembled a black sky
with cream streaks of lighting. “Speaking of which, I got a few watermelons out-”</p>
<p>  “<i>Have</i>,” the 46 year old mother of 3 interrupted him.</p>
<p>  “Have what?”</p>
<p>  “You <i>have</i> a few watermelons, not you got. You speak 3 languages boy
don’t corrupt your English.” She was a dermatologist with a wide nose that all
her children dominoed.</p>
<p>  Truth be told she didn’t even
have to work and since she chose to, she had the means to have her own
establishment. She’d been working under Dr. Kelly for 12 years and earned a
decent salary with welcoming benefits so she saw no need to quit. Some wanted
it all, some were content. Kierra Walker fell into the latter.</p>
<p>  Together she and Larry had a boy
they named Clayton. The following year they married and honeymooned in Mexico.
In 92’ they birthed Kendrick. Four years later an unexpected Catrina arrived
two months premature. And there you have Larry’s little branch of the Walker
dynasty.</p>
<p>  Their eldest Clayton is a second
string fullback for the Tennessee Titans. He got married three years ago to the
lead singer of a major gospel group.</p>
<p>  Kendrick has done excellent at entreprenuing
but still Kierra pushes him to continue his education. He works ten hour days
and takes online classes working toward a business degree.</p>
<p>  Last there is Catrina. She’d just
graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas a 4.0 student. She won a scholarship
through National Geographic and she’ll be moving up to Daytona Beach in a few
months. For now she sleeps till noon, cooks breakfast at two and gets dressed
at four.</p>
<p>  The television was turned on an
afternoon soap. Breaking news interrupted Kelly from finding out Robert cheated
with Stephanie. The news being, Paris Jackson, the late Michael’s fifteen year
old daughter attempted suicide by slicing her wrist with a kitchen knife and
popping twenty ibuprofens. When the cops arrived, she stated, “I wish my daddy
was here.”</p>
<p>  Honey, we all wish your daddy was
here. No singer can ever match the influence he left imprinted on this world.
VH1 was running Mike videos to soundtrack Paris’ actions. Kendrick jumped up
from his bar stool and started moonwalking with his head titled down.</p>
<p>  He was very athletic and an
excellent dancer. Every kid grew up horrified of the Thriller video and
imitating Mike’s smooth dance moves by grabbing on his crotch and biting down
on his lip asking whomever was around the infamous question, “Whose bad?”</p>
<p>  Enters Catrina, plate of
breakfast in hand, pink scarf covering what was no doubt a mess. That girl
slept like she was fighting. She wore brown dog house shoes on her feet with
floppy ears flapping and marble eyes. Whiskers protruding, pink cloth tongue
dangling out of its mouth. BCBG pajama set, shorts and spaghetti top on, she
could stand to lose a few pounds but she wasn’t a sloppy chunk of rolls. She,
like her siblings had Kierra’s nose but Catrina also had wide oriental eyes set
in deep brown skin. Her lips were also chunky. A silver bar bell was pierced
into her tongue. Besides that her 2 lobes and an upper ear stud.</p>
<p>  “Hey Bruddy Wuddy,” she said,
reducing Kendrick from a 21 year old successful businessman with an athlete’s
build to the same treatment as a cute little poodle.</p>
<p>  “Wassup, no runaways today?” Ever
since the summer started she’d been volunteering at a Broward County Humane
Society.</p>
<p>  “Nope, today is National Beauty
Rest Day for all the princesses worldwide,” she replied squeezing onto the
loveseat between Amanda and Ken.</p>
<p>  “I wish you would’ve texted me
last night, I was up at six this morning,” Amanda injected herself into the
conversation.</p>
<p>  “Better luck next year,” Catrina
was full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>  Amanda and Ken had been going
steady the past 2 years and from day one she blended right into this family the
way strawberries and bananas do in a smoothie. These days lots of people were
dating outside their race, even adopting children of different ethnicities. The
new millennium raised the standard on social intertwining. Love knows no shade;
it is the most unprejudiced feeling of all time. It can unite 2 men or it can
unite a couple with a 20 year age gap. There aren’t any guidelines, no rules
and love doesn’t discriminate.</p>
<p>  A white Ford Econoline with the
words I-SPY printed across the side with a background of a mural of cameras and
surveillance screens pulled up and parallel parked in front of the house.</p>
<p>  Everything about Larry screamed
Carl Winslow. His car of choosing was a Cadillac CTS sedan, but as of late you
were more prone to catch him driving one of his work vans. The economy was
slowly recuperating from what history books crooned The Great Recession, and in
a recession people are more apt to be worrying about car notes and mortgage
payments rather than luxuries like surveillance systems.</p>
<p>  The tri-county was home to
several gazillionaires who couldn’t tell you what a recession was. For them
Larry was finding himself stuck in rush hour traffic more and more. Rush hour traffic
had an upside to it. It meant he was headed to a client’s home or coming from
depositing a check; or on his way home from ripping and running all day, a
hamster in the wheel of life.</p>
<p>  There were five more vans painted
in the same insignia floating around the tri-county. His company employed
twelve technicians, three salesman and six people on the administrative side.</p>
<p>  When he walked through the door
the look he gave Kierra and the look she gave him in return would let any
outsider know these people were truly in love. Twenty three years ago they
pledged their vows and twenty three years later they still meant every word.</p>
<p>  He greeted her with a kiss and a
bouquet of six white roses were revealed from behind his back. Kendrick rose
from his place on the couch leaving his girl and sister to discuss Sally Hansen
and approached his old man with a firm handshake that evolved into both men
pulling each other in for a quick hug and pat on the back, the scene reminding
you of an old Budweiser commercial.</p>
<p>  Kierra was off to find water and
vase for her roses.</p>
<p>  “I may need you next week, will
you be available?” Father asked son. Their bond could be tested at extremely
high temperatures like gold and wouldn’t quaver.</p>
<p>  “What’s going on dad?”</p>
<p>  Larry Walker was not one to
dwindle away funds and he’d instilled the same principle into all his children.
Still he was no millionaire, but with the help of a trusted partner he had
taken out a hefty loan and invested into a 7 building, 42 unit apartment
complex a little ways north in Lake Worth. Some of the units required
remodeling and to cut back on labor the partners agreed to do some of the
fixing with their own hands.</p>
<p>  “You aren’t too busy to lay some
tile with your old man are you?”</p>
<p>  “Not at all dad, I can bring
Jeremy too.” He and Jeremy had been friends long before he even knew Amanda
existed.</p>
<p>  “Jeremy’s a good kid and I’m
proud of you for your ability to pick strong minded individuals to keep in your
circle. But for this project he’d be a 3<sup>rd</sup> wheel if you feel my
drift.”</p>
<p>  With the recession causing Larry
to be more in the field, Kendrick’s girlfriend and own business, there wasn’t
much time for them together like before. The days of putting together model
cars together were ancient history. It was to moments like this that instilled
Kendrick’s morals and values.</p>
<p>  Late afternoons of throwing the
pig skin with his first born turned into Larry coaching Clayton’s little league
team, taking them for ice cream after a game win lose or draw. Now, Clayton was
in the NFL with several endorsements and publicity, thanking God first, then
his father every time a microphone was slammed into his face.</p>
<p>Coral Springs,
Florida wasn’t a major city but it wasn’t some small rural town either. One
could go through their whole time on earth never hearing of the city. But for
the Walkers it was their home, their foundation and the groundwork to their
stability.</p>
<p>  The plate of waffles gone and
Catrina was now showing Amanda a pair of brown thick strap heels made by DMSX
Donald J. Pliner’s Spring Collection with the matching bag. Every girl loved
designers, rags, sales and malls. Catrina was without mate but she was no
exception. If anything she’d look good for herself.</p>
<p>  “That’s so cute, what are you
wearing with it?” Amanda complimented her taste. Catrina had a closet with
10,000 outfits and 20,000 accessories and she was dumbfounded by this question.</p>
<p>  “Two words- Town Center,” was her
reply.</p>
<p>  Coral Springs was approximately
twenty minutes from Boca Raton where the Town Center Mall was located. It was
built just for women it seemed with stores like Nine West, Phillip Lam and
Coach. The mall was so upscale it offered valet parking, housed a massage spa
and a Ruth Chris Steakhouse.</p>
<p>  It took over an hour for Catrina
to get showered and dressed. She came down the wooden stairs in a Stella
McCartney floral print dress and a pair of black flats and a slim black belt
all the red carpet stars were wearing. Small clutch in hand her hair was curled
and left a lingering scent of Orange Citrus &amp; Papaya thanks to the Garnier
Fructis shampoo. Women were such beautiful and unique creatures with their
mixtures of fragrances and garments. The smell of a certain perfume could take
a man back 12 years to his first girlfriend.</p>
<p>  In the time it took Catrina to
finally emerge from her cave of toiletries Kendrick had fallen asleep on the
couch with his baldhead nestled onto Amanda’s lap. Larry was also asleep on the
other couch and the TV was on CNN talking about the NSA snooping into Facebook
accounts and monitoring citizen’s privacy labeling it counter-terrorism. The
next thing you know they’ll be telling us we have to store a copy key of our
home at the local police department.</p>
<p>  Kierra was in the kitchen ‘MOM’
apron sprawled around her petite frame measuring ricotta cheese for tonight’s
lasagna and garlic bread supper. Raising three kids she was accustomed to
cooking.</p>
<p>  “Mom, can we take your truck?
Daddy’s van is blocking me in the driveway,” Catrina stated as she stumbled
into the kitchen with her forehead perspiring from just one step into the
almighty Florida sun.</p>
<p>  “Go get my keys out of my purse
honey and don’t eat while you’re out I’m making dinner.”</p>
<p>  Life, one minute it could be as
normal as a 72 BPM heart rate, the next everything around you can start falling
like Job. That is why we must live it to the fullest, enjoy every moment and
cherish our loved ones like there’ll be no tomorrow. </p>

shingles. Or cause Billy three doors down likes to fix on his hot rod in the
driveway with his shirt off and light blue jeans full of grease and oil stains.
  A bronze Mini Cooper S Paceman
was parked in the driveway next to a silver Infiniti truck, indicating Catrina
his 17 year old sister was home. She was a little on the heavy side.
  The bi-racial couple stepped into
the house, Ken with a palm planted on the small of Amanda’s back.
  “Smells like Belgian waffles in
here,” Ken stated.
  “That’s your sister in their
burning down the house. Two in the afternoon and that girl is making waffles
and eggs,” Kierra replied.
  “Brain food ma,” Ken sat on a bar
stool resting his arms on the granite countertop that resembled a black sky
with cream streaks of lighting. “Speaking of which, I got a few watermelons out-”
  “Have,” the 46 year old mother of 3 interrupted him.
  “Have what?”
  “You have a few watermelons, not you got. You speak 3 languages boy
don’t corrupt your English.” She was a dermatologist with a wide nose that all
her children dominoed.
  Truth be told she didn’t even
have to work and since she chose to, she had the means to have her own
establishment. She’d been working under Dr. Kelly for 12 years and earned a
decent salary with welcoming benefits so she saw no need to quit. Some wanted
it all, some were content. Kierra Walker fell into the latter.
  Together she and Larry had a boy
they named Clayton. The following year they married and honeymooned in Mexico.
In 92’ they birthed Kendrick. Four years later an unexpected Catrina arrived
two months premature. And there you have Larry’s little branch of the Walker
dynasty.
  Their eldest Clayton is a second
string fullback for the Tennessee Titans. He got married three years ago to the
lead singer of a major gospel group.
  Kendrick has done excellent at entreprenuing
but still Kierra pushes him to continue his education. He works ten hour days
and takes online classes working toward a business degree.
  Last there is Catrina. She’d just
graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas a 4.0 student. She won a scholarship
through National Geographic and she’ll be moving up to Daytona Beach in a few
months. For now she sleeps till noon, cooks breakfast at two and gets dressed
at four.
  The television was turned on an
afternoon soap. Breaking news interrupted Kelly from finding out Robert cheated
with Stephanie. The news being, Paris Jackson, the late Michael’s fifteen year
old daughter attempted suicide by slicing her wrist with a kitchen knife and
popping twenty ibuprofens. When the cops arrived, she stated, “I wish my daddy
was here.”
  Honey, we all wish your daddy was
here. No singer can ever match the influence he left imprinted on this world.
VH1 was running Mike videos to soundtrack Paris’ actions. Kendrick jumped up
from his bar stool and started moonwalking with his head titled down.
  He was very athletic and an
excellent dancer. Every kid grew up horrified of the Thriller video and
imitating Mike’s smooth dance moves by grabbing on his crotch and biting down
on his lip asking whomever was around the infamous question, “Whose bad?”
  Enters Catrina, plate of
breakfast in hand, pink scarf covering what was no doubt a mess. That girl
slept like she was fighting. She wore brown dog house shoes on her feet with
floppy ears flapping and marble eyes. Whiskers protruding, pink cloth tongue
dangling out of its mouth. BCBG pajama set, shorts and spaghetti top on, she
could stand to lose a few pounds but she wasn’t a sloppy chunk of rolls. She,
like her siblings had Kierra’s nose but Catrina also had wide oriental eyes set
in deep brown skin. Her lips were also chunky. A silver bar bell was pierced
into her tongue. Besides that her 2 lobes and an upper ear stud.
  “Hey Bruddy Wuddy,” she said,
reducing Kendrick from a 21 year old successful businessman with an athlete’s
build to the same treatment as a cute little poodle.
  “Wassup, no runaways today?” Ever
since the summer started she’d been volunteering at a Broward County Humane
Society.
  “Nope, today is National Beauty
Rest Day for all the princesses worldwide,” she replied squeezing onto the
loveseat between Amanda and Ken.
  “I wish you would’ve texted me
last night, I was up at six this morning,” Amanda injected herself into the
conversation.
  “Better luck next year,” Catrina
was full of sarcasm.
  Amanda and Ken had been going
steady the past 2 years and from day one she blended right into this family the
way strawberries and bananas do in a smoothie. These days lots of people were
dating outside their race, even adopting children of different ethnicities. The
new millennium raised the standard on social intertwining. Love knows no shade;
it is the most unprejudiced feeling of all time. It can unite 2 men or it can
unite a couple with a 20 year age gap. There aren’t any guidelines, no rules
and love doesn’t discriminate.
  A white Ford Econoline with the
words I-SPY printed across the side with a background of a mural of cameras and
surveillance screens pulled up and parallel parked in front of the house.
  Everything about Larry screamed
Carl Winslow. His car of choosing was a Cadillac CTS sedan, but as of late you
were more prone to catch him driving one of his work vans. The economy was
slowly recuperating from what history books crooned The Great Recession, and in
a recession people are more apt to be worrying about car notes and mortgage
payments rather than luxuries like surveillance systems.
  The tri-county was home to
several gazillionaires who couldn’t tell you what a recession was. For them
Larry was finding himself stuck in rush hour traffic more and more. Rush hour traffic
had an upside to it. It meant he was headed to a client’s home or coming from
depositing a check; or on his way home from ripping and running all day, a
hamster in the wheel of life.
  There were five more vans painted
in the same insignia floating around the tri-county. His company employed
twelve technicians, three salesman and six people on the administrative side.
  When he walked through the door
the look he gave Kierra and the look she gave him in return would let any
outsider know these people were truly in love. Twenty three years ago they
pledged their vows and twenty three years later they still meant every word.
  He greeted her with a kiss and a
bouquet of six white roses were revealed from behind his back. Kendrick rose
from his place on the couch leaving his girl and sister to discuss Sally Hansen
and approached his old man with a firm handshake that evolved into both men
pulling each other in for a quick hug and pat on the back, the scene reminding
you of an old Budweiser commercial.
  Kierra was off to find water and
vase for her roses.
  “I may need you next week, will
you be available?” Father asked son. Their bond could be tested at extremely
high temperatures like gold and wouldn’t quaver.
  “What’s going on dad?”
  Larry Walker was not one to
dwindle away funds and he’d instilled the same principle into all his children.
Still he was no millionaire, but with the help of a trusted partner he had
taken out a hefty loan and invested into a 7 building, 42 unit apartment
complex a little ways north in Lake Worth. Some of the units required
remodeling and to cut back on labor the partners agreed to do some of the
fixing with their own hands.
  “You aren’t too busy to lay some
tile with your old man are you?”
  “Not at all dad, I can bring
Jeremy too.” He and Jeremy had been friends long before he even knew Amanda
existed.
  “Jeremy’s a good kid and I’m
proud of you for your ability to pick strong minded individuals to keep in your
circle. But for this project he’d be a 3rd wheel if you feel my
drift.”
  With the recession causing Larry
to be more in the field, Kendrick’s girlfriend and own business, there wasn’t
much time for them together like before. The days of putting together model
cars together were ancient history. It was to moments like this that instilled
Kendrick’s morals and values.
  Late afternoons of throwing the
pig skin with his first born turned into Larry coaching Clayton’s little league
team, taking them for ice cream after a game win lose or draw. Now, Clayton was
in the NFL with several endorsements and publicity, thanking God first, then
his father every time a microphone was slammed into his face.
Coral Springs,
Florida wasn’t a major city but it wasn’t some small rural town either. One
could go through their whole time on earth never hearing of the city. But for
the Walkers it was their home, their foundation and the groundwork to their
stability.
  The plate of waffles gone and
Catrina was now showing Amanda a pair of brown thick strap heels made by DMSX
Donald J. Pliner’s Spring Collection with the matching bag. Every girl loved
designers, rags, sales and malls. Catrina was without mate but she was no
exception. If anything she’d look good for herself.
  “That’s so cute, what are you
wearing with it?” Amanda complimented her taste. Catrina had a closet with
10,000 outfits and 20,000 accessories and she was dumbfounded by this question.
  “Two words- Town Center,” was her
reply.
  Coral Springs was approximately
twenty minutes from Boca Raton where the Town Center Mall was located. It was
built just for women it seemed with stores like Nine West, Phillip Lam and
Coach. The mall was so upscale it offered valet parking, housed a massage spa
and a Ruth Chris Steakhouse.
  It took over an hour for Catrina
to get showered and dressed. She came down the wooden stairs in a Stella
McCartney floral print dress and a pair of black flats and a slim black belt
all the red carpet stars were wearing. Small clutch in hand her hair was curled
and left a lingering scent of Orange Citrus & Papaya thanks to the Garnier
Fructis shampoo. Women were such beautiful and unique creatures with their
mixtures of fragrances and garments. The smell of a certain perfume could take
a man back 12 years to his first girlfriend.
  In the time it took Catrina to
finally emerge from her cave of toiletries Kendrick had fallen asleep on the
couch with his baldhead nestled onto Amanda’s lap. Larry was also asleep on the
other couch and the TV was on CNN talking about the NSA snooping into Facebook
accounts and monitoring citizen’s privacy labeling it counter-terrorism. The
next thing you know they’ll be telling us we have to store a copy key of our
home at the local police department.
  Kierra was in the kitchen ‘MOM’
apron sprawled around her petite frame measuring ricotta cheese for tonight’s
lasagna and garlic bread supper. Raising three kids she was accustomed to
cooking.
  “Mom, can we take your truck?
Daddy’s van is blocking me in the driveway,” Catrina stated as she stumbled
into the kitchen with her forehead perspiring from just one step into the
almighty Florida sun.
  “Go get my keys out of my purse
honey and don’t eat while you’re out I’m making dinner.”
  Life, one minute it could be as
normal as a 72 BPM heart rate, the next everything around you can start falling
like Job. That is why we must live it to the fullest, enjoy every moment and
cherish our loved ones like there’ll be no tomorrow.

<h3>The Story of <i>Miriam's Well</i>
</h3>
<p>In this modern day retelling of the Exodus, Miriam wanders the political and spiritual desert of a changing America, torn between her roots as the Jewish daughter of a Black father and white mother, her yearning for home, and her brothers, Aaron, a successful New York City attorney, and Moses, an autistic artist living in Kansas. An astonishing cook and singer, Miriam has a knack for showing up to feed and help people at landmark events, including People's Park during the Summer of Love, the Wounded Knee encampment in South Dakota, the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, the Oklahoma City terrorist attack, 9/11, and Hurricane Katrina. As she seeks the promised land, she shows her people, and eventually herself, how to turn the chaos and despair of our times into music, meals, and miracles.</p>
<p>The novel also includes over 35 pages of real recipes from the fictional cooking and baking Miriam does throughout the book, including delicious delights by Nancy O'Connor's<i> The Rolling Prairie Cookbook</i>, Jayni and Frank Carey's <i>The New Kansas Cookbook,</i> Janet Majure's <i>Recipes Worth Sharing,</i> and Meghan Heriford of the Ladybird Diner in Lawrence, Kansas.</p>

<h3>Why a Book Tour Campaign</h3>
<p>Like most writers, I've been pretty much funding my own book tours for many years, which has limited my travel and reach. I'm thrilled to be working with Ice Cube Press, publishing the finest of Midwestern writers for many years, which is giving the book all it needs in terms of great design, wide distribution, and a fabulously hard-working publisher, Steve Semken. Like most presses, this one doesn't have resources for a book tour. So I'm turning to you to help me visit many communities (events in the works or plans for Kansas, Missouri, Vermont, Wisconsin, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and more). In return, you can get your own copy of <i>Miriam's Well </i>or many other vivid perks.</p>
<h3>What Miriam's Well Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign goal of $4,900 will give this novel legs to reach more readers in more communities by covering reasonable costs of travel (watch out, I could be sleeping on your couch soon!). Here's what the funds will go for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel expenses for in-person readings at libraries, community hubs, bookstores, synagogues, and colleges, plus writing workshops related to the novel throughout the country.</li>
<li>Connecting with book clubs and other reading communities across the country to offer video-conference visits at their convenience.</li>
<li>Sharing the book more widely through social media and printed materials.</li>
<li>Filming short videos and recording podcasts of sample readings, questions and answers about the book, and the mythical and contemporary dimensions of this story.</li>
</ul>
<p>My part is putting in lots of time and love, and also paying my way for a share of the travel expenses.</p>
<p>What you get, beyond of the satisfaction of helping a workaday writer fulfill one of her dreams, are signed copies of <i>Miriam's Well </i>for you and friends or family, baskets of books, in-person workshops and readings, and poems or even a song written just for you or a beloved.</p>

To this end, I'm aiming the tour as much as possible toward events where I can meet readers directly as well as readings in independent book stores, which I'm committed to support however I can.

<h3>A Young Adult Spiritual Fiction Thriller</h3>
<p>Read the first chapter at <a href=""http://www.watcherkey.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.watcherkey.com</a>!</p>
<p>In a world so polarized by good and evil emerges a new perspective on the fight for the soul of mankind from a spiritual perspective. In the book, readers are immersed in a fictional setting to walk alongside a young man who discovers that he is, in fact, a part of this hidden world where celestial beings war for control of both the land of Watchers and of Creation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498935747/e3j7vutxyolx4dtxqh0g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Through this rich fiction-fantasy novel, we hope to convey a message to young readers that they are indeed responsible for the outcomes of their choices. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498185710/rxxsyxzhkqqi4xbtad4v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Our Hope</strong></h3>
<p>We hope, above all, that our first book <i>The Watcher Key</i> will captivate readers with an exciting, thought provoking, and spiritually challenging message. Young adults resonate with exciting stories, and <i>The Watcher Key</i> is no exception.</p>
<h3>The Series</h3>
<ul><li>
<i>The Watcher Key</i> is the first of the series, about a boy who discovers Lior, a land created for the ancient celestial beings the Watchers and their descendants. Upon his arrival, Sam begins to realize the vital part he will play in the ultimate fate of mankind, and his fellow members who follow the light. The Darkness, however, is cunning and powerful, seducing both man and Descendant to evil, and many have fallen into its powerful grip. Charged with the ultimate task of saving Lior from destruction, Sam and his friends must find the Key that will lift the curse that has been placed over the land by one of the Fallen Watchers, Kachash, the lord of deception. Sam will discover many fantastical things on his adventure, some that will leave an everlasting impression on his life. <br/>Book Two is currently underway and will be the epic saga to continue the destiny in which Sam has now been intertwined, a calling that will lead him down a dark path of self-discovery, and another plot to destroy Lior and the Descendants. This time, however, the Dark One has arisen from his prison, and he has one thing on his mind. Find Sam Forrester.<br/>Book three, the epic conclusion to the series, will be an incredible heart-pounding adventure that will pinnacle with a celestial battle of both mortal and immortal. Stay tuned for book three in 2018!</li></ul>
<h3><strong>The Vision</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The vision for the Descendants of Light <i>The Watcher Key</i> is rather simple, to do what I love to do (write), and provide excellent spiritual fiction books for young adult readers. I and my team are dedicated to providing family-friendly literature that can be enjoyed by the entire family, free from poor influences that can draw young adults.</li>
<li>By buying <i>The Watcher Key</i>, you are helping us launch an incredible vision, to ultimately see an entire publishing company dedicated to providing awesome stories from many authors with positive values. We look to you, the reader, as our inspiration for accomplishing this. Without you and help from God, we could never reach this incredible goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this initial campaign, we are treating it like a book pre-order on steroids. Not only will you have the chance to reserve your very own copy of <i>The Watcher Key</i>, but you will also have the chance to sport some really cool Watcher Key gear to help us out! Your book pre-order is just the beginning! There will be custom hand-made ceramic mugs, t-shirts, glow-in-the-dark necklaces, and of course, bookmarks!</li>
<li>Our goal is to raise $3,000 for this first book, which will help us with the first printing run of <i>The Watcher Key</i>. From there, We plan a book tour to spread the word at book expos and festivals. We really believe this series is an incredible opportunity to provide compelling and spiritually uplifting fiction in an under-served market and with your help we can make it a reality!</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges are many with any great vision, but specifically with the launch of the first book <i>The Watcher Key</i>, the printing costs are truly daunting! You might ask ""Why not shop for a publisher instead of self-publishing?"" and we have asked that ourselves. Our thinking is that if we are able to own the rights fully to the series, as well as the publishing company itself, then we can accomplish the vision we believe has been given to us to help realize. Growing a company as well as publishing a book series is going to be long and arduous, but exciting as well! The daily grind of a business will surely be daunting and un-glamorous, but my creative passion for writing family-friendly fantasy stories will keep me motivated and focused.</p>
</div><div>

A Young Adult Spiritual Fiction Thriller
Read the first chapter at www.watcherkey.com!
In a world so polarized by good and evil emerges a new perspective on the fight for the soul of mankind from a spiritual perspective. In the book, readers are immersed in a fictional setting to walk alongside a young man who discovers that he is, in fact, a part of this hidden world where celestial beings war for control of both the land of Watchers and of Creation.

Through this rich fiction-fantasy novel, we hope to convey a message to young readers that they are indeed responsible for the outcomes of their choices. 

Our Hope
We hope, above all, that our first book The Watcher Key will captivate readers with an exciting, thought provoking, and spiritually challenging message. Young adults resonate with exciting stories, and The Watcher Key is no exception.
The Series

The Watcher Key is the first of the series, about a boy who discovers Lior, a land created for the ancient celestial beings the Watchers and their descendants. Upon his arrival, Sam begins to realize the vital part he will play in the ultimate fate of mankind, and his fellow members who follow the light. The Darkness, however, is cunning and powerful, seducing both man and Descendant to evil, and many have fallen into its powerful grip. Charged with the ultimate task of saving Lior from destruction, Sam and his friends must find the Key that will lift the curse that has been placed over the land by one of the Fallen Watchers, Kachash, the lord of deception. Sam will discover many fantastical things on his adventure, some that will leave an everlasting impression on his life. Book Two is currently underway and will be the epic saga to continue the destiny in which Sam has now been intertwined, a calling that will lead him down a dark path of self-discovery, and another plot to destroy Lior and the Descendants. This time, however, the Dark One has arisen from his prison, and he has one thing on his mind. Find Sam Forrester.Book three, the epic conclusion to the series, will be an incredible heart-pounding adventure that will pinnacle with a celestial battle of both mortal and immortal. Stay tuned for book three in 2018!
The Vision

The vision for the Descendants of Light The Watcher Key is rather simple, to do what I love to do (write), and provide excellent spiritual fiction books for young adult readers. I and my team are dedicated to providing family-friendly literature that can be enjoyed by the entire family, free from poor influences that can draw young adults.
By buying The Watcher Key, you are helping us launch an incredible vision, to ultimately see an entire publishing company dedicated to providing awesome stories from many authors with positive values. We look to you, the reader, as our inspiration for accomplishing this. Without you and help from God, we could never reach this incredible goal!


What We Need & What You Get

In this initial campaign, we are treating it like a book pre-order on steroids. Not only will you have the chance to reserve your very own copy of The Watcher Key, but you will also have the chance to sport some really cool Watcher Key gear to help us out! Your book pre-order is just the beginning! There will be custom hand-made ceramic mugs, t-shirts, glow-in-the-dark necklaces, and of course, bookmarks!
Our goal is to raise $3,000 for this first book, which will help us with the first printing run of The Watcher Key. From there, We plan a book tour to spread the word at book expos and festivals. We really believe this series is an incredible opportunity to provide compelling and spiritually uplifting fiction in an under-served market and with your help we can make it a reality!



Risks & Challenges
The challenges are many with any great vision, but specifically with the launch of the first book The Watcher Key, the printing costs are truly daunting! You might ask ""Why not shop for a publisher instead of self-publishing?"" and we have asked that ourselves. Our thinking is that if we are able to own the rights fully to the series, as well as the publishing company itself, then we can accomplish the vision we believe has been given to us to help realize. Growing a company as well as publishing a book series is going to be long and arduous, but exciting as well! The daily grind of a business will surely be daunting and un-glamorous, but my creative passion for writing family-friendly fantasy stories will keep me motivated and focused.

As a dinged-up veteran of L.A. and New York sales and pitches, I can tell you that having some chapters of a book published ahead of time and then, because of the response, having other chapters optioned for publication, gives us a real leg up when it comes to selling publication and production rights for the completed project. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>AND SPEAKING OF BUZZ</strong></p><p>You’ve seen the name OZY pop up here a few times.  OZY is an online news/feature site that focuses on news and original content and has pretty much taken the industry by storm.  They currently boast a monthly readership of some 25,000,000 folks (yep, really—25 million).  Their contributors include among others Bill Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Bill Clinton...and me.  No, I don’t hob nob with these folks, but I do read their stuff…don’t know if they read mine. </p><p>OZY has published a number of the completed chapters written for Tales From The Day and optioned more (and yes, they pay for them). </p><p>          <a href=""http://www.ozy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493247443/jgh8k3nnlaoofuspmlyj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> One of those published, The Day We Went Shark Fishing In Our Underwear, is as I write this at some 33,000 “shares” and climbing (“shares” are when readers pass along articles to colleagues and friends).  The piece has been, it seems, picking up about a thousand more shares every couple of days. </p><p>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493248850/g5ci5ppfignqp3pkltqc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A Senior Editor at OZY just informed me that this is a pretty big deal, as most articles are felt to have traction if they pick up a very few hundred shares, as in two or three hundred. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Updated 4/30/2017</p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493577599/u35btuyaw1ojx1ywat11.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Another of the pieces they published, The Day The Game Warden Died (after changing the name to Of Shotguns, Syphilis, and Sworn Enemies), is now edging up on a thousand shares. </p><p>This is a “hurray” of course, but is germane here because it clearly indicates that the subject matter, approach and writing style of Tales From The Day is current and resonates with a wide and eclectic audience.

And we can do so within the context of how people really behave, with all the craziness and courage which is usually involved.  Because together we can change the “write about how it was” genre to one of writing about how people act in human ways regardless of the times. Because you can be a part of creating something new, based on the old, into print and beyond. And because sometimes you should care…just because you should care.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;text-align: center;""><strong>SCHEDULE AND USE OF FUNDS</strong></p><p>As you know from this posting, we are hoping to raise at least 85K.  The majority of these funds will be used for marketing of the finished work, both for a major publishing deal and the offering out of production rights.  Assuming we are successful with fund raising, Tales From The Day (the book) should be all wrapped up in about six months or so, after which the full court marketing press will begin for at least another six months.  During the initial six months, as the book is being completed, I will continue to offer out completed vignettes for publication, plus amp up social media to keep the buzz going. Publication credits and buzz REALLY help when it comes to locking up book or production deals.  If we exceed the funding goal, it will just speed everything up. Don’t know about you, but I’m pretty much over delayed gratification.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></p><p>This may well be the best part for me actually, and hopefully for you as well. </p><p>As you can see from the perks, part of them involve your getting access to a special blog which will detail what we do to publish the book and sell related production rights.  If my time in LA../Hollywood taught me anything, it was that a lot of really good stuff never sees the light of day.

 And Others…IF YOU ARE STILL INTRIGUEDWith your help, there are two things I will accomplish with the funds raised here:  first is to really speed up the completion of Tales From The Day (the book) and get it out there.  The second is to shop the book and its contents with the TV and Movie suits on both coasts...and for that kind of thing, there's just no substitute for being there (yes, I do know how to use Skype).As you can see from the section below entitled “And Speaking Of Buzz,” some of the completed chapters written for Tales from The Day have been published.  We’ve gotten enthusiastic response and serious traction from this, with more publication of completed chapters optioned. As a dinged-up veteran of L.A. and New York sales and pitches, I can tell you that having some chapters of a book published ahead of time and then, because of the response, having other chapters optioned for publication, gives us a real leg up when it comes to selling publication and production rights for the completed project. AND SPEAKING OF BUZZYou’ve seen the name OZY pop up here a few times.  OZY is an online news/feature site that focuses on news and original content and has pretty much taken the industry by storm.  They currently boast a monthly readership of some 25,000,000 folks (yep, really—25 million).  Their contributors include among others Bill Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Bill Clinton...and me.  No, I don’t hob nob with these folks, but I do read their stuff…don’t know if they read mine. OZY has published a number of the completed chapters written for Tales From The Day and optioned more (and yes, they pay for them).            One of those published, The Day We Went Shark Fishing In Our Underwear, is as I write this at some 33,000 “shares” and climbing (“shares” are when readers pass along articles to colleagues and friends).  The piece has been, it seems, picking up about a thousand more shares every couple of days.         A Senior Editor at OZY just informed me that this is a pretty big deal, as most articles are felt to have traction if they pick up a very few hundred shares, as in two or three hundred. Updated 4/30/2017         Another of the pieces they published, The Day The Game Warden Died (after changing the name to Of Shotguns, Syphilis, and Sworn Enemies), is now edging up on a thousand shares. This is a “hurray” of course, but is germane here because it clearly indicates that the subject matter, approach and writing style of Tales From The Day is current and resonates with a wide and eclectic audience. All of this will give the project a leg up as together with you, we run for the prize: publication in book form and subsequent TV/movie production.   WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?Because together we can bring folks, events and social times that are gone back to life. And we can do so within the context of how people really behave, with all the craziness and courage which is usually involved.  Because together we can change the “write about how it was” genre to one of writing about how people act in human ways regardless of the times. Because you can be a part of creating something new, based on the old, into print and beyond. And because sometimes you should care…just because you should care.SCHEDULE AND USE OF FUNDSAs you know from this posting, we are hoping to raise at least 85K.  The majority of these funds will be used for marketing of the finished work, both for a major publishing deal and the offering out of production rights.  Assuming we are successful with fund raising, Tales From The Day (the book) should be all wrapped up in about six months or so, after which the full court marketing press will begin for at least another six months.  During the initial six months, as the book is being completed, I will continue to offer out completed vignettes for publication, plus amp up social media to keep the buzz going. Publication credits and buzz REALLY help when it comes to locking up book or production deals.  If we exceed the funding goal, it will just speed everything up. Don’t know about you, but I’m pretty much over delayed gratification.WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?This may well be the best part for me actually, and hopefully for you as well. As you can see from the perks, part of them involve your getting access to a special blog which will detail what we do to publish the book and sell related production rights.  If my time in LA../Hollywood taught me anything, it was that a lot of really good stuff never sees the light of day. This was almost always due to the creators being either really bad at deal making or not knowing what to do or how to go about selling/producing their creative work, which is pretty much all I did for a number of years.As a perk for getting involved with this project, you’ll see this process unroll from start to finish, in detail.  One perk involves us actually having a face to face (lunch or skype) to discuss what you’ve got going and how to get it out there…or anything else you might want to kick around.I’m not allowed to offer you a slice of earnings.  A signed copy of the first run of the book for contributors of course, plus t shirts…but that’s just a big whoop unless the book gets legs or is visually produced in some way.  Truly, I think the real “perk” value here for you is getting a detailed  insight into this whole process.   Some contributors will get a first look at all new vignettes as they are completed, plus a ringside seat as tales from the day gets marketed, published and beyond. I very much hope that getting detailed insight into this process will help some of you who want to do the same thing with your own work.But mostly what’s in it for all of us is a hell of a ride and a big ration of fun.  And at the end isn’t that the dreamed-of essence for our endeavors?Contact me any time:Wayne D.
