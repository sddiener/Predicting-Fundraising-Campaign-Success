<h3>Creating a communal performance space</h3>
<p>It's incredible to think Gaza has been under blockade for almost a decade. We can't go there; they can't come here. So we're creating a place where people can meet - a communal, virtual performance space. </p>
<p>Using a mix of live-streaming and recorded video, artists occupy each other’s homes, streets and other social spaces to share their everyday lives. At times they even dissolve into each other or become ghostly protagonists in the drama.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the London International Festival of Theatre gave Station House Opera a two-week residency to work with a group of artists in London and Gaza, followed by a public sharing on 17 January at Watermans Art Centre in London and Al Meshal Theatre in Gaza City.</p>
<p>Having established a brilliant team and tested the technology, now we're developing the work into a full production for 2017/18 - with a month-long workshop and rehearsal period from 17 October to 13 November this autumn.</p>
<p>During the workshop twenty artists from a variety of disciplines - including theatre, film, visual arts and photography - will focus on developing their stories and interactions into final material for the full production in Gaza and London.</p>
<p><i>At Home in Gaza and London</i> is all about artistic collaboration. It brings together performers and audiences in utterly different situations to share a common enterprise. Which is where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need </h3>
<p>We're thrilled to be working with such a vibrant community of artists on this ground-breaking project. But we need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p>We need to raise funds now, or the four-week workshop in October won't go ahead.</p>
<p>When you contribute you'll not only give artists in Gaza the chance to work with their contemporaries abroad, you'll also make sure they get the international attention they deserve.</p>
<p>Every donation we receive will go directly to developing the <i>At Home in Gaza and London</i> project into a full production.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards covering the cost of renting space for the workshops and public sharings in London and Gaza, ensuring we've got the equipment we need, and paying all the artists.</p>
<p>There are some excellent perks too, from free tickets and a sumptuous Palestinian meal, to meeting the artists and a virtual tour of Gaza.</p>
<p>You can also help by spreading the word and making some noise about our crowd funding campaign.</p>
<p>And we'd love you to join us for our public sharings!</p>

<h3>What others have to say</h3>
<p><strong>Actress Miriam Margolyes:</strong> “I totally support this exciting project. My only visit to Gaza was 25 years ago. I shall never forget it and when I see the video of the Station House Opera performance I realise how vital the contribution of the Arts is, in bringing people together and a sense of hope back to a place blighted by Israeli intransigence. May it flourish and prosper; I welcome such innovation, using live performance &amp; digital invention to transform our world.”</p>
<p><strong>Producer Brian Eno:</strong> ""After the most recent destruction in Gaza, in 2014, the nations of the world got together and decided to DO SOMETHING. Between them they pledged €5billion to rebuild Gaza. And then they all got on planes and went home - and, mostly, forgot to send the money. As a result, Gaza is still a massive bomb site, with families living among piles of broken concrete, damaged hospitals functioning as best they can, and no prospect of anything like a normal existence for the 2 million people trapped there. We can’t let this continue…and, if we start understanding what is really happening there, through creative projects like <i>At Home in Gaza and London</i>, we won’t let it continue.""</p>
<p><strong>Filmmaker Leila Sansour: </strong>""This is a truly inspiring project which celebrates the power of art to break barriers. Not unlike the tunnels of Gaza, this work is a virtual highway that provides a link to a creative community in a city that has been shut away from the world. What an ingenius way for artists in Gaza to work with their contemporaries abroad and to have access to international audiences.”</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings from the Adivasi Arts Trust!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support for the short film   short film 'How We Got Fire'.  The story   is an adaptation from the oral narrative traditions of the Andamanese people, and it will be included in a  series of short films  currently in development.</p>
<p>I am Tara Douglas,  Secretary of the Trust and a Trustee of the Trust for Tribal Art Culture and Knowledge.    I completed a Professional Doctorate in Digital Media in 2015 at Bournemouth University  for my research titled 'Tales of the Tribes: Animation as a Tool for Indigenous Representation'.   It brought extensive practical experience  of  animation film-making  and  coordinating projects with indigenous, tribal and Adivasi young people to translate their stories for the medium of animated film,  and in 2017 the Adivasi Arts Trust received the ENGO award for promotion of culture.  My research  is based in India, and we  have now produced two series of animated films and a full length documentary film for national broadcast in India.  </p>
<p>The  research  highlights the dilemmas that are faced by the diverse tribal communities of India:  these people are socially and economically marginalized and their art, culture  and stories remain widely unknown and unrecognised by society.  The most extreme case would be that of the peoples of the Andaman Islands: there are very  few survivors, and their fragile languages and cultures  are immanently threatened.      Prior to this pandemic and lockdown, I had initiated  processes to contact local people for their involvement in the project:  the region is a sensitive area,  these communities are classified as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups and  special permission for research is required from the Tribal Welfare Department. </p>
<p>I plan to visit Port Blair and to coordinate with the  Department and the Anthropological Survey of India to organise a series of storytelling workshops so that we can invite participation from local people in the project.  In this setting, the objective is also to  arrange for them to create some artwork and animated sequences for the film. I  also plan for  young digital media professionals and students of animation in India to assist  the production of the  short film,  and  hope to translate and dub it into the local Andamanese language, as well as into English and Hindi.</p>
<p>This will be the first initiative to study the narrative traditions of the region using the medium of animated film.  The media project aims to broaden awareness, interest and understanding of the  indigenous values by  highlighting the  intrinsic reciprocity in relationships of  interdependence with the natural and supernatural worlds  upheld by these small communities.   It is important, timely and appropriate  to celebrates the knowledge, culture and artistic practices of these unrepresented peoples,  and to become aware of the unprecidented impact on traditional  ways of life that has taken place  in tandem with the accelerated destruction of the natural environment.    It is hoped that the project will also encourage the few  remaining Andamanese people by the appreciation that is shown towards their culture,  and   the empowerment through their participation.</p>
<p>The film-making activity must be carried forward with great sensitivity and as the project coordinator, I will be seeking sustained  contact with members of the community throughout the process.  The  film of 8 minutes duration will explore the use of mixed media techniques:  handmade artwork that can  be created with local inputs to enhance a visual aethetic would be appropriate to the content of the narrative,  and digital technology  embeds a high standard of production and post-production so that the film can be viewed by audiences locally, nationally and internationally at festivals and institutions of culture and education.  </p>
<p>The avenues that have been explored to support  this work are currently unavailable.  Therefore your contributions are vital to sustaining the project to its completion.  This campaign is a continuation of the work. We are very grateful for your support and hope that you will continue to help us to bring the project to completion.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Approximately 10,000 images must be designed and recorded for this short film, demanding  sustained commitment from the team.  It is anticipated that the production will one year to complete:  the challenges of engaging with members of the community to make this work as a  participatory media project are immense. </p>
<p>This  estimated financial requirement  for this project is  ₤5000 Stirling (UK).  The earlier campaign achieved some of the target funding, which has taken the project forward, as you will see in the video for this campaign.    This campaign is an update on the project, and the funding requested is for:<br/><br/>1) Field research to coordinate a series of workshops and engage local participants including domestic travel and fees to interpreters and translators.  </p>
<p>2) Technical costs for equipment (hard drives, back up, internet, audio recording, editing, mastering).</p>
<p>3) Stipends for the artists engagement in the work.</p>
<p>4) Communication costs for maintaining contact with academic institutions, stakeholders and consultants.</p>
<p>5) Dissemination  to stakeholders, supporters and viewers.</p>
<p>This is a non-commercial production that  represents good value for money.  As the project is based in India,  the costs are required for domestic travel, which is key to achieving the goal of collaboration with local people.  My prior experience is the foundation to  adjust  to diverse circumstances, the capacity for improvisation and the  measured use of our available resources.   If, for any reason the film cannot be completed, the funds raised will contribute to the parent project, The Stories of Our Ancestors (towards workshops for tribal participants, planned at the North Eastern Hill University in Shillong, Meghalaya)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This  media project is an earnest attempt at  contributing to the  dialogue about the historical and contemporary culture of the  Andamanese peoples:  to date,  little is known about them; their traditional way of life is rapidly vanishing and, suspended as they are  between the arguments for isolation and assimilation, their own indigenous cultural traditions and languages remain mysterious, undervalued and unrepresented.  By your support, you will become  part of a story that promotes the values of sustainable living and protection of nature which are at the foundation of these cultures. Your contribution will help to  document and share indigenous knowledge,  and you will be enchanted by storytelling of a completely original style.</p>
<p>Our previous media projects have reached audiences   across India, the UK and further afield, through  screening tours, workshops, seminars, conferences, at cultural events and festivals, and my existing links with institutions, government and non-goverment organisations will be key for  achieving the delivery of this project and its dissemination.  The short film, 'How We Got Fire' will be included in the 'Stories of Our Ancestors' project  with associates in North East India, which will further promote its proliferation as cultural and educational material.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My  commitment and prior experience in this field of research is the  pathway to address the risks and challenges to the project.  It is expected that visitors will once again be permitted to travel to the Andaman Islands when the temporary  closure has been lifted to the region. Permission has been applied for  research with the Andamanese and Ongee tribal groups residing in restricted areas.  In any case, it would be feasible to organise  workshops  in Port Blair with  local government assistance.</p>
<p>I maintain strong links with indigenous communities in North East India and it is viable to base the production at the North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU) in Shillong, where I am associated as a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Anthropology, in the event that I am  unable to carry out this work at the field research site.   Workshops for tribal participants and students can be organised at NEHU to develop the films and students of media and animation would  then be invited to lead the media production.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about this unique cultural project by sharing this Indigogo campaign with your friends.</p>

Of course, to make some really cool things may take a long time. I like to work for clients and be compensated accordingly. But not all of my works are commissioned.

It has become the beginning of art series. Since that time, the collection was expanded by few more digital artworks made in the same style. Some friends of mine said that it might be a good art project named perhaps “Fisherman’s Eye Catchers”. Indeed, why not? Images might be published as stickers and posters. Another option is a wall calendar. Game fishers or marine life lovers may appreciate it. This set could attract private collectors, or liven up the interior of a fisherman’s club or a seafood restaurant.</p><p>Here is an example of how the posters look like:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476397302/k3cupddfiew3yiqv0lea.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I’m going to create ten more images to make a set of 15 game fishes.

<h3>The Workflow</h3>
<p>The process of creating a digital artwork is divided in several stages from the very first sketch to the final detail. It takes 3 to 4 weeks per image. Here is an example of the workflow process:</p>

</div>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>To launch this project, I decided to start a crowdfunding campaign. I need to find enough funds to be able to concentrate on this project full-time. To complete it will require several months, maybe a year. By supporting my campaign, you will show you recognize the value of this project and help me bring my art to other interested people. Basically, you become my patrons.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funds to complete the project. And you should and will be compensated. As soon as the project is complete, all artworks can be printed in a set, such as a wall calendar. There is always a risk. But, certain artwork is already done and I can have it printed for you through a print service. I certainly hope the campaign will be successful and I’ll get a chance to complete a whole set of pictures.</p>

</div></div>","Short IntroductionHi there!My name is Artyom Yefimov, aka artefy. I’m a freelance digital artist and illustrator. You can see some of my projects in my portfolio at www.behance.net/artefy or visit my personal page at artefy.name.I always do a perfect job. Of course, to make some really cool things may take a long time. I like to work for clients and be compensated accordingly. But not all of my works are commissioned. Sometimes, I create images just for fun, as a self-expression.The ProjectAbout seven years ago, I made a photorealistic vector illustration of jumping rainbow trout. It has become the beginning of art series. Since that time, the collection was expanded by few more digital artworks made in the same style. Some friends of mine said that it might be a good art project named perhaps “Fisherman’s Eye Catchers”. Indeed, why not? Images might be published as stickers and posters. Another option is a wall calendar. Game fishers or marine life lovers may appreciate it. This set could attract private collectors, or liven up the interior of a fisherman’s club or a seafood restaurant.Here is an example of how the posters look like:I’m going to create ten more images to make a set of 15 game fishes. Here is the list of species to be included in the set:

Largemouth Bass (done)
Blue Marlin (done)
Sailfish (done)
Rainbow Trout (done)
Atlantic Cod (done)
Yellowfin Tuna
Tarpon
Mako Shark
Mahi Mahi
Bluefin Trevally

<h3>WHY FUND #toilettour ?</h3>
<p>In a world where human beings expose themselves constantly through the lens of social media, where do we allow ourselves to be vulnerable? The answer is TOILETS.  Toilets are our last private space. In this body of work, artist and @toilettourinternational creator, Kelly Moore, seeks what it is to be vulnerable.  How will it affect human nature when our private space becomes public domain? ART and ART ALONE can answer these questions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise initially $2000 which will cover airfare and accommodations for the Norway leg of Toilet Tour.  We are starting in Norway because, apparently, it's the happiest country on Earth.  Is it because of their toilets? We will find out!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of 3rd year Film and Television students at Falmouth University who aim to create a documentary that shines a light on rehabilitation in UK prisons.</li>
<li>For our final year project we aim to make an insightful documentary that focuses on the UK prison system and the remarkable art and writing created within.</li>
<li>By supporting our campaign you will be part of a inspiring and eye opening piece of filmmaking which we hope will project us into the industry after our graduation. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to cover our transport costs. Driving to anywhere from Cornwall is far and expensive.  We've already filmed in London which cost £120 and plan to make more trips to prison art exhibitions in Birmingham which will cost roughly the same.</li>
<li>Music license fees are also expensive! We aim to use the song Human by Rag'n'Bone Man.  </li>
<li>Other costs are for catering, accommodation, merchandise and archive footage. </li>

<li>This project shows an artistic perspective on people in prison and ex-convicts.</li>
<li> In other parts of the world, people who are sent to prison are worked with intensely to help them to reform so they are able to re-enter society as a productive member.</li>
<li>In the UK, our prisons are overcrowded and understaffed. They also lack the funding to make them safe places for rehabilitation. The ideal situation would be a programme, such as ones run by the  Koestler Trust, that give prisoners time and space to work at a craft such as art or writing. They need the structure and opportunity to grow as a person.</li>
<li>We've been inspired by the Koestler Trust and the Prison Reform Trust as they work in different ways to promote the writing and arts of prisoners. They have given us insight into their aims and explained how they work to help those in prison. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our main challenge is to gain access to people in prison who have been helped by art and writing. To gain access would be amazing for our proposed film. However, after the recent unrest, reported in the media, it will be almost impossible to gain access to make a student film.</li>

Poetry by Los Alamos born poet Allison Cobb enriches the performance further.Yuki’s vision is simple and profound: bring Suspended Moment to the most important nuclear sites around the world:  Hanford Washington, where the materials for the bomb dropped on Nagasaki were created. Los Alamos, where the bombs were built. Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Fukushima. Adelaide, South Australia, a site for hundreds of nuclear tests. At each site, in addition to the installation, the artists will engage with local communities through a Butoh workshop and performance, bringing an even more personal aspect to those participants. Initial funding of $8,500 will bring us to Hanford and Los Alamos.By allowing viewers to personally connect with our dark nuclear past, we hope to prevent these events from repeating in the future.SUSPENDED MOMENT IS BEING SPONSORED BY THE NEW YORK FOUNDATION OF ARTS  An excerpt from Hatch the Future Podcast: Reflecting on a Nuclear Legacy.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><i>Students from Coventry University are looking to find funds from the generous public by asking for your kind help and support. </i></p>
<p><i>The funding received would help us cover the cost of hiring a venue within London (the most accessible city of England). Sufficient funding will also help pay for the online magazine that will cover a vast range of artists’ work as well as uncovering articles glorifying certain types of art forms as opposed to other types. </i></p>
<p><i>The students have worked hard to brand their group name as ‘Verve’ to signify exactly what the word means- ‘vigour’, ‘enthusiasm’ and ‘spirit’. Each of these qualities are personal traits within the members as we are passionate about expressive art and ideas presented in the form of art. We accept that art is subjective therefore the artwork will also be subjective to each individual when producing. No matter what the ideas, the art pieces are not judged and not disparaged.</i></p>
<p><i>We aim to hold an exhibition to the maximum capacity of artist allowed, so that we include everyone and abandon no one. The magazine however will be published online, therefore all virtual pieces will be categorically be published, however physical such as immersive art will be prioritised to the exhibition. </i></p>
<p><i>Three years of studying Media Production and one year abroad in Europe has shown us the importance of loving all forms of art as expressing yourself is what makes up an individual. In a city where diversity is promoted, this campaign is the perfect way of uniting all artists who are passionate about expressing themselves in a creative artistic way. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get </strong></p>
<p><i>In a nutshell, we are students, hiring out a space in London. For those that don’t understand what that means, it means that we have no secondary source of income or funds since we are in full time education we do not have the time to organise a public event as well as hold down a job. The prices in London are extortionately high but we have taken the executive decision to have it in London as it promotes a bigger better image along with promoting higher public participation. We WANT this.<br/>That is what the whole project is all about. We want the public to get involved. Art is an expression that comes in several different shapes and forms that  can make you think as well as make you feel. We want you to immerse yourself around this art so that you are able to see how important art can be to a person and how it can really define and inspire you.</i></p>
<p><i>The budget will be broken down by splitting the money 75/25. The majority of the budget will be directed towards the exhibition since the physical resources we will use are greater compared to the ones online, however this is not to say that online materials will not be costing. Promotion online for example is essential to get the word of mouth around. I mean that’s why how you found this page ultimately right? Materials such as buying an annual domain name, buying high quality magazine software subscription will be needed in order to fund the magazine side of the project. The rest of the money we are trying to raise will try to cover the costs of venue hire, photo printing, décor and creating our branding online. We are hoping to host the exhibition in London, because this is the most touristic and artistic place in England; but not only that-London is known world-wide! It would be great to have such an audience able to reach our exhibition in a convenient location for us all. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Don’t worry if we don’t receive the full funds; we still greatly appreciate everything that we receive. Even if we do not receive the full amount we need, we know that we must fund ourselves through our own pocket. The problem however is that our pockets are limited; we cannot afford to put the whole amount into the event and magazine as we do not have any funds available to us. There are no grant schemes available either therefore every donation is accepted-small or big. </i></p>
<p><i>Perks- whether small or big, we will grant you a mention on our online magazine that we will publish soon after the exhibition has been conducted. The page will consist of your name and  a title as a sponsor towards our project. </i></p>
<p><strong><i>Please let it be noted that these perks are not compulsory and you may wish to only donate rather than have a mention. </i></strong><br/><strong><i>Please also note that contributing anonymously will mean that your name will not be mentioned but will be categorised under the ‘anonymous’ categories along with our other anonymous donors. </i></strong></p>
<p><i>Even if we are not able to raise the whole £800, you can still help by spreading the word and coming down to the exhibition to come and see and get inspired by the works of everyone involved. It is all about public participation and looking at the work and the words of the artists to make you feel something.</i></p>
<p><i>Your support (in any form) is what will make this possible. Every donation is welcome and even if you are not able to support us monetary-wise, word of mouth about the event will help us just the same. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p><i>Neither of us have done anything like this before and to do this a final project of our degree is incredibly risky but we feel as though the benefits outweigh the risks. By doing this, we are pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and learning new skills every step of the way. These skills will be easily transferable outside of this project. We will also be proving not only our lecturers, tutors and peers, but anyone that has the fear of curating their own project as they are not ready that with the right determination and passion, we can do it because everyone needs to start somewhere. This experience is almost in a way our first form of working freelance as no guidance has been given to us, expect that of verbal advice. (Although, in all honesty, even experienced advice will be welcomed and appreciated by us!)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p><i>We are welcoming submissions for your <strong>expressive </strong>art pieces from now until 26<sup>th</sup> March 2017 with hopes of showcasing the pieces by the end of April/early May. </i></p>
<p><i>This page will be updated regularly but be sure to check us out on Facebook - @verveartists  where we post regular updates on our progress. Follow and like us, and don’t forget to donate and share. You know that if you were in our position or your best friend or family was in our position, you would appreciate the support so why not do the same now?<br/><br/>By giving a simple £2 per person means we can share the load and half the contributors so we can reach our target and stretch our budget the best we can. So come on, helping a friend in need is a friend indeed...So be our friend! We’ve only got 3 weeks to raise money. That’s 18 days! Help us please!</i></p>
<p><i>We look forward to hearing from you and we thank you in advance for your support!</i></p>
<p><i>Kind Regards,</i></p>

The rest of the money we are trying to raise will try to cover the costs of venue hire, photo printing, décor and creating our branding online. We are hoping to host the exhibition in London, because this is the most touristic and artistic place in England; but not only that-London is known world-wide! It would be great to have such an audience able to reach our exhibition in a convenient location for us all. 
 
Don’t worry if we don’t receive the full funds; we still greatly appreciate everything that we receive. Even if we do not receive the full amount we need, we know that we must fund ourselves through our own pocket. The problem however is that our pockets are limited; we cannot afford to put the whole amount into the event and magazine as we do not have any funds available to us. There are no grant schemes available either therefore every donation is accepted-small or big. 
Perks- whether small or big, we will grant you a mention on our online magazine that we will publish soon after the exhibition has been conducted. The page will consist of your name and  a title as a sponsor towards our project. 
Please let it be noted that these perks are not compulsory and you may wish to only donate rather than have a mention. Please also note that contributing anonymously will mean that your name will not be mentioned but will be categorised under the ‘anonymous’ categories along with our other anonymous donors. 
Even if we are not able to raise the whole £800, you can still help by spreading the word and coming down to the exhibition to come and see and get inspired by the works of everyone involved. It is all about public participation and looking at the work and the words of the artists to make you feel something.
Your support (in any form) is what will make this possible. Every donation is welcome and even if you are not able to support us monetary-wise, word of mouth about the event will help us just the same. 
 
Risks & Challenges
Neither of us have done anything like this before and to do this a final project of our degree is incredibly risky but we feel as though the benefits outweigh the risks. By doing this, we are pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones and learning new skills every step of the way. These skills will be easily transferable outside of this project. We will also be proving not only our lecturers, tutors and peers, but anyone that has the fear of curating their own project as they are not ready that with the right determination and passion, we can do it because everyone needs to start somewhere. This experience is almost in a way our first form of working freelance as no guidance has been given to us, expect that of verbal advice. (Although, in all honesty, even experienced advice will be welcomed and appreciated by us!)
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We are welcoming submissions for your expressive art pieces from now until 26th March 2017 with hopes of showcasing the pieces by the end of April/early May. 
This page will be updated regularly but be sure to check us out on Facebook - @verveartists  where we post regular updates on our progress. Follow and like us, and don’t forget to donate and share. You know that if you were in our position or your best friend or family was in our position, you would appreciate the support so why not do the same now?By giving a simple £2 per person means we can share the load and half the contributors so we can reach our target and stretch our budget the best we can. So come on, helping a friend in need is a friend indeed...So be our friend! We’ve only got 3 weeks to raise money. That’s 18 days! Help us please!
We look forward to hearing from you and we thank you in advance for your support!

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Inspiring the world through painting has been our mission since we began<strong> <a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apple Pie Painting</a></strong>, 3 short years ago. What began as a simple idea to bring mobile painting parties to people across Kansas City, has evolved into countless memories, laughter, and creativity, with over 15,000 happy customers. We now set forth on our greatest journey yet, and one that will expand our vision across the globe. With this launch of our new and exciting <a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>In-Home Painting Party Kits</strong></a>, we can now extend the smiles, laughter, and confidence to everyone, as we have done right here in our own community. With your support, you can provide us with the fuel that will further ignite our fire and passion, as we inspire creativity on a global scale.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>                                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510558170/o9bctiepujuvtimq7fjv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It was shortly after our first year of business, having launched our mobile painting party concept in our hometown of Kansas City, that we began to see the initial success of the concept take hold. We were truly seeing the amount of lives we were touching. That's when April and I asked ourselves, after seeing this, <strong><i>“What kind of impact could we have, if given the opportunity to inspire people everywhere, and take our painting party concept to a much larger scale”?</i></strong> For us, this was our <i><strong>“Ah Ha!”</strong></i> moment, and when our greater vision became all too clear. With that vision, we are now on our way to becoming <strong><a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">America’s #1 mobile painting party experience</a>,</strong> and are ready to create an even more intimate and inspiring, one-of a-kind creative activity, brought direct to you, in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It was also around this time that we received a package in the mail from a foundation in Oregon, called <strong><a href=""http://dreamingzebra.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Dreaming Zebra</a>,</strong> that we had begun shipping our used art supplies and brushes to a few months earlier. What we found when we opened that package had both of us in tears of gratitude and joy. Inside this package was a tiny little canvas, with our original company logo painted on it. In addition, there was a card addressed to April and I, from a group of young children in Africa, that had written to us, to say how grateful they were to have received the donation of brushes, and how happy they felt, now having the ability to paint and create art.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>                                                <a href=""http://dreamingzebra.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510554489/ranplxqa0nglff7q4baa.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To date, this has been our proudest moment, having never realized that such a small effort, in donating used paint brushes could mean so much to someone. For the children that receive our brushes, it could mean the difference between living their dreams, versus never having realized them at all; and that’s one of the greatest things about art. It has the ability to inspire us all, in addition, it can even be the escape for some, of the harsh and horrible realities of life; having known first hand from friends, how art has saved them from a life of drugs, physical/sexual abuse, and even death. As we continued to work with <strong><a href=""http://dreamingzebra.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Dreaming Zebra Foundation</a></strong>, we realized the important impact our company was providing, and the significant role we played, in the lives of children across the world. Your support, and funds for our campaign will allow us to do just that!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now, after much planning and hard work, we are finally ready to launch our newest product line of<a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/pages/diy-painting-kits"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>in-home painting kits called </strong></a><strong><a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/pages/diy-painting-kits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1 Million Brushes</a>.</strong> Our painting kits are designed for people of all ages and abilities, as our kits allow for this painting party experience to be shipped directly to the customer’s door, for everyone to enjoy. You can now create your very own masterpiece in the comfort of your own home, with friends, family, or even by yourself. Our kits can be ordered to include an instructional DVD, or just a downloadable link, and are shipped direct to you, for an amazing experience! </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">With this initial launch, we are offering 5 different HD videos that walk you or your entire group, step by step through the fun and entertaining recreation of the painting; just as you would experience at one of our mobile painting parties. In addition to the joy you’ll have in seeing your creativity come to life, you can also feel a sense of pride knowing that while you’re painting your masterpiece, a child somewhere, is also sharing in the same joy, with the help of the brushes we will donate from each kit purchase or donation received. April and I are fortunate and blessed to have found a way of giving back through our<strong> <a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/pages/diy-painting-kits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1 Million Brushes Campaign</a></strong>, and to also have the opportunity to help inspire the world!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The initial goal of our campaign is to <strong>raise a minimum of $35,000</strong>. This amount will allow us to add at least 12 additional videos to our current offering, in addition to helping us streamline our processes, expand production capabilities, and lower our costs, as we create a more affordable product, that will in turn, be available to everyone across the worldwide. With your generous and heartfelt contributions, you will allow us the opportunity to further inspire people around the world through the power of art.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The following 7 items below outline our current financial needs in order to bring our painting kits to market on an accelerated schedule. With your valued donations, we can execute our plan accordingly, and make <a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/pages/diy-painting-kits"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>#1MillionBrushes</strong></a> a reality!</p> <ol>
<li>The production of <strong>12 new instructional painting videos</strong>, with the next 6 launching in February of 2018.</li>
<li>We will determine our options on adding the ability for <strong>multiple languages</strong> on all of our videos, in order to reach new markets around the world, as we expand our inspiration further.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lowering our costs</strong> of supplies is a must! We are already in negotiations with multiple manufacturers and supplies that can offer us significant savings, and with better quality products. However in order to achieve this, we must begin order in bulk of at least (1000+ at a time).</li>
<li>
<strong>Hiring staff</strong> that is dedicated to our vision, passion, and dream, will be a necessity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Upgraded facilities</strong> will be needed, as we are quickly running out of space in our current location. The need for a warehouse to assemble and fulfill orders, in addition to housing inventory, as well as offices for our corporate staff will be a must as we grow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expanding and upgrading our current e-commerce platform</strong> will be necessary, in order to be capable of handling our increasing kit orders, and monthly subscription packages, in addition to our eventual line of merchandise.</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">
<strong>Marketing our vision on a national and global scale</strong> will require a much larger budget than we currently using in our local market. If we plan to keep up with the ever changing global marketplace, and our competition, we will need to increase our budget, in addition to adding a valuable customer loyalty and rewards program.</li>

<p>By supporting our campaign, and believing in our vision, your donations will allow us to impact the world on a level that April and I had once only dreamed. The <strong><a href=""https://www.applepiepainting.com/pages/diy-painting-kits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#1MillionBrushes</a></strong> campaign, with your support, helps us to create a fun and entertaining product that we believe is truly capable of inspiring people around the world, while making a significant social impact, and an inspirational footprint that could eventually inspire the next Van Gogh, or Picasso, or perhaps the next <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elon Musk</a></strong> or Steve Jobs.</p> <p>The ability to explore one’s creativity is the driving force of innovation, and our painting kits, can be that catalyst for the next generation of great innovators and dreamers! (Link to a blog about the benefits of art)</p> <p>Believe us when we say we will make this vision a reality. If you’re skeptical, and wondering how we will achieve these goals, then allow us to answer any questions you may have, as April and I have been proving ourselves time and time again, since first creating our business. I can assure you that when it comes to achieving our goals, we are those people that you do not want to tell us, “It can’t be done”. As Steve Jobs once said,<strong><i> “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do”!</i></strong> Our background and accomplishments with Apple Pie Painting are numerous, being that we have only been in business for 3 years. Please allow us to provide credibility as to our resolve, and to our track record of reaching our goals and achieving success.</p> <p>Having launched our company, in the fall of 2014, we started with little more than a dream and our determination. While living in a 2 bedroom apartment, with 2 young children, and only enough painting supplies to handle 1 painting party of no more than 20 painters at once, we have come quite a long way since then. We even produced our first few prototype painting videos in our dining room, which also served as our warehouse, and our recording studio. With the help of a couple white sheets stapled to the wall, serving as the backdrop, and a few $5 can lights from the local hardware store, we began our journey.</p> <p>3 years later, we can only look back and appreciate our humble beginnings. With a bootstraped budget, and everyone telling us we couldn’t do what we said we would do, we can now laugh a little at ourselves, where we started from, and all the fun we’ve had to this point on our journey. From the countless tears, a lot of wins, and plenty of setbacks along the way, as most entrepreneurs know, April and I have persevered. Having never given up on our relentless desire to see our dreams become a reality. With now over 15,000 satisfied and inspired customers, we are doing what most said could not be done.</p> <p>While we are making a huge impact in our region, and our business is growing, we realize that we could never take the dream of 1 Million Brushes to the levels we have always dreamed of with the current revenues we have. Even with our recent success, it takes more than a couple thousand dollars to make this become a reality. We’ve realized that the only way we can create this vision of 1 Million Brushes is with a substantial upfront investment, in order to take the market by storm!</p> <p>With that being said, please allow us to prove to you that we are the right people for this job, as we reveal our list of our accomplishments and successes that we’ve achieved. We take great pride in each of them, but are also humbled in knowing,  that if we ever let our guard down, there will always be someone right behind us, ready to take it all away. We live by the words of <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/mcuban?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark Cuban</a>,</strong> <i><strong>“Work like there is someone working 24 hours a day to take it away from you.”</strong></i></p> <p>Being a local, home grown company, our achievements and accolades help us to validate that what we are doing is right, and that what we provide to our customers is valuable. In a market surrounded by national competitors, and a lot of marketing dollars, always trying to take us down, we have pushed forward to become the best painting party company in all of Kansas City, and the largest one of it’s kind in the entire Midwest. With over 14,000 followers on social media, we have quickly become the most popular mobile painting party experience in America!</p>

</div></div>","Inspiring the world through painting has been our mission since we began Apple Pie Painting, 3 short years ago. What began as a simple idea to bring mobile painting parties to people across Kansas City, has evolved into countless memories, laughter, and creativity, with over 15,000 happy customers. We now set forth on our greatest journey yet, and one that will expand our vision across the globe. With this launch of our new and exciting In-Home Painting Party Kits, we can now extend the smiles, laughter, and confidence to everyone, as we have done right here in our own community. With your support, you can provide us with the fuel that will further ignite our fire and passion, as we inspire creativity on a global scale.
 
                                                   
 
It was shortly after our first year of business, having launched our mobile painting party concept in our hometown of Kansas City, that we began to see the initial success of the concept take hold. We were truly seeing the amount of lives we were touching. That's when April and I asked ourselves, after seeing this, “What kind of impact could we have, if given the opportunity to inspire people everywhere, and take our painting party concept to a much larger scale”? For us, this was our “Ah Ha!” moment, and when our greater vision became all too clear. With that vision, we are now on our way to becoming America’s #1 mobile painting party experience, and are ready to create an even more intimate and inspiring, one-of a-kind creative activity, brought direct to you, in the comfort of your own home.
 
It was also around this time that we received a package in the mail from a foundation in Oregon, called The Dreaming Zebra, that we had begun shipping our used art supplies and brushes to a few months earlier. What we found when we opened that package had both of us in tears of gratitude and joy. Inside this package was a tiny little canvas, with our original company logo painted on it. In addition, there was a card addressed to April and I, from a group of young children in Africa, that had written to us, to say how grateful they were to have received the donation of brushes, and how happy they felt, now having the ability to paint and create art.
 
                                                
 
To date, this has been our proudest moment, having never realized that such a small effort, in donating used paint brushes could mean so much to someone. For the children that receive our brushes, it could mean the difference between living their dreams, versus never having realized them at all; and that’s one of the greatest things about art. It has the ability to inspire us all, in addition, it can even be the escape for some, of the harsh and horrible realities of life; having known first hand from friends, how art has saved them from a life of drugs, physical/sexual abuse, and even death. As we continued to work with The Dreaming Zebra Foundation, we realized the important impact our company was providing, and the significant role we played, in the lives of children across the world. Your support, and funds for our campaign will allow us to do just that!
 
Now, after much planning and hard work, we are finally ready to launch our newest product line of in-home painting kits called 1 Million Brushes. Our painting kits are designed for people of all ages and abilities, as our kits allow for this painting party experience to be shipped directly to the customer’s door, for everyone to enjoy. You can now create your very own masterpiece in the comfort of your own home, with friends, family, or even by yourself. Our kits can be ordered to include an instructional DVD, or just a downloadable link, and are shipped direct to you, for an amazing experience! 
Our First 6 Painting Options To Choose From


 
Your can order your full kit as a ""Deluxe Kit"" including a table top easel and apron, or the ""Classic Kit"" with everything you need to create a masterpiece! 
 

With this initial launch, we are offering 5 different HD videos that walk you or your entire group, step by step through the fun and entertaining recreation of the painting; just as you would experience at one of our mobile painting parties. In addition to the joy you’ll have in seeing your creativity come to life, you can also feel a sense of pride knowing that while you’re painting your masterpiece, a child somewhere, is also sharing in the same joy, with the help of the brushes we will donate from each kit purchase or donation received. April and I are fortunate and blessed to have found a way of giving back through our 1 Million Brushes Campaign, and to also have the opportunity to help inspire the world!
 


 
The initial goal of our campaign is to raise a minimum of $35,000. This amount will allow us to add at least 12 additional videos to our current offering, in addition to helping us streamline our processes, expand production capabilities, and lower our costs, as we create a more affordable product, that will in turn, be available to everyone across the worldwide. With your generous and heartfelt contributions, you will allow us the opportunity to further inspire people around the world through the power of art.
 
The following 7 items below outline our current financial needs in order to bring our painting kits to market on an accelerated schedule. With your valued donations, we can execute our plan accordingly, and make #1MillionBrushes a reality! 
The production of 12 new instructional painting videos, with the next 6 launching in February of 2018.
We will determine our options on adding the ability for multiple languages on all of our videos, in order to reach new markets around the world, as we expand our inspiration further.

Lowering our costs of supplies is a must! We are already in negotiations with multiple manufacturers and supplies that can offer us significant savings, and with better quality products. However in order to achieve this, we must begin order in bulk of at least (1000+ at a time).

Hiring staff that is dedicated to our vision, passion, and dream, will be a necessity.

Upgraded facilities will be needed, as we are quickly running out of space in our current location. The need for a warehouse to assemble and fulfill orders, in addition to housing inventory, as well as offices for our corporate staff will be a must as we grow.

Expanding and upgrading our current e-commerce platform will be necessary, in order to be capable of handling our increasing kit orders, and monthly subscription packages, in addition to our eventual line of merchandise.

Marketing our vision on a national and global scale will require a much larger budget than we currently using in our local market. If we plan to keep up with the ever changing global marketplace, and our competition, we will need to increase our budget, in addition to adding a valuable customer loyalty and rewards program.
 


 
Because we are offering a product that has already been designed, and is ready for shipment in December, we can offer Perks that give back right away, and just in time for Christmas! In order for us to reach our goal of $35,000, we realize that we will need the help and contributions of our entire community.

By supporting our campaign, and believing in our vision, your donations will allow us to impact the world on a level that April and I had once only dreamed. The #1MillionBrushes campaign, with your support, helps us to create a fun and entertaining product that we believe is truly capable of inspiring people around the world, while making a significant social impact, and an inspirational footprint that could eventually inspire the next Van Gogh, or Picasso, or perhaps the next Elon Musk or Steve Jobs. The ability to explore one’s creativity is the driving force of innovation, and our painting kits, can be that catalyst for the next generation of great innovators and dreamers! (Link to a blog about the benefits of art) Believe us when we say we will make this vision a reality. If you’re skeptical, and wondering how we will achieve these goals, then allow us to answer any questions you may have, as April and I have been proving ourselves time and time again, since first creating our business. I can assure you that when it comes to achieving our goals, we are those people that you do not want to tell us, “It can’t be done”. As Steve Jobs once said, “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do”! Our background and accomplishments with Apple Pie Painting are numerous, being that we have only been in business for 3 years. Please allow us to provide credibility as to our resolve, and to our track record of reaching our goals and achieving success. Having launched our company, in the fall of 2014, we started with little more than a dream and our determination. While living in a 2 bedroom apartment, with 2 young children, and only enough painting supplies to handle 1 painting party of no more than 20 painters at once, we have come quite a long way since then. We even produced our first few prototype painting videos in our dining room, which also served as our warehouse, and our recording studio. With the help of a couple white sheets stapled to the wall, serving as the backdrop, and a few $5 can lights from the local hardware store, we began our journey. 3 years later, we can only look back and appreciate our humble beginnings. With a bootstraped budget, and everyone telling us we couldn’t do what we said we would do, we can now laugh a little at ourselves, where we started from, and all the fun we’ve had to this point on our journey. From the countless tears, a lot of wins, and plenty of setbacks along the way, as most entrepreneurs know, April and I have persevered. Having never given up on our relentless desire to see our dreams become a reality. With now over 15,000 satisfied and inspired customers, we are doing what most said could not be done. While we are making a huge impact in our region, and our business is growing, we realize that we could never take the dream of 1 Million Brushes to the levels we have always dreamed of with the current revenues we have. Even with our recent success, it takes more than a couple thousand dollars to make this become a reality. We’ve realized that the only way we can create this vision of 1 Million Brushes is with a substantial upfront investment, in order to take the market by storm! With that being said, please allow us to prove to you that we are the right people for this job, as we reveal our list of our accomplishments and successes that we’ve achieved. We take great pride in each of them, but are also humbled in knowing,  that if we ever let our guard down, there will always be someone right behind us, ready to take it all away. We live by the words of Mark Cuban, “Work like there is someone working 24 hours a day to take it away from you.” Being a local, home grown company, our achievements and accolades help us to validate that what we are doing is right, and that what we provide to our customers is valuable. In a market surrounded by national competitors, and a lot of marketing dollars, always trying to take us down, we have pushed forward to become the best painting party company in all of Kansas City, and the largest one of it’s kind in the entire Midwest. With over 14,000 followers on social media, we have quickly become the most popular mobile painting party experience in America!

Kama bedeutet Liebe, und Sutra heißt Faden. Berühmter als der Text sind allerdings die Darstellungen von Sexpositionen, die auf dem Text basieren. MINISUTRA ist inspiriert von diesem Geist der klassischen, präkolonialen erotischen Kultur  Indiens, die, im Gegensatz zu unserer sterilen, kommerzialisierten und oft misogynen Mainstream–Erotik, verspielt, vielseitig, lebendig, sinnlich und entspannt ist. </p><p> </p><h3>Warum soll ich dieses Projekt unterstützen? </h3><p>Kunstbücher und Bilderbücher sind im allgemeinen Liebhaberwerke, in denen viel unbezahlte Arbeit drinsteckt, die wenig oder keinen Profit sowohl für die Künstlerin als auch den Verleger abwerfen und deren Realisierung von finanzieller Förderung abhängig sind. Das trifft auf MINISUTRA zu, genauso wie es auf meine vorigen Bücher <a href=""https://www.biancatschaikner.com/#/savari/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SAVARI</a> und <a href=""https://www.biancatschaikner.com/#/cookbook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La Cocina de America Latina</a> zutraf. Mit dem Kauf eines Buches oder eines Kunstwerkes ermöglicht ihr die Veröffentlichung eines hochwertigen Kunstbuch!  </p><p> </p><h3>Was kann ich tun, um MINISUTRA zu unterstützen? </h3><p>Ich würde mich sehr freuen, wenn ihr mein Crowdfunding-Projekt für MINISUTRA teilen würdet – und wenn ihr ein Buch bestellt oder einen Druck oder ein Original kauft, dann freue ich mich natürlich doppelt! </p><p> </p><h3>Was kriege ich dafür? </h3><p>Nur bei dieser Crowdfunding-Aktion gibt es die einmalige Gegenheit, das Buch signiert zu einem reduzierten Preis von 11 Euro zu erwerben (danach wird es 12.5 Euro kosten). Gratis Versand ist inkludiert, auf Wunsch gibt es auch eine Widmung. <br/>Außerdem gibt es hier – und nur hier! die Möglichkeit, limitierte Kunstdrucke und originale Malereien zu kaufen – ebenfalls zu einem speziellen Preis. Und, ganz was Feines: Ihr könnt eine speziell für euch gemachte erotische Zeichung mit eurer Lieblingsstellung in Auftrag geben! </p><p> </p><h3>Wohin wird das Geld gehen? </h3><p>Die Einnahmen werden für Druckkosten, Verpackung, Versandkosten und die Kunstdrucke verwendet. Von den Einnahmen werden 5% an Indiegogo gehen, 10 Mwst. werden abgezogen und die Gebühren für Geldtransfers mit Kreditkarte ebenfalls. </p><p>Wenn wir mehr Geld bekommen, als erwartet, werden wir eine größere Edition drucken.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Was passiert mit meinem Geld, wenn das Projekt nicht erfolgreich ist?</strong></h3><p>In dem unwahrscheinlichen Fall, dass das Buch nicht gedruckt wird, wird der Kaufpreis vollständig zurückerstattet. Wenn du Kunstwerke gekauft hast, wirst du diese trotzdem bekommen. </p><p> </p><h3>Wer wird das Buch drucken? </h3><p>Das Buch wird vom österreichischen <a href=""http://www.bucherverlag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bucher Verlag</a> gedruckt und veröffentlicht. Der Bucher Verlag ein kleiner, feiner Kunstbuchverlag, der letztes Jahr mein Buch SAVARI veröffentlicht hat und  zahlreiche Preise für seine schönen und hochwertigen Bücher gewonnen hat. </p><p> </p><h3>Wann werde ich mein Buch bzw. meine Kunstwerke bekommen? </h3><p>Das Buch und die Kunstwerke werden voraussichtlich bis März 2018 geliefert.</p></div>","++++ für die DEUTSCHE VERSION bitte ganz nach unten scrollen! ++++++ MINISUTRA is designed and layouted ready to print and the only thing that’s missing now is the funding of the printing costs of a small edition. I‘ve put together a bunch of some exclusive packs for you to purchase with books, limited edition art prints and original artworks which are all  – only here, only now! – offered at a special price. Every single purchase you make will help me publish MINISUTRA. With your love and support, this book will come to life! In the meantime, you can enjoy this year's kamasutra advent calendar here: https://www.facebook.com/biancatsh/And to learn more about me and my work, visit my website: https://www.biancatschaikner.comThank you so much and may the gods of love bless you ;-) Questions?

Es wird eine hochwertig gedruckte Auflage von 700 Stück geben.    Was ist das Kamasutra eigentlich?Das Kamasutra ist ein antiker indischer Text über die Kunst des Liebens. Kama bedeutet Liebe, und Sutra heißt Faden. Berühmter als der Text sind allerdings die Darstellungen von Sexpositionen, die auf dem Text basieren. MINISUTRA ist inspiriert von diesem Geist der klassischen, präkolonialen erotischen Kultur  Indiens, die, im Gegensatz zu unserer sterilen, kommerzialisierten und oft misogynen Mainstream–Erotik, verspielt, vielseitig, lebendig, sinnlich und entspannt ist.  Warum soll ich dieses Projekt unterstützen? Kunstbücher und Bilderbücher sind im allgemeinen Liebhaberwerke, in denen viel unbezahlte Arbeit drinsteckt, die wenig oder keinen Profit sowohl für die Künstlerin als auch den Verleger abwerfen und deren Realisierung von finanzieller Förderung abhängig sind. Das trifft auf MINISUTRA zu, genauso wie es auf meine vorigen Bücher SAVARI und La Cocina de America Latina zutraf. Mit dem Kauf eines Buches oder eines Kunstwerkes ermöglicht ihr die Veröffentlichung eines hochwertigen Kunstbuch!   Was kann ich tun, um MINISUTRA zu unterstützen? Ich würde mich sehr freuen, wenn ihr mein Crowdfunding-Projekt für MINISUTRA teilen würdet – und wenn ihr ein Buch bestellt oder einen Druck oder ein Original kauft, dann freue ich mich natürlich doppelt!  Was kriege ich dafür? Nur bei dieser Crowdfunding-Aktion gibt es die einmalige Gegenheit, das Buch signiert zu einem reduzierten Preis von 11 Euro zu erwerben (danach wird es 12.5 Euro kosten). Gratis Versand ist inkludiert, auf Wunsch gibt es auch eine Widmung. Außerdem gibt es hier – und nur hier! die Möglichkeit, limitierte Kunstdrucke und originale Malereien zu kaufen – ebenfalls zu einem speziellen Preis. Und, ganz was Feines: Ihr könnt eine speziell für euch gemachte erotische Zeichung mit eurer Lieblingsstellung in Auftrag geben!  Wohin wird das Geld gehen? Die Einnahmen werden für Druckkosten, Verpackung, Versandkosten und die Kunstdrucke verwendet. Von den Einnahmen werden 5% an Indiegogo gehen, 10 Mwst. werden abgezogen und die Gebühren für Geldtransfers mit Kreditkarte ebenfalls. Wenn wir mehr Geld bekommen, als erwartet, werden wir eine größere Edition drucken. Was passiert mit meinem Geld, wenn das Projekt nicht erfolgreich ist?In dem unwahrscheinlichen Fall, dass das Buch nicht gedruckt wird, wird der Kaufpreis vollständig zurückerstattet. Wenn du Kunstwerke gekauft hast, wirst du diese trotzdem bekommen.  Wer wird das Buch drucken? Das Buch wird vom österreichischen Bucher Verlag gedruckt und veröffentlicht. Der Bucher Verlag ein kleiner, feiner Kunstbuchverlag, der letztes Jahr mein Buch SAVARI veröffentlicht hat und  zahlreiche Preise für seine schönen und hochwertigen Bücher gewonnen hat.  Wann werde ich mein Buch bzw. meine Kunstwerke bekommen? Das Buch und die Kunstwerke werden voraussichtlich bis März 2018 geliefert.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>This <strong>photo exhibition</strong> will feature a collection of different photos from various parts of Belfast. The goal is to highlight the creativity and talent of local artists and painters. It will also serve as a guide if you are interested in seeing the artwork in person. At first when I started working on this project I did contemplate the idea of excluding all political art, graffiti and murals related to the paramilitaries but they are a huge part of what makes the streets of Belfast unique whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>The reason why I am taking this project to Indiegogo is because it is very hard to get a exposure in a niche subject like this. Crowdfunding is therefor a viable solution and with Indiegogo I can get some needed help and the funding required to get this exhibition project started. </p>

<h3>The Unicorn Advice Booth and The Yurticorn</h3>
<p>We at Camp Unicorner are creating a new installation for our camp frontage, The Unicorn Advice Booth!  The advice booth will feature a changeable chalkboard sign so that the booth can be anything we dream it to be - kissing booth?  Lemonade stand?  Bar?  Puppet theatre?  Gifting station?  Opportunities for fun and shenanigans are limitless!  The booth will be colorful and fun while offering shade and seating, and it will be lit for night time use so any time of day passersby can stop and play!</p>
<p>We are also working to enhance, upgrade, and stock up our Yurticorn unicorn lounge!  The Yurticorn is a hexayurt full of fluffy unicorns and magical creatures, and also features a free library and coloring corner!  It's a great place to relax, nap, have pillow fights, meditate, and comfort your inner child!  This will be the Yurticorn's third year on the playa and it gets more magical every year!  With your help we can make it more colorful, more comfy, and more fun with more coloring books, colored pencils, fantasy and kids books, tacky unicorn art, and tons of gifts!</p>
<p>It brings us immense pleasure to share our colorful positivity with others. Burners of all ages light up when they see the magical installations we've created for everyone's fun and enjoyment! </p>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<p>3 sheets of 1/2"" plywood - $75</p>
<p>Primer and paint - several gallons, many colors! - $350</p>
<p>Paint brushes, rollers, pans, etc. - $100</p>
<p>Chalkboard paint and liquid chalk markers - $30</p>
<p>80 feet of 2x4"" lumber - $60</p>
<p>8 feet of 2x12"" lumber - $20</p>
<p>4 barstools - $80</p>
<p>Solar LED lights - $100 </p>
<p>Rebar and hardware (screws, etc.) - $50</p>
<p>Curtains and rods - $100</p>
<p>Coloring books and colored pencils - $20</p>
<p>Fantasy novels and children's books - $50</p>
<p>Bolts of fabric - $200</p>
<p>Hexayurt (bi-filament) tape - $100</p>
<p>Carpets and ground cover - $100</p>
<p>MORE unicorns, pillows, and mats! - $200</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, never fear!  The Unicorn Advice Booth will happen regardless - we will prioritize building materials first and fun additions later, so that our ultimate goal of increasing our interactivity is achieved.  We work year-round to create and upgrade our installations so they are always getting better.</p>
<p>ALL FUNDING from this campaign will go toward creation and enhancement of The Unicorn Advice Booth and The Yurticorn!</p>
<p><strong>Our Gifts to You:</strong></p>
<p>Both the Unicorn Advice Booth and the Yurticorn are open 24-hours a day so they are always available for interactivity and fun!  The Unicorner also offers many fun gifts during Burning Man, like books, bookmarks, unicorn friends, buttons, pins, and more!</p>
<p>There are many awesome perks that we have created for our friends and contributors!  These include high quality vinyl stickers and buttons of our fabulous camp logo, really cool party glasses glittered by your favorite unicorns, and especially the limited-edition hard-enamel collector's pins that are super sweet and glow in the dark!!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We work hard and we play hard in order to bring joy to people who visit the Yurticorn and Unicorn Advice Booth at Burning Man and events like SF Decompression. We are so excited to create a new interactive experience that offers opportunities for fun and imagination.  When we first created the Yurticorn, we had no idea how positive the effect would be, but we've gotten so much great feedback about the space we've created that we are motivated to create more, do more, and give back to our wonderful community as much as we can!  Thank you for helping us meet our goals and realize our dreams!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is funding, which is why we've created this fundraiser!  We are a creative and motivated group of carpenters, artists, and art lovers, but we are a small camp of friends and families with limited income.  We put so much effort, time, and money into our installations and with community support we can go that much further and create so much more!!  For instance, last year we built PlayaTech love seats, pews &amp; bleachers in order to increase our camp's comfort for visitors, so we're confident that we will be able to build an Advice Booth for everyone to play with! </p>
<p> <strong>Other ways you can help:</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to help us achieve our goals. If you could help spread the word about our Indiegogo campaign using the links to your social media, we'd be forever grateful!! Please find us on our public Facebook page, ""Unicorner - Fun and Shenanigans!"".  We post updates and camp info there, so you can find us on the playa and come say hi!  We'd love to meet you!</p>

Mais ces objets ne sont pas nés d'une direction que je me force à suivre, c’est le fruit d'une vision qui m'habite, naturellement, depuis toujours.Cette créativité nouvellement libérée devait par contre être domptée en même temps que les autres états d'esprit dont elle se nourrit; le bonheur de me donner enfin le droit de consacrer ma vie à ma passion, l'enthousiasme débordant, une confiance aveugle, tous ces états d'esprit m'ont donné de dures leçons.Quoique la bête de la création en elle-même pourrait ne jamais être totalement domptée, l'homme qu'elle a aidé à s'épanouir peut maintenant affirmer en avoir compris le fonctionnement et ainsi déclarer en avoir le contrôle.La créativité et la volonté ne sont pas les deux seuls ingrédients nécessaires à la réussite, mis à part la chance, le travail, l'organisation, l'acharnement, etc. L'ingrédient essentiel reste l'argent, cette notion de valeur qui nous nourrit, nous met un toit sur la tête et définit notre place dans la société, et il me manque terriblement, une conséquence directe de ces leçons encaissées. Le produitDans les derniers mois, j'ai consacré de plus en plus de temps à réaliser un concept de mobilier qui me titillait l'esprit depuis longtemps.Ayant à l'origine misé sur le Salon de l'Habitation pour faire découvrir son design, j'ai manqué de temps et n'ai pu y présenter ne serait-ce que le prototype.Le temps passé à réaliser ce produit était par contre bien réel, et a créé un important manque à gagner.Il m'est donc impératif de lever des fonds rapidement, sans quoi…La conception du dit meuble étant terminée, le prototype ayant passé tous les tests de nature physique et mécanique haut la main, il ne reste qu'à l'introduire au monde et lui faire vivre son vrai test, celui de l'intérêt qu'il peut susciter.Alors ce que je souhaite en premier lieu, c'est que vous partagiez et incitiez vos amis et vos proches à partager ce sociofinancement sur les réseaux sociaux, afin que le maximum possible de gens y soit sensibilisé. Et deuxièmement, que vous en parliez personnellement aux gens de votre entourage susceptibles de trouver un intérêt à posséder ce meuble. L'offreUn module de rangement, solidement assemblé et fabriqué de ciment et de bois, au prix de 450 $, soit un rabais de 25 % sur le prix de détail après lancement. Ce tarif est valable pour une production initiale de 12 unités, ce total devant être atteint dans un délai de 15 jours à compter du début de cette campagne, à la fin de cette offre, les modules seront offerts au prix de détail de 600 $ auprès de La Touche Locale.Le prix de base est valable pour la version offrant un tiroir en merisier russe. Différents placages de bois peuvent être proposés avec supplément (sur les photos de présentation, le placage est du bois de zebrano), de même qu’il est possible d’envisager de colorer le ciment.           ConclusionJe suis conscient que le prix demandé n'est pas accessible à tous, mais c’est un produit qui, à mon avis, trouvera son public auprès de gens cherchant une signature particulière à leur environnement, ou peut-être de compagnies qui doivent meubler une salle ou des bureaux. C’est pour cette raison que je vous demande de partager cette publication, afin qu’elle trouve écho auprès de son public.Je vous remercie d’avance de m’avoir aidé en partageant cette publication ou en ayant fait vous-même une commande. Cordialement,Sylvain.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Marnie Freeman is a talented artist who is know as the ""Artist of Liberty®"" because the subject matter she is passionate about reflects the founding values of our great nation.  The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president was historic at many levels. Many never thought he would ever even have a chance, but he tapped into a core of supports who came out in force to win the White House and start a new chapter in the American story.</p>
<p>During the campaign the supporters of Trump/Pence ticket were likened to a ""basket of deplorables."" This became a rallying cry for many who were on the fence with their support. These supporters prayed for candidate Trump and turned out in record numbers with a desire to ""Make America Great Again"" as One Nation Under God. Now, they want to send a resounding message to President Trump: ""We are standing behind you.""</p>
<p>For the first time Marnie Freeman is accepting a public commission to create a special painting that commemorates this historic election. Her painting is titled ""March of the Deplorables"". It will depict a line of supporters praying for and marching alongside President Trump and Vice President Pence on their journey to the White House. She will also include key figures who were instrumental in this historic victory such as Kellyanne Conway, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Lt. General Flynn, Steve Bannon, Katrina Pierson and Karen Pence. Much like the campaign was targeted to giving a voice to the average American rather than the privileged few, this painting is being funded in the same way. By opening this up to the public more people can participate in this historic painting. The idea came from Lt. Colonel E. Ray Moore, a retired Army Chaplain. Colonel Moore asked Marnie to paint this to honor the men and women who made the 2016 victory happen. He felt that it should be ""commissioned by the people.""</p>
<p>Marnie plans to present this painting to President Trump and Vice President Pence when it is completed. She believes that it will be a cherished memento of what many believed was impossible.</p>
<p>Please check out the various ways you can participate in this amazing project.</p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Many of you already know us for our works in fantastic medieval bookbinding in an artisanal way, which we have been doing for six years now, working with national publishers such as Nosolorol and international as <strong>WhiteWolf</strong>, <strong>Modiphius</strong>, among many others. Of course many orders from private clients. And from our website, where you can see all our works and books for sale: </p>

<p> Since he had use of reason he held a pencil in his hand.<br/>                                Many professors shook their heads as if they had a fair monster before them to check how little they attended in class. But the small Jagoba, outraged by the rejection of the world towards the cartoonists, decided then to open the way to swipes, bites and more unpleasant things.</p>

<h3>Necronomiconis Medievalis</h3>
<p><i>What is the Necronomiconis Medievalis?</i> It is a medieval edition written by a Spanish monk in the fourteenth century, collecting old writings in different languages. This arduous task that he carried out in secret, paid off when, after several years of research and work, he was able to create this great book.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gaymD1UDvTk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/><br/>This book was an idea that for years I had in mind, since there were several books on sale with the name of <strong>Necronomicon</strong> and that did not finish setting for a devoted follower of the <i>H.P. Lovecraft </i>(and other writers like August Derleth) and their mithos, like me. I needed something more, as a follower of this universe and player of the magnificent role-playing game ""<strong>The call of cthulhu</strong>"", which I recommend from my heart here.</p>
<p>My idea was to create a <strong>Necronomicon</strong> at the height of this universe and that the followers of <strong>Lovecraft </strong>can say, that this may be one of the best books that represent this universe, although that you will decide.<br/>Both the medieval book of wooden covers and the pocket edition contain the same illustrations. These books are a collection of creatures and artifacts from the myths of the <i>H.P.Lovecraft </i>universe. Being able to use it as a bestiary in the role games. With more than <strong>200 illustrations</strong> this book is indispensable if you like the worlds of <i>Lovecraft</i>. It does not contain readable text only symbols, spells and litanies in strange languages, <u>never seen before</u>. The setting that we have given has been of the ancient world, in some of the illustrations appear the 7 wonders of the ancient world and the legend says ... that just by seeing a specific page, you go crazy.<br/>You have never seen anything like it, since this project has more than 8 months of work, not only the book, but all the Merchandising that comes with it. You can not lose this.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqASdqJWXuo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>My goal as a bookbinder and thanks to <i>Jagoba Lekuona</i> is to create the ideal book, as we all imagine this type of book. As a role player, it is to have a book in which I can teach my players all this world and its creatures that inhabit it.<br/><br/>I inform you that the edition of this book is limited to <strong>666 units</strong> (No more will be manufactured), with its <i>certificate</i> indicating its numbering and although the content is equal to all that are manufactured, none will be the same, granting in this way, that each piece is different. So the owner will have a unique piece, which is ultimately what it is about having something unique ... and special.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-bL5rE7PHl4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/>I explain briefly how is the book ...<br/>After passing certain illustrations we make a prototype, (which are the photos you can see acontiniación). After printing in print (after seeing different papers and tests) the paper is aged with 3 layers of treatment, sheet by sheet.</p>

<p>As you know the <i>Necronomiconis Medievalis</i> (<strong>350 euros</strong>), its <u>size is A5 </u>(half folio). We have created it with this size because it is easier to transport, for the games. But we are also going to make it a little bigger <u>A4 size</u> (like a folio), so we have taken out the <i>Necronomiconis Medievalis </i>BIG (<strong>600 euros</strong>), obviously it takes more material and hours of work. It will be exactly like the one that appears in the photos, but bigger.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not everyone can afford to pay the cost of this great work, so we have created a paperback edition in soft cover so that no one is left without the ""<i>Necronomiconis Medievalis</i>""<br/>We have not been able to miss this opportunity to add a notebook (Necrocuadernomicón) on human skin and the role play of ""<i>The call of Cthulhu</i>"" 7ºEdition.</p>
</div><p> </p><div>
<h2>PACK</h2>
<p>During all these months, we have communicated with our followers in different social networks and we have liked the idea that all items can be purchased individually. But the most interesting are the<strong> ""Pack""</strong> we have created, with different price ranges so that everyone has access to them.<br/>In these Pack you can find a group of products, which as a whole are cheaper than buying them individually.<br/>We hope you enjoy them.<br/><br/><i>What can we find in these Pack?</i></p>
<p><strong>POCKET BOOK</strong><br/><br/>This pocket edition of the <i>Necronomiconis Medievalis</i> in softcover, is the cheapest option to get this great job for only <strong>19 euros</strong>, although if you choose a PACK you get better price.<br/>With a size of A5 approx. It is a paperback book with a number of pages to be determined, about 200 pages or more in full color.</p>

Many of you already know us for our works in fantastic medieval bookbinding in an artisanal way, which we have been doing for six years now, working with national publishers such as Nosolorol and international as WhiteWolf, Modiphius, among many others. Of course many orders from private clients. And from our website, where you can see all our works and books for sale: 
www.elartesanodelrey.es Jagoba Lekuona ILUSTRATOR
 Since he had use of reason he held a pencil in his hand.                                Many professors shook their heads as if they had a fair monster before them to check how little they attended in class. But the small Jagoba, outraged by the rejection of the world towards the cartoonists, decided then to open the way to swipes, bites and more unpleasant things.

 

Necronomiconis Medievalis
What is the Necronomiconis Medievalis? It is a medieval edition written by a Spanish monk in the fourteenth century, collecting old writings in different languages. This arduous task that he carried out in secret, paid off when, after several years of research and work, he was able to create this great book.

This book was an idea that for years I had in mind, since there were several books on sale with the name of Necronomicon and that did not finish setting for a devoted follower of the H.P. Lovecraft (and other writers like August Derleth) and their mithos, like me. I needed something more, as a follower of this universe and player of the magnificent role-playing game ""The call of cthulhu"", which I recommend from my heart here.
My idea was to create a Necronomicon at the height of this universe and that the followers of Lovecraft can say, that this may be one of the best books that represent this universe, although that you will decide.Both the medieval book of wooden covers and the pocket edition contain the same illustrations. These books are a collection of creatures and artifacts from the myths of the H.P.Lovecraft universe. Being able to use it as a bestiary in the role games. With more than 200 illustrations this book is indispensable if you like the worlds of Lovecraft. It does not contain readable text only symbols, spells and litanies in strange languages, never seen before. The setting that we have given has been of the ancient world, in some of the illustrations appear the 7 wonders of the ancient world and the legend says ... that just by seeing a specific page, you go crazy.You have never seen anything like it, since this project has more than 8 months of work, not only the book, but all the Merchandising that comes with it. You can not lose this.

My goal as a bookbinder and thanks to Jagoba Lekuona is to create the ideal book, as we all imagine this type of book. As a role player, it is to have a book in which I can teach my players all this world and its creatures that inhabit it.I inform you that the edition of this book is limited to 666 units (No more will be manufactured), with its certificate indicating its numbering and although the content is equal to all that are manufactured, none will be the same, granting in this way, that each piece is different. So the owner will have a unique piece, which is ultimately what it is about having something unique ... and special.

I explain briefly how is the book ...After passing certain illustrations we make a prototype, (which are the photos you can see acontiniación). After printing in print (after seeing different papers and tests) the paper is aged with 3 layers of treatment, sheet by sheet.




The sheets are then stitched in A5 size booklets. After preparing the covers of the book in wood and aging them, the whole set is bound in an artisanal way with medieval techniques of the time.












The cover is decorated with different elements. This type of book, when done by hand, involves many hours of work.

As you know the Necronomiconis Medievalis (350 euros), its size is A5 (half folio). We have created it with this size because it is easier to transport, for the games. But we are also going to make it a little bigger A4 size (like a folio), so we have taken out the Necronomiconis Medievalis BIG (600 euros), obviously it takes more material and hours of work. It will be exactly like the one that appears in the photos, but bigger.

Unfortunately not everyone can afford to pay the cost of this great work, so we have created a paperback edition in soft cover so that no one is left without the ""Necronomiconis Medievalis""We have not been able to miss this opportunity to add a notebook (Necrocuadernomicón) on human skin and the role play of ""The call of Cthulhu"" 7ºEdition.
 
PACK
During all these months, we have communicated with our followers in different social networks and we have liked the idea that all items can be purchased individually. But the most interesting are the ""Pack"" we have created, with different price ranges so that everyone has access to them.In these Pack you can find a group of products, which as a whole are cheaper than buying them individually.We hope you enjoy them.What can we find in these Pack?
POCKET BOOKThis pocket edition of the Necronomiconis Medievalis in softcover, is the cheapest option to get this great job for only 19 euros, although if you choose a PACK you get better price.With a size of A5 approx. It is a paperback book with a number of pages to be determined, about 200 pages or more in full color.

We will explore and connect arts, culture, music, photography, politics, poetry and cinema. Our platform intends to give visibility to up-and-coming, underground talents.Phase reimagines the way we interact with culture. We believe that today, young creatives should not restrict themselves to one area of interest. Therefore, Phase enables these creatives to explore different possibilities, express their broad range of passions and benefit emerging artists.The magazine will reflect London culture of musicians coexisting alongside writers. We will engage with the tradition of underground zine culture that challenges convention. Phase will be London’s monthly encounter with those composing this counterculture.Phase is UK based but will create an ecosystem benefitting and connecting our readership to young artists and writers from around the world. Why?We aim to create a link between a nostalgic idealisation of the past and an eagerness for reinventing contemporary culture.We believe it is time to confront our generation's potential by resisting the idea that everything has already been made.Phase will be accessible but intellectually engaging, politically opinionated and open to discourse.Phase blends Britain's musical identity with the French emphasis on culture, art, and cinema.As Phase grows, we hope to use the magazine as a tool to highlight the work of writers and artists who share our vision, and eventually tackling the issues we care most about, including the refugee crisis, environmental destruction, racism, homelessness, and social justice.Who's behind it? Our team is made up of young creatives and writers. We understand our generation must shape the artistic landscape of the future. Anjali Larsen - Editor-in-Chief/Music EditorAnjali is an independent journalist and film student from Paris. She has spent the last year living in London seeking and uncovering the city's most talented writers and artists. Now, her goal is to provide them with a platform that will enable them to express their talents uninhibited. Leo Peace - Co-Editor/Politics Editor

<p>The Sugar Creek Art Center leases working studio spaces to area artists. Our artists interact and collaborate to enhance and expand their work. We hold monthly gallery exhibits to connect with our rural community.</p>

This is a very special and personal book.  Whoever opens it will find the joy of analyzing what they feel and see from the world, plus things to read, illustrations to see and also free space to both draw, write, paste little things...and anything you feel like including. 
The finality of this is for you to be able to share your book with both your future self and the people that surrounds you. If you're a traveller, someone with concerns and/or willing to discover and learn everyday, this is your sketchbook

Some background to be able to live in the mean time, so that I can focus 100% on it and be able to finish everything in time.

For that you'll get:
I'll break it down further in the perks section, but if you contribute, varying amounts could net you original signed prints of a chosen part of the book, a spot for your name in the art book, a physical copy of the art book and more!

You may have also spent a

If you ever tried learning the human anatomy or
attempting to do so, you will soon find out it’s not easy. 
You may have also spent a
fortune on anatomy books and even watched hours of videos on the 
subject. Do you still find yourself not progressing ? Perhaps the 
frustration when you are unable to find any suitable
anatomy reference at all? Art is hard, but it does not have to be!
Having spent a great deal of time in the gaming industry
with a great passion for character art and as a lead artist at Ubisoft Singapore on AAA titles like Ghost Recon and Assassin Creed franchises has taught something... 


Seasoned veterans will tell you the best way to learning anatomy
is by cross referencing books with a reference model, a good reference 
model! To appreciate the human form further is to build the model 
yourself! The good news
is this has been done for you. This model has been an accumulation of hundreds of 
hours of painstaking research and
sculpting work. Started entirely from scratch and 
sculpted from inside out, each layer of muscles were carefully researched and 
sculpted separately. Important details like the origin
and insertion points, volume and density of each muscles have been 
faithfully preserved.Though the deeper muscles will never
be visible, however this method yields a more accurate representation of how the final top muscles should naturally look. Fortunately all is not lost, the entire sculpting
process has been documented on YouTube. Over 100 videos of the sculpting method, techniques and tools used are shared, starting from how I built the armature
all the way to the final molding and casting process.
BenefitsAll the expensive anatomy books in the world can’t paint a complete 
picture of the complexities of the human body. In fact, the most 
difficult aspect of learning anatomy is attempting to piece together a 
functional 3D mental image based on an array of 2D images typically 
available. Being able to hold and feel your subject in your hands decreases the learning curve tremendously.Visual depth and tactile 3D experience will always be better then just flat images. Being able to refer between a diagram and a physical model will make much better visual sense.

<div>What the city's <i>not</i> saying? Funding for those sidewalks is limited to what they consider ""the length of the city's major streets."" Read: the upscale, commercial areas that cater to visitors.</div>
<div>That means that other areas need to find their own way to create a walkable—or jog-able, stroller-able, or wheelchair-able—neighborhood.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1258542/files/20150301091338-sidewalk-GRAPHIC.jpg?1425230018"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>TSL knows this problem all too well. Thanks to their location on the truck route, the sidewalks outside TSL have suffered from decades of commercial traffic and trucks that drive over and park upon the curb. This meant that, until last year, the sidewalk was essentially <b>unwalkable</b>—full of sinkholes, broken, and reduced to mud in some places.<br/>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>This is problematic for a number of reasons:</div>
<div><p>
<b>+</b>A sidewalk that is truly ""wide"" and ""fully-paved"" allows safe pedestrian access to the neighborhoods beyond Columbia Street for <i>all</i> community members, whether they're walking, pulling a cart, pushing a stroller, or operating a wheelchair.<br/><b>+</b>Walkability is one of the most important factors of a <b>safe</b> and <b>efficient</b> urban environment.<br/><b>+</b>A healthy sidewalk allows TSL's programming and space to truly be accessible to all, including differently abled community members.</p></div>
<div>TSL lobbied for months for grants, loans, or other financial assistance from New York State, the city of Hudson, or arts organizations, but there are no programs in place to support infrastructure improvements. This is a <b>problem</b>—because without a safe space, a non-profit organization cannot fulfill its mission of reaching all community members.</div>
<p>
</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">That's why TSL decided to take on the sidewalk renewal project without assistance—and with it, a $30,000 bill.</h2>
<p>
</p>
<div>Now, TSL is looking to defray the cost of these community improvements by looking to the community—the community of Hudson, the community of New York State, the arts community, and the community of those who believe art and empowerment should be accessible to all.<br/><p><br/></p>

Now, TSL needs your help!



The sidewalk problem
""The Walkable City."" ""Upstate's Downtown."" These are all phrases used by the city of Hudson in reference to its ""wide, fully paved sidewalks.""
What the city's not saying? Funding for those sidewalks is limited to what they consider ""the length of the city's major streets."" Read: the upscale, commercial areas that cater to visitors.
That means that other areas need to find their own way to create a walkable—or jog-able, stroller-able, or wheelchair-able—neighborhood.

TSL knows this problem all too well. Thanks to their location on the truck route, the sidewalks outside TSL have suffered from decades of commercial traffic and trucks that drive over and park upon the curb. This meant that, until last year, the sidewalk was essentially unwalkable—full of sinkholes, broken, and reduced to mud in some places.



This is problematic for a number of reasons:

+A sidewalk that is truly ""wide"" and ""fully-paved"" allows safe pedestrian access to the neighborhoods beyond Columbia Street for all community members, whether they're walking, pulling a cart, pushing a stroller, or operating a wheelchair.+Walkability is one of the most important factors of a safe and efficient urban environment.+A healthy sidewalk allows TSL's programming and space to truly be accessible to all, including differently abled community members.
TSL lobbied for months for grants, loans, or other financial assistance from New York State, the city of Hudson, or arts organizations, but there are no programs in place to support infrastructure improvements. This is a problem—because without a safe space, a non-profit organization cannot fulfill its mission of reaching all community members.


That's why TSL decided to take on the sidewalk renewal project without assistance—and with it, a $30,000 bill.


Now, TSL is looking to defray the cost of these community improvements by looking to the community—the community of Hudson, the community of New York State, the arts community, and the community of those who believe art and empowerment should be accessible to all.




Budget breakdown
TSL's budget is pretty simple.
+$30,000 will go directly toward paying for the sidewalk renewal project+$3,500 will go toward Indiegogo and credit card processing fees+$1,500 will go toward fulfilling rewards, including postage and printing
If TSL receives less than $35,000, all of the funding they do receive will still go toward the sidewalk bill, fees, and rewards. However, they will remain in debt to the sidewalk project, leaving them with a smaller budget for programming.
If TSL receives more than $35,000, the sidewalk will be paid off, and any additional funds will go toward additional programming! Hooray!

CLAYWORKS</u></b></p>
<p>Baltimore
Clayworks’ mission is <b><i>to develop, promote and sustain an artist-centered
community, which provides outstanding artistic, educational and collaborative
programs in the ceramic arts.</i></b><i>  </i>Founded in 1980 by a group
of nine community-minded ceramic artists, Baltimore Clayworks has developed a
strong local and global reputation for artists’ development coupled with
sustained community engagement.  </p>
<p>Each year
Baltimore Clayworks serves over 15,000; has 12 artists in residence, 4 visiting
artists and 20-25 exhibitions in our galleries in Mt. Washington. Clayworks has
over 60 professional teaching artists and nearly 400 additional exhibiting
artists throughout the year. Annually we teach over 1,500 students in our
studios in Mt. Washington and over 2,000 students through our Community Arts
programs. </p>
<p><b>ARTISTS' RESIDENCIES</b> are at the
heart of the organization; juried from national and international applicants,
they are supported by superb studio facilities and community. Both visiting and
resident artists have 24 hour access to workspaces, equipment, and electric and
gas kilns housed in the studio facilities. In addition, Clayworks houses the

Clayworks launches its celebratory campaign ""$35,000 in 35 days"" to
help sustain the organization for another 35+ years - join the party!
It is with
the support, guidance and accomplishments of all those that have been a part of
Clayworks’ rich history that enable us now to reach new audiences, connect to
new participants and partners, continue our quality programming and begin new
initiatives that will ensure that Clayworks remains a leader in ceramics and
community arts. 
With our
nationally and internationally recognized artists involved at Clayworks, we are
able to offer quality clay instruction to those at our Mt. Washington campus
and the surrounding communities in Baltimore city and county.
Clayworks is
committed to making the arts accessible to those who otherwise would have
limited or no access, bringing professional ceramic artists to Baltimore to
work with youth and senior adults at our satellite studios, Jubilee Arts, Zeta
Center for Active and Healthy Aging, Tuerk House and in other spaces in their
own communities. By partnering with organizations already imbedded in the
life of the neighborhoods and developing art-making programs that meet the
interests of the community, Baltimore Clayworks has successfully worked with
broad and diverse groups of residents in Baltimore for over three decades.
This rings
true with our Clay for All satellite studio and partner, Jubilee Arts,
which is a program of Newborn Holistic Ministries. Clayworks has worked with
Jubilee Arts for 6 years and provides clay programming throughout the year to a
wide variety of ages and ability levels in the Sandtown–Winchester, Upton and
surrounding communities on the west side of Baltimore City.
“An
important part of community arts is that we are working to change the
environment and culture of the people in Sandtown, [and other Baltimore
neighborhoods] through clay. Dealing with the pros and cons of this
under-served community and building relationships that are everlasting – we are
part of the solution.” says
Director of Community Engagement, Herb Massie

Baltimore
Clayworks’ mission is to develop, promote and sustain an artist-centered
community, which provides outstanding artistic, educational and collaborative
programs in the ceramic arts.  Founded in 1980 by a group
of nine community-minded ceramic artists, Baltimore Clayworks has developed a
strong local and global reputation for artists’ development coupled with
sustained community engagement.  
Each year
Baltimore Clayworks serves over 15,000; has 12 artists in residence, 4 visiting

ARTISTS' RESIDENCIES are at the
heart of the organization; juried from national and international applicants,
they are supported by superb studio facilities and community. Both visiting and
resident artists have 24 hour access to workspaces, equipment, and electric and

<h1>Welcome to Our Bus Campaign! </h1>
<p>Hi, we are Alisa and Phil, a couple who recently purchased a 1990 Ward school bus with the vision to turn it into our first home, and embarking on a tour of the West Coast. Upon completing this mission, we intend to chase our dreams of travel, art, music, and exploration, and we want you to be a part of this process. How? By backing this project, we will give you something meaningful to us that we have created.</p>

<h1>The West Coast Tour:</h1>
<p>When the bus is ready to go, the real journey will begin. Our first goal is to drive from our current residence in San Antonio, to the beautiful Northwest. Along the way we plan to hit some of the most popular cities, the most gorgeous natural wonders of the west, and hopefully find some secret local treasures along the way, most of which neither of us have ever experienced.</p>

<h2>
<i>Who am I, What do I do</i>?<br/>
</h2>
<p>My name is Karen (Kaz).  I'm very driven by my creative ideas.                                      For the past 20 something years I have obsessed, created and sold original artworks. I can't help myself!  Paintings, sculptures and jewellery... just to name a few of my art addictions.</p>
<p><b>'This girl needs help you say"",    'YES I do!'</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1201114/files/20150206052304-Artwork_1.jpg?1423228984"" src="""" style=""width: 607.582px; height: 685px;""/></p>
<h2>What Happened?<br/>
</h2>
<p>All was good in the land of Kaz, until one day I had to quit my beloved job working with an old school Upholsterer, very sad.  I have neck and back issues which were severely aggravated by my labor intensive job.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1201151/files/20150206053921-Chair_picture.jpg?1423229961"" src="""" style=""width: 194.542px; height: 235px;""/> <br/></p>
<p>My job search efforts have not unfolded a suitable job, one that caters for fluctuating pain levels. I need to sit or stand for short periods, mixing it up,   soooo.... guess what?  I intend to pursue my creative journey full time, making and selling jewellery, paintings and prints, quirky dolls, altered art, garden murals and holding art classes in my studio to pass on my knowledge. Self employment allows me to sit or stand as needed. I also commence studying Micro Business at the end of February.  Here is some more of the work I will be making:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1202765/files/20150206231746-Artwork_2.jpg?1423293466"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The help that I'm seeking</h2>
<h3>Something cool will come your way too!</h3>
<p> <b>I have a 6m x 5m shed which is HALF lined and insulated, potentially the perfect studio for 
any quirky artist. </b>
</p>
<b></b><p><b>In order to make a living I need to finish lining my studio. <b>I have virtually all of the materials ready to go.</b> The only space I have to work at the moment is the corner of my dining table. A lot of my materials are still packed in the studio so they don't get dirty which makes them difficult to access... frustrating too!<br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>The $1200 I am attempting to raise:</b></p>
<b>
</b><ol>
<b>
</b><li><b>  Is to pay a lovely builder man to finish lining the walls and ceiling- $500<br/></b></li>
<b>
</b><li><b>  To connect the power, the cables are run but not connected - $350<br/></b></li>
<b>
</b><li><b>  To purchase a cheap little second hand shed so I can remove all my tools and shed type things out of the studio space. $100<br/></b></li>
<b>
</b><li><div align=""left""><p><b>  This amount also assists with materials for 'perks' and Indiegogo fees <br/></b></p></div></li>
</ol>
<h2></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1205326/files/20150208011238-My_mess.jpg?1423386758"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If $500 is my total in contributions that would be fantastic too! I would have the walls and ceiling in the studio lined and just run a power cord from the house. Obviously I'd love to have the whole lot of work completed but I would still be up and running, which is my main aim.<br/></p>
<p>Once upon a perfect day I would have completed the studio lining myself, I did 
the first half! The studio is too dirty and hot, with the Aussie climate, to use 
as is. I work a lot with fabric too so I need a clean space.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What you get...
</h2>
<p>I'm not asking for 'money for nothing'. What I'm essentially 
doing is Pre-selling my art and craft to fund the work on my studio so I can start working. I have chosen 'flexible funding' for this campaign, which means if my $1200 goal is not met I still  get to keep what you have contributed, and you will still receive the Perk that you have chosen. Any contribution would make an amazing difference to me and help towards getting me up and running in my business. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Hello All,

Who am I, What do I do?

My name is Karen (Kaz).  I'm very driven by my creative ideas.                                      For the past 20 something years I have obsessed, created and sold original artworks. I can't help myself!  Paintings, sculptures and jewellery... just to name a few of my art addictions.
'This girl needs help you say"",    'YES I do!'


What Happened?

All was good in the land of Kaz, until one day I had to quit my beloved job working with an old school Upholsterer, very sad.  I have neck and back issues which were severely aggravated by my labor intensive job.

 
My job search efforts have not unfolded a suitable job, one that caters for fluctuating pain levels. I need to sit or stand for short periods, mixing it up,   soooo.... guess what?  I intend to pursue my creative journey full time, making and selling jewellery, paintings and prints, quirky dolls, altered art, garden murals and holding art classes in my studio to pass on my knowledge. Self employment allows me to sit or stand as needed. I also commence studying Micro Business at the end of February.  Here is some more of the work I will be making:

The help that I'm seeking
Something cool will come your way too!
 I have a 6m x 5m shed which is HALF lined and insulated, potentially the perfect studio for 
any quirky artist. 

In order to make a living I need to finish lining my studio. I have virtually all of the materials ready to go. The only space I have to work at the moment is the corner of my dining table. A lot of my materials are still packed in the studio so they don't get dirty which makes them difficult to access... frustrating too!

The $1200 I am attempting to raise:



  Is to pay a lovely builder man to finish lining the walls and ceiling- $500

  To connect the power, the cables are run but not connected - $350

  To purchase a cheap little second hand shed so I can remove all my tools and shed type things out of the studio space. $100

  This amount also assists with materials for 'perks' and Indiegogo fees 



If $500 is my total in contributions that would be fantastic too! I would have the walls and ceiling in the studio lined and just run a power cord from the house. Obviously I'd love to have the whole lot of work completed but I would still be up and running, which is my main aim.
Once upon a perfect day I would have completed the studio lining myself, I did 
the first half! The studio is too dirty and hot, with the Aussie climate, to use 
as is. I work a lot with fabric too so I need a clean space.

What you get...

I'm not asking for 'money for nothing'. What I'm essentially 
doing is Pre-selling my art and craft to fund the work on my studio so I can start working. I have chosen 'flexible funding' for this campaign, which means if my $1200 goal is not met I still  get to keep what you have contributed, and you will still receive the Perk that you have chosen. Any contribution would make an amazing difference to me and help towards getting me up and running in my business. 
Here's where you come in. . . . 
$10 Perk 

Huge massive thank you and 3 x 2-1/4"" badges of your choice from my characters below 'Adventures of Pip and Todd', posted to you. These guys were originally painted onto rather tired 1970's paintings, I brightened them up :-)

<div>Hi! We are The Cheesecake Calendar! We are a queer, inclusive pin-up calendar designed BY and FOR queer people. We are creating this calendar because we feel that there is a lack of representative erotic and beauty photography directed towards us and the rest of our community. The idea of a calendar came from its iconography and our desire to infiltrate the mainstream and reclaim more symbols, while making something that people can comfortably hang on their walls. Also, we just wanted to bring you 12 pictures of hot babes! </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $4500, and that will cover everything needed for this project, from studio rentals and bridge fare to props and lighting equipment. It also includes the first printing of 200 calendars and shipping them anywhere in the world*. </p>
<p>We're working both on location in the San Francisco Bay Area and in a rental studio, which will cost an estimated $600 for 12 hours of studio work, and renting various lighting equipment (strobes, batteries, softboxes, etc) for some of the location shoots. </p>
<p>Due to the variety of shoots planned, props will vary considerably. We're planning on buying things like a deerstalker cap, a cat harness, Christmas socks, and makeup products. We will be buying pies and warm drinks for various shoots, as well a variety of gourds and squash and A LOT of baby wipes. </p>
<p>Finally, the funding for the calendar itself. We are requesting funds to produce, print and ship exactly 215 calendars. We are using a family-owned printing company located in the southeastern USA for both the calendar itself all perk prints, and will be shipping everything manually from the Bay Area. We also plan on throwing a small party to launch the calendar some time in November. </p>
<p>Now the fun stuff - PERKS. We know not everyone will be able to afford the $20 calendar, so we're added perks at a lower cost. For $5, you get a thank-you email from the founders, while for $10 you get a small print and thank-you letter sealed with a kiss. </p>
<p>$20 is the base cost for us to produce a calendar, so that's how much we're asking.</p>
<p>For $50 you get a calendar signed by one of the models - for $75 you get a calendar signed by ALL of the models. </p>
<p>We're planning on throwing a launch party in November - for $150, you'll be sent an invitation for two along with the autographed calendar. </p>
<p>Finally, for $250, you'll be sent all of that - a calendar signed by everyone, a thank-you letter, a small print and two tickets to the launch party, AND you'll be given a donor thank you on all our social media and in the calendar itself!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, priority one is making sure the shoots are completed. Second priority will be getting calendars to as many of our backers as we can. No matter what, we will be selling prints and calendars on Redbubble come December. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><sub>* Due to the high cost of international shipping, we request that you add an additional $15 to your donation. </sub></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Intention</h3>
<div>We and nearly everyone we know has felt at one time underrepresented and often as a result, unattractive. We want to change that. There is a huge range of what is considered beautiful or hot, and our goal is to showcase as many types as we can. While we can't undo the erasure of queer identities we all experience, we hope to in our own way bring the amazing beauty and hotness of our community to the front and - most importantly - make people feel like babes just by being who they are. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our biggest risk is not raising enough money to complete all of our shoots. Once principle photography is completed, we have the resources to change plans if necessary and ensure that some form of this product gets out into the world.  </p>

Well, we are about 20 individuals from all around the world who share the same passion for migrants rights. What we also share is a love for art.That's when it hit us! Let's create a booklet with illustrations about the different rights of migrant workers in order to provide everyone (migrants, politicians, NGOS, activists and anyone interested) with the necessary knowledge to understand the Convention.



The booklet will explain the Convention in simple, easy to understand language and use works of art to illustrate the rights of migrants.  The completed project is expected to be released on International Migrants Day and in Celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the United Nations Migrant Workers Convention on  December 18, 2015. Its name? You guessed right: Illustrate Our Rights!

<p></p>
<p>Halloween was the one time each year I was allowed to play in my mother’s makeup case; I was always so excited!  My mom made our costumes every year;  Later in life, I began sewing my own; not only for Halloween, but for clubbing and photography.  I studied display and Exhibit Design at FIT and started working at MAC Cosmetics in 1994; this is where my makeup training began.  I’m fascinated with the concept of transformation.  I love that makeup, hair and costuming can completely disguise someone.  It’s a moment to become someone else… even if just in one’s own mind.  I think I picked up my first camera at the age of five.  I always loved taking pictures.  I used to spend hours in the darkroom printing my black and white photos...  and then I discovered Photoshop - OH THE OPPORTUNITY!”<br/></p>
<p>I am  a “one-man show”, when making these images- executing the makeup, wigs, photographs, sets, and sewing my own costumes.  The process of creativity is a relaxing experience and by working alone, I’m not held to any timeframe and can experiment without judgment or expectation. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My work draws from memories of childhood  imagination.  The images have a dreamlike quality with subject matter inspired by fairy tales seen through a distorted lens. While not the primary theme, some images do have a homo-erotic undertone in a very fantastic way.  This collection includes self-portraits and expands on the idea by using multi-exposure images to capture various manifestations of myself in one image.  I also features my niece, nicknamed Baby-cakes, in many of the photos.  Her old soul continues to inspire me with her free spirit.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Pensive and retrospective,  I relate to most characters that I create, although some are simply humorous.</span></p>

<p>This is for women all around the world who live
in an unbalanced society.</p>
<p>The women who create boys that grow into men
who forget their worth.</p>
<p>This is for every woman whose sexuality was
fearlessly forgotten. </p>
<p>For every fight for feminine freedom, or
feminist philosophy that went unheard. </p>
<br/><h3>Hello My Loves &lt;3</h3> <ul> <li>Have you ever wonder why a woman's sexuality is so taboo and a man's sexuality is ""Human Nature""? Ever wonder why a young girl is shunned for being sexually active before the age of 30, yet a man is applauded for being sexually ahead of the game at 13? Ever wonderwhy the women who embrace their sexuality are constantly criticized and labeled whores, hoes and harlots, but the world is secretly enticed by said women? I wonder! ALL OF THE TIME, so it is my honor to ask you support me in my exploration of the answer through art.<br/>
</li>
<li> My name is Summer Keiona and I am a freedom fighter and a dream believer! I currently am finishing up my MFA in Acting for Film at New York Film Academy and boy am I excited to dedicate my life to this beautiful craft and exploration of the human experience.</li> <li>This Campaign was created to help fund the first short film from The Stray  Production Group [TSPG] written, and funded solely by little ole me :) This film will encourage its audience to seek freedom from the labels of society and embrace the fullness and beauty of self love, regardless of the stigmas alive in the status quo.</li> <li>With your help, I know a magnificently meaningful piece of art will be produced that aims to free the minds of many, and I am so very grateful for any and all contributions made!</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What ""The Stray Production Group"" Needs &amp; What You Get When You Donate.</span></p>
</div><div> <ul> <li>As of now the goal is to raise $6,000 in order to pay the cast of 8 people and crew of at least 10 people for their handwork and determination. A couple of grand will be used to book a visually stunning location that tells a story in itself and the remainder of the funds will be used to submit the short film to film festivals.</li> <li>The people who support me the most will definitely see their names in lights ( well maybe not lights, but I definitely will dedicate this film to you and give credit of your contribution) I also would love to interview and feature you on my YouTube Chanel to let my subscribers know how awesome you are. If we meet the goal of $6,000 my top supporter will receive a GoPro Hero 4 Silver ) I personally want to thank you for helping me make my dreams into a reality and give you one of my favorite tools used in making great films.</li> <li>If we do not make goal... Let's just focus on making the goal. Dreams come true so together if we focus on manifesting a grade A film, the funds will come!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></h3>
</div><div> <ul> <li>In this business of being an Actress today simply having talent is NOT ENOUGH. Producers and Directors are seeking people with ""Big Names"" because ""Big Names"" equal ""Big Money"" and Hollywood is a ""Big Money Business"". If one doesn't have a ""Big Name"" they must have a ""Big Social Media Following"" and little ole me has neither.

in an unbalanced society.
The women who create boys that grow into men
who forget their worth.
This is for every woman whose sexuality was
fearlessly forgotten. 
For every fight for feminine freedom, or
feminist philosophy that went unheard. 
Hello My Loves <3  Have you ever wonder why a woman's sexuality is so taboo and a man's sexuality is ""Human Nature""? Ever wonder why a young girl is shunned for being sexually active before the age of 30, yet a man is applauded for being sexually ahead of the game at 13? Ever wonderwhy the women who embrace their sexuality are constantly criticized and labeled whores, hoes and harlots, but the world is secretly enticed by said women? I wonder! ALL OF THE TIME, so it is my honor to ask you support me in my exploration of the answer through art.

 My name is Summer Keiona and I am a freedom fighter and a dream believer! I currently am finishing up my MFA in Acting for Film at New York Film Academy and boy am I excited to dedicate my life to this beautiful craft and exploration of the human experience. This Campaign was created to help fund the first short film from The Stray  Production Group [TSPG] written, and funded solely by little ole me :) This film will encourage its audience to seek freedom from the labels of society and embrace the fullness and beauty of self love, regardless of the stigmas alive in the status quo. With your help, I know a magnificently meaningful piece of art will be produced that aims to free the minds of many, and I am so very grateful for any and all contributions made!  What ""The Stray Production Group"" Needs & What You Get When You Donate.
  As of now the goal is to raise $6,000 in order to pay the cast of 8 people and crew of at least 10 people for their handwork and determination. A couple of grand will be used to book a visually stunning location that tells a story in itself and the remainder of the funds will be used to submit the short film to film festivals. The people who support me the most will definitely see their names in lights ( well maybe not lights, but I definitely will dedicate this film to you and give credit of your contribution) I also would love to interview and feature you on my YouTube Chanel to let my subscribers know how awesome you are. If we meet the goal of $6,000 my top supporter will receive a GoPro Hero 4 Silver ) I personally want to thank you for helping me make my dreams into a reality and give you one of my favorite tools used in making great films. If we do not make goal... Let's just focus on making the goal. Dreams come true so together if we focus on manifesting a grade A film, the funds will come!    Risks & Challenges
  In this business of being an Actress today simply having talent is NOT ENOUGH. Producers and Directors are seeking people with ""Big Names"" because ""Big Names"" equal ""Big Money"" and Hollywood is a ""Big Money Business"". If one doesn't have a ""Big Name"" they must have a ""Big Social Media Following"" and little ole me has neither. So, with that being said, it is imperative for artist like myself to create content!
Also many Actresses of color are not given as many opportunities or non-stereotypical parts to play, so nowadays it is easier to stay true to the art and not sell out and play  in yet  another slave movie by writing roles with more dimension and depth.
I plan to start my own production company that solely produces films with depth and meaning, rather than producing films with solely business in mind. This project is the first of many movies made with a strong message in mind.    Other Ways You Can Help 
By simply sharing the word and shedding light on the project on your personal social media platforms will help this dream come into fruition.
Of course money matters, so if you have it to donate, please do :) Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to get this campaign out to the world!   Thank you so much for everything!With Love,-Summer",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>On July 7th I will be having a solo photography show at Fotoeffect Gallery in the Pearl District in Portland, Oregon. This is my first ever solo exhibition on the first Thursday art walk in Portland. It's big opportunity for me, and I'm very excited about it.</p>
<p>I've been doing photography for most of my life, but the last few years have been a period of intense creativity and renewed focus. I've been pushing myself in many ways, both creatively, and technically - deliberately throwing myself into new situations and new experiences with camera in tow.

For this reason this show focuses on the grand landscapes of Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>The idea of a show has been in the back of my mind for a few years, but until now I've chosen to focus on the adventures, and the images, and on honing my craft. Now, this opportunity has come my way, and I've chosen take full advantage of it. This is a dream come true, but my work is truly cut out for me. I have to fill the entire gallery and every print has to be perfect, and I'm determined to do it right. Printing and framing are very expensive, and I have just over a month to pull it all together.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For this reason, I'm asking for your help.

Every penny raised in this campaign will go towards printing, framing and other production costs. Thank you for all of your generous support.

<b>Citroedelic (2.0)  - David Normal's Citroen Art Car Project </b><p>Those of you who know me are aware that I have been a die-hard Citroen enthusiast for many years.  The car pictured above is a 1969 D Special that I purchased in 2005.  Through thick and thin, I have kept this car running as daily transportation.  I put the paint job on in 2012, and transformed the car into ""Citroedelic"", my Citroen 'artcar'.  It garners a lot of attention on the road and even received a write up in <a href=""http://autoweek.com/article/car-news/best-france-and-italy-car-show-shines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Autoweek</a>.<br/><br/>Here are some photos of Citroedelic shortly after it was painted in 2012:<br/></p>

<p>After 90,000 miles and two engines this beautiful car has been gradually succumbing to rust, and then, finally, just the other day, its camshaft broke while I was driving down the 580 in Oakland!  It's time to lay this car to rest.  However, I do NOT want to stop driving Citroens!  My goal is to get a 'new' Citroen (this time a station wagon such as <a href=""https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/cto/5494811776.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/cto/5494811776.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this one</a> for sale on Craigslist) and transform it into a more elaborately beautiful art car.  </p>
<div>I intend to take a Citroen D Station wagon and paint it with fantastic designs, and detail the interior with embroidery, and intricate decoration throughout.  Having driven an imaginatively painted Citroen for several years I know that people really enjoy it.  Often people come along and tell me that seeing my car 'made their day'. At other times it can be quite startling - though flattering -  to have people yelling and honking their horns at me with wild enthusiasm, and very often I return to my parked car to find it ringed with people taking photos.  Its always a conversation starter and I meet a lot of people with the car.  I feel that the car is a rolling piece of public art that people connect with strongly and such radical self-expression is a real contribution to society. </div>

</h3> <p>But my friends call me Hat.</p>
<p>And last year, I began writing and illustrating a book called <i>""How Heather got her HAT'ness back"".</i>..</p>Those of you who read my <a href=""http://www.liveagainsttheflow.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> regularly, will already be familiar with the story and the journey of how this book came to be.  <br/><br/>The GREAT news is that now, after months of work... I am just a few pages away from finishing the book (<i>woooo-hoooo!</i>)...<br/><br/>The... uh... not-so-great news is that I don't have the kind of money required to PRINT and produce the book!<br/><br/>So... (drumroll)...  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>I need help to get this book printed!<br/>
</h3> <p>My book is a full-colour, 64-page book.  And printing of this kind is not cheap.</p>
<p>We need to raise $5000.  And this is what the money will pay for:<br/></p>
<ul> <li>The printing of the books.  I will be using a local South African company (Paarl printers) who have a fantastic reputation for printing quality books and magazines (they're also one of the few printing companies who make an effort to be as kind to the environment as possible).<br/>
</li> <li>Setting up the ISBN number and the barcode.<br/>
</li> <li>Shipping fees (and packaging) to send copies of the book (and various prezzies) to backers all over the world... (most of my blog readers - and the people who have expressed an interest in this book - live in the US, Canada, Europe, Australia &amp; New Zealand).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically - I can't do this without your help.  If I had an extra $5000, I wouldn't hesitate to fund this project myself...  but - I don't - so - now I just kinda need to take a big, fat leap of faith and rely on a couple of generous peeps to help me.</p>
<p>And... as a way of expressing my deep gratitude for your support... I've added a couple of perks and goodies for backers (check out the ""Perks"" column on the right).<br/></p>

</h3>
<b>So, what's the book about?</b><br/>It's an illustrated poem - written in the most ME'ish way (messy, raw and as honest as I can possibly be)... about my personal story.<br/><br/>It's about how I misplaced my MUCH'ness (to coin a phrase by the Mad Hatter).  It's about how I tried soooo hard to ""fit-in""... and ""be normal""... and live up to a whole bunch of burdensome expectations placed upon my life by other people... and, in doing so... I slowly lost touch with The Real Me.<br/><br/>The book delves into how wearing masks and inauthentic living can have a terribly damaging affect on our emotions and self-esteem.<br/><br/>And the story follows my (slow) journey... full-circle... and celebrates my return to my ""HAT'ness""... and why I think it's so vital for folk to just *BE* themselves!<br/><b><br/>Is it a children's book?</b><br/>No.  <br/>I guess the obvious assumption would be that it's a children's book (since most children's books are illustrated).  But originally, I intended this book for adults...  people a bit like me... creative creatures... those who had always struggled to *fit* in with <i>""normal""</i> life and <i>""normal""</i> ways and<i> ""normal"" </i>aspirations.  <br/><br/>While I wrote and drew, I was thinking of folk who have always felt a bit strange... as though they are outliers... those who are prone to think of themselves as ""broken"" or ""abnormal""... simply because they're NOT like everyone else.<br/><br/>The book opens with an almost child-like feel (which I intended - because I wanted to introduce readers to the messy, colourful world of ""Hat"")... but after that, it turns a bit dark and serious for a while... and there's a couple of themes in there that may not be appropriate for young children or tweens.<br/><br/>My story covers things like depression, eating disorders, self-abuse and infidelity.<br/><br/>There's nothing TOO hectic (ie:  there's no nudity, violence, gore or f-words)... but I would definitely suggest parental guidance for those with younger kids.<br/><br/>One of the darkest verses (if not <i>*the*</i> darkest verse) goes like this:<br/><br/><i>""And she tumbled down into a pit of despair<br/>and binged on cheese pizzas and plucked out her hair<br/>and piled on the kilos - and tried not to care<br/>and punished herself for her husband's affair""</i><br/><br/>But in the end - it all ends VERY happily, of course!  :-)<br/><br/>(As a side note, my children are 9 and 7 and we've read it a couple of times and they LOVE it... but then again - it is *my* story... and they <i>really</i> wanted to read ""Mommy's Story"").<br/><b><br/>Will there be a children's version of this book in the future?</b><br/><br/>Yes!!!<br/>After the feedback I received from blog readers, I QUICKLY realised that there's a massive need for a story like this for children!  <br/><br/>There are still WAY too many young ""Hat's"" in the world who are feeling bullied and pressured to change... and diminish... and *fix* themselves... and be something that they're NOT meant to be.<br/><br/>So - as soon as <i>this</i> book has been printed...

<li>Backers of the campaign will be the first people on the planet to receive copies of the book.  I will not distribute or sell the book to anyone else - until my very-treasured-and-appreciated backers all have their copies (wherever in the world they may be).</li>

<h3></h3>
<p><span>Lady Dye Yarns, LLC is an eco-friendly indie-dye yarn business started in June 2010 that creates vibrant and colorful hand-painted yarns and accessories that are inspired by street art and city living. </span><span>Demands for LDY has</span><span> gone up since the year the company started. In 2011, LDY was in two stores. After attending their first trade show in  2014, The National NeedleArts Association, LDY is now in 30 stores across the nation (14 states). LDY expects to be in 60 stores by the end of 2015. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>The Beginning...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Back in 2010, I took an amazing yarn dyeing workshop in Cambridge, MA and fell in love with hand-painted yarns! Back then, I was solely dyeing yarn for myself and I still remember the day I sat down with my local knitting group at <i>Doyle's Cafe</i> in Jamaica Plain, MA, and started knitting with my own hand-dyed yarn. Then someone suggested I should start selling my hand-painted yarns.<br/></p>
<p>It never crossed my mind before to sell hand-dyed yarn as I was working a full-time job in the non-profit sector. I took that advice and I thought it would be great to make a ""little money on the side."" I became a member in a local artisan group. I participated in my first craft-show, <i>SOWA</i>, in the South End. I received great admiration of my yarn and from there, I decided to start my own fiber arts company. I left my full-time job in April of 2011 to focus my attention on finding part-time work in the arts community while spending the other time growing my business.<br/><br/>In 2013, I was one of the finalist selected in the <i>Merrimack Valley Sandbox Accelerator</i> program (now known as <i>Entrepreneurship for All</i>). I received a business mentor, I laid out a business model that would work for my company, and I received many resources and opportunities through <i>EforAll</i>. At the time, we were only in two stores  and we were selling our yarn on consignment. I knew this was not good enough for Lady Dye Yarns to just be in two stores and I wanted more for my company. I did my first crowdfunding campaign with Indiegogo to attend our first trade show, <i>The National NeedleArts Association (TNNA)</i>, and we raised enough money to go! We had huge success at <i>TNNA</i>! We went from being in two stores in 2014 to our present number of 30 stores nationally and we continue to grow thanks to all of you!<br/><br/>We are entering a new chapter in the company where we are ready to move into space, employ a Business Manager, increase raw material, expand our marketing and branding, and build our working capital. We need your help again to make this happen. We are raising $40,200 to expand the company. <br/><br/></p>

<li><p><span>To be a leading manufacturer in one-of-a-kind yarns focusing on street art.</span></p></li>

</ul>
<div>The focus of our sales reps have been to get LDY yarns into retail/boutique stores. They all receive 15% commission on all orders and reorders. In addition, LDY aims to have three designers (Boston, San Francisco, New York) create urban inspired knitwear for our target audience. As a company, LDY understands that 89% of knitters go online to find yarns, social groups, patterns, etc. Therefore, creating a vibrant website and social media presence, is important to Lady Dye Yarns growth. <br/>

Lady Dye Yarns, LLC is an eco-friendly indie-dye yarn business started in June 2010 that creates vibrant and colorful hand-painted yarns and accessories that are inspired by street art and city living. Demands for LDY has gone up since the year the company started. In 2011, LDY was in two stores. After attending their first trade show in  2014, The National NeedleArts Association, LDY is now in 30 stores across the nation (14 states). LDY expects to be in 60 stores by the end of 2015. 

The Beginning...

Back in 2010, I took an amazing yarn dyeing workshop in Cambridge, MA and fell in love with hand-painted yarns! Back then, I was solely dyeing yarn for myself and I still remember the day I sat down with my local knitting group at Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain, MA, and started knitting with my own hand-dyed yarn. Then someone suggested I should start selling my hand-painted yarns.
It never crossed my mind before to sell hand-dyed yarn as I was working a full-time job in the non-profit sector. I took that advice and I thought it would be great to make a ""little money on the side."" I became a member in a local artisan group. I participated in my first craft-show, SOWA, in the South End. I received great admiration of my yarn and from there, I decided to start my own fiber arts company. I left my full-time job in April of 2011 to focus my attention on finding part-time work in the arts community while spending the other time growing my business.In 2013, I was one of the finalist selected in the Merrimack Valley Sandbox Accelerator program (now known as Entrepreneurship for All). I received a business mentor, I laid out a business model that would work for my company, and I received many resources and opportunities through EforAll. At the time, we were only in two stores  and we were selling our yarn on consignment. I knew this was not good enough for Lady Dye Yarns to just be in two stores and I wanted more for my company. I did my first crowdfunding campaign with Indiegogo to attend our first trade show, The National NeedleArts Association (TNNA), and we raised enough money to go! We had huge success at TNNA! We went from being in two stores in 2014 to our present number of 30 stores nationally and we continue to grow thanks to all of you!We are entering a new chapter in the company where we are ready to move into space, employ a Business Manager, increase raw material, expand our marketing and branding, and build our working capital. We need your help again to make this happen. We are raising $40,200 to expand the company. 
What Will Lady Dye Accomplish


To be a leading manufacturer in one-of-a-kind yarns focusing on street art.
To become a major source for urban inspired knitwear designs
To be come a leader on urban knitting and crafting.

The focus of our sales reps have been to get LDY yarns into retail/boutique stores. They all receive 15% commission on all orders and reorders. In addition, LDY aims to have three designers (Boston, San Francisco, New York) create urban inspired knitwear for our target audience. As a company, LDY understands that 89% of knitters go online to find yarns, social groups, patterns, etc. Therefore, creating a vibrant website and social media presence, is important to Lady Dye Yarns growth.

<ul>
<li> Hi, my name is Jorge Katthain and I´m a visual artist dedicated to sculpture and bespoke limited edition jewelry.</li>
<li><strong>Briefly describe your campaign and explain why is it important for you</strong></li>
<li>The main purpose of my Project is to pursue a collective understandment of the importance of living in harmony with nature and animal species. I strongly believe that by doing so we can reach a type of knowledge that is key for our evolution as ¨HumAnimal¨ species.</li>
<li><p><strong>Describe the magnitude of what the collaborators help will achieve.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>With the support of each and every of the contributors not only will the exhibition be possible but the message  of respect and love towards our spiritual teachers (the animal species) will be spread and shared creating a powerfull acknowledgement of the importance of having an harmonic relationship with nature and every living form of life within it.</p></li>
</ul> </div><div>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explain how much funding you need and where is it going. Be specific and honest, people need to trust you so they want to fund your project.</strong></p> <ul>
<li>The necessary fund is $18,500 USD which will be used for purchasing the basic materials for the sculptures production, labour costs to achieve my vision and all of the required elements for promotion, montage and exhibition curatorship.</li>
<li>The materials to be used for the sculptures production in bronze and resin are as follow:</li>
<li>Rubber, Fiber Glass, Resin,Catalyzing Chemical, Fabric Cloth and Brushes for the  production of molds which will be used for wax or resin casting in order to make the sculptures in bronze or in resin for the 22 inch high sculpture. The process behind  bronze sculpture production is known as lost wax casting and it is performed at a specialized foundry of sculpture production.</li>
<li>Iron and Bronze to physically materialize the pieces. Bronze is used for the sculptures creation and for the supporting base Iron. Labour costs are considered within the essential elements to reach the sculpture´s totallity.</li>
<li>Resin, Catalyzing Chemical, Fiber Glass and Iron for the 220 Inch Tall Sculpture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Describe the funding destination in case of not achieving the main goal.</strong></p>
<ul><li>In case of not achieving the main goal, the funds will be destined to the production of sculptures that can be made with the collected ammount as, formaly speaking, the commitment that I have with my work has given me besides many other things, discipline, patience and persistance recognition as necessary values in any growth form wether it might be personal or professional.</li></ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explain your campaign in a more detailed way and tell the people the difference that their contribution will make. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In my career path I have sculpted forms that somehow represent esotericism or mystical space. Every time that I do, the idea of the reptile, the feline, some insects or the skull have started to acquire a dominant focus in my work. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that of all animals, the archetype of the reptile, the feline, the beetle or the cricket carry that symbol of esotericism or mysticism. Mythologically speaking, they maintain their place in human imagery and tales or stories that involve that sence of mistery or esotericism.</li>
<li>In my work, the tales of this understandment carry a sense of shamanic story which seek to reach the physical and spiritual presence of animal form and of beings that may resemble a ¨human¨form but to my understanding they are beings or guardians of a higher level or collective consciousness. With the combination of both elements, I consider it to carry in one way, that sence of mistery in the understandment of (that intermediary space) our HumAnimal mision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and everyone else.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Connecting with people or nature gives life a deeper sence of meaning. To amplify the universal language of love and respect  through life recognition could be a way of rising our vibration with a clear sence of continuity and evolution. This is why I consider my project to be valuable because not only raises awareness on the importance of having a harmonious relationship with nature and animal species but also encourages us to briefly meditate on our own mortality in order to value any life form. Furthermore, my project presents collectors and contributors a phenomenal option of investment in the art market instead of  investing in bonds or stocks.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Building trust</strong></p>
<ul><li>I trully value your support so in order to show my respect, I will be uploading and updating my campaign with images or videos of the production process so you can witness the advance of my campaign through Indiegogo (katthainsculpture), Facebook (HumAnimal) and Instagram (jkatthain).  </li></ul>
<p> <strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>People value transparency. Be open and highlight the risk and challenge perspective that you might face on your way to achieving your goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>My honesty, unbreakable conviction and persistance on achieving the main goal is definitely a solid value that makes me reliable and trustworthy to count with your support.  </li>
<li>One of the challenges that I might face is not being on schedule for the sculptures production so it is essential to have your support as often as possible. I will trully appreciate you spreading the word out on contributing my campaign.</li>
<li>Time is crucial for the sculptures and exhibition production. This is why your financial support will give me serenity enough to focus on the creative process.</li>
<li>To be part of the solution, I will engage with people through social media by personally taking time to answer their questions or any other doubt that might surface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other ways of helping</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is to my understanding that not everyone may be able to financially contribute so I only ask  if you could be so kind to share my campaign with your friends, family or any other group of people that could help me reach my goal.  </li>

<p><strong>Resumen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preséntate y cuenta tu historia.</strong></li>
<li>Hola, soy Jorge Katthain artista plástico dedicado a la escultura y creador de piezas edición limitada de joyería. </li>
<li><strong>Describe brevemente tu campaña y explica por qué es importante para ti.</strong></li>
<li>El propósito principal de mi proyecto es buscar un entendimiento colectivo de la importancia de vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y la especie animal. Creo firmemente que al hacerlo, podremos alcanzar un tipo de conocimiento clave para nuestra evolución como especie ¨HumAnimal.</li>
<li><strong>Expresa la magnitud de lo que logrará la ayuda de los colaboradores.</strong></li>
<li>Con el apoyo de cada uno de los contribuidores, no solo la exposición será posible sino el mensaje de amor y respeto hacia nuestros maestros espirituales (la especie animal) será expandido y compartido creando un poderoso reconocimiento de la importancia de tener una relación armónica con la naturaleza y toda forma de vida en ella.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3>
<ul><li><strong>explica cuánto financiamiento necesitas y a dónde va. Sé transparente y específico, la gente necesita confiar en ti para que quiera financiarte.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>El fondeo necesario es de $325,000 MXN los cuales serán utilizados para comprar los materiales básicos para la producción de las esculturas, la mano de obra empleada para lograr mi visión y todos los elementos requeridos para la promoción, montaje y curaduría de la exposición.</li>
<li>Los materiales a utilizar para la producción de las esculturas en bronce y resina son los siguientes:</li>
<li>Silicón, Fibra de Vidrio, Resina, Catalizador, Manta de Cielo, Estopa y Brochas para la producción de los moldes; los cuales servirán para vaciar cera o resina en su interior y poder realizar las piezas de bronce ó, en el caso de la escultura de 3 mts de altura, resina. Al proceso de producción de esculturas en bronce se le conoce como Vaciado de Bronce a la Cera Perdida y se realiza en una Fundición especializada en la creación de esculturas de cualquier formato.</li>
<li>Bronce y Fierro para materializar las piezas físicamente. El bronce se utiliza para la creación de la escultura y el Fierro para la base sobre la cual será montada. La mano de obra requerida está considerada dentro de los elementos indispensables para lograr la totalidad de la pieza.</li>
<li>Resina, Catalizador, Fibra de Vidrio y Fierro para la producción de la escultura de 3 mts de altura. ​</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Describe a dónde van los fondos si no logras la meta total.</strong></p>
<ul><li>En caso de no lograr la meta total, los fondos serán destinados a la producción de esculturas que se puedan lograr con el monto recaudado ya que formalmente hablando, el compromiso con mi trabajo me ha dado a demás de muchas otras cosas, el reconocimiento de la disciplina, la paciencia y persistencia como valores necesarios en cualquier formación personal o profesional. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>El impacto</h3> <p><strong>Explica tu campaña en mayor detalle y cuéntale a la gente la diferencia que hará su contribución:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>En mi carrera profesional he esculpido formas que de alguna manera representan esoterismo o espacio místico.Cada vez que lo hago, la idea del reptil, el felino, algunos insectos ó el cráneo, han comenzado a adquirir un enfoque dominante en mi obra.Tal vez tenga que ver con el hecho que, de todos los animales, para mí, el arquetipo del reptil, del felino, de los escarabajos o los grillos  llevan ese símbolo de esoterismo o misticismo. Mitológicamente hablando, mantienen su lugar en la imaginación humana y relatos o historias que involucran un sentido de misterio o esoterismo.</li>
<li>En mi obra los relatos de este entendimiento llevan un sentido o historia  chamánica la cual procura alcanzar la presencia física y espiritual de la forma animal y de seres que si bien asemejan una forma ¨humana¨ son a mi entendimiento seres superiores o vigilantes de un orden mayor o consciencia colectiva. Con la combinación de ambos elementos, considero  que de alguna manera acarrea este sentido de misterio en el entendimiento de (ese espacio intermediario) nuestra misión HumAnimal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explica porqué tu campaña es valiosa para los contribuidores y para todo el mundo.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Conectar con la gente o la naturaleza nos da un sentido más profundo del sentido de la vida. Amplificar el lenguaje universal del amor y el respeto a través del reconocimiento hacia la vida puede ser una manera de elevar nuestra vibración con un sentido claro de dontinuidad y evolución. Por esto, considero que mi proyecto es valioso no sólo porque eleva nuestra conciencia de la importancia de tener una relación armónica con la naturaleza y la especie animal pero también brevemente nos alenta a meditar sobre nuestra propia mortalidad con el fin de valorar cualquier forma existente de vida. Por otra parte, mi proyecto ofrece una opción fenomenal de inversión en el mercado del arte a coleccionistas y contribuidores en lugar de invertir en bonos o acciones.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Generando Confianza</strong></p>
<ul><li>Verdaderamente valoro tu apoyo así que para mostrar mi respeto, estaré subiendo y actualizando mi campaña con imágenes o videos del proceso de producción para que puedas presenciar el avance de la campaña a través de Indiegogo (katthainsculpture) Facebook (HumAnimal) e Instagram (jkatthain).</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3> <p>Las personas valoran la transparencia. Sé abierto y destácate al ofrecer perspectivas sobre los riesgos y obstáculos que puedes enfrentar en el camino hacia lograr tu meta.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mi honestidad, inquebrantable convicción y persistencia en lograr la meta final son definitivamente sólidos valores que me hacen fiable y confiable para poder contar con tu apoyo.  </li>
<li>Uno de los retos que pudieran presentarse es el no estar a tiempo en la producción así que es esencial tener tu apoyo lo más frecuentemente posible. En verdad te agradeceré mucho el compartir mi campaña  para la contribución en la misma.</li>
<li>El tiempo es crucial para la producción de las esculturas y la exposición. Por esta razón, tu apoyo financiero me dará la tranquilidad suficiente para enfocarme en el proceso creativo.</li>
<li>Para ser parte de la solución, interactuaré con las peronas a través de las redes sociales para responder personalmente las dudas o cualquier otra incertidumbre que pueda surgir.<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span>

In my work, the tales of this understandment carry a sense of shamanic story which seek to reach the physical and spiritual presence of animal form and of beings that may resemble a ¨human¨form but to my understanding they are beings or guardians of a higher level or collective consciousness. With the combination of both elements, I consider it to carry in one way, that sence of mistery in the understandment of (that intermediary space) our HumAnimal mision.

Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and everyone else.
Connecting with people or nature gives life a deeper sence of meaning. To amplify the universal language of love and respect  through life recognition could be a way of rising our vibration with a clear sence of continuity and evolution. This is why I consider my project to be valuable because not only raises awareness on the importance of having a harmonious relationship with nature and animal species but also encourages us to briefly meditate on our own mortality in order to value any life form. Furthermore, my project presents collectors and contributors a phenomenal option of investment in the art market instead of  investing in bonds or stocks.
Building trust
I trully value your support so in order to show my respect, I will be uploading and updating my campaign with images or videos of the production process so you can witness the advance of my campaign through Indiegogo (katthainsculpture), Facebook (HumAnimal) and Instagram (jkatthain).  
 Risks and Challenges
People value transparency. Be open and highlight the risk and challenge perspective that you might face on your way to achieving your goal.

My honesty, unbreakable conviction and persistance on achieving the main goal is definitely a solid value that makes me reliable and trustworthy to count with your support.  
One of the challenges that I might face is not being on schedule for the sculptures production so it is essential to have your support as often as possible. I will trully appreciate you spreading the word out on contributing my campaign.
Time is crucial for the sculptures and exhibition production. This is why your financial support will give me serenity enough to focus on the creative process.
To be part of the solution, I will engage with people through social media by personally taking time to answer their questions or any other doubt that might surface.

Other ways of helping

It is to my understanding that not everyone may be able to financially contribute so I only ask  if you could be so kind to share my campaign with your friends, family or any other group of people that could help me reach my goal.

THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THIS CREATIVE JOURNEY!

Resumen

Preséntate y cuenta tu historia.
Hola, soy Jorge Katthain artista plástico dedicado a la escultura y creador de piezas edición limitada de joyería. 
Describe brevemente tu campaña y explica por qué es importante para ti.
El propósito principal de mi proyecto es buscar un entendimiento colectivo de la importancia de vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y la especie animal. Creo firmemente que al hacerlo, podremos alcanzar un tipo de conocimiento clave para nuestra evolución como especie ¨HumAnimal.
Expresa la magnitud de lo que logrará la ayuda de los colaboradores.
Con el apoyo de cada uno de los contribuidores, no solo la exposición será posible sino el mensaje de amor y respeto hacia nuestros maestros espirituales (la especie animal) será expandido y compartido creando un poderoso reconocimiento de la importancia de tener una relación armónica con la naturaleza y toda forma de vida en ella.

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
explica cuánto financiamiento necesitas y a dónde va. Sé transparente y específico, la gente necesita confiar en ti para que quiera financiarte.

El fondeo necesario es de $325,000 MXN los cuales serán utilizados para comprar los materiales básicos para la producción de las esculturas, la mano de obra empleada para lograr mi visión y todos los elementos requeridos para la promoción, montaje y curaduría de la exposición.
Los materiales a utilizar para la producción de las esculturas en bronce y resina son los siguientes:
Silicón, Fibra de Vidrio, Resina, Catalizador, Manta de Cielo, Estopa y Brochas para la producción de los moldes; los cuales servirán para vaciar cera o resina en su interior y poder realizar las piezas de bronce ó, en el caso de la escultura de 3 mts de altura, resina. Al proceso de producción de esculturas en bronce se le conoce como Vaciado de Bronce a la Cera Perdida y se realiza en una Fundición especializada en la creación de esculturas de cualquier formato.
Bronce y Fierro para materializar las piezas físicamente. El bronce se utiliza para la creación de la escultura y el Fierro para la base sobre la cual será montada. La mano de obra requerida está considerada dentro de los elementos indispensables para lograr la totalidad de la pieza.
Resina, Catalizador, Fibra de Vidrio y Fierro para la producción de la escultura de 3 mts de altura. ​

Describe a dónde van los fondos si no logras la meta total.
En caso de no lograr la meta total, los fondos serán destinados a la producción de esculturas que se puedan lograr con el monto recaudado ya que formalmente hablando, el compromiso con mi trabajo me ha dado a demás de muchas otras cosas, el reconocimiento de la disciplina, la paciencia y persistencia como valores necesarios en cualquier formación personal o profesional. 

El impacto Explica tu campaña en mayor detalle y cuéntale a la gente la diferencia que hará su contribución:

En mi carrera profesional he esculpido formas que de alguna manera representan esoterismo o espacio místico.Cada vez que lo hago, la idea del reptil, el felino, algunos insectos ó el cráneo, han comenzado a adquirir un enfoque dominante en mi obra.Tal vez tenga que ver con el hecho que, de todos los animales, para mí, el arquetipo del reptil, del felino, de los escarabajos o los grillos  llevan ese símbolo de esoterismo o misticismo. Mitológicamente hablando, mantienen su lugar en la imaginación humana y relatos o historias que involucran un sentido de misterio o esoterismo.
En mi obra los relatos de este entendimiento llevan un sentido o historia  chamánica la cual procura alcanzar la presencia física y espiritual de la forma animal y de seres que si bien asemejan una forma ¨humana¨ son a mi entendimiento seres superiores o vigilantes de un orden mayor o consciencia colectiva. Con la combinación de ambos elementos, considero  que de alguna manera acarrea este sentido de misterio en el entendimiento de (ese espacio intermediario) nuestra misión HumAnimal.

Explica porqué tu campaña es valiosa para los contribuidores y para todo el mundo.
Conectar con la gente o la naturaleza nos da un sentido más profundo del sentido de la vida. Amplificar el lenguaje universal del amor y el respeto a través del reconocimiento hacia la vida puede ser una manera de elevar nuestra vibración con un sentido claro de dontinuidad y evolución. Por esto, considero que mi proyecto es valioso no sólo porque eleva nuestra conciencia de la importancia de tener una relación armónica con la naturaleza y la especie animal pero también brevemente nos alenta a meditar sobre nuestra propia mortalidad con el fin de valorar cualquier forma existente de vida. Por otra parte, mi proyecto ofrece una opción fenomenal de inversión en el mercado del arte a coleccionistas y contribuidores en lugar de invertir en bonos o acciones.
Generando Confianza
Verdaderamente valoro tu apoyo así que para mostrar mi respeto, estaré subiendo y actualizando mi campaña con imágenes o videos del proceso de producción para que puedas presenciar el avance de la campaña a través de Indiegogo (katthainsculpture) Facebook (HumAnimal) e Instagram (jkatthain).

Riesgos y desafíos Las personas valoran la transparencia. Sé abierto y destácate al ofrecer perspectivas sobre los riesgos y obstáculos que puedes enfrentar en el camino hacia lograr tu meta.

Mi honestidad, inquebrantable convicción y persistencia en lograr la meta final son definitivamente sólidos valores que me hacen fiable y confiable para poder contar con tu apoyo.  
Uno de los retos que pudieran presentarse es el no estar a tiempo en la producción así que es esencial tener tu apoyo lo más frecuentemente posible. En verdad te agradeceré mucho el compartir mi campaña  para la contribución en la misma.
El tiempo es crucial para la producción de las esculturas y la exposición. Por esta razón, tu apoyo financiero me dará la tranquilidad suficiente para enfocarme en el proceso creativo.
Para ser parte de la solución, interactuaré con las peronas a través de las redes sociales para responder personalmente las dudas o cualquier otra incertidumbre que pueda surgir. 



Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar Algunas personas no pueden colaborar, pero eso no significa que no puedan ayudar: Comprendo que no todos podrán contribuir de manera financiera así que tan sólo te pido si fueras tan amable de compartir mi campaña con amigos, familiares o cualquier otro grupo de personas que pudieran ayudarme a alcanzar la meta.

To continue its work of providing art as an inspiring force in San Francisco and the Bay Area, San Francisco Women Artists (SFWA) seeks your support of our historic nonprofit arts organization. A presence in the San Francisco arts community since 1887, SFWA remains committed to the impact of art by increasing the representation of women in the arts and the encouragement of aspiring young artists.Your tax-deductible gift will help secure the continuation of our living legacy as we support regional artists and provide a welcoming gallery space in which the wider community may experience the vivifying and humanizing influence of art created by women. To maintain this commitment requires a sustained vision, personal sacrifice, and ongoing financial support. Therefore, we are asking you to consider an investment in SFWA now to support San Francisco Women Artists in its first-ever public fundraising campaign and assist us in meeting our fundraising goal of $25,000. Why DonationsSFWA is supported in part by our member artists, gallery sales, outreach programs, individual donations and by various grants from the San Francisco Arts Commission: SF Grants for the Arts, Neighborhood Arts Collaborative, and the Voluntary Arts Contribution Fund. SFWA actively researches and applies for such grants, and has been awarded three grants this past year. Despite this recognition and support, the future of SFWA—like the future of many other San Francisco based arts organizations—is at risk.Once a thriving mecca for aspiring artists, affordable spaces for artists to exhibit their work in San Francisco have rapidly disappeared, and many galleries have been forced to shutter their doors due to surging operating costs. In the bustling Inner Sunset, SFWA is one of a handful of community-based galleries remaining in the City; however, SFWA is also faced with the very real possibility that our historic nonprofit organization will not survive if we are unable to gain philanthropic support.Your support will help ensure SFWA continues:
Hosting monthly juried exhibits and regional art competitions
Providing affordable space rental opportunities for Bay Area artists
Mentoring interns through the Mayor’s Youth Education & Employment Program (MYEEP)
Featuring youth art exhibits in the gallery’s Artist Salon
Providing a welcoming venue for the community to actively engage with local artists

<p><strong>What is Flint Magazine?</strong><br/><a href=""http://www.flintmagazine.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Flint</i></a> is an art magazine about rocks.

</div></div>","The Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, a Tampa based non profit arts organization dedicated to exhibiting important photographic art as central to contemporary life and culture launches this campaign  to bring to Tampa the exhibition VAIVEN: Six visual journeys back and forth between Spain and the US to celebrate the Hispanic heritage month this October 2015.  



Your contributions will help reaching the remaining funds needed to bring the exhibition to Tampa for almost three months and organize additional activities such as gallery talks and workshops with the artist. 


About the exhibition

With the goal of serving the museum's diverse audience through enriching works by a wide array of domestic and international photographers

the exhibition is an open dialogue about multicultural identities and heritage, migration, and cultural assimilation though the eyes of six Spanish-American photographers. The dichotomy of belonging to two places and the constant play between the influence of cultural background versus the setting, remains the core of this exhibition. Memories, popular culture, identity, the every day life, nature and urban spaces function as starting points to analyze the motivations and expectations that lie behind each photographic series.


The diverse backgrounds of all the artists meet on the common grounds of their intersecting perspectives of both countries. 
Considering Tampa's multicultural diversity and its strong Spanish heritage, many Tampanians, with or without Spanish background, will identify of the topics addressed  with the visual journeys proposed by  contributing artists Ana Hayes-Pérez,  Raúl Urbina,  Xavier Nuez, Javier Corso, Monica Lek, & Carla Tramullas. 
Meet the artists and its works by clicking on their names or watching the following video (in English and Spanish) 


Thank you for helping us bring new and diverse voices to the museum through thought-provoking exhibits like 

Vaiven: Six visual journey's back and forth between Spain &  the US



What We Need & What You Get
 The $2,850 dollars will help covering part of the expenses of installing, uninstalling  and maintaining the exhibit in FMOPA for three months as well as organizing parallel exhibits such as gallery talks and workshops. 
The exhibit already receives support from  Spain Arts & Culture, the Spanish official cultural program in the U.S. that aims to create multiple links between the creative sectors of Spain and the US to cover production and transportation costs, but we still need additional  funds to make the project come to live in Tampa. 
In addition to showing  your name in our THANK YOU wall at the exhibit, you will receive THANK YOU gifts for your contributions such as photobooks,  museum memberships, photography workshops, photo sessions and personal photography lessons with luxusphotography.com  & award winning photographer & FMOPA's instructor Jeremy Scott.

<p>In March 2015, before Heidi travelled to Senegal to plan her fashion
project, she was having Senegalese tea at Alioune &amp; Anne’s place in Geneva. The
discussion on happiness, travelling, cultural differences and realising one’s
dreams inspired us to create this project.</p>
<p>Heidi:<i> “Alioune told me about these young men in Touba Djigane, they have
their families in big cities but are determined to make their life the hard way
and cultivate the land. I wanted to go there, find out why, and see this project
myself. Alioune has spent himself some time working there, by hand, and it’s
his long time dream to be able to send them a tractor. At Touba Djigane I met
good-hearted, motivated men, who are passionate about agriculture and happy to
work under the hot sun and live simple life.” 

</i></p><p>Many people in Senegal still imagine money grows on trees in Europe, and
life is easy. They do everything to get here, because it’s difficult to make
life in Senegal. Our motivation is to help people who don’t run after
illusions, but are ready to work to make their lives. In Senegal it’s difficult
to have the material needed for working.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430742443/ta57zll54ex5fmg6uq5t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<h3><b>The<span> Agriculture Project</span></b></h3>
<p>The land in this area is very rich and can provide lot of vegetables and
fruits. The young men have 14 hectares of land, but because this land has never
been prepared for agriculture, the first steps are difficult. Despite of that,
in the previous years they have already prepared one part of the area (2 hectares)
by hand, with help of a horse and a donkey. Currently they continue doing their
best with what they have. </p>
<p>In Senegal there’s 3 months of the rainy season, during which everything
turns green and people can cultivate their lands, and if they work well they
can gain enough to live the next 9 months before the next cultivating season. A
tractor in Touba Djigane would make a big difference on people’s lives. They
could turn over much more land and cultivate it all this year. With the
products that they can sell, they could also buy animals. People who live in
the villages in this area are passionate about agriculture, and only thing
slowing down making their life by cultivating their lands is the lack of
equipment. They need a tractor, and eventually also a watering system to be
able to cultivate all year round, but for now the tractor would make a big step
for advancing, if they get it before the rainy season starts.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430743347/y9fxs4zgbldzdgnyfpfv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<h3><b>The Tractor </b></h3>
<p>The price for a new tractor is 12 000 - 15 000 €. We have found this
second hand tractor in Spain for 3700 € (= 4150 dollars) and we’d like to buy and send it to Touba
Djigane before the rainy season. The tractor is suitable for the use in
Senegal. The tractor has now been reserved for us until the end of this
campaign, and if this project will be successfully financed, the owner of the
tractor will send it to Senegal in a container.<span> 
There are no custom fees for importing agriculture equipment to Senegal.
It will take 10 days to get to Senegal, and Abdou and Ibrahim will go and
receive the tractor, and bring it to the village. Also Alioune will arrive from
Switzerland in the beginning of July with his family and they’ll confirm everything
goes smoothly. They will also update us all with photos from Touba Djigane when
our friends can start working with the tractor! </span></p>
<p><b><i>All money you send goes directly to the tractor and the costs
it takes to send it to Senegal.</i> </b>Sending costs about 1000 € and this website platform keeps also a small percentage of the payments, so the budget is really only on the tractor. In case we'd receive more money than our goal is, we could buy other equipment to go with the tractor. Even a small contribution makes a difference! 10 dollars is about 9 euros at the moment. <i> <br/></i></p><p align=""right""><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430737538/ogmdomxsl9grzeptnbk1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 470.432px; height: 265px;""/></i></p><p></p><p><b>Plan B : </b>If we won't have enough money by the end of the 
campaign, you can still be sure the money goes to the tractor. We will 
then organize musical evenings to fundraise to complete the project. In this case it might take 
more time before we get the tractor to Touba Djigane, so we really hope 
to reach our goal. </p><p></p>

</h3><ul>
<li>
<b>They work hard and show results. </b>These young men have during 6 years
showed that they can plan things, work and make it happen. If they have the
means they can cultivate all the land they have and produce a lot this year, as
well as help the people in the villages nearby.</li>
<li>
<b>Small thing for us, big for them.</b> With a small contribution we can make
a big difference. We believe in supporting hardworking, good hearted people who
show they are capable of using well the resources they have at hand.</li>
<li>
<b>Good example for other young people.</b> We want more people to stay
motivated and work, instead of trying to take boats to Europe in hopes of a better
life. Many die on these trips, many are sent back as soon as they reach Spain,
and those who get to Europe don’t really find jobs and the dream of the better
life proves to be an illusion. We want to raise awareness on this and help
people realise there are better options, and support those who are working to
make their life in a good and constructive way.</li>
</ul><p>Alioune: “<i>It's my friends in Touba Djigane. I was there in 2009 when the project started, and I spent there one month and helped them to cut the bushes and prepare the 2 hectares of land that they're using now. I return there every year to see my friends, and they are very determined to do good work, despite the challenging circumstances. The project is advancing all the time, and I'd really like to help them.</i>”</p>
<p>Anne: “<i>I've lived 2 years in Senegal in a small village with similar conditions as Touba Djigane. I've seen the farmers sweat under the hot sun working with only a donkey, a horse, even without any help, just with the tools they had. The life is hard and how their families will live by the rest of the year depends completely on what they manage to cultivate during these three months. Would a farmer here work without a tractor? It's such a small investment compared to what an enormous change it can make in people's daily life. It is really worth joining our forces to support these people, and together we can do it.""</i> <br/></p>
<p>Heidi: <i>“I went to Touba Djigane in April 2015 and got to know the people
there. They have understood that the good life and happiness does not come with
easily gained wealth, but believe in working and constructing, and having peace
of mind and heart. I find that very admirable and I really want to help them
realize their dream. They make a good example for all of us, and really need
and deserve this tractor.”</i></p>

<div> <h2>Envoyons ce tracteur au Sénégal avant les pluies !<br/>
</h2>
<p>Dans le village de brousse de Touba Djigane, dans la région de Kaolack, un petit projet agricole mobilise 11 jeunes hommes entre 25 et 40 ans qui ont décidé de rester et ont préféré cultiver leur terre plutôt que d'embarquer sur d'incertaines pirogues. <br/><br/>En mars 2015, avant que Heidi ne parte au Sénégal pour planifier son projet de mode, elle est venue boire le thé sénégalais chez Alioune et Anne à Genève. Le discussion sur le bonheur, les voyages, les différences culturelles et la réalisation de nos rêves a inspiré monter ce projet pour Touba Djigane.<br/><br/>Heidi : « <i>Alioune m'a parlé de ces jeunes gens de Touba Djigane ; leurs familles sont loin dans des grandes villes mais ils ont choisi de cultiver la terre, un choix difficile. J'ai voulu aller là-bas pour comprendre ce choix et voir le projet par moi-même. Alioune a lui-même passé du temps à Touba Djigane pour aider à défricher à la main et il rêve depuis longtemps de leur envoyer un tracteur. A Touba Djigane, j'ai rencontré des hommes de coeur, motivés, passionnés par le travail de la terre et heureux de travailler, même dur, sous le soleil et de mener une vie simple.</i> »<br/></p>
<p>Au Sénégal, beaucoup de gens pensent encore qu'en Europe l'argent pousse sur des arbres et que la vie y est facile. Ils font tout pour tenter la traversée parce que la vie au Sénégal est difficile. Notre motivation est d'aider des gens qui ne courent pas après des illusions mais sont prêts à travailler pour gagner leur vie. Une des difficultés qui se présente à eux au Sénégal est le manque de matériel et d'équipement adéquat.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430777585/buq6kxvmhmgzkjb8vhhu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Le projet agricole<br/>
</h3>
<p>La terre de Touba Djigane est très fertile et peut produire beaucoup de céréales, fruits et légumes. Les jeunes qui travaillent dans ce projet ont 14 hectares à disposition, mais seules leurs mains et leur force pour travailler. Les premiers pas sont donc difficiles. S'ils ont tout défriché, ils ne sont pourtant en mesure de cultiver que deux hectares, puisqu'ils ont pour seule aide un cheval que la charrue épuise rapidement. Au quotidien, ils font de leur mieux avec les moyens à disposition.<br/>Or, le rendement dépend de la surface cultivée. <br/></p>
<p>En effet, au Sénégal, la saison des pluies ne dure que 3 mois, de juillet à septembre. Tout verdit alors et c'est exclusivement durant cette période que les paysans produisent la récolte des 9 mois les séparant de la prochaine saisons des pluies. 2 hectares exploitable, c'est donc très peu. Un tracteur serait un énorme plus pour ces jeunes cultivateurs et les paysans des villages alentours; ils pourraient labourer et cultiver toute la surface disponible et obtenir ainsi une récolte plus abondante pour la population locale et pour la vente. Les bénéfices permettraient également d'acheter des vaches et des moutons.<br/><br/>Les gens des villages aiment leur terre, mais le manque d'équipement performant rend leur travail et leur vie terriblement difficiles. Ils ont réellement besoin d'un tracteur et même à terme d'un système d'irrigation pour cultiver au-delà de la saison des pluies, mais pour l'heure, au seuil de la saison des pluies, un tracteur ferait déjà toute la différence.<br/></p>

<h3>Le tracteur</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Un tracteur neuf coûte entre 12 000 - 15 000 €. Nous avons trouvé un tracteur d'occasion en Espagne pour 3700 € (= 4150 $) et nous souhaiterions vivement pouvoir l'acheter et l'envoyer au Sénégal. Ce tracteur convient parfaitement à une utilisation au Sénégal. Il est réservé pour nous jusqu'à la fin de cette campagne et, si le projet rassemble le financement nécessaire, l'actuel propriétaire du tracteur pourra le faire transporter au Sénégal par container. Afin de favoriser des initiatives comme celles des jeunes de Touba Djigane, le gouvernement sénégalais a décidé d'exempter de frais de douane tout le matériel agricole importé au Sénégal. Le transport durera 10 jours et Abdou et Ibrahim viendront réceptionner le tracteur à Dakar et le transporter jusqu'au village. Alioune et sa famille arriveront aussi au Sénégal début juillet et ils pourront confirmer la bonne marche des opérations. Ils pourront faire parvenir des photos des premières utilisations du tracteur.<br/><br/><i><b>Tout l'argent envoyé ira directement à l'achat du tracteur et aux frais de transport de ce dernier.</b> </i>Les frais de transport s'élèvent environ à 1000€ et le site par lequel nous menons la campagne garde aussi un petit pourcentage des versements effectués. 10$ valent actuellement environ 9€.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430777791/kxyvd48r1hblcggjlwni.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 482.886px; height: 272px;""/></p>
<p><b>Plan B :</b> Si nous ne parvenons pas à réunir la somme prévue au terme de la campagne, nous vous assurons néanmoins que le montant atteint ira intégralement à l'achat du tracteur et nous organiserons des événements musicaux pour lever des fonds supplémentaires. Cela aura pour conséquence de reporter l'envoi du tracteur et de « gaspiller » une nouvelle saison des pluies ; nous espérons donc vivement atteindre notre objectif.<br/></p>
<h3>Calendrier</h3>
<p><b>4 juin :     </b>Fin de la campagne, si nous avons la somme, nous confirmons l'achat du tracteur</p>
<p><b>11 juin :</b>     Le tracteur quittera l'Espagne dans un container (10 jours de voyage)<br/></p>
<p><b>21 juin :</b>     Arrivée du tracteur au Sénégal et transport vers Touba Djigane, nos amis pourront commencer à travailler avec<br/></p>

<h3>3 raisons pour les aider</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Ils travaillent dur et obtiennent des résultats. </b>Pendant les 6 dernières années, ces jeunes gens ont démontré qu'ils pouvaient faire des projets, travailler et les réaliser. Avec des moyens adéquats, ils pourront cultiver toute la terre, augmenter considérablement leur production et aider les populations des villages voisins.</li>
<li> <b>Une petite chose pour nous en est une grande pour eux.</b> Avec une petite contribution, nous pouvons faire une grande différence. Nous croyons en le fait de soutenir des gens de bonne volonté qui travaillent dur et sont capables d'utiliser les ressources dont ils disposent.</li>
<li> <b>Un bon exemple pour les jeunes au Sénégal.</b> Nous souhaitons que plus de gens puissent être motivés à rester et à travailler au lieu d'embarquer sur des bateaux avec le rêve d'une vie meilleure. Beaucoup meurent en route, beaucoup sont renvoyés au pays dès leur arrivée en Espagne et, pour ceux qui atteignent l'Europe, le rêve devient vite une illusion. Nous souhaitons contribuer à faire prendre conscience de cela, aider les jeunes à réaliser qu'il existe d'autres options et soutenir ceux qui travaillent pour gagner leur vie d'une façon positive et constructive.<br/>

In the countryside in Senegal, in a small village of Touba Djigane in the region
of Kaolack, there’s a small agriculture project where 11 young men, aged 25-40,
are working and cultivating land.
In March 2015, before Heidi travelled to Senegal to plan her fashion
project, she was having Senegalese tea at Alioune & Anne’s place in Geneva. The
discussion on happiness, travelling, cultural differences and realising one’s
dreams inspired us to create this project.
Heidi: “Alioune told me about these young men in Touba Djigane, they have
their families in big cities but are determined to make their life the hard way
and cultivate the land. I wanted to go there, find out why, and see this project
myself. Alioune has spent himself some time working there, by hand, and it’s
his long time dream to be able to send them a tractor. At Touba Djigane I met
good-hearted, motivated men, who are passionate about agriculture and happy to

Many people in Senegal still imagine money grows on trees in Europe, and
life is easy. They do everything to get here, because it’s difficult to make
life in Senegal. Our motivation is to help people who don’t run after
illusions, but are ready to work to make their lives. In Senegal it’s difficult
to have the material needed for working.
The Agriculture Project
The land in this area is very rich and can provide lot of vegetables and

in the previous years they have already prepared one part of the area (2 hectares)

En effet, au Sénégal, la saison des pluies ne dure que 3 mois, de juillet à septembre. Tout verdit alors et c'est exclusivement durant cette période que les paysans produisent la récolte des 9 mois les séparant de la prochaine saisons des pluies. 2 hectares exploitable, c'est donc très peu. Un tracteur serait un énorme plus pour ces jeunes cultivateurs et les paysans des villages alentours; ils pourraient labourer et cultiver toute la surface disponible et obtenir ainsi une récolte plus abondante pour la population locale et pour la vente. Les bénéfices permettraient également d'acheter des vaches et des moutons.Les gens des villages aiment leur terre, mais le manque d'équipement performant rend leur travail et leur vie terriblement difficiles. Ils ont réellement besoin d'un tracteur et même à terme d'un système d'irrigation pour cultiver au-delà de la saison des pluies, mais pour l'heure, au seuil de la saison des pluies, un tracteur ferait déjà toute la différence.


Le tracteur

Un tracteur neuf coûte entre 12 000 - 15 000 €. Nous avons trouvé un tracteur d'occasion en Espagne pour 3700 € (= 4150 $) et nous souhaiterions vivement pouvoir l'acheter et l'envoyer au Sénégal. Ce tracteur convient parfaitement à une utilisation au Sénégal. Il est réservé pour nous jusqu'à la fin de cette campagne et, si le projet rassemble le financement nécessaire, l'actuel propriétaire du tracteur pourra le faire transporter au Sénégal par container. Afin de favoriser des initiatives comme celles des jeunes de Touba Djigane, le gouvernement sénégalais a décidé d'exempter de frais de douane tout le matériel agricole importé au Sénégal. Le transport durera 10 jours et Abdou et Ibrahim viendront réceptionner le tracteur à Dakar et le transporter jusqu'au village. Alioune et sa famille arriveront aussi au Sénégal début juillet et ils pourront confirmer la bonne marche des opérations. Ils pourront faire parvenir des photos des premières utilisations du tracteur.Tout l'argent envoyé ira directement à l'achat du tracteur et aux frais de transport de ce dernier. Les frais de transport s'élèvent environ à 1000€ et le site par lequel nous menons la campagne garde aussi un petit pourcentage des versements effectués. 10$ valent actuellement environ 9€.


Plan B : Si nous ne parvenons pas à réunir la somme prévue au terme de la campagne, nous vous assurons néanmoins que le montant atteint ira intégralement à l'achat du tracteur et nous organiserons des événements musicaux pour lever des fonds supplémentaires. Cela aura pour conséquence de reporter l'envoi du tracteur et de « gaspiller » une nouvelle saison des pluies ; nous espérons donc vivement atteindre notre objectif.
Calendrier
4 juin :     Fin de la campagne, si nous avons la somme, nous confirmons l'achat du tracteur
11 juin :     Le tracteur quittera l'Espagne dans un container (10 jours de voyage)
21 juin :     Arrivée du tracteur au Sénégal et transport vers Touba Djigane, nos amis pourront commencer à travailler avec
Juillet - Août - Septembre :     Saison des pluies au Sénégal, qui est la seule saison durant laquelle on cultive et dont le produit fait vivre le reste de l'année.


3 raisons pour les aider


Ils travaillent dur et obtiennent des résultats. Pendant les 6 dernières années, ces jeunes gens ont démontré qu'ils pouvaient faire des projets, travailler et les réaliser. Avec des moyens adéquats, ils pourront cultiver toute la terre, augmenter considérablement leur production et aider les populations des villages voisins.
 Une petite chose pour nous en est une grande pour eux. Avec une petite contribution, nous pouvons faire une grande différence. Nous croyons en le fait de soutenir des gens de bonne volonté qui travaillent dur et sont capables d'utiliser les ressources dont ils disposent.
 Un bon exemple pour les jeunes au Sénégal. Nous souhaitons que plus de gens puissent être motivés à rester et à travailler au lieu d'embarquer sur des bateaux avec le rêve d'une vie meilleure. Beaucoup meurent en route, beaucoup sont renvoyés au pays dès leur arrivée en Espagne et, pour ceux qui atteignent l'Europe, le rêve devient vite une illusion. Nous souhaitons contribuer à faire prendre conscience de cela, aider les jeunes à réaliser qu'il existe d'autres options et soutenir ceux qui travaillent pour gagner leur vie d'une façon positive et constructive.


Alioune : “C'est mes amis à Touba Djigane. J'étais là-bas en 2009 quand ils ont commencé le projet, je suis resté un mois et j'ai aidé à défricher la brousse et à préparer les 2 hectares de terre qu'ils utilisent maintenant. J'y retourne chaque année pour voir mes amis, ils sont déterminés à travailler durement dans les champs. Malgré les conditions pénibles, je vois qu'ils évoluent bien et j'aimerais vraiment leur donner un coup de pouce et les soutenir dans leur effort.”Anne : ""J'ai vécu 2 ans au Sénégal dans un village de brousse aux conditions similaires à celles de Touba Djigane. J'ai vu travailler les paysans et peiner sous le soleil avec un âne, un cheval ou rien d'autres que leurs outils. La vie est rude et la subsistance de leur famille pour une année entière dépend de cette seule récolte annuelle. Quel paysan travaillerait ici sans tracteur ? C'est un minuscule investissement pour un énorme changement dans le quotidien de ces gens. Nous mettre ensemble pour les soutenir en vaut la peine et nous pouvons le faire. ""Heidi : ""Je suis allée à Touba Djigane en avril 2015 et j'ai rencontré les gens là-bas. Ils ont compris que le bonheur ne vient pas d'argent gagné facilement, mais croient en le travail et la paix d'âme et d'esprit. J'ai trouvé cela très admirable et j'ai vraiment envie de les aider à réaliser leur rêve. Ils sont un bon exemple pour nous tous ; ils ont besoin de ce tracteur et le méritent.""
Rejoignez-nous !

Réalisons ce projet et montrons à ces jeunes gens et aux autres que les rêves peuvent devenir réalité lorsqu'on y croit fort. Merci !

My name is Ilya. I'm a founder of project <b>ARTWORK Online Gallery (<a href=""http://www.artwork-gallery.ru"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.artwork-gallery.ru</a>).</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p>  It is
strange how much one trip changes you. I have long lived in Siberia, in Omsk
and probably never would have thought about creating an online gallery, if not
a nice trip to St. Petersburg. Beauty works in museums and galleries in the
city has been able to move  me deeply,and
ever since I love art and all that it involves. At that moment, when I first
touched this wonderful creative world, I was very surprised that my attempts to
find some big free internet portal, which would cover the different directions
in art, have been unsuccessful. Most part of internet resources offer only to
buy or sell the paintings . Well, if we are not talking about selling, we can
observe only a very highly specialized portals. Pottery, painters, masters of
computer graphics and other creative people… All of them work on their own as
separated tribes living in one state, but under different laws and customs.</p>
<p>  I was very
surprised about this state of affairs and decided that it would be just fine to
combine all of these people in a single project. To be able to cover the
different types and styles to create a real support of contemporary art. I
wanted it to be a place where any beginner or an experienced artist could
present their work, show it to the people to express his gift, his talent. </p>
<p>  The <b>“ARTWORK
Online Gallery”</b> project has come to life. Starting work on a small website, I
realized that more and more artists want to express themselves, and among them
were many young talents who have just started to take their first steps in the
incredible world of art. And each of them works in a different direction. At
this point, it became obvious that I can not manage alone, and I got my friends
to work on <b>”Artwork Online Gallery”</b> as well. So we started adding more and more new
sections where everyone could find a place in the cozy halls of our virtual
online gallery. Later I
went to live in Bulgaria, where I told about my “Online Gallery” to new friends
and as a result, our team has enlarged, and there also has been new artists who
really wanted to show their creativity to the world.</p>
<p>  More and
more artists from different countries began to join our project and continue to
make our gallery even more attractive for those who appreciate art. The next
step was to work with social networks and then it became obvious that there are
true connoisseurs of beauty , because our communities in social networks is
supported by thousands of people and now we know that the work is not in vain
and that people are very interested in our project.</p>
<p>  But with
the big popularity problems began to appear . It turned out that we simply
cannot withstand the load on the website, and we just need more powerful
servers, and will be a lot of work on innovations for our “Online Gallery”. It
was then that we realize where to look for help! Of course, here, in a place
where people care about other people's ideas and where we can see with our
desire to bring beauty and art to everyone who wants it.</p>
<p>  Art - is the
thing that has no nationality and language, it is one for all, it is now a
world heritage of humanity, which should be available to everyone. That is why
we are eager to expand our project worldwide. This is why  we created this campaign to raise funds. Our
goal is not only to help people  enjoy
the beautiful works of art of the world, but also give an opportunity to
everyone who is talented in art  to find
their own creative way and even get into museums and exhibitions together with
the originals of their works. And it's not just our desire. It is the desire of
all those who love art and our project. With your support we can show the
wonderful world of creative people which is filled with miracles and beauty.</p>
<p>  We also want to
create a bridge between those who create and those who are already working in
the field of art. We want to help young talents  reach out to those people who are happy to
take their work to exhibitions, galleries and museums. There are so many fine
artists among the young people who cannot find their way due to the fact that there
are many obstacles in the art world. And against the backdrop of the global
chaos that reigns various military and political wars, we want to create a real
home for all those who see a bright future in the arts, in its beauty and
purity. And that artists and other creators will be able to show us the
beautiful world and can once again regain faith in a better
future.</p>
<p>  Our team looks
forward to your support, because all raised funds will help
our resource to develop  further. We will
be able to help all those who can create works of incredible beauty and it is
with your support we will be able to show the best works in the world to a  huge number of
people from different countries and regions of our planet!</p>
<p>  There is
nothing better than to give people the light and joy through art in our
difficult times. And if we can expand with your help, we will be very glad to
see you in our virtual gallery of contemporary art, both as an artist and as a
visitor, because <b>“ARTWORK Online Gallery”</b> – it is a real stronghold of art.</p><p>After all this we can conclude that the main goal of our updated Online Gallery is a full cooperation of those who create works of art and art lovers from all over the world on one site.  And the most important thing is that our website is not online store. All creative people can show their works even if they are not going to sell them. Thanks to a new approach of the project development and a new system of interaction with the site, artists will be able to get acquainted with art dealers, gain fame, show their work to the whole world and get admirers of their works. And users of the portal will be able to communicate freely with the people of art, enjoy beautiful works of art, as well as demonstrate their own talents and learn something new . And the live communication without language barriers with people from different countries and new experience will help everyone to touch the beautiful, to the very heart of our wonderful Online Gallery.<br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h1><b>That's why we need your help with fundraising.</b></h1><p><b>  </b>Because we want to create the biggest, most informative and useful online gallery of contemporary art, we need to spend a huge amount of work.

</h2>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">                               <b>Q: How old is your website ??? </b></span></h4>
<div>A: Our site is very young. The domain was registered in 2012, but the work on the website began in 2014. First we made a small website for some Russian artists to show their works. But later we saw that artists from other countries want to show their artwork. They began to ask us questions how they can upload works of art to our website. And we started develop ARTWORK Online Gallery.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>            <b>Q: How much I have to pay for registration in your project?</b>
</h4>
<div>A: Our project is free for all .</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>                          <b>Q: How many works can I upload for free?</b>
</h4>
<div>A: You can upload an infinite number of your works of art. But we have a limit on the file size - not more than 2 megabytes. Later we are going to remove the limit on the file size.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>   <b>Q: You have a Russian domain now.  Are you going to purchase               international  domain name?</b>
</h4>
<div>A: Sure!!! We are going to purchase "".com"" domain. New domain name will be <a href=""http://www.artwork-gallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artwork-gallery.com</a> . But the cost of this domain name is  $3896.20 (<a href=""https://who.is/whois/artwork-gallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://who.is/whois/artwork-gallery.com</a> - link  to check the price). That's why we made this IndieGoGo Campaign.</div>
<div>                     </div>
<h4>          <b>Q: Are you going to improve personal account for users?</b>
</h4>
<div>A: Of course. Our team is going to develop and add a personal user account with an extended set of features.</div>
<div>                     </div>
<h4>      <b>Q: I'm not from Russia. Can I upload my works to your website?</b>
</h4>
<div>A: No matter what is your country. Everyone can show their talents in art on our website.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>                     <b>Q: Can I sale my paintings from your website? </b>
</h4>
<div>A: Yes. If someone will show interest to one of your paintings or other works, our administrators will let you know about it. Upon receiving the order the administration of the site conveys the artist’s contact details to the buyer (or vice versa - the buyer transfers the data to the artist), without taking further part in the transaction. Thus, the artist is able to negotiate with the buyer directly, without intermediaries, increasing the chances to sell his work. (In case of a successful deal the website's commission is just 10%. This amount helps to maintain the website).</div>

<br/> </div></div>","With your help we will transform our art website into the biggest and powerful online gallery of contemporary art and you will help thousands of creative people to express their talents in art and share their artwork with the whole world !!! Hello everyone. My name is Ilya. I'm a founder of project ARTWORK Online Gallery (www.artwork-gallery.ru).  It is
strange how much one trip changes you. I have long lived in Siberia, in Omsk
and probably never would have thought about creating an online gallery, if not
a nice trip to St. Petersburg. Beauty works in museums and galleries in the
city has been able to move  me deeply,and
ever since I love art and all that it involves. At that moment, when I first
touched this wonderful creative world, I was very surprised that my attempts to
find some big free internet portal, which would cover the different directions
in art, have been unsuccessful. Most part of internet resources offer only to
buy or sell the paintings . Well, if we are not talking about selling, we can
observe only a very highly specialized portals. Pottery, painters, masters of
computer graphics and other creative people… All of them work on their own as
separated tribes living in one state, but under different laws and customs.
  I was very
surprised about this state of affairs and decided that it would be just fine to
combine all of these people in a single project. To be able to cover the
different types and styles to create a real support of contemporary art. I
wanted it to be a place where any beginner or an experienced artist could
present their work, show it to the people to express his gift, his talent. 
  The “ARTWORK
Online Gallery” project has come to life. Starting work on a small website, I
realized that more and more artists want to express themselves, and among them
were many young talents who have just started to take their first steps in the
incredible world of art. And each of them works in a different direction. At
this point, it became obvious that I can not manage alone, and I got my friends
to work on ”Artwork Online Gallery” as well. So we started adding more and more new
sections where everyone could find a place in the cozy halls of our virtual
online gallery. Later I
went to live in Bulgaria, where I told about my “Online Gallery” to new friends
and as a result, our team has enlarged, and there also has been new artists who
really wanted to show their creativity to the world.
  More and
more artists from different countries began to join our project and continue to
make our gallery even more attractive for those who appreciate art. The next
step was to work with social networks and then it became obvious that there are
true connoisseurs of beauty , because our communities in social networks is
supported by thousands of people and now we know that the work is not in vain
and that people are very interested in our project.
  But with
the big popularity problems began to appear . It turned out that we simply
cannot withstand the load on the website, and we just need more powerful
servers, and will be a lot of work on innovations for our “Online Gallery”. It
was then that we realize where to look for help! Of course, here, in a place
where people care about other people's ideas and where we can see with our
desire to bring beauty and art to everyone who wants it.
  Art - is the
thing that has no nationality and language, it is one for all, it is now a
world heritage of humanity, which should be available to everyone. That is why
we are eager to expand our project worldwide. This is why  we created this campaign to raise funds. Our
goal is not only to help people  enjoy
the beautiful works of art of the world, but also give an opportunity to
everyone who is talented in art  to find
their own creative way and even get into museums and exhibitions together with
the originals of their works. And it's not just our desire. It is the desire of
all those who love art and our project. With your support we can show the
wonderful world of creative people which is filled with miracles and beauty.
  We also want to
create a bridge between those who create and those who are already working in
the field of art. We want to help young talents  reach out to those people who are happy to
take their work to exhibitions, galleries and museums. There are so many fine
artists among the young people who cannot find their way due to the fact that there
are many obstacles in the art world. And against the backdrop of the global
chaos that reigns various military and political wars, we want to create a real
home for all those who see a bright future in the arts, in its beauty and
purity. And that artists and other creators will be able to show us the
beautiful world and can once again regain faith in a better
future.
  Our team looks
forward to your support, because all raised funds will help
our resource to develop  further. We will
be able to help all those who can create works of incredible beauty and it is
with your support we will be able to show the best works in the world to a  huge number of
people from different countries and regions of our planet!
  There is
nothing better than to give people the light and joy through art in our
difficult times. And if we can expand with your help, we will be very glad to
see you in our virtual gallery of contemporary art, both as an artist and as a
visitor, because “ARTWORK Online Gallery” – it is a real stronghold of art.After all this we can conclude that the main goal of our updated Online Gallery is a full cooperation of those who create works of art and art lovers from all over the world on one site.  And the most important thing is that our website is not online store. All creative people can show their works even if they are not going to sell them. Thanks to a new approach of the project development and a new system of interaction with the site, artists will be able to get acquainted with art dealers, gain fame, show their work to the whole world and get admirers of their works. And users of the portal will be able to communicate freely with the people of art, enjoy beautiful works of art, as well as demonstrate their own talents and learn something new . And the live communication without language barriers with people from different countries and new experience will help everyone to touch the beautiful, to the very heart of our wonderful Online Gallery.That's why we need your help with fundraising.  Because we want to create the biggest, most informative and useful online gallery of contemporary art, we need to spend a huge amount of work. That's why we suggest you get familiar with the diagram of budget planning. We have identified six of the most important points:1. Development and programming 2. Seo & PR3. Purchase of
international domain in the  .com zone (new site adress will be:  www.artwork-gallery.com).4. Gifts and rewards for anyone who has decided to support our project.5. Multilanguage (also improve existing translation).6. Rent of powerful servers.                 BUDGET DISTRIBUTION DIAGRAM:
The first paragraph ""Development and Programming"" also includes at least fifteen subparagraphs (language on pictures - Russian):
1. Add support for
hashtags and improve the search engine for works of art.



2. Develop and add a
personal user account with an extended set of features (4 types of membership will be available).



3. Add a
graphics editor to our online gallery. Each user will have the
opportunity to feel like an artist. There will be a special section for users
under the title ""I am learning to draw ..."". In this section, users
can upload their creations. Planned support for graphics tablets.



4. Blogs for each
artist. Each artist will be able to run their own blog.



5. Function «Follow
me» to the user. Every registered user will be able to monitor the work of his
favourite master fromthe account or receive the latest news on e-mail.



6. Add the function
""Albums"" for artists. Each artist will be able to add not only the
individual works, but also create albums of a series of works, or add a photo
of the creative process.



7.  Finalize the
feedback form. Now, if the visitoris are interested in
someone's work of art they can contact the artistdirectly, bypassing the site administration.

8. Improving
commenting of the works. It is planned to make comment form
not only through social networking plugins but also by adding comments on the
site.



9. Add a visit counter.
Will take into account the number of visits to the page of the author and
browsing with works of art. On this basis, new sections will be added: Work of
the day, work of the week and work of the month. The popularity of the artist
will also be taken into account based on the counter.
visit counter

work of the week(day, month)


10. Add filters in
each category to simplify searching. Now the filters are not available for all
categories of the site. Once finalized this task, visitors
can apply filters to all categories.



11. Simplify the site
navigation and implementation of a large number of tips starting with the
registration process, and ending with the viewing and adding the artwork.

12. Support for the English
language forum.


13. Additional functions for the artist's page.

Risks and challenges:
In spite of our desire to send our gifts to everyone who has supported us as quickly as possible, we can face a number of difficulties, which do not depend on us.
We cannot give exact delivery times, as they may vary depending on:
- Type of transportation
- The conditions of delivery of postal companies
- Your country of residence.
Of course we pointed that Estimated Delivery date of your gifts if February 2016.  But this date is only possible if :
1). Your gift is:

2). If the original works of art are at the artist and don’t need to make a copy.
3). If the work is not cultural value and don’t need to make special documents for sending.
If the painting selected as a gift is out of stock, it may take time to create this work of art. Production time of the painting copy depends on the artists themselves. We would also like  to warn you that the standard shipping method does not include insurance for works of art and, unfortunately, it applies to all types of work, whether it is a copy or the original.

                       FAQ:

                               Q: How old is your website ??? 
A: Our site is very young. The domain was registered in 2012, but the work on the website began in 2014. First we made a small website for some Russian artists to show their works. But later we saw that artists from other countries want to show their artwork. They began to ask us questions how they can upload works of art to our website. And we started develop ARTWORK Online Gallery.

            Q: How much I have to pay for registration in your project?

A: Our project is free for all .

                          Q: How many works can I upload for free?

A: You can upload an infinite number of your works of art. But we have a limit on the file size - not more than 2 megabytes. Later we are going to remove the limit on the file size.

   Q: You have a Russian domain now.  Are you going to purchase               international  domain name?

A: Sure!!! We are going to purchase "".com"" domain. New domain name will be www.artwork-gallery.com . But the cost of this domain name is  $3896.20 (https://who.is/whois/artwork-gallery.com - link  to check the price). That's why we made this IndieGoGo Campaign.
                     
          Q: Are you going to improve personal account for users?

A: Of course. Our team is going to develop and add a personal user account with an extended set of features.
                     
      Q: I'm not from Russia. Can I upload my works to your website?

A: No matter what is your country. Everyone can show their talents in art on our website.

                     Q: Can I sale my paintings from your website? 

A: Yes. If someone will show interest to one of your paintings or other works, our administrators will let you know about it. Upon receiving the order the administration of the site conveys the artist’s contact details to the buyer (or vice versa - the buyer transfers the data to the artist), without taking further part in the transaction. Thus, the artist is able to negotiate with the buyer directly, without intermediaries, increasing the chances to sell his work. (In case of a successful deal the website's commission is just 10%. This amount helps to maintain the website).

<p>    Hey folks, my name is Brenda Ray and I've been
performing in front of audiences since I was four years old. In spite of
graduating college and being accepted to some great master programs for writing, I've decided to do the scariest thing I’ve ever done…. drop everything
and pursue poetry and music on my own. </p>
<p>      The album is a mash up of all the best pieces I’ve
produced over the past five years. In it I explore grief, love, loss, family, The
Kardashians, house parties, and several other things. The Music is a mixture of
folk, R&amp;B, rock… a little tough to label but then again so am I. </p>
<p>          This is a big step for me, so your contribution would
mean the world. As much as I would’ve liked to be an MFA graduate, there
was something much more pure about pursuing my art, sticking with my audience,
and having a little more faith in my fans. In short, I am following my heart.
Your support would help me take that long overdue step of recording a
professional album. It will also provide me with a quality piece of merchandise
that I can offer audiences as I perform shows this year.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>      It costs about $125 to record a

as itunes, Amazon, and Spotify. This price is quoted at about $431.30. Finally,
I am also recording with two brilliant musicians and because I believe in
paying artists for their work, I will need an additional $150 to compensate for
their time and talents. Overall, this adds up to a total goal of $1,831.30 <br/></p>

<p><strong>Centro de Creación Artística TET</strong> (Taller Experimental de Teatro) presents <strong>""the river under the river"" </strong>(evening and tasting), a play that includes <strong>the chronicles of Alicia Jiménez de Sánchez</strong>, anecdotes, stories, poems, songs and flavours from Venezuelan. This is a collective creation, a performance with two interpreters:<strong> Joe Justiniano and Lya Bonilla Jiménez </strong>(Alicia's niece). They worked together with <strong>Guillermo Díaz Yuma, Jariana Armas, Areani Rondón, Dixon Dacosta, Manuel Chourio, Sonia González and Carlos Sánchez Torrealba</strong>, collaborating in the configuration of the staging. They are also accompanied by <strong>Boris Paredes, Andrés Cartaya</strong> and other professional musicians who enrich the experience with their proposals and interpretations.</p>
<p>The chronicles tell us about Alicia's childhood, and her relationship with her father, grandmother and siblings, stories from several towns in Venezuela’s savannah, where her family lived between 1930 and 1960. These amusing anecdotes are accompanied by legends and traditional tales, texts by <strong>Aquiles Nazoa, Eugenio Montejo, Ramón Palomares, Enriqueta Arvelo Larriva,</strong> folk songs and compositions by <strong>Simón Díaz, Henry Martínez and Guillermo Jiménez Leal </strong>(brother of the writer of the chronicles). This material display a significant content of the popular imaginary. Besides, the public can enjoy an small tasting of salty and sweet venezuelan dishes. All the guests can feel part of an stimulating and suggestive experience.</p>
<p>The stage is a circle surrounded by chairs, furniture and armchairs, a space that becomes the living room of the house, the garden where treasures are buried, the library where extraordinary books are found, the kitchen of the grandmother, the main street of the village, the courtyard of the school where the children recite, dance and act in theatrical performances. The play ends with a great party where the venezuelan rhythms invite to stand up and meet those around you.</p>
<div><div>Anyone who listens to these stories, somehow, recovers something lost. Anyone who reads into the details of these tales, awakes an ancestral memory, the root of our desires and impulses. Stories speak about our relationship with love, our home and humour, even our own way of relating with nature. Our sounds, our colours and flavours, make us Venezuelans and Latin Americans. This performance will offer to its audience the opportunity to rediscover the small and simple things of  everyday life, through the beauty of each tale and the poetic images, they will get to perceive the current that moves under the river.<br/>_________________________________<div>

<p><i>Este viaje se emprende a partir de las crónicas sobre la infancia de Alicia, relatos de los pueblos de venezuela donde vivió su familia entre 1930 y 1960. Estas graciosas anécdotas están acompañadas por leyendas y cuentos tradición oral, textos de <strong>Aquiles Nazoa</strong>, poemas de <strong>Eugenio Montejo, Ramón Palomares, Enriqueta Arvelo Larriva</strong>, cantos de trabajo y canciones de <strong>Simón Díaz, Henry Martínez y Guillermo Jiménez Leal</strong> (hermano de la escritora de las crónicas), para recrear un rico imaginario popular que, junto a una pequeña degustación de platos salados y dulces venezolanos harán de esta velada una experiencia sensorial, estimulante y sugestiva.</i></p>
<p><i>El escenario es un círculo rodeado de sillas, muebles y poltronas, un espacio que se convierte en la sala de la casa, en la habitación de los niños, en el jardín donde se entierran tesoros, en la biblioteca donde se encuentran libros extraordinarios, en la cocina de la abuela, en la calle principal del pueblo, en el patio de la escuela donde se recita, se baila y se hacen representaciones teatrales. La obra termina con una gran fiesta donde los ritmos del llano logran levantar a todos de sus puestos para ir al encuentro con el otro.</i></p>
<p><i>Quien escucha estas historias, de alguna manera, recupera algo perdido. Quien recrea los detalles de un relato está despertando una memoria ancestral, los orígenes de nuestros deseos e impulsos. Los sonidos, colores y sabores nuestros, aquello que nos constituye como venezolanos y latinoamericanos, hablan de la relación con el hogar, con el amor, de un particular humor y sensibilidad que nos caracteriza, e incluso de nuestra relación con la naturaleza y lo salvaje. Este trabajo ofrecerá al público la posibilidad de reencontrarse con los pequeños y sencillos detalles cotidianos, con la belleza del relato y la imagen poética, para percibir la corriente que se mueve bajo el río que somos.</i></p>

<h3>History &amp; Vision</h3>
<p>2017 will be my 20th consecutive year attending Burning Man, and somewhat arbitrarily, it's high time I let go of my action figure collection. I've always wanted to do something artistic with their exit from my life. Oddly enough, unbeknownst to me, my father (a skilled wooden toy maker) spent the last couple of decades going to garage sales and picking up hundreds of Happy Meal toys. So when he died last year (almost simultaneously with Burning Man 2016) and I found trunks full of these little items (I will never know why he bought them), it felt like a calling to combine these collections into something greater than their parts. Does this speak to my — and my father's — hoarding tendencies? Perhaps. Like father, like son, but more accurately, we both have very youthful spirits (still wishing to think of Dad in the present tense).

History & Vision
2017 will be my 20th consecutive year attending Burning Man, and somewhat arbitrarily, it's high time I let go of my action figure collection. I've always wanted to do something artistic with their exit from my life. Oddly enough, unbeknownst to me, my father (a skilled wooden toy maker) spent the last couple of decades going to garage sales and picking up hundreds of Happy Meal toys. So when he died last year (almost simultaneously with Burning Man 2016) and I found trunks full of these little items (I will never know why he bought them), it felt like a calling to combine these collections into something greater than their parts. Does this speak to my — and my father's — hoarding tendencies? Perhaps. Like father, like son, but more accurately, we both have very youthful spirits (still wishing to think of Dad in the present tense). We’re tricksters (my name on the playa is Whee-zel, for good reason). We joke. We laugh hard. We find the curiosity in how things work, and then recreate them on a more manageable scale. We are endlessly fascinated how art can reflect the world in a distorted manner, like a doll house, perfect in every detail, but still a fragile imitation.
Of course, the worship and hypocrisy of so called “family values,” not to mention the commercial exploitation of iconography of heroes and villains — these themes will show up in the art piece as well. Try as I might to make art out of my history, these lil’ critters are nothing more than glorified children's fantasies of violence, and as colorful as the designs may be, they really just come down to simplistic interpretations of “bad vs. good.” After all, nothing reflects the commodification of pop culture Americana like children's toys. These various ideas come crashing and melting together in this art piece. Like the Batman and Joker battling it out…while neither of them are aware that their conflict simply makes up an elbow joint on a much larger creation. Sounds a lot like life to me. Who knows what we might accomplish if we could stop fighting each other and see the amazing miracle we all encompass?.

<p>The
Peggy’s Cove Area Festival of the Arts provides the opportunity for people of
all ages to engage in and celebrate the arts.</p>
<p>The
beauty of Peggy’s Cove and its surrounding areas is a source of inspiration to
many local artists and artisans such as painters, potters, sculptors, and
woodworkers. Because many of these artists use their homes—or even the great
outdoors—as their studios, there aren't always opportunities to share their
work with the public. The purpose of the festival is to share these hidden
gems, and to bring the art that flourishes in our communities to you. The
Peggy’s Cove Festival of the Arts provides a welcoming opportunity to meet
these artists, view and purchase their wonderful work, and celebrate the arts.</p>
<p>Since
its launch in 2011, the Peggy’s Cove Area Festival of the Arts has grown
quickly from a dream into a full-fledged not-for-profit celebration of the
arts. In 2014 the Festival attracted over 4000 local, national and
international visitors. In 2015, with the addition of the new Arts Fair, even
more are expected.</p>
<p>Detailed information about what’s planned for Festival 2015 is
available on our website:  <a href=""http://www.peggyscoveareafestivalofthearts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">peggyscoveareafestivalofthearts.com</a>  Highlights will include a gala reception,
plein air painting events in two locations, a new arts fair and the popular studio
tour.</p>
<p>Advertisements, sponsorships and grant supports have been
tremendously important, but they can’t provide enough to sustain this vibrant
arts festival. With your support, we can make all this happen!</p>
<p><b>Our Goals</b></p>
<p>We’ve
set our goal in this campaign for $3000. If we’re successful in raising the
full amount, we’ll be able to provide free workshops, demonstrations,
performances, and entry to the Arts Fair, which will open the event to a wider
community and truly embody the welcoming atmosphere the festival strives to
create. Funds will also be used towards the cost of the Yurt in Peggy’s Cove,
where selected works created onsite and from the artist’s collections will be
displayed and available for sale. </p>
<p>It’s
also important that we promote the event widely and with compelling marketing
material. We hope to do so with new banners and flags that will enliven our
communities and enhance the spirit of this summer arts celebration. While we

this festival more engaging, memorable, and celebratory.</p>

In addition to some incredible art, we are also working to bring several speakers/events to the show, including <a href=""https://avitalnormannathman.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Avital Norman Nathman</a>, Pioneer Valley resident and author/editor of ""The Good Mother Myth.""</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There will also be an interactive area the show. Participants are invited to write, draw, share images, or use any other medium to answer the question: ""How has mothering shaped your life?"" While we're not so sure what its future will look like after the exhibition, we have a few ideas up our sleeves...</span></p><p>We also feel that an exhibition that raises the voices of mothers in its content also needs to do so in practice. On opening night (August 8th), we're offering free, on-site childcare for our patrons. Additionally, we'll also be offering a private space inside the gallery for breastfeeding, diaper changing, or simply taking a short break on your visit to the Eastworks Building. This space will be available to everyone during Gallery Hours, throughout the week.</p><p><b>So now, the question is: how does this all happen?</b></p><p>Between me, some incredible mentors, supportive sponsors, and committed volunteers, we are confident that this will shape up to be an incredible event this August. All we need is your help to make it happen!</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>In total, we're asking for $2,500. Broken down, this number goes into:</p><p>Print Materials (Posters, Outdoor Signage): $75<br/>Art Supplies (Hanging Materials, Other Works-Specific Materials for presentation): $175<br/>Childcare For The Opening Exhibition: $150<br/>Wall Decals (Exhibition Name, Artist names/works/statements): $275<br/>Speaker Compensation: $750 (~2 speakers)<br/>Miscellaneous Print Expenses (gallery check-in sheets, show comments): $25<br/>Curator Honorarium: $250<br/>Intern Honorarium: $150<br/>Participatory Component Expenses (cork board, paint, additional materials): $265.00<br/>Estimated Indiegogo/Paypal Fees: $400</p><p>We know our number for Indiegogo and Paypal fees is a little high. If we reach the end of the campaign and we end up with a surplus of funds in that area, the additional money will go to art supplies, speaker compensation, or, depending on the amount, towards budgeting for childcare at one of our in-gallery events.</p><h3>The Perks</h3><div>If you contribute, we have a few perks up our sleeves!<p></p>
<p>Everyone who contributes at the $20 level will be listed as a ""contributor"" near our Gallery Statement. This list of contributors will also be visible at our exhibition counter. You will have our eternal gratefulness for your contribution!<br/><br/>If you contribute at the $50 level, Hannah will watch your kids for an evening of your choice. That's right, free childcare—and Hannah is good, too! She has experience with infants through early adolescents but especially loves early childhood. You will also get your name on the contributor list.</p>
<p>If you contribute at the $100 level, we will arrange a private gallery viewing for you, complete with a tasty home-cooked meal. There's nothing better than art and tasty food! You will also get your name on the contributor list.</p>
<p>If you contribute at the $250 level, you may use the gallery for an event of your choosing, pending some limitations. Some ideas include: a work gathering, host your morning/afternoon/evening workshop, a birthday party, etc. We will have a volunteer on-site to open and close the space. You will also get your name on the contributor list.</p>
<p>If you contribute at the $500 level,  you get all the perks listed above: Hannah will watch your kids, we'll arrange a nice private viewing with a home-cooked meal, AND we will let you use the gallery for an event of your choice. And, of course, you will also get your name on the contributor list.</p>
<h3>If We Fall Short</h3>If we don't meet our goal, we have a few alternative plans in mind. We've also constructed alternative budgets that cut out our curator and intern honorariums; while these would be very nice to have and make our lives a little easier for the month of August, the honorarium isn't our priority; the show is. We are also actively working on pursuing sponsorships with area organizations, so we hope that even if we don't make our entire budget on Indiegogo, we may be able to make up for some of the gaps with local business partnerships! </div><p>Hannah will also be presenting at EAT in Easthampton, an in-person crowdfunding event. If you live in Western Mass and want to hear more information about this event (and how you can support us!) then visit the <a href=""http://www.easthamptoncityarts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ECA+ Website</a> for more details!</p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We are incredibly fortunate to live in a community that strongly supports and empowers the voices of mothers. Area organizations like MotherWoman, Grow, Women's Voices Worldwide and others are doing very important work in the Pioneer Valley and beyond to lift the voices of mothers and create a community that values mothers and families and the often complicated, yet important lives they lead. As a doula, I have also had the privilege to observe the respectful nature of several of our area hospitals towards the bodily and personal autonomy of our mothers. <br/><br/>What I intend to do with this exhibition is bridge this rhetoric of valuing mothers in social and community contexts with the expansive creative community we have in Easthampton and the greater Pioneer Valley. I want to create a platform outside of the internet and mothers' groups and circles for everyone to see—and understand—how motherhood shifts our identities and how it connects, on some level, to all of us. And in keeping with the experimental nature with the MAP space, I want to use this space as an opportunity to reflect on how we can make the gallery space as family-friendly—and by association, community-friendly—as possible. This will have implications for me, as someone who enjoys curating shows in my community, as well as other art makers, curators, and creatives in the Pioneer Valley, whom I will be more than happy to share my experiences with. Let's open up the gallery and make it inviting and accessible to everyone!</p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>This is my first Indiegogo campaign, so this all feels very new to me. As I balance curating/managing this show, plus work, plus school, I recognize that there may be moments where this feels like a lot. I'm trying to do my due diligence right now by embracing my 8-hour nights of sleep and budgeting my time now, recognizing that I will likely lose out on that full-night's sleep and any level of free time come August. I feel most comfortable when I am multitasking; I thrive off of having multiple projects and events happening at once. So, this August is a welcome challenge for me, and one that I am familiar with having to balance. </p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We completely understand if you are unable to donate at this time! If you are social media-savvy, we would be so grateful for you to share this campaign with your friends, or anyone you think may be touched by the exhibition!</p><p>We also have a list of things for the show that we hope to receive as in-kind donations or personal loans—including a projector, fans (the space gets hot in August!), children's toys, and furniture. If you think you might be able to help in this area, please be in touch! And thank you so much for taking the time to read this. We so appreciate it!</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryHello there!

<p>2013</p>A Little About Me...
<p>My name is Kayla Jenkins, and my life's goal is to sustain and support myself through my passion, Art.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kaylaajenkinsportfolio.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kaylaajenkinsportfolio.wordpress.com</a> </p>
<p>I recently finished my undergraduate studies in December 2014, earning Bachelor's degrees in Fine Arts, as well as Philosophy with a minor in Mathematics from McKendree University in Lebanon, Il.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to help supplement the costs that it takes to get my career started, specifically participating in Art fairs and shows across the country.</p>
<h3 style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The Game Plan</h3>
<p>You may be interested to know how exactly this funding is going to help my goal. Everybody has to start small, right? -so your donations are truly vital to my success and have the potential to be the financial structure for which I base my entire career. The idea is to start small, by applying to smaller, less expensive shows in the hopes of selling my work, subsequently funding the costs for future shows and fairs. The fees for these can vary drastically. </p>
<p>In early May 2015 I applied and was accepted to The Midwest Salute to the Arts ( <a href=""http://www.midwestsalute.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.midwestsalute.com</a> ) in Fairview, Il. The booth fees for this show, depending on size and location range from $250 to $450, and that is relatively cheap compared to most. I hope that with the help of some generous individuals and this innovative site, I will be able to raise funding to procure the costs of the booth fee and costs for walls inside my booth which I estimate will cost around $500 and will be used for any art fair in the future.</p>
<p>All of this is necessary to prepare me for successful art fair, and in turn helping me sell more works to fund more shows in the near future.</p>
<p>Here is an idea of other show's I would like to apply for soon...</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Ocala Arts Festival 2015; $35 Application Fee, $250 Booth Fee</li>
<li>The Great Gulf Coast Arts Festival; $40 Application Fee, $300-$600 Booth Fee</li>
<li>Fall Festival on Ponce; $25 Application Fee, $425 Booth Fee</li>
</ul>
<p><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;'>What I've Done to Ensure Success</span></p>
</div><div> <p><b>(So you know that your money won't go to waste)</b></p>
<p>For the past 5 years or so I have been developing myself an artist, and attempting to involve myself as much in the art world as I can.</p>
<p>Aside from shows I've done affiliated with my University, I was invited to show at the Varsity Art Show in 2014 hosted by Art St Louis- a showcasing that involved the top two students at each of 16 major institutions in the St. Louis Area. Also, in 2012 I applied and was accepted to partake in program called the Emerging Artists as Entrepreneurs program hosted by the cultural festivals of St Louis, who just happens to be the directors of the St Louis Art Fair in Clayton, Mo, one of the top annual fair in the country. This program prepared me more than I ever could have imagined. The requirements consisted of a year of workshops including assisting mentoring artists at the 2013 St Louis Art Fair. Our reward for this was an opportunity to by pass the jurying process into the 2014 St Louis Art Fair. This program taught us everything from marketing aspects, like pricing and how to communicate with  potential buyers to the do's and dont's of submitting a quality application that will impress jurors. Thanks to this program I have complete knowledge of what to expect and what I will need in order to succesful.</p>

That' totally understandable. but thank you so  much for viewing my page and being interest about what I'm doing- and please, tell your friends!</p>

2013A Little About Me...
My name is Kayla Jenkins, and my life's goal is to sustain and support myself through my passion, Art.
www.kaylaajenkinsportfolio.wordpress.com 
I recently finished my undergraduate studies in December 2014, earning Bachelor's degrees in Fine Arts, as well as Philosophy with a minor in Mathematics from McKendree University in Lebanon, Il.
The purpose of this campaign is to help supplement the costs that it takes to get my career started, specifically participating in Art fairs and shows across the country.
The Game Plan
You may be interested to know how exactly this funding is going to help my goal. Everybody has to start small, right? -so your donations are truly vital to my success and have the potential to be the financial structure for which I base my entire career. The idea is to start small, by applying to smaller, less expensive shows in the hopes of selling my work, subsequently funding the costs for future shows and fairs. The fees for these can vary drastically. 
In early May 2015 I applied and was accepted to The Midwest Salute to the Arts ( www.midwestsalute.com ) in Fairview, Il. The booth fees for this show, depending on size and location range from $250 to $450, and that is relatively cheap compared to most. I hope that with the help of some generous individuals and this innovative site, I will be able to raise funding to procure the costs of the booth fee and costs for walls inside my booth which I estimate will cost around $500 and will be used for any art fair in the future.
All of this is necessary to prepare me for successful art fair, and in turn helping me sell more works to fund more shows in the near future.
Here is an idea of other show's I would like to apply for soon...


Ocala Arts Festival 2015; $35 Application Fee, $250 Booth Fee
The Great Gulf Coast Arts Festival; $40 Application Fee, $300-$600 Booth Fee
Fall Festival on Ponce; $25 Application Fee, $425 Booth Fee

What I've Done to Ensure Success
 (So you know that your money won't go to waste)
For the past 5 years or so I have been developing myself an artist, and attempting to involve myself as much in the art world as I can.
Aside from shows I've done affiliated with my University, I was invited to show at the Varsity Art Show in 2014 hosted by Art St Louis- a showcasing that involved the top two students at each of 16 major institutions in the St. Louis Area. Also, in 2012 I applied and was accepted to partake in program called the Emerging Artists as Entrepreneurs program hosted by the cultural festivals of St Louis, who just happens to be the directors of the St Louis Art Fair in Clayton, Mo, one of the top annual fair in the country. This program prepared me more than I ever could have imagined. The requirements consisted of a year of workshops including assisting mentoring artists at the 2013 St Louis Art Fair. Our reward for this was an opportunity to by pass the jurying process into the 2014 St Louis Art Fair. This program taught us everything from marketing aspects, like pricing and how to communicate with  potential buyers to the do's and dont's of submitting a quality application that will impress jurors. Thanks to this program I have complete knowledge of what to expect and what I will need in order to succesful.

    Other Ways You Can Help As a starving artist and recent college graduate, I know all to well that even though you may want to contribute- sometimes you just cant. That' totally understandable. but thank you so  much for viewing my page and being interest about what I'm doing- and please, tell your friends!

<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Cristina Rivas. I’m a visual artist. Painting and photography are the way by which I communicate at the moment. Although, I flirt with some others slopes.</p>
<p>I was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela; Where I live nowadays. I have participated in some different collectives in Venezuela and in a small individual one. I feel it’s time to make an individual as the viewer truly deserves it, an exposition where the visitor would have the opportunity of being introduced into the proposed world and create a more effective visual speech.</p>
<p>I’m organizing something I call “a true individual exposition”. I’ve been working on this project for 3 years, from the conceptualization to the creation. It has not been easy, especially when you got limited resources, but I didn’t take this as a barrier, on the contrary, this has been a huge pushing to search for alternative solutions and to bury all the problems, and so I found Indiegogo, a solution where if you like my work and contribute with something, it will be a great help for the project, so in gratitude you will receive different presents, which are described on the reward headland. Your contribution will cover location, promotion, printed works, mounting, catalogues, among other expenses related to the event organization.</p>
<p>There is something very important about the exposition’s opening, it’s an action art that will be accomplished, for that reason I need the resources, in order to fund the required actors, makeup and costume design.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest. I used all my financial resources on this project, which can only be possible with your contribution, with it and using photography to leave a different perception about hope, I’ll offer the viewer a direct approximation to the surreal world I’m presenting though art transformed into action.</p>
<p>This story, that wants so much the opportunity of being shown, is my gain. I would love you to be part of this project!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477511420/kpmd9q7xnihzpfimqaev.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""> </p>
<h2><strong>My Art : </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Artistic proposal “Hope is not always white”</strong></p>
<p>The proposal’s intention is to show, through several photographs and action-art, a different concept about hope, very distant from the accepted one inside the western civilization, which I have been developing for a few years based on my own experiences and dreams; turning this into a crucial element in my visual language.</p>
<p>Sometimes we make decisions that apparently bring us closer to our goals but unconsciously those decisions are, in fact, impediments to achieve them.  Christian religion teaches hope is a synonym of waiting; this definition is static and passive. It communicates all circumstances can just ameliorate through a divine intervention and also having strong faith on that will be possible. We can find some examples on the Bible very frequently.</p>
<p>“You are my hiding place and my shield, I hope in your word.” Psalm 119:114- The Bible.</p>
<p>When someone is found inside an emotional chaos or in a psychological disorder usually believes and feels abandoned by God; is there where the problem arises, because this definition of hope forged by society won’t bring satisfying answers to the individual.</p>
<p>“And now Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you” Psalm 39:7 – The Bible</p>
<p><strong>Propuesta artística "" La Esperanza no siempre es Blanca"" </strong></p>
<p>La intención de esta propuesta  es mostrar mediante una serie de fotografías y arte-accion, un concepto de esperanza diferente al mayormente aceptado dentro de la civilización occidental,el cual he venido desarrollando desde hace algunos años  en base a mis propias experiencias, vivencias y sueños, convirtiéndose este un elemento fundamental en mi lenguaje visual.</p>
<p>En ocasiones tomamos decisiones que en apariencia nos acercan a nuestros objetivos, pero sin estar conscientes, son en realidad impedimentos para alcanzarlos.La religión cristiana enseña que la esperanza es un sinónimo de esperar, esta definición es estática y pasiva, comunica que las circunstancias solo mejoran  por medio de la intervención divina y la fe de que esta ocurrirá. Podemos encontrar ejemplos de esto con frecuencia en la biblia.</p>
<p>“Tú eres mi escondite, y mi escudo; en tu palabra he puesto mi esperanza” Salmo 119:114</p>
<p>Cuando la persona está en un caos emocional, en un desorden psicológico, cree y siente que ese Dios lo ha abandonado, es allí cuando nace el problema, ya que la definición de la esperanza que ha sembrado la sociedad, no traerá respuestas satisfactorias al individuo.</p>
<p>""Y ahora, Señor, ¿qué esperaré? Mi esperanza está en ti."" Salmos 39:7 – La Biblia</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact</u></strong></p>
<p>I consider the definition of hope planted by my proposal more productive and effective because leads to more honest results. In fact, it is more suitable for nowadays paradigms.</p>
<p>The exposition will allow the visitor the opportunity of being transported to a story from another reality, a world full of spiritual, psychological and physical phases immersed in chaos; and this will be possible through photographs and performance. So, is there where a different vision of hope reborn; where the individual’s reality can just be transformed through conscious action addressed to such purpose. This leaves a fluid message to the viewer; to act, continue and work for what he or she wish for. This way of perceiving hope will help the individual to understand not all that we want is always possible, but there will always be other alternatives routes.</p>
<p>Only with your contribution will be possible to materialize these ideas.</p>

<h2>Thank you! </h2>
</div></div>","About me:
Hello! My name is Cristina Rivas. I’m a visual artist. Painting and photography are the way by which I communicate at the moment. Although, I flirt with some others slopes.
I was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela; Where I live nowadays. I have participated in some different collectives in Venezuela and in a small individual one. I feel it’s time to make an individual as the viewer truly deserves it, an exposition where the visitor would have the opportunity of being introduced into the proposed world and create a more effective visual speech.
I’m organizing something I call “a true individual exposition”. I’ve been working on this project for 3 years, from the conceptualization to the creation. It has not been easy, especially when you got limited resources, but I didn’t take this as a barrier, on the contrary, this has been a huge pushing to search for alternative solutions and to bury all the problems, and so I found Indiegogo, a solution where if you like my work and contribute with something, it will be a great help for the project, so in gratitude you will receive different presents, which are described on the reward headland. Your contribution will cover location, promotion, printed works, mounting, catalogues, among other expenses related to the event organization.
There is something very important about the exposition’s opening, it’s an action art that will be accomplished, for that reason I need the resources, in order to fund the required actors, makeup and costume design.
I’ll be honest. I used all my financial resources on this project, which can only be possible with your contribution, with it and using photography to leave a different perception about hope, I’ll offer the viewer a direct approximation to the surreal world I’m presenting though art transformed into action.
This story, that wants so much the opportunity of being shown, is my gain. I would love you to be part of this project!

 
My Art : 
Artistic proposal “Hope is not always white”
The proposal’s intention is to show, through several photographs and action-art, a different concept about hope, very distant from the accepted one inside the western civilization, which I have been developing for a few years based on my own experiences and dreams; turning this into a crucial element in my visual language.
Sometimes we make decisions that apparently bring us closer to our goals but unconsciously those decisions are, in fact, impediments to achieve them.  Christian religion teaches hope is a synonym of waiting; this definition is static and passive. It communicates all circumstances can just ameliorate through a divine intervention and also having strong faith on that will be possible. We can find some examples on the Bible very frequently.
“You are my hiding place and my shield, I hope in your word.” Psalm 119:114- The Bible.
When someone is found inside an emotional chaos or in a psychological disorder usually believes and feels abandoned by God; is there where the problem arises, because this definition of hope forged by society won’t bring satisfying answers to the individual.
“And now Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you” Psalm 39:7 – The Bible
Propuesta artística "" La Esperanza no siempre es Blanca"" 
La intención de esta propuesta  es mostrar mediante una serie de fotografías y arte-accion, un concepto de esperanza diferente al mayormente aceptado dentro de la civilización occidental,el cual he venido desarrollando desde hace algunos años  en base a mis propias experiencias, vivencias y sueños, convirtiéndose este un elemento fundamental en mi lenguaje visual.
En ocasiones tomamos decisiones que en apariencia nos acercan a nuestros objetivos, pero sin estar conscientes, son en realidad impedimentos para alcanzarlos.La religión cristiana enseña que la esperanza es un sinónimo de esperar, esta definición es estática y pasiva, comunica que las circunstancias solo mejoran  por medio de la intervención divina y la fe de que esta ocurrirá. Podemos encontrar ejemplos de esto con frecuencia en la biblia.
“Tú eres mi escondite, y mi escudo; en tu palabra he puesto mi esperanza” Salmo 119:114
Cuando la persona está en un caos emocional, en un desorden psicológico, cree y siente que ese Dios lo ha abandonado, es allí cuando nace el problema, ya que la definición de la esperanza que ha sembrado la sociedad, no traerá respuestas satisfactorias al individuo.
""Y ahora, Señor, ¿qué esperaré? Mi esperanza está en ti."" Salmos 39:7 – La Biblia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Impact
I consider the definition of hope planted by my proposal more productive and effective because leads to more honest results. In fact, it is more suitable for nowadays paradigms.
The exposition will allow the visitor the opportunity of being transported to a story from another reality, a world full of spiritual, psychological and physical phases immersed in chaos; and this will be possible through photographs and performance. So, is there where a different vision of hope reborn; where the individual’s reality can just be transformed through conscious action addressed to such purpose. This leaves a fluid message to the viewer; to act, continue and work for what he or she wish for. This way of perceiving hope will help the individual to understand not all that we want is always possible, but there will always be other alternatives routes.
Only with your contribution will be possible to materialize these ideas.

From 8 to 14 August 2016 Fighting for Crumbs (Art in the Shadow of Neoliberal Britain) will be an art event talking place in both Wakefield and Sheffield. The documentary will premiere at the Wakefield Labour Club (aka The Redshed), whilst a showcase of the artists' work will be displayed at Gage Gallery, Sheffield.We feel this is an important addition to the conversation opened up by Invisible Britain. Fighting for Crumbs (Art in the Shadow of Neoliberal Britain) is a sober and compassionate look at the state of present-day Britain through the eyes of artists who feel a sense of responsibility to deal with issues facing us all.
Our aim is to raise enough funds to make the film and stage the exhibition. Working very closely with DEADIDEA Productions we aim to raise £900. Any additional funds raised would go towards helping the Redshed remain a politically active meeting place for another 50 years.

Vasallos de Venezuela is a group

long experience and heritage based on the research and learning of the
traditional music and dance knowledge of different Venezuelan local communities
and the stage experience acquired during shows in Venezuela and many other
countries.

<p>I am Ells Future. Growing up we played outdoors all day and
all night if we could get away with it. Our DNA craved fresh air and space to
roam around. Trees, grass, animals, insects, the human scent. Anything you
could think of, we did it. Human to human contact was our thing. We shared
ideas, talked about family issues, personal issues, planned out our days,
laughed and even got angry with one another. There was no thought of
separation. Technology has totally shattered the beneficial effects of physical
social interaction. Now we push buttons to speak and smile at screens. We smile
and talk to screens projecting images and words. Human robots. I want you to
mindfully ponder the phrase “social interaction”. Obesity, stress, depression
and just simply responding to actual humans standing next to you using your
natural voice box has become oblivious to daily living. Just look around, everyone has a phone, tablet, video game,
mega pixel television. It’s crazy. Even when I observe gatherings, 90% of the
attention goes into technology. Look around. I bet most of you are texting
right now. Is this the collapse of the human attention span or created
diversions to drive the rate of insanity through the cosmos?</p>
<p><b>About this project</b></p>What is the Cans Game?<br/><br/>Throwing a ball toward a target is the oldest game known to man, and it just got better. Cans is a modified version of tops and continues to be played throughout many parts of the world. It is typically played on custom courts, sidewalks, or playgrounds. Cans on the other hand, allows you to play on any hard smooth surface you like. The game playing area is designed to roll up for easy transportation and enhanced storage capabilities. The custom mats are designed to support skill, If you love CANS, friendly competition and can stand your ground, we highly recommend you back CANS today with a simple pledge.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-mce-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352807.7961_funddescription.jpg"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352807.7961_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-mce-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352694.7645_funddescription.jpg"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352694.7645_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-mce-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352602.7036_funddescription.jpg"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456352602.7036_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>New Patented Cans Gameplay Mat:<br/><br/>After testing out several combinations of fabrics and materials, we’ve come up with a new quality mat perfect for playing Cans on the street and indoors on any smooth surface anywhere in the world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-mce-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456353437.31_funddescription.jpg"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456353437.31_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> Paterson, New Jersey Common Field Park - PACKED!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-mce-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456353569.9812_funddescription.jpg"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/9225537_1456353569.9812_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>   Newly Designed Cans Game Mats - HS Gym<br/><br/><p><b>The three main highlights:</b></p>·  Durability: Our Premium Rubber/Latex Free material gives the mat up a 7x longer life than vinyl material.<br/>·  Design: Sometimes less is more.

Divide players into groups of two. Each group chooses 1 ball and 2 cans per mat. To start, 1 player of opposing sides stand behind 10 point slot of each can and face each other.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game: The objective of Cans is for each player to strike or hit their opponents Cans by throwing or tossing a ball at the designated Can target. Players are awarded points based on their ability to accurately hit their opponents Cans until they reach 100 points<br/><br/>Players: Two players, ages 7 and above.<br/><br/>Version1: 2 players, 1 vs. 1<br/><br/>Game:<br/><br/>1. Player 1 throwing the ball from behind the Cans towards/ onto the other Cans cross mat.<br/><br/>2. Scoring consists of targeted point lines, each ranging from 10,20,30,40 points as marked on the ICAN7 gameplay mat.<br/><br/>3. Point range for scoring is determined by each player’s discretion throughout the course of the game.<br/><br/>For example: a player might choose to score points at the 10 point line mark and later in the game choose to score points at the 40 point line mark in attempt to reach a total score of 100 points before their opponent.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>·  40 points= line mark furthest from the can<br/><br/>·  30 points= third furthest<br/><br/>·  20 points= second furthest<br/><br/>·  10 points= closest<br/><br/>Winning: First player to 100 points, plays again until someone out thinks her.<br/><br/>Cheating: Change the rules to highlight your particular skillset instead. Rules are meant to be broken, and so  we encourage The Cans Game enthusiast to adapt and play however they want to play.<br/><br/>ENJOY LIFE! Put down the smart phones, tablets, and computers. Turn off the television and video games. Get out of the house, apt, dwelling and have a great time with friends and family in nature. We know we have!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p>Why cans? It’s for the children. The children who have
nothing. The children who have no voice to speak. The children whose
imagination have been          <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  hi-jacked. The children who hurt internally. The children
who, when their minds open up can create new worlds for the future. The
children who enjoy being outdoors living, breathing and exploring themselves
without hindrance. The children who reflect loving kindness and compassion.</span></p>
<p>It’s for the mothers and fathers who may not be together,
but can come together, laugh, eat good foods and enjoy each others company
through friendly play. It’s for mothers and fathers who want to rebuild their
relationship and strengthen their bonds with their children. It for families
who want to bond again and share commonalities that exist in all of us. Cans
establishes on-going relationships with brothers and sisters of all.</p>
<p>For the bullies who have been tormented and abused
throughout their lives. For the lonely who society decided to exclude from the
world for their hair color, shoe construction, skin hue, body type, etc..</p>
<p>Cans is for everyone, the entire world CAN PLAY! If you
support this game and our mission to bring excitement back to the community,
you will help create and build the minds of the future. This will mean so much
to humanity. Isn’t this what life is about. Isn’t this what you want? Support us and
support the world.</p>
<p>Cans is integrative and can transform any expanded area into
an energetic gameplay setting. Cans will restore amazing needs to build better
communities. Cans will become a sacred energy site for all to love. When
compassion is restored, the world heals. Cans will accelerate the planetary
energy of compassion as a counterbalance to traditional sports and division.</p>

Now because we’ve matured, we’ve decided it was time to take the Cans game we’ve always played to another level. Traditional cans simply wouldn’t work in a parking lot.

laughed and even got angry with one another. There was no thought of
separation. Technology has totally shattered the beneficial effects of physical
social interaction. Now we push buttons to speak and smile at screens. We smile
and talk to screens projecting images and words. Human robots. I want you to
mindfully ponder the phrase “social interaction”. Obesity, stress, depression
and just simply responding to actual humans standing next to you using your
natural voice box has become oblivious to daily living. Just look around, everyone has a phone, tablet, video game,
mega pixel television. It’s crazy. Even when I observe gatherings, 90% of the
attention goes into technology. Look around. I bet most of you are texting
right now. Is this the collapse of the human attention span or created
diversions to drive the rate of insanity through the cosmos?
About this projectWhat is the Cans Game?Throwing a ball toward a target is the oldest game known to man, and it just got better. Cans is a modified version of tops and continues to be played throughout many parts of the world. It is typically played on custom courts, sidewalks, or playgrounds. Cans on the other hand, allows you to play on any hard smooth surface you like. The game playing area is designed to roll up for easy transportation and enhanced storage capabilities. The custom mats are designed to support skill, If you love CANS, friendly competition and can stand your ground, we highly recommend you back CANS today with a simple pledge.New Patented Cans Gameplay Mat:After testing out several combinations of fabrics and materials, we’ve come up with a new quality mat perfect for playing Cans on the street and indoors on any smooth surface anywhere in the world. Paterson, New Jersey Common Field Park - PACKED!   Newly Designed Cans Game Mats - HS GymThe three main highlights:·  Durability: Our Premium Rubber/Latex Free material gives the mat up a 7x longer life than vinyl material.·  Design: Sometimes less is more. After hearing from you at parks, events, and via email messages, we’ve decided to go with just 6 colors (pink, blue, green, red, purple, orange). Each color features a theme promoting healing and growth.·  CANS: Cans are 100% recycled and custom crushed so they maintain their shape during each game. Collect them from anywhere.  How do you play?The following is a brief overview of the setup, scoring, and how to adapt your CANS mat for even more personalized experience.Setup: Place two CANS gameplay mats 7 feet apart depending on skill level. Divide players into groups of two. Each group chooses 1 ball and 2 cans per mat. To start, 1 player of opposing sides stand behind 10 point slot of each can and face each other.Goal of the Game: The objective of Cans is for each player to strike or hit their opponents Cans by throwing or tossing a ball at the designated Can target. Players are awarded points based on their ability to accurately hit their opponents Cans until they reach 100 pointsPlayers: Two players, ages 7 and above.Version1: 2 players, 1 vs. 1Game:1. Player 1 throwing the ball from behind the Cans towards/ onto the other Cans cross mat.2. Scoring consists of targeted point lines, each ranging from 10,20,30,40 points as marked on the ICAN7 gameplay mat.3. Point range for scoring is determined by each player’s discretion throughout the course of the game.For example: a player might choose to score points at the 10 point line mark and later in the game choose to score points at the 40 point line mark in attempt to reach a total score of 100 points before their opponent.Scoring:·  40 points= line mark furthest from the can·  30 points= third furthest·  20 points= second furthest·  10 points= closestWinning: First player to 100 points, plays again until someone out thinks her.Cheating: Change the rules to highlight your particular skillset instead. Rules are meant to be broken, and so  we encourage The Cans Game enthusiast to adapt and play however they want to play.ENJOY LIFE! Put down the smart phones, tablets, and computers. Turn off the television and video games. Get out of the house, apt, dwelling and have a great time with friends and family in nature. We know we have!

Why cans? It’s for the children. The children who have
nothing. The children who have no voice to speak. The children whose
imagination have been            hi-jacked. The children who hurt internally. The children
who, when their minds open up can create new worlds for the future. The
children who enjoy being outdoors living, breathing and exploring themselves
without hindrance. The children who reflect loving kindness and compassion.
It’s for the mothers and fathers who may not be together,
but can come together, laugh, eat good foods and enjoy each others company
through friendly play. It’s for mothers and fathers who want to rebuild their
relationship and strengthen their bonds with their children. It for families
who want to bond again and share commonalities that exist in all of us. Cans
establishes on-going relationships with brothers and sisters of all.
For the bullies who have been tormented and abused
throughout their lives. For the lonely who society decided to exclude from the
world for their hair color, shoe construction, skin hue, body type, etc..
Cans is for everyone, the entire world CAN PLAY! If you
support this game and our mission to bring excitement back to the community,
you will help create and build the minds of the future. This will mean so much
to humanity. Isn’t this what life is about. Isn’t this what you want? Support us and
support the world.
Cans is integrative and can transform any expanded area into
an energetic gameplay setting. Cans will restore amazing needs to build better
communities. Cans will become a sacred energy site for all to love. When
compassion is restored, the world heals. Cans will accelerate the planetary
energy of compassion as a counterbalance to traditional sports and division.

About us
Who are we?
We are friends and family who love to travel, eat natural foods, and enjoy the energy of life. We all grew up playing Cans with one another on sidewalks and in nearby playgrounds. We enjoyed team competition like basketball and football, but cans was our time to relax from the fast moving ultra competitive world and laugh with each other. Now because we’ve matured, we’ve decided it was time to take the Cans game we’ve always played to another level. Traditional cans simply wouldn’t work in a parking lot. After tweaking and testing, we have finally come up with our Cans game prototype that we want to share with you.

We will be diligent in making sure that everything is done to the highest quality standard.Supplier coordination: We work with a small supplier to source the best materials for CANS sets and ensure the product is created correctly, which may affect us as a result.

<p><span><b>The Idea: Photo to Painting</b></span></p>
<p></p> <p>The Canvas Talk is an online platform where you can upload your favorite photographs, choose the medium of art (Ex: Oil painting) and we will create a <b>100% handmade</b> painting for you and send it across! It has been established by two art enthusiasts with a clear objective of creating high quality personalized artwork for individuals who want to treasure memories in the most beautiful and unique way. </p>
<p></p>
<p>How did we come into being? Well, let's say our old fashioned views played a huge part! We realized that social media has made this world a very visual place, people take hundreds of photographs trying to capture special moments and upload them on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, store them online on G+ and iCloud or offline on laptops and iPads. Then, they are forgotten. Nobody bothers to browse through digital galleries containing thousands of photographs ranging back 10 years or more. Slowly, they fade away from our memory.</p>
<p>We want to capture your precious moments in a way that they are always in front of you, reminding you about the wonderful people in your life. Just like it was done before the technology boom! by way of a painting. Be it your child's first step, a beautiful family moment, your favorite pet or a loved one who is not with you anymore; a painting is an exquisite souvenir, don't you think?</p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Risks:</b></p>
<p>There are always risks that can delay the process of getting your painting to you on time. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you have a clear picture.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Framed Paintings: Big framed paintings are always tricky to ship. Sometimes, the frame may be damaged due to long transit time. We only use TNT and UPS for our deliveries, pack the paintings extremely well so that they are insulated well. If you receive a damaged frame, please ship it back to us and we will replace it for you.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Shipping and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs. We have prepared as well as we can and hopefully there won't be any delays.</p>
</div>
<div><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Drying Time: Oil paintings require a reasonable amount of drying time before it can be shipped. Depending on the weather (Rainy, Humid), it may require additional time. This may cause slight delays in the delivery date. <br/></p></div>
<div><p style=""display: inline !important;"">We will keep you well informed throughout the entire project.<br/></p></div>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>FAQs:</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>What if my photograph is
damaged or not of the highest quality?</b></p>
<p>You can email us the photograph;
one of our artists will review it and let you know if it is suitable.</p>
<p><b>How do I select the right photograph?</b></p>
<p>For paintings it is enough if the quality of the
photo allows the artist to clearly see the details of your photo - but here are
a few tips on what you should look for:</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">1. Try to send photos with the highest resolution.
If your photo is less than 100 KB size, its resolution may be too low and our
artists may have difficulties in making a good painting from a photo which
doesn't clearly show details.</span></p>
<p>2. Pay attention to the background. You have a
beautiful photo of your little boy for example, but the background is filled
with details that will detract from the painted portrait. In such a case, you
can tell our artists to use a one color background of any color you choose or
simply let the artist decide. Just mention it in the comments box, right after
you upload the image.</p>
<p><b>Can I make special requests for editing?</b></p>
<h3>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Yes, you can! Just let us know when you are sending
your photos. We can combine figures from different photos into one painting,
change the background, eliminate or add figures and objects and create color
paintings from black and white photos.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Please provide as much details as possible (like:
""The dress should be Pink and the eyes should be Blue"").</p>
<p><b>Can you combine images from more than photograph into a painting?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes, we can! You can send several photographs via
email and have subjects from each photo placed together into a single painting.
Simply give us detailed instructions.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Can I preview my order before receiving it?</span></b></p>
<p>Yes. Once the painting from your photo is ready, we
will contact you to review it. If you feel that any modifications should be
made, we receive your feedback, make the requested modifications and send it
back to you for confirmation. The painting will be shipped to you only after
you approve it.</p>
<p><b>What's the status of my order?</b></p>

 The Canvas Talk is an online platform where you can upload your favorite photographs, choose the medium of art (Ex: Oil painting) and we will create a 100% handmade painting for you and send it across! It has been established by two art enthusiasts with a clear objective of creating high quality personalized artwork for individuals who want to treasure memories in the most beautiful and unique way. 

How did we come into being? Well, let's say our old fashioned views played a huge part! We realized that social media has made this world a very visual place, people take hundreds of photographs trying to capture special moments and upload them on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, store them online on G+ and iCloud or offline on laptops and iPads. Then, they are forgotten. Nobody bothers to browse through digital galleries containing thousands of photographs ranging back 10 years or more. Slowly, they fade away from our memory.
We want to capture your precious moments in a way that they are always in front of you, reminding you about the wonderful people in your life. Just like it was done before the technology boom! by way of a painting. Be it your child's first step, a beautiful family moment, your favorite pet or a loved one who is not with you anymore; a painting is an exquisite souvenir, don't you think?
About The Campaign:
This campaign is extremely important to us as it will help us get the word out and fund our growth requirements. We believe, this is a different idea to genuinely amaze your loved one by a single thoughtful gesture.
Journey Till Date:

We have completed the research, design and testing phase of the online platform www.thecanvastalk.com

We have identified and hired the best artists who can capture every small detail in a photograph. All the artist have a minimum of 7-10 year industry experience and are professionally qualified portrait artists.
Our logistics are in place and we are almost ready to go
 What We Need & What You Get:
Till date, we have self funded the project, but now we need your help for the following:


To add more forms of art like watercolors, pencil sketch and mixed media
To rent a bigger studio space, where all our artists can work under one roof and we can have more control over the entire process 
To finance the online and offline marketing strategies. SEO, Google Adsense, Blogger Outreach, PR, Advertisements in newspapers, magazines and other Promotions
To hire more artists on a permanent basis rather than on a contractual basis



Perks:
This is the exciting part, we have some amazing perks for you and your loved ones. Have a look at the right side of this page for a detailed view. We plan to surprise you with high quality prints of world famous paintings. We are also giving you the opportunity to  pre-order your painting at a discount of 20-30% from the selling price. You can ask us to customize it, combine two or more photographs, change the background or add an element. Create a masterpeice of your own choosing!

Risks:
There are always risks that can delay the process of getting your painting to you on time. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you have a clear picture.

Framed Paintings: Big framed paintings are always tricky to ship. Sometimes, the frame may be damaged due to long transit time. We only use TNT and UPS for our deliveries, pack the paintings extremely well so that they are insulated well. If you receive a damaged frame, please ship it back to us and we will replace it for you.


Shipping and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs. We have prepared as well as we can and hopefully there won't be any delays.

Drying Time: Oil paintings require a reasonable amount of drying time before it can be shipped. Depending on the weather (Rainy, Humid), it may require additional time. This may cause slight delays in the delivery date. 
We will keep you well informed throughout the entire project.

FAQs:


What if my photograph is
damaged or not of the highest quality?
You can email us the photograph;
one of our artists will review it and let you know if it is suitable.
How do I select the right photograph?
For paintings it is enough if the quality of the
photo allows the artist to clearly see the details of your photo - but here are
a few tips on what you should look for:
1. Try to send photos with the highest resolution.
If your photo is less than 100 KB size, its resolution may be too low and our
artists may have difficulties in making a good painting from a photo which
doesn't clearly show details.
2. Pay attention to the background. You have a
beautiful photo of your little boy for example, but the background is filled
with details that will detract from the painted portrait. In such a case, you
can tell our artists to use a one color background of any color you choose or
simply let the artist decide. Just mention it in the comments box, right after
you upload the image.
Can I make special requests for editing?

Yes, you can! Just let us know when you are sending
your photos. We can combine figures from different photos into one painting,
change the background, eliminate or add figures and objects and create color
paintings from black and white photos.

Please provide as much details as possible (like:
""The dress should be Pink and the eyes should be Blue"").
Can you combine images from more than photograph into a painting?
Yes, we can! You can send several photographs via
email and have subjects from each photo placed together into a single painting.
Simply give us detailed instructions.
Can I preview my order before receiving it?
Yes. Once the painting from your photo is ready, we
will contact you to review it. If you feel that any modifications should be
made, we receive your feedback, make the requested modifications and send it
back to you for confirmation. The painting will be shipped to you only after
you approve it.
What's the status of my order?
We will
keep you updated on this via email.
Is my private information protected?
Yes it is. All the information and photographs
gathered through our secure server will be used solely to process your orders.
We will never sell or share your private information with any 3rd party.
Are your artists classically trained?
Yes. All of our artist were traditionally trained
at top art universities and are active artists.
My question isn't answered here, what should I do?
Please email us at info@thecanvastalk.com and we
will get back to you shortly.
Where do I send my photo?
We will
contact you shortly after the Indiegogo campaign ends and give you the
instructions.
Can I choose a background for my painting?
Yes! We do it at no extra
cost. We offer two options. If you would like us to pick a suitable background,
we are happy to do so or alternatively you can send in another photo as
background. Just let us know of any changes you wish to have done to your photo
including the background. 
You show the size as 12x16 inches, I would like a 16x12 inch. What should I do?
When we write
12""x16"" we refer both to 16""x12"" and 12""x16"". If
you send us a horizontal image, the item you'll receive will be horizontal. If
you send a vertical photo, it will be vertical. If you prefer your vertical
photo to be horizontally or the other way round please inform us about it.
Do you charge extra for modifications?
No, we don't charge
extra. All modifications are free of charge.
How will you ship my painting?
We primarily ship through TNT, however in some
instances we ship via USPS or UPS. 
Do you
ship internationally?
Yes, we do.
Can I
have the artwork delivered as a gift to someone else?
You sure can! While sending your photograph, include
the address you want the artwork to be shipped.
If you would like a gift note included in any of
your orders, please email us with the short message you would like included and
we will ship the artwork with the note.
Can I
track my package once it is shipped?
You will receive an email when your package is
shipped that will include all tracking information. If there is a problem with
your shipment, please contact us at info@thecanvastalk.com or
call us on 0044 772 151 5192.
I
received my artwork and it is damaged. What do I do?
If your artwork is damaged during shipping, just
give us a call and we will be happy to replace your damaged artwork. We do not
require damaged items to be returned, however we ask that you provide photos of
the damage so that our shipping department can handle the claim process with
our carrier.
How
should I take care of my artwork?
We would recommend the following suggestions to
prolong the life of your artwork:



Avoid touching the canvas surface.


Do not hang your artwork in direct sunlight to
avoid fading over prolonged exposure.


Do not hang your artwork in a hot or humid area,
such as above an active fireplace or in a bathroom.

Feather dusting is recommended. Do not use water or
cleaning agents on your artwork




Team Behind The Canvas Talk:



Siddharth Nahar, Co-founder: I'm a qualified Chartered Accountant (ACA), currently working with an Asset Management company in London. While working across different entities and countries including London, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Vietnam and South Africa, the entrepreneurial bug bit me. I've always had an interest in paintings and admired artists for their talent. Many don't receive the recognition they deserve and are grossly underpaid. I want to create a community for them and promote this idea at a commercial level. Hence, after spending almost 6 months researching, designing and testing, The Canvas Talk was created.


Pooja Jain, Co-founder: I'm a PR professional and a lifestyle blogger. Writing has always been my passion, so after moving to London in 2014 I started blogging and creating content for others. Simultaneously, Siddharth and myself conceptualized the idea of creating an online platform which can connect art lovers to art creators. We aim to create realistic portrait paintings of the highest quality by referencing your photographs.

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The funding required for the NYC art exhibits is roughly $5000; however, Ash Showler is footing half of the bill herself (while paying off student debt -eeek!).

Rewards for your charitable contributions will be based on tier level, with each one combining into the next. Some of these include a colorful poster of one of the pieces in the art exhibit, a guest pass to the NYC art exhibit, hand-written cards full of eternal gratitude, stickers, an Ashen Art embroidered sew-on patch, or a published, hardcover book of all the artists, including yours truly, shown at either of the Art Exhibits! Since this campaign is based on a flexible funding goal, all funds, regardless if the goal is reached, will go to the installation, etc of the paintings at both art shows. Ash will cover the remaining portion of fees.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The funds for this campaign are for the installation and space necessary for the New York City Art Exhibit. The purpose of this application is to encourage individuals to listen to their bodies and spirits through artwork. </p>

<p><font color=""blue"">427 gallery</font> (or Four To Seven) was found in April 2014 by artists Kaspars Groševs and Ieva Kraule to bring new ideas, great artists and new shift to the landscape of Latvian contemporary art. Since then over 30 exhibitions, events, readings and internet projects have been organized by many wonderful artists, including <font color=""blue"">Tore Wallert, Mirak Jamal, F5, Vytenis Burokas, Carl Palm, GolfClayderman, Daria Melnikova and Agata Melnikova, the Ocean Academy of Arts, Evita Vasiļjeva, Vicente Mollestad, Raids Kalniņš, Gili Tal, Matthew Lutz-Kinoy, Henning Lundkvist, Marianne Vierø, Līva Rutmane, Marija Olšauskaitė, Monika Lipšic, Vivienne Griffin, Gaile Pranckunaite</font> and many others.</p>

<p>Over the time <font color=""blue"">427 gallery</font> has been a restaurant, a horoscope reading session, a strip bar cast in concrete, a ritual spot, an empty night club with the biggest disco ball in the Baltics, a graveyard, a dance floor from the Education Ministry of Lithuania, a fashion runway, a beauty salon, a dating game, a lip-sync contest, a traveling box and other things. And for a month the whole floor of the gallery was covered in latex.</p>
<p>We want to continue what we've started in 2018 and we have exciting plans! Unfortunately at the moment we can no longer pay the rent, pay the artists (something we have always tried to do even in the toughest of times), transport the works of art and, most importantly, organize exhibitions to provide an alternative to the Latvian art scene. And that is why we ask for Your help to continue to exist in our current physical form, bring people together and search for new adventures in contemporary art.</p>

427 gallery (or Four To Seven) was found in April 2014 by artists Kaspars Groševs and Ieva Kraule to bring new ideas, great artists and new shift to the landscape of Latvian contemporary art. Since then over 30 exhibitions, events, readings and internet projects have been organized by many wonderful artists, including Tore Wallert, Mirak Jamal, F5, Vytenis Burokas, Carl Palm, GolfClayderman, Daria Melnikova and Agata Melnikova, the Ocean Academy of Arts, Evita Vasiļjeva, Vicente Mollestad, Raids Kalniņš, Gili Tal, Matthew Lutz-Kinoy, Henning Lundkvist, Marianne Vierø, Līva Rutmane, Marija Olšauskaitė, Monika Lipšic, Vivienne Griffin, Gaile Pranckunaite and many others.
Group show Joy and Mirror. Port City (January 2016)
Over the time 427 gallery has been a restaurant, a horoscope reading session, a strip bar cast in concrete, a ritual spot, an empty night club with the biggest disco ball in the Baltics, a graveyard, a dance floor from the Education Ministry of Lithuania, a fashion runway, a beauty salon, a dating game, a lip-sync contest, a traveling box and other things. And for a month the whole floor of the gallery was covered in latex.
We want to continue what we've started in 2018 and we have exciting plans! Unfortunately at the moment we can no longer pay the rent, pay the artists (something we have always tried to do even in the toughest of times), transport the works of art and, most importantly, organize exhibitions to provide an alternative to the Latvian art scene. And that is why we ask for Your help to continue to exist in our current physical form, bring people together and search for new adventures in contemporary art.
Carl Palm 15.12. - 26.01.
 

The Money
We are hoping to get 9000 euros to cover the following:

Pay for the rent and heating (6000 euros for a year)
Transport of works (1000 euros)
Artist fees (2000 euros)

(For some reason Indiegogo allows us only to raise money in dollars, therefore the total amount is 11 000 $ which is roughly 9000 euros)

 
The Future
427 gallery will continue to exist in 2018 no matter what, but we'd love to keep our space that we've grown to love - so many wonderful evenings have happened here, people from all around the world has come with an open mind and curious to talk about the things visible and things invisible. We believe it's important for every city to have spaces run by artists, free of institutional bounds and interested in alternatives to big museums and commercial spaces.
We will search for additional funding for our projects in 2018, but paying the rent is just crucial at this point. We have plans for 6 shows this year and with Your help we can make it happen!
And even if we don't raise enough money to last through the long winter, 427 gallery will continue to exist, perhaps in a cloud or a basement of some strip bar, or in the parks and woods, who knows. But 427 gallery will live on!
 

Big Thank You! to everyone who has come to 427 gallery, even if standing outside the closed doors and peaking inside, everyone who has followed us online, everyone who has shared our images, everyone who has written about us and to people who plan to do one of these things in the future!

I’ve participated in many singing groups and performances in university and in various music ministries, trained with a renowned vocal instructor in Singapore, and even performed in musicals, including one with the Singapore Repertory Theatre in 2006.</p><p>In the past 6 months, I’ve invested more than 60 hours with a vocal coach into learning about the voice, vocal training, and how to be a vocal coach, and this, combined with 15 years of classical music training in piano, 10+ years of singing experience, and my training as a life coach since 2014, allows me to not only improve your singing and develop your vocal ability, but also help you express yourself more authentically and confidently.</p><p>Most commercial singing lessons teach generic techniques, or teach you “the right way” to sing a song. But really, your voice is unique from everyone else’s, and you are different from everyone else, so when you work with me, you’ll get specific coaching meant just for you, which allows you to instantly improve your vocals and your self-expression, and get the result you didn’t even know you were looking for.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552400461/belenwhr3df14v2dwle5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><u>1.

With no formal training in art or events management, I created 30 new paintings, rented a venue, raised $2,000, and invited friends and family to attend. During the week of the exhibition, more than 200 people saw my work, 17 paintings were sold, and I even received a contract to illustrate 3 children's books!From this experience, I learnt that dreams can become reality when we have the courage to take that leap of faith and make it happen! It's easier said than done, but with inspiration and a little push from someone who's on that path, I believe more people will begin on that journey too.So now my dream is to bring my creative abilities (art, music and coaching) all around the world, and create experiences for people to connect to their dreams, to discover what truly matters to them, and take action to make it happen.This takes the form of an on-going, long-term project to create 100 Dream Tree murals or installations with the participation of various communities around the world, where everyone gets an opportunity to believe in their dreams again, through the experience of co-creating in a collective work of art.<3 <3 <3“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” - Lao TzuIn the same way, a journey of 100 Dream Trees begins with... well, the first few Dream Trees! :DAnd having only done one Dream Tree mural at an artist residency in Spain last year (pictured above), and not much of a Dream-Tree-mural portfolio to show, my current strategy to kick-start this huge project is to apply for artist residencies.So I’m excited to share that I’ve been accepted into THREE art residency programs this summer to create 3 Dream Tree installations in Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria!I'll spend a month in each location, interact with the community and get to know the area, and then facilitate workshops for members of the community to connect to their dreams, and paint them out.These painted dreams will then be incorporated into a Dream Tree installation, as a symbol of their collective dreams and aspirations, with the message that by believing in our dreams once again, we can create a whole new world.This clearly is no easy feat. Travel, art materials, and day to day expenses can add up to quite a bit. And there's jet lag, adjusting to different climates, food, lifestyle, etc.And to embark on this long-term project of creating 100 Dream Trees around the world, and connecting hundreds, maybe thousands, of people to their dreams again, it's such a huge dream that I can't do it alone.So join me and support me in this journey and co-create this with me.Because this is really about all of us believing in our dreams again - like that song from the movie ""The Greatest Showman"":A million dreams is all it's gonna take. A million dreams for the world we're gonna make. Bring My Dream Project to Life!In order to bring my dream project to life, I will need to raise a total of $8,590 USD.(For my friends in Singapore, it's around $11,612 SGD.) Here's a breakdown of my expenses (in USD):
Flights, trains, buses: $2,300
Residency participation fees: $1,190
Art materials & equipment: $1,300
Food, water and necessary expenses for 3 months: $2,900

But really, your voice is unique from everyone else’s, and you are different from everyone else, so when you work with me, you’ll get specific coaching meant just for you, which allows you to instantly improve your vocals and your self-expression, and get the result you didn’t even know you were looking for. 1. ONE Private Singing Lesson / Vocal Coaching SessionFor $60 USD, you’ll get 1 private singing lesson and instantly level up your vocal expression 2. FOUR Private Singing Lessons / Vocal Coaching SessionsFor $220 USD, you’ll get 4 60-minute singing lessons over 4-6 weeks
We’ll meet weekly, and when you consistently practice what I recommend for you, you’ll see (and hear!) an outstanding development in your voice and ability to express yourself in just a few weeks!
Alternatively, you can also choose to gather 3 other friends and have 1 3-hour group session (in-person only).
 We can get started as soon as you’ve claimed these perks! :DHave questions?

Exclusive stuff just for you Indiegogo dreamers, which will not be shared on my Instagram or Facebook profiles.  The Journey of Living Your Dreams""Dreams are illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you."" - Marsha NormanSo what’s your dream?If there were no limits and nothing holding you back, what is it that you truly desire?What do you really want to create with your life?I believe everyone has a dream. I believe our dreams reveal to us who we really are, and they're the signs of the journey we've been called to make in this life. And it's when we take that first step that we begin the process of discovering what our lives are truly an expression of.Whether it's to manifest that creative ambition or project, to start a family, to backpack around the world, to make a difference in an industry you're passionate about... our dreams may seem impossible and daunting at times, but to me, it's one of the most fulfilling and worthwhile journeys in this life.When you join me in this journey, you’re encouraging me to keep rising to the challenge of my dreams. You’re letting me know that it’s okay for me to struggle and find my way, that you believe in my stepping into this bigger role - bigger art projects, unfamiliar places, bigger mission.When you join me in this, you'll also make a difference to the communities I'll be working with, because they get a chance to connect to their dreams through my work. You'll be part of that installation that gets them to dream again, the mural that beautifies their neighborhood, the journey they will embark on to live their dreams.But most importantly, you’ll make a difference for yourself.By saying YES to your dream again, even if you’re not sure what it might be.By allowing yourself to imagine again how you'd like to create your life, and have a one-of-a-kind original artwork to keep you connected to that.By allowing yourself to express your voice freely and authentically, through singing or taking up a project to fulfill one of your dreams.By joining me, you'd have given me a chance to focus on the impact I want to create, to create my very best work, and bring my best self to the people I will meet, which also includes you <3Make my dream come true by making your dream come true.Take me up on supporting you to fulfill your lifelong creative dream. Take me up on the opportunity to create something meaningful together with your loved ones. Take me up on connecting to your real voice again.Come join me in this journey, because this is what I’m committed to making my life about, and when you make that journey toward your goals and aspirations, I’m right there with you!A million dreams is all it's gonna take. A million dreams for the world we're gonna make. Other Ways You Can Join MeIf you’ve read this far and decided that this campaign isn’t for you (Thank you for reading all the way through!), you can still make a difference by sharing this with a friend, loved one, or colleague who could benefit from this.Specifically, those who have had a dream for a long time and haven’t taken action on it, or they have had a difficult time on their journey.Or they want to be able to express themselves more confidently and authentically.Or they would love to have a beautiful personal work of art in their home that represents themselves, their loved ones and their dreams.You can make a difference to them simply by sharing this campaign with them by sending them the link to this page, or sharing this on your Facebook.I’m also looking for more communities to collaborate with for future Dream Tree murals - in your neighborhood, your workplace, or organizations you believe could benefit from such a project. So do send them my way, and let’s get closer to the goal of 100 Dream Trees!Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.""I believe that future is ours. Love,MaryAnn P.S.

<p>       An unexpected phone call came in one morning, a yet-to-be-announced luxury automotive brand inviting me to co-brand my art jewelry with them . . . to align my art, my name, my brand with theirs. They have selected my art jewelry to be featured in their corporate publication for collectors and at a major event this summer. Though until a contract is signed, I cannot legally reveal who it is. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Gatekeeper has opened the gates . . .<br/>I am asking you to drive through the gates with me.</strong></p>
<p>       I am asking you to support my brand's focused vision of innovative design and creativity. A brand whose drive is to leave the trends behind creating extraordinary art jewelry to be seen in, and modern exceptional paintings to live with. Jewelry that transforms and supports a woman on her quest for strength of self and individual beauty. Paintings that inspire compassion, thoughtfulness, and a sense of belonging in the Mysteries of life.</p>
<p>       I am asking you to be more than a Patron of the Arts. I'm asking you to share the experience of this thrill ride with me!</p>
<p>       In sharing the experience with me, you will be receiving artwork, one-on-one events, or in-person consultation for custom designed and created pieces at various levels of your participation . . . and an immense amount of gratitude!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Driving Through the Gate </strong></h3>
<p>       In order for me to drive through this gate, I need $20,000 . . . a standard number for business development costs at this level of engagement. Participation in the high end luxury jewelry trade shows can run anywhere from $10,000 to over $20,000 to get you in front of the gatekeepers. That's the show only, no flights, hotel, materials' cost for jewelry to show/sell, and the displays and marketing materials for it all. All told, it could easily run over to $40,000.   </p>
<p>       Beyond the participation fee, funds raised will go toward materials: 23K gold leaf, steel, sterling silver, pearls, precious stones, and time making the exclusive art pieces for the in-person exhibition; flight, hotel, expenses for the four days in attendance; and for the design and creation of the artworks you will be receiving for your investment with me. </p>
<p>       For your participation of financial support, I have an array of creative offerings from which you can choose. For a truly custom experience, a personal visit from me to your home or office for consultation on three custom paintings at 3'x3' (or paintings measuring the equivalent in square inches). I will fly in, book a hotel, meet with you for the next day or two for consultation to design and create the perfect pieces for your space. Upon their completion, I will ship them and return to your home or office to install them! This would be soooo fun!</p>
<p>       <strong>The opportunity to co-brand has a very short time deadline on it . . .</strong> they need a commitment before the end of May so they can set me up with an interview and interior designer for the event space. The exhibition event includes a select set of luxury-level creative, technically innovative, and unique purveyors with whom they are working. I have planned my schedule, started working on the sculptural jewelry designs for the exclusive display case, and I have beautiful photography of pieces for the pages in the publication.</p>
<p>       The only thing missing is the financial support to sign the contract. If the financial support to sign the contract isn't forthcoming in the next few weeks, I won't be able to drive through the gate.</p>
<p>       If I can't drive through this gate, there are other gates on the road for me to drive towards. I have those planned as well. Contingency planning means a flexible and mobile forward path to success! The money raised in this campaign would then be used to get me through those other gates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This one is the créme-de-la-créme!  I want to race through this one!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Value of Art</h3>
<p>       The value of my project is most simply about the value of Art in ones' life. Art enhances, enriches, and visually stimulates our senses. It awakens us to emotional response with the curve of a smile or the rush of our breath. It makes statements on the value we place in ourselves and the spaces in which we live. Art is the luxurious tangible object in our lives that feeds our hearts and souls, reminding us that we are in the presence of grace. </p>
<p>       I have had women who wear my one of a kind neckpieces state that they feel a transformation happen, that they become More. Each one has a different definition of what More is to her, but in each case, they are extremely happy, content, and vibrant. It makes me smile to hear their joy!</p>
<p>       I have had people viewing my paintings who tell me my work brings them to a heightened sense of awareness, of connection. They feel a calm come over them, a feeling of knowing that all is possible. Some of my paintings are vast in their cosmic feeling, some are intimate in their atmospheric coloring, but all are accessible to that part of us that longs for reassuring quiet and love. I've been told my paintings are healing agents. And that makes me smile too.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">      <strong>To make a positive difference in the world, to create joy and healing in each person who wears and views it . . . this is what I want for my art.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It is the gift I was given to work with. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Track Record as Project Manager </h3>
<p>       It takes more than creative ability to successfully manage a project, and more so with one on the magnitude of this opportunity. I am responsible for more than my brand, I also have a responsibility to my co-branding entity and to you, my co-drivers. The following are personal attributes at the core of my being. They have led me to the successes I've experienced with every show, exhibition, commission, and event on which I've worked. </p>
<p>• Highly organized with a penchant for order.<br/>• Plan and develop realistic schedule to reach the desired goal.<br/>• Problem-solver: flexible and strategic<br/>• Dedicated to the deadline</p>
<p>       When the contract is signed, I will develop a weekly schedule according to their milestone deadlines for the collectors' publication and for the exclusive event. Everything I do will be based on their needs. Contributing to maintaining a smoothly running process is paramount. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>       There are risks &amp; challenges with everything. The biggest risk to this particular co-branding opportunity is not raising enough money to sign the contract. Should that risk happen, Plan B will commence, I will use the funds raised to prepare for another high level exhibition opportunity. Major trade industry events for Fall and Winter are opening their applications for exhibitor selection. These will require similar amounts of financing. Though this particular opportunity is unparalleled for the exclusivity of its luxury product and clientele, a few of the other events are high quality and also command a selective participation that would work very well for my brand. </p>
</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">One last plea . . .</h3><p>       I ask for your help in getting the word out, to share my  story so that others can drive through the gate with me!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Let's create a whole concours driven to excellence in Art!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">      For your ease, use the Indiegogo share tools. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you for your support!</h3></div>","THIS.  IS.  IT.
       The rare opportunity that takes a brand to the next level. The opportune moment that opens the gates for a brand to drive through and take its place among exceptional peers. However, to drive through this gate requires $20K immediately! A contract must be signed within 3 weeks!
       An unexpected phone call came in one morning, a yet-to-be-announced luxury automotive brand inviting me to co-brand my art jewelry with them . . . to align my art, my name, my brand with theirs. They have selected my art jewelry to be featured in their corporate publication for collectors and at a major event this summer. Though until a contract is signed, I cannot legally reveal who it is. 
The Gatekeeper has opened the gates . . .I am asking you to drive through the gates with me.
       I am asking you to support my brand's focused vision of innovative design and creativity. A brand whose drive is to leave the trends behind creating extraordinary art jewelry to be seen in, and modern exceptional paintings to live with. Jewelry that transforms and supports a woman on her quest for strength of self and individual beauty. Paintings that inspire compassion, thoughtfulness, and a sense of belonging in the Mysteries of life.
       I am asking you to be more than a Patron of the Arts. I'm asking you to share the experience of this thrill ride with me!
       In sharing the experience with me, you will be receiving artwork, one-on-one events, or in-person consultation for custom designed and created pieces at various levels of your participation . . . and an immense amount of gratitude!
 

Introducing Valerie Ostenak,the Artist as Metalsmith 

""I am drawn to movement and flow . . . vines and tendrils reaching out changing the ordinary into the beautiful; water carving glorious curves in canyons, wind changing the shape of clouds. Each a record of transformation, telling a story of adventure. I like playing with the movement that can be created with metal. In that movement, I, too, am creating an adventure and a story for each piece to tell.""

<p>Bison and pickup trucks. We live with both here in Jackson Hole.

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align: center;""> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align: center;""><strong>Artists: </strong></p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align: center;""><strong><span>Nathalie Mba Bikoro, Mansour Ciss Kanakassy, Pierre Marie Ciss, Jean Marie Claude Bruce, Djime Diakite, Claude Gomis, Tita Mbaye, Cool Diabang Mory, Hassan Sar</span></strong></p>

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The exhibition ""Guis Sou Me Le Mbao"" in Thiaroye (Senegal) - a project by Claude Gomis and Saskia Köbschall - is one of apexart's four selected Franchise Exhibitions for 2016-17.  It will invite contemporary African artists to commemorate the massacre of Tirailleurs Sénégalais, African soldiers conscripted for the French army, in the Thiaroye military camp in 1944.</p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The exhibition and the accompanying educational program for youth aim to shed light on a silenced chapter of colonial history: the story of the Tirailleurs Sénégalais, who fought and died for the French army in countless colonial wars and both World Wars from 1857 - 1964.<br/> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">Their story has long been close to our hearts and we finally got the chance to work on it by winning the apexart program, which will help us cover the costs for the exhibition itself (rent, production costs, art work transports etc.).</p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">With the support of this Indiegogo campaign we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">cover the travel costs of the artists based outside of Senegal, so they can engage with the Thiaroye community and create site specific installations</li>
<li lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">create an accompanying program of lectures, music and performances</li>
<li lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">organize workshops with youth and children from surrounding school</li>
</ul>_____________________________________________________________________________<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE EXHIBITION</h3>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The title of the exhibition draws on the Wolof phrase <i>I do not see you at Mbao </i>that was coined in the aftermath of the massacre as the soldiers' families rushed to the village of Mbao where the survivors had found refuge, hoping to see their loved ones. <i>Guis sou me le mbao</i> entered the Wolof language as an expression that is used to warn someone that he or she is in great danger. It is one of the traces that reveal the deep trauma caused by the massacre, whose brutality sent shock waves throughout French West Africa and was a wake up call to many, that despite the sacrifices West Africans had made for France in both World Wars and countless military interventions on three continents, they had come home to the same colonial brutality, racial injustice and discrimination.</p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The title of the exhibition literally issues a warning of the danger of non-remembrance of the colonial past and the invisibility but severeness of it's repercussions in our present through the persistence of colonial epistemologies, social and economic structures. The project will invite the artists to engage with the community of Thiaroye in order to create site specific works that will reflect on modes of resistance and means of challenging (post)colonial politics of memory.</p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;""> </p>
<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom:0cm;"">The exhibition “GUIS SOU ME LE MBAO” is part of the apexart franshise exhibition program. Founded in 1994, apexart is a non-profit arts  organization in NYC that offers opportunities to independent curators and emerging and established artists, and challenges ideas about art, its practice, and its curation.<br/><br/>The franchise program encourages curators to explore unusual exhibition places. “Guis Sou Me Le Mbao” will take place in Thiaroye (Senegal), a suburb of the capital Dakar, and aims to engage the community of Thiroye in an arts event that speaks directly to the history of the place and engages the community in the circuit of internationally renown artists.</p>

SHORT SUMMARY
 
Artists: 
Nathalie Mba Bikoro, Mansour Ciss Kanakassy, Pierre Marie Ciss, Jean Marie Claude Bruce, Djime Diakite, Claude Gomis, Tita Mbaye, Cool Diabang Mory, Hassan Sar
 
 
The exhibition ""Guis Sou Me Le Mbao"" in Thiaroye (Senegal) - a project by Claude Gomis and Saskia Köbschall - is one of apexart's four selected Franchise Exhibitions for 2016-17.  It will invite contemporary African artists to commemorate the massacre of Tirailleurs Sénégalais, African soldiers conscripted for the French army, in the Thiaroye military camp in 1944.
The exhibition and the accompanying educational program for youth aim to shed light on a silenced chapter of colonial history: the story of the Tirailleurs Sénégalais, who fought and died for the French army in countless colonial wars and both World Wars from 1857 - 1964. 
Their story has long been close to our hearts and we finally got the chance to work on it by winning the apexart program, which will help us cover the costs for the exhibition itself (rent, production costs, art work transports etc.).
 
With the support of this Indiegogo campaign we will be able to:

cover the travel costs of the artists based outside of Senegal, so they can engage with the Thiaroye community and create site specific installations
create an accompanying program of lectures, music and performances
organize workshops with youth and children from surrounding school

THE EXHIBITION
The title of the exhibition draws on the Wolof phrase I do not see you at Mbao that was coined in the aftermath of the massacre as the soldiers' families rushed to the village of Mbao where the survivors had found refuge, hoping to see their loved ones. Guis sou me le mbao entered the Wolof language as an expression that is used to warn someone that he or she is in great danger. It is one of the traces that reveal the deep trauma caused by the massacre, whose brutality sent shock waves throughout French West Africa and was a wake up call to many, that despite the sacrifices West Africans had made for France in both World Wars and countless military interventions on three continents, they had come home to the same colonial brutality, racial injustice and discrimination.
 
The title of the exhibition literally issues a warning of the danger of non-remembrance of the colonial past and the invisibility but severeness of it's repercussions in our present through the persistence of colonial epistemologies, social and economic structures. The project will invite the artists to engage with the community of Thiaroye in order to create site specific works that will reflect on modes of resistance and means of challenging (post)colonial politics of memory.
 
The exhibition “GUIS SOU ME LE MBAO” is part of the apexart franshise exhibition program. Founded in 1994, apexart is a non-profit arts  organization in NYC that offers opportunities to independent curators and emerging and established artists, and challenges ideas about art, its practice, and its curation.The franchise program encourages curators to explore unusual exhibition places. “Guis Sou Me Le Mbao” will take place in Thiaroye (Senegal), a suburb of the capital Dakar, and aims to engage the community of Thiroye in an arts event that speaks directly to the history of the place and engages the community in the circuit of internationally renown artists.
