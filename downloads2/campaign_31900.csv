<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>My name is Darryl Daniels, I am twenty years old, and I have recently been accepted into Hillsong College in Australia to study music for three years. The doubt and lack of a financial supply had pushed my hopes of attending Hillsong to the back of my mind, and even caused me to almost give up that hope... Not anymore. But I need your help! I have applied and got accepted! Now I just need to pay.</span></p>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The amount I need to raise is $7,500. This covers my flight, the first year’s tuition, and the three years that I will be staying there of Overseas Health Coverage, finalizing my acceptance. I will be working throughout the school year to pay for housing and living expenses.</span></p>
</div>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Here's my story:</strong></p>
<div>I was raised in a Christian home with two brothers and four sisters, me being the second youngest of the family. When I was thirteen my parents separated. This was a complete shock and it shook my world. The following year I had discovered that my dad’s body was slowly being taken over by pancreatic cancer.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>August 27th, 2006, marks the day that I first experienced the loss of a loved one. My sister Nicole, at the age of 19, had passed away in a car accident due to impaired driving. <br/>Two months after this, Oct. 31st, my dad passed away while he was in the hostpial getting treated for cancer. He had internel bleeding in his brain. I was there when his heart stopped beating.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Over the next few months it was as if a grey veil was pulled over my perspective of life. I fell into a deep depression. I felt alone and insignificant. I was only concerned about myself and could not see beyond my own pain.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One day I was alone in my room as thoughts of suicide were going through my mind when God pressed upon me to open my Bible and I decided to listen. I opened and read these words,</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“He replied, ‘Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ""Move from here to there,"" and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I flipped to another page and read, </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“‘Have faith in God,’ Jesus answered.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> In that very moment an amazing peace suddenly came over me like a wave, washing away all of the weight that I had felt pressing me down, all the darkness that had been laid over my heart was gone.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I had never before felt the presence of God this way. It was thick and tangible; I felt covered and surrounded by love. I realized what it truly meant to know God; what it meant to have a relationship with Jesus Christ. Up to this point I had thought I understood what it meant to know God, but I learned otherwise.<br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Ever since that day I have not been the same. God had taken my life and restored it and given me a hope that can only be found in Jesus Christ. I have gone through ups and downs, but never have I fallen into depression like I once did. My oldest brother took his own life in January, 2009. This was another devastating event in the family. This time I did not focus on the situation around me, but up at God and He pulled me through. Without Jesus I would not be here and I owe Him my life. Now, I do the best I can to live for God and bring Him glory with everything I do.</span></p>
</div>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>My musical background:</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I have been involved with music for 7 years now. I started off playing the drums and took private lessons for the first 4 years. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I eventually took music theory and picked up the piano, guitar, and singing. I have been playing guitar and singing for about 2 years now, as well as writing songs. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Through the years I have been playing the drums at churchs almost every Sunday morning and Wednesday night. I have also started singing lead every once in a while at church this past year. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Lately, I have been concentrating on singing and songwriting. Writing songs is a way for me to express myself in ways that I could not do otherwise. <br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>My Dream:</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>I believe the teaching, wisdom, and guidance that I will experience while attending Hillsong College will increase my ability to do this.

<h3>Here's the deal</h3>
<p>Hey ya'll! My name is Paige Motz. I'm 19 years young and I am totally in love with Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In May, I graduated from a 7 month school for missions in Brisbane, Australia. During the school, I also spent 7 weeks in Russia, living as a missionary. God completely changed my life during the Discipleship Training School in Australia and my outreach in Russia. I saw the hand of God move in AWESOME ways in the lives of people we were able to minister to, and through that, in my own life as well. God filled me up and so much growth took place in my life through Him! </p>
<p>While I had my heart set on going to a university in Texas upon my return (and was already enrolled and everything!), I felt very strongly that the Lord was actually calling me BACK to Brisbane to staff the Music, Art, and Dance Discipleship Training School- where I could give of the overflow He has blessed me with, come alongside others and share all the things He has shown me, and even use my passion for photography to teach others how to use their art for God's glory as I help lead the photography track of the school. So at the beginning of August, I will head back to Australia to begin my 21 month commitment as a FULL TIME missionary with YWAM Bribane!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because YWAM is completely volunteer-based, I am responsible for funding my trip, food and lodging, the Basic Leadership School course, and the 2 [missional] outreaches I will be leading. All prayers and support in this area would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Over all, I will be needing around a total of <strong>$18,000</strong> to cover all the things listed above, as well as my plane ticket, visa, overseas health care, and basic living necessitates.</p>
<p>I am currently working 3 jobs, have sold a good amount of my possessions, and am fundraising as much as possible to raise as much money as I can for this journey. However, with just <strong>ONE MONTH</strong> before I leave, I will need more than that to reach my goal.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your prayers and support SO much! And if you feel led or decide to donate financially, I'd like to give you a gift in return for your generosity! So check out the possible perks for your contribution on the side of this page :) </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am not merely taking part in this experience for myself or my own personal benefit. God totally transformed me during my DTS. Now, there's a passion stirring up in me to see the same thing happen in the lives that I get to be apart of while staffing! I want to use everything that God has shown me to benefit the lives of others for His glory. I want to be apart of others learning how God can use their art form- specifically photography- for HIS glory alone, and ultimately, I want to see Him touch lives in BIG ways. I truly believe God has big things for this generation, and is really moving on the mission field. And by supporting this cause- whether in prayer or financial donation- you could be a part of what God is doing there!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>One thing God has shown me recently is the POWER OF PRAYER. And I can confidently say that your prayers are worth just as much- if not MORE- than a monetary donation. So if you don't have the resources or feel led towards donating, no worries! I cannot beg you enough to support me in prayer instead! </p>
<p>If you feel led to share this video, as well- feel free!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

This campaign to provide her with living expenses was an idea some of us Canadians came up with because, in May 2013, Sylvie was suspended without pay on suspicion of leaking information to the media about an unethical EI quota system.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What Happened</h3>
<p><span class=""author-g-wvnjkiry4z122zd7exjl"">In Canada we are supposed to have a whistleblower's protection act, but in reality we don't have protection for people who expose government wrong-doing. </span><span class=""author-g-wvnjkiry4z122zd7exjl"">Sylvie Therrien could not continue, in good consience, working quietly within </span><span class=""author-g-wvnjkiry4z122zd7exjl"">government ""quota"" guidelines for EI. When she questioned her superiors about the ethics of the practise, her concerns were laughed off because the EI managers could get bonuses for big cuts to EI payouts. She realized that cutting people off rightfully earned EI only served one purpose: to make the government look good by saying that fewer people were unemployed.

<p><span class=""author-g-wvnjkiry4z122zd7exjl"">So Sylvie, at great peril to her own future earnings, stepped up and told the media about this unethical action by the Government of Canada.

<b><h2><b><i>En français</i></b></h2></b><h3><b>Dénonciatrice : Quotas à l’assurance- emploi</b></h3>
<p> Une campagne est engagée par un groupe de citoyens Canadiens afin<br/>d’aider Sylvie Therrien financièrement car depuis le 13 mai 2013, elle est<br/>suspendue sans solde.</p>
<h3><b>Voici les faits: </b></h3>
<p>Sylvie a débuté son emploi comme agente de programme aux<br/>Ressources Humaines et Développement Canada en Janvier 2011. À partir d’Octobre<br/>2012, sujette aux coupures du gouvernement fédéral, elle n’a d'autre choix que<br/>d'accepter un transfert au service de l'Intégrité à titre d'enquêteur à<br/>l’Assurance- emploi.</p>
<p><b>Voir l' entrevue avec Sylvie</b></p>
<p>(<a href=""http://livestream.com/occupyearth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://livestream.com/occupyearth</a>) En français</p>
<p>Sylvie se sent incapable de continuer à travailler en paix avec<br/>elle-même en utilisant  un système de quotas et des pratiques<br/>d’intimidations auprès des prestataires de revenu. Lorsqu’elle questionne ses<br/>supérieurs sur les pratiques de quotas, ceux-ci essaient de la convaincre de ne<br/>pas s’en faire en prétextant qu’il y a beaucoup de fraudes et de gens qui<br/>abusent du système et que les économies (quotas) se feront facilement, si elle<br/>fait son travail. Elle insiste donc sur le fait qu’elle trouve ces pratiques<br/>injustes et préjudiciables aux chômeurs. Ses supérieurs l’étiquètent aussitôt<br/>de «fauteur de trouble ». Les problèmes de Sylvie au travail augmentent, elle<br/>subit de l’intimidation et lorsqu’elle se plaint à la directrice, on lui répond<br/>qu’une enquête interne conclut que ses allégations de milieu de travail<br/>non-sain et de racismes à l'égard des nouveaux Canadiens et de préjugés contre<br/>les autochtones ne sont pas fondés. De plus, que Sylvie pourrait être passible<br/>de réprimandes, si elle fait de tels commentaires dans le futur.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Ajoutons que les pratiques de quotas imposées aux enquêteurs</span><br/>permettent aux gestionnaires de recevoir des bonis de plus de $50,000 à la fin<br/>de l’année fiscale si leur équipe d’enquêteurs performe et rencontre les<br/>objectifs.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Malgré la menace de perdre son emploi, Sylvie expose ces pratiques</span><br/>aux médias et aux Canadiens en les informant sur ce qu'il se passe à leur insu<br/>et avec leurs cotisations d’assurance-emploi. Elle explique pourquoi on coupe<br/>ou refuse les prestations d'assurance-emploi aux chômeurs. Ceux qu’on<br/>pénalisent permettent au gouvernement de faire des économies de<br/>$35,000-$40,000/mois, ce qui équivaut a $485,000/année. L’impact : ½ million<br/>par année de paiement d’assurance-emploi multiplie par chaque enquêteur dans<br/>chaque bureau de Service Canada à travers le pays équivaut a des millions<br/>d’économies ou d’argent volé aux Canadiens!</p>
<p> Le gouvernement remonte la filière jusqu'à Sylvie. L’employeur,<br/>sans preuve, décide qu’elle est coupable et la suspend sans solde sur le champ,<br/>pour fin d'enquête des le 13 mai 2013.</p>

<h3><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">L’Impacte des quotas</b></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>En cette période de difficultés économiques, beaucoup de Canadiens<br/>et Canadiennes se retrouvent en position vulnérable et sans emploi. L’état doit<br/>les supporter ou du moins, ne pas détourner les fonds payés par ces canadiens<br/>vers des bonis versés aux gestionnaires. On paie des voyages en hélicoptère à<br/>des ministres qui vont à la pèche, des campagnes publicitaires astronomiques ,<br/>des dépenses obsènes de sénateurs,la promotion coueuse de<u> plans d’action<br/>économique</u> qui ne fonctionnent pas. Sylvie, comme la majorité des<br/>Canadiens, croit que ce fond d’assurance-emploi appartient aux chômeurs<br/>Canadiens et non pas au gouvernement Canadien pour en disposer à sa guise. Il<br/>s'agit d'un filet social et il ne devrait servir qu'en ce sens. Il est clair<br/>qu'un système de quotas est inadmissible!</p>
<p>Sylvie Therrien, employée à Service Canada a été suspendue sans<br/>solde le 13 mai 2013 sous des allégations sans preuve. L’employeur, notre<br/>gouvernement, a décidé d’avance que Sylvie était coupable avant même de<br/>commencer leur enquête puisqu’elle a été puni par une coupure immédiate de<br/>salaire. L' enquête qui a suivi peut être  qualifiée de bidon puisque<br/>l'audience sur sa suspension sans solde a été remise à plus tard, soit à la<br/>mi-septembre, sous prétexte qu'on n'a pas pu trouver de date accommodante<br/>pour  l’employeur et  assurant  une représentation syndicale<br/>bilingue pour défendre Sylvie. Comment Sylvie doit-elle payer ses factures en<br/>attendant?</p>
<p>Le Canada possède une loi qui protège les «Whistleblowers-dénonciateurs » qui exposent publiquement des pratiques non-éthiques au sein du gouvernement et pourtant...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Vous pouvez aider :</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Même en ces temps difficiles, nous croyons que les Canadiens et<br/>les Canadiennes peuvent faire preuve de solidarité, d’entraide et de compassion<br/>afin d’aider Sylvie, qui a perdu son emploi. Aidons-là, aucune contribution<br/>n’est trop petite et merci à l'avance pour votre générosité. </p>

What Happened
In Canada we are supposed to have a whistleblower's protection act, but in reality we don't have protection for people who expose government wrong-doing. Sylvie Therrien could not continue, in good consience, working quietly within government ""quota"" guidelines for EI. When she questioned her superiors about the ethics of the practise, her concerns were laughed off because the EI managers could get bonuses for big cuts to EI payouts. She realized that cutting people off rightfully earned EI only served one purpose: to make the government look good by saying that fewer people were unemployed. Spin Spin Spin was what these quotas were about.
So Sylvie, at great peril to her own future earnings, stepped up and told the media about this unethical action by the Government of Canada. In our interview (http://livestream.com/occupyearth) she explains how she was told to disallow EI benefits for frivolous reasons in order to meet a quota of $485,000 in disallowed benefits per year

Let's stand up for Sylvie, who stood up for us! Even in these tough times, we believe that caring Canadians would be willing to donate to help pay the living expenses of someone who stood up for fellow Canadians.  Whether you can only afford $1 or can handle a larger donation of $5, $10 or even $100, know that your support is greatly appreciated. And please help by sharing this message with other caring Canadians. Together we can show Sylvie that yes, Canadians do care and Canadians support whistleblowers!
 
En françaisDénonciatrice : Quotas à l’assurance- emploi
 Une campagne est engagée par un groupe de citoyens Canadiens afind’aider Sylvie Therrien financièrement car depuis le 13 mai 2013, elle estsuspendue sans solde.
Voici les faits: 
Sylvie a débuté son emploi comme agente de programme auxRessources Humaines et Développement Canada en Janvier 2011. À partir d’Octobre2012, sujette aux coupures du gouvernement fédéral, elle n’a d'autre choix qued'accepter un transfert au service de l'Intégrité à titre d'enquêteur àl’Assurance- emploi.
Voir l' entrevue avec Sylvie
(http://livestream.com/occupyearth) En français
Sylvie se sent incapable de continuer à travailler en paix avecelle-même en utilisant  un système de quotas et des pratiquesd’intimidations auprès des prestataires de revenu. Lorsqu’elle questionne sessupérieurs sur les pratiques de quotas, ceux-ci essaient de la convaincre de nepas s’en faire en prétextant qu’il y a beaucoup de fraudes et de gens quiabusent du système et que les économies (quotas) se feront facilement, si ellefait son travail. Elle insiste donc sur le fait qu’elle trouve ces pratiquesinjustes et préjudiciables aux chômeurs. Ses supérieurs l’étiquètent aussitôtde «fauteur de trouble ». Les problèmes de Sylvie au travail augmentent, ellesubit de l’intimidation et lorsqu’elle se plaint à la directrice, on lui répondqu’une enquête interne conclut que ses allégations de milieu de travailnon-sain et de racismes à l'égard des nouveaux Canadiens et de préjugés contreles autochtones ne sont pas fondés. De plus, que Sylvie pourrait être passiblede réprimandes, si elle fait de tels commentaires dans le futur.
Ajoutons que les pratiques de quotas imposées aux enquêteurspermettent aux gestionnaires de recevoir des bonis de plus de $50,000 à la finde l’année fiscale si leur équipe d’enquêteurs performe et rencontre lesobjectifs.
Malgré la menace de perdre son emploi, Sylvie expose ces pratiquesaux médias et aux Canadiens en les informant sur ce qu'il se passe à leur insuet avec leurs cotisations d’assurance-emploi. Elle explique pourquoi on coupeou refuse les prestations d'assurance-emploi aux chômeurs. Ceux qu’onpénalisent permettent au gouvernement de faire des économies de$35,000-$40,000/mois, ce qui équivaut a $485,000/année. L’impact : ½ millionpar année de paiement d’assurance-emploi multiplie par chaque enquêteur danschaque bureau de Service Canada à travers le pays équivaut a des millionsd’économies ou d’argent volé aux Canadiens!
 Le gouvernement remonte la filière jusqu'à Sylvie. L’employeur,sans preuve, décide qu’elle est coupable et la suspend sans solde sur le champ,pour fin d'enquête des le 13 mai 2013.

L’Impacte des quotas

En cette période de difficultés économiques, beaucoup de Canadienset Canadiennes se retrouvent en position vulnérable et sans emploi. L’état doitles supporter ou du moins, ne pas détourner les fonds payés par ces canadiensvers des bonis versés aux gestionnaires. On paie des voyages en hélicoptère àdes ministres qui vont à la pèche, des campagnes publicitaires astronomiques ,des dépenses obsènes de sénateurs,la promotion coueuse de plans d’actionéconomique qui ne fonctionnent pas. Sylvie, comme la majorité desCanadiens, croit que ce fond d’assurance-emploi appartient aux chômeursCanadiens et non pas au gouvernement Canadien pour en disposer à sa guise. Ils'agit d'un filet social et il ne devrait servir qu'en ce sens. Il est clairqu'un système de quotas est inadmissible!
Sylvie Therrien, employée à Service Canada a été suspendue sanssolde le 13 mai 2013 sous des allégations sans preuve. L’employeur, notregouvernement, a décidé d’avance que Sylvie était coupable avant même decommencer leur enquête puisqu’elle a été puni par une coupure immédiate desalaire. L' enquête qui a suivi peut être  qualifiée de bidon puisquel'audience sur sa suspension sans solde a été remise à plus tard, soit à lami-septembre, sous prétexte qu'on n'a pas pu trouver de date accommodantepour  l’employeur et  assurant  une représentation syndicalebilingue pour défendre Sylvie. Comment Sylvie doit-elle payer ses factures enattendant?
Le Canada possède une loi qui protège les «Whistleblowers-dénonciateurs » qui exposent publiquement des pratiques non-éthiques au sein du gouvernement et pourtant...

Vous pouvez aider :

Même en ces temps difficiles, nous croyons que les Canadiens etles Canadiennes peuvent faire preuve de solidarité, d’entraide et de compassionafin d’aider Sylvie, qui a perdu son emploi. Aidons-là, aucune contributionn’est trop petite et merci à l'avance pour votre générosité. 
 Les canadiens ont besoin d'employée honnète comme Sylvie pour exposer la vérité et Sylvie a maintenant besoin de nous!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Receiving an education is a basic human right, just like having clean drinking water or having food to eat. In the developing world, and even in America, there is not enough access to an affordable and effective education. Without an education, children lack the sources to develop skills such as creativity, problem solving, and leadership to solve the world’s biggest problems. The education systems around the world are in a state of crisis. In the developing world, children beg for an education.</p>
<p>In fact, there are more than 61 million preschool-aged children that do not even have access to education in the world. That number does not even include the 266 million adolescents out of school every day around the world. If every country had 40 percent of their men and women able to read and write, they would develop more quickly than their current rates.</p>
<p>I work with an NGO called Pencils of Promise that builds schools in the developing world for communities that truly want them. We then stay on the ground and hire teachers and staff from in the community while keeping a few Pencils of Promise staff around to make sure the school stays in tact. The founder, Adam Braun (Semester at Sea Spring 2005 Alum), came up with the idea while on Semester at Sea and inspired me to apply. He made a habit out of asking every child he met what they wanted most in the world and a child beggar on the streets in India simply said, “a pencil.”  Pencils of Promise works in communities to build schools and empower young leaders to in turn empower the world around them.</p>
<p>The story that has had the biggest effect on me is about Adam’s early work with Pencils of Promise when one day he was backpacking in Laos, a small country in Southeast Asia. Adam said he came across a group of children huddled over a broken chalkboard, practicing their letters on the weekend. The fact that we complain in America as children because we have to go to school completely hides the effective power behind a confident, imaginative, empowered, and educated individual. We take advantage of what so many people around the world beg to receive.</p>
<p>Through Semester at Sea, I will be able to learn more about the developing world and immerse myself in international cultures that I have never had the opportunity to come in contact with before. Through the global comparative education offered through Semester at Sea I will become well equipped to learn more about a world I know little about. The knowledge and experience I gain from this trip will introduce me to a new way of thinking and will prepare me for my future work in nonprofits. It will help me realize even more that I am not just a citizen of the United States, but also a global citizen. Hopefully the knowledge, global experience, and life skills I learn on the Semester at Sea program will help me to reach my dream job, a staff member at Pencils of Promise, and become a strong force doing everything I can to bring educational opportunity to those in need all around the world, especially women, While on the trip, I will be researching the disparity of educational opportunity to women around the world. This will potentially help me to create a program to implement in schools that will encourage women to receive an education and become empowered. Please help this dream become a reality as my parents and I are not able to afford the $30,000 trip on our own. Through your donation, scholarships, work-study, and personal letters to friends and family, this dream can become a reality.  Thank you so much for your support!</p></div>","Education is an ever-growing need in our world’s struggling economy.

<p><b>Public
Library Project </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many children in Guinea cannot read at grade level.
According to the World Bank only 63.4% of Guinean youth between the ages 15 to
24 can read and only 57% of females of that age bracket can read and write. These
numbers are even lower for children under the age of 15. In order to remedy this
major issue, improving the early grade-reading competency is a must. It is with
these statistics in mind that Hope of Guinea has started its project to open
the first fully functioning public library in Guinea. </p>
<p>Hope of Guinea has partnered with the County of Dixinn in
Conakry, Guinea to open the first fully functioning public library in Guinea. We
have started this campaign to raise money to pay for the setup of the library,
including shelving, tables, computer desks, and other miscellaneous items such
as lamps, electrical and internet outlets, security equipment to secure computers
and tablets, and a computer equipped with a librarian system to monitor usage. </p>
<p>Through a partnership with Books For Africa, we were able to
send a container of 30,563 new French books to Guinea in November 2013, which
will be used to supply the library. We have also received a donation of 25 DataWind
Educational Tablets through Dr. Sarah McCue, a Professor at Georgetown
University.  The tablets will serve as
critical components for the computer lab to be opened within the library. We
are seeking donations for 20 additional computers, two heavy-duty printers and
scanners along with other necessary educational software. These computers will
help expose children to new technologies thus helping them adapt to an evolving
world. </p>
<p>The County of Dixinn has provided the infrastructure for
the library, a computer lab and land to build a basketball court. The library
will be housed in the same compound as the Jozip Broz Tito Elementary and
Middle School located in the city of Belle-Vue in Conakry, Guinea.  The library will be free of charge and
available to all children.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>

I publish my audiobooks through internet. One day in 2012 a person sent me an email from West Bengal, India that he is blind and he works for a blind school where they regularly listen my audio books. He also wrote that they do not have many books in Braille and that’s why they cannot read all books. But as I narrate the stories, they can simply listen to it. It really touched me. I was creating audio books as my hobby for those people who do not have time to read. I never thought of making audio books for blind people, it never came to my mind. After knowing this I started asking more questions about the school and I learned that it is in a rural village of West Bengal, India. Majority of the students are very poor, school provides them boarding, lodging and study materials in Braille. The facility provides special arrangement for its students keeping in mind the requirements of the blind kids. The school gets a nominal funding from Government sources which is not at all sufficient for running the school with teachers, staff and boarding facilities. So they need people like you and me who can donate and help these unfortunate kids to continue their education. For them, education or light of knowledge is the only thing that can change their life. Without education, these kids would have no means to lead a good life and might end up begging in the streets. Last year we raised $1535 using this Indiegogo platform and supported 10 sightless students to complete their education for one year. This year also I need your help to support 10 sightness students. 8 of them retained from last year and 2 students were added in place of 2 who graduated from middle school.</p><h2><strong>Description of the campaign and why it’s important to me</strong></h2><p>It is really very tough for a blind kid to continue his/her education. In India it is even tougher due to lack of infrastructure, poverty and lack of social awareness. For these 10 blind kids in Krishanagar India, education is the only means available to them for social recognition. Krishnanagar Helen Keller Vidhyapith is the place where blind kids can study up to middle school. The school provides education, study materials in braille and living assistance in dorm. Each student requires $150 for his/her expense in the school for one year. I on behalf of Mukti for social Development, a California based non profit public benefit corporation (IRS Employer Identification Number - 26-2650992) am seeking $1500 for supporting these 10 poor blind kids for next year in school starting January 2014. Failure to provide this amount to the kids could result in discontinuation of school for some of them. Please donate and help the blind kids to get the light of knowledge. This project is very close to my heart because my Grandfather became blind at an age of 58. I have seen how difficult his life became after he lost his sight. Life became horrible for him and infrastructure was not there to support him. My grandfather was not poor, his biggest problem was he could not see. But these 10 blind kids I choose are very poor. So with a little monetary help, at least they will be able to get some education and live a respectful life.</p><br/><h2><strong>How much funding I need and where it’s going</strong></h2><p>Each student requires a scholarship of $150 per year which will cover their school fee, study materials in Braille, audio books and hostel fee. So I will require $1500 for supporting 10 blind students for a year. Your entire donations will go to the Krishnanagar Helen Keller Vidyapith and Shaktinagar High School in West Bengal, India. </p><h2><strong>My track record with projects like this</strong></h2><p></p><ul>
<li>Last year I collected $1535 for 10 blind students of the same schools. Visit the project at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-campaign-to-support-10-blind-kids-to-continue-education/x/723409"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-campaign-to-support-10-blind-kids-to-continue-education/x/723409</a>
</li>
<li>I always try to help underprivileged kids. In year 2010 I read in newspaper about a 3 months old kid named Kaushik Debnath from Tripura, India who needed a difficult heart surgery but his parents being very poor were not able to afford. I contacted my friends and through emails and Facebook and I collected some money which was not sufficient. Then I contacted a non-profit organization named Pashchimi and their donor base donated a lot. I collected a little over $2000 which helped Kaushik's parents pay for the heart surgery. Thanks to the surgery, now Kaushik is leading a normal life.</li>
<li>My other project was with the non-profit organization named Mukti for Social Development. In this project, I helped to organize a 10K run to collect money for solar lights in Sundarban region of West Bengal, India. We managed to provide solar lamps to 120 families living without electricity. The details of the project are available at<a href=""http://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000166"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000166</a>
</li>
<li>Another project that I do during festive season is Holiday Toy Drive. In the year 2011, I collected over 50 new toys donated by employees of Semtech Inc, a semiconductor company based in California. The details of this project are at <a href=""http://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000165"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000165</a>

Krishnanagar Helen Keller Vidhyapith is the place where blind kids can study up to middle school. The school provides education, study materials in braille and living assistance in dorm. Each student requires $150 for his/her expense in the school for one year. I on behalf of Mukti for social Development, a California based non profit public benefit corporation (IRS Employer Identification Number - 26-2650992) am seeking $1500 for supporting these 10 poor blind kids for next year in school starting January 2014. Failure to provide this amount to the kids could result in discontinuation of school for some of them. Please donate and help the blind kids to get the light of knowledge. This project is very close to my heart because my Grandfather became blind at an age of 58. I have seen how difficult his life became after he lost his sight. Life became horrible for him and infrastructure was not there to support him. My grandfather was not poor, his biggest problem was he could not see. But these 10 blind kids I choose are very poor. So with a little monetary help, at least they will be able to get some education and live a respectful life.How much funding I need and where it’s goingEach student requires a scholarship of $150 per year which will cover their school fee, study materials in Braille, audio books and hostel fee. So I will require $1500 for supporting 10 blind students for a year. Your entire donations will go to the Krishnanagar Helen Keller Vidyapith and Shaktinagar High School in West Bengal, India. My track record with projects like this
Last year I collected $1535 for 10 blind students of the same schools. Visit the project at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-campaign-to-support-10-blind-kids-to-continue-education/x/723409

I always try to help underprivileged kids. In year 2010 I read in newspaper about a 3 months old kid named Kaushik Debnath from Tripura, India who needed a difficult heart surgery but his parents being very poor were not able to afford. I contacted my friends and through emails and Facebook and I collected some money which was not sufficient. Then I contacted a non-profit organization named Pashchimi and their donor base donated a lot. I collected a little over $2000 which helped Kaushik's parents pay for the heart surgery. Thanks to the surgery, now Kaushik is leading a normal life.
My other project was with the non-profit organization named Mukti for Social Development. In this project, I helped to organize a 10K run to collect money for solar lights in Sundarban region of West Bengal, India. We managed to provide solar lamps to 120 families living without electricity. The details of the project are available athttp://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000166

Another project that I do during festive season is Holiday Toy Drive. In the year 2011, I collected over 50 new toys donated by employees of Semtech Inc, a semiconductor company based in California. The details of this project are at http://muktiforsocialdevelopment.org/shownews.php?newsid=100000165",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

What We Need



US CyberPatriot costs $400 to register per team of nine students. We estimate that we need at least $1,500 to operate for the 2013-2014 school year.
The funds will go toward registering students new to the world of cybersecurity and helping them understand the importance of the field and delve into the depths of the material.
If we are not able to meet our goal, we will still be able to use the money to register as many students as we can. The remainder will go toward registering for the other competitions we participate in, such as CyberAces, the San Diego Mayor's Cup CyberChallenge, and PicoCTF.


The Impact





Every single member of Westview CyberSecurity takes the field very seriously. While we have our fun, we are aware of the massive importance of cybersecurity both in the workplace and the world. By fostering education early on, we are able to encourage students new to the field and engage everyone in actively learning. We want to make a difference in the world, and we believe that one way to do that is to strengthen security.
Historically, we have excelled in these competitions. Three years ago the team traveled to Washington, D.C. and received 2nd place at the national US CyberPatriot competition Last year, we won $2,500 at the San Diego Mayor's Cup CyberChallenge as well as a week-long training session in ethical hacking (http://goo.gl/hzX0yE).
We take the time to train all our members before each competition and prepare in every way possible.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<hr/>
<p>  </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHO WE ARE</h2>
<blockquote><em>We believe that <strong>everyone has the right to education, regardless of their location, availability or financial conditions</strong>, and therefore we assume as our mission to facilitate such access.</em></blockquote>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHERE DID WE GET THIS IDEA?</h2>
<p>The ideia has born a few years ago, when Sofia moved to a smaller town. She is both a teacher and a student, and she experienced in first hand what is like to live and study in a smaller town. She had lived most of her life in a big city, and when she moved away from the capital she realized she had lost the power to choose which courses she would like to do. In the new town, there was no diversity and whenever there was some interesting course to do, it ended canceled for lack of participants.</p>
<p>This is the reality of most small towns. There is no specialized or qualified training  because there is no market for it. But we believe that education is a right, therefore we should all be entitled to educate ourselves in any subject, regardless of our location, or time availability of our financial condition and therefore we created REWINDD that aims to turn this right into a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHO NEEDS THIS?<span> </span>
</h2>
<p class=""Body1"">Everyone. A closer look at the training market has revealed profound gaps regarding to the offer. With the exception of big cities where we can find specific training and some diversity, the rest of the country, we find always the same titles.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">The reality is that our training centers have no choice. The implementation of government programs to support education led to the opening of dozens of training centers, jostling each other on offering financed training. This situation has created unrealistic expectations about the price of the training. Nowadays people are more awake to the need to qualify but less ready to invest their own money in such training.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">The companies were forced to reduce their offer to the National Qualifications Catalogue and within this, to a small range of courses for which they are able to join groups easily.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">The training activities that do not fit in this context, end up developing in a parallel market, where the trainers themselves take the organization of training action at their own risk. In this case there is more variety, but still, there are many courses that fail to open because the promotor can not gather a group in a given zone or time.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Outside the major cities, this can be dramatic. If you want something different, more specific, you just can´t find it.</p>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">HOW WILL WE DO IT? <span> </span>
</h2>
<p class=""Body1""><strong>REWINDD will make knowledge accessible to all. </strong></p>
<p class=""Body1"">We are developing an on demand video training platform where students may access they prefered courses 24 hours a day, from anywhere.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">We want to provide a training experience quite similar to the environment in the classroom. Courses are designed specifically for online environment and use techniques to assure the student feels just like the tranches is by his side. We seek to build a relationship between student and teacher although they might be miles away.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">We will begin with important themes like personal finances, design, webdevelopment, tecnology, marketing, coaching, emotional inteligence, wellness and personal development courses because we recognize the need for it In the market. Still, we want to extend the training to other areas of knowledge quickly and for this we rely on the help of our future trainees who can leave suggestions on our website.</p>
<p>We pretend to take our learning platform to all Portuguese-speaking countries, like <span>Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea, Mozambique, S. Tome and Principe and East Timor and all portuguese communities out there.</span></p>
<p>REWINDD users will benefit from ...</p>
<ul>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Autonomy</strong>, they will no longer depend on others to have the oportunity to learn, because it would not be necessary to assemble a group with a common interest in these matters and availability for the same time and place.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Privacy</strong>, they can do it right from their couch</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Pace</strong>, they can learn at their own pace. They may view and review the training videos as many times as they want to.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Availability</strong>, contents are available 24 hours a day, 365 days per week.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Freedom</strong> to start, stop and resume the course whenever they want without being limited to a predefined schedule that would be subject to the availability of the group, trainer and training room.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Mobility</strong> they may watch the course anywhere, they will only need a computer and internet access.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Diversity</strong>, the chance to find related courses that allow them to complement their training.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Niche</strong> <strong>contents</strong>, if we can find a trainer they will have the training no matter how specific the theme or area is.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Lower price</strong>, for the majority, <strong>absolutely free</strong> for those who can not afford it.</li>
<li class=""Body1"">
<strong>Privileged access</strong> to the trainer for inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER</h2>
<p class=""Body1"">By helping us, you are giving each studant the chance to study regardless of his location, availability or financial conditions. <strong>You can make a difference in someone's life.</strong></p>
<h3 class=""Body1""> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?</h2>
<p>We launched a year ago, a pilot experiment and the feedback was highly positive. Students who experienced the webdesign course we made available said:</p>
<blockquote><em>I like to do things at my own pace, and here I have the chance for it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I can review the videos as often as I want, backtrack, relearn from time to time and make the site on my time.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>There are always those details that get lost in a classroom course, because we were focused to realize previous task, or because the phone rang at an important stage and we got distracted, or because we are tired. This model is easy. Just pause it, go for a sandwich and come back in exactly the place where we were with Sofia to join us.</em></blockquote>
<p>Since then, we already have the developed the concept, designed the logo, and started developing the website. It's being built as we speak and we are already gathering the teaching team too. We already have someone in mind to produce the videos, still, we need the equipment and software for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the first 12 months of REWINDD. After that the project should pay for itself.</p>
<p>We have the costs of developing the website, capturing and editing each course, as well as the costs of launching, expanding program and doing outreach for the next 12 months.  Now <strong>we need help to finish getting it ready to launch.</strong> Funds raised will be used to finish development, video capture and editing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The funds will be used entirely for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarships, for students with no financial conditions  </li>
<li>Website development and hosting</li>
<li>Video / audio equipment and software</li>
<li>Volunteer stipends</li>
<li>Office rent</li>
<li>Indiegogo's cut</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funds will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website hosting</li>
<li>Video / audio equipment and software</li>
<li>Indiegogo's cut</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>

<h2 class=""Body1"">QUEM SOMOS?</h2>
<blockquote><em>Acreditamos que <strong>todos têm o direito à educação, independentemente da sua localização, disponibilidade ou condições financeiras</strong> e, portanto, assumimos como nossa missão facilitar esse acesso.</em></blockquote>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1""><span>ONDE SURGIU A IDEIA?</span></h2>
<p>A ideia surgiu há alguns anos, quando Sofia, se mudou para as Caldas da Rainha. Ela é formadora e uma eterna estudante, pelo que experimentou em primeira mão o que é viver e estudar numa cidade pequena. Sofia viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Lisboa, e quando se mudou percebeu que tinha perdido o poder de escolher os cursos que queria fazer. Não tinha diversidade e sempre que aparecia algum curso interessante para fazer, acabava cancelado por falta de participantes.</p>
<p>Esta é a realidade da maioria das cidades pequenas. Não há formação especializada ou qualificada, porque não há mercado para ela. Mas nós acreditamos que a educação é um direito, independentemente da nossa localização, disponibilidade  ou da nossa condição financeira e, por isso, criamos REWINDD que vem criar uma nova realidade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">QUEM PRECISA DISTO?<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h2>
<p class=""Body1"">Todos aqueles que gostam de aprender, de fazer formação contínua, demelhorar as suas competência e conhecimentos. Um olhar mais atento sobre o mercado de formação revelou lacunas profundas no que diz respeito à oferta.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Com excepção feita aos grandes centros como Lisboa e Porto onde podemos encontrar formação específica e diversidade, no resto do país, encontramos mais do mesmo.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">A realidade é que os centros de formação não têm alternativa. A implementação do programa de Novas Oportunidades levou à abertura de dezenas de centros de formação, que se acotovelam entre si na oferta de formação financiada. Esta situação criou expetativas irrealistas sobre o preço da formação. Hoje em dia as pessoas estão mais despertas para a necessidade de se qualificarem mas menos disponíveis para investir o seu próprio dinheiro nessa formação.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Na prática, isto obrigou as empresas do setor a reduzirem a sua oferta formativa ao Catálogo Nacional de Qualificações e dentro deste, a um pequeno leque de cursos para os quais conseguem formar turmas com facilidade.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">As ações de formação que não se enquadram neste contexto, acabam por se desenvolver num mercado paralelo, onde os próprios formadores assumem a organização da ação por sua conta e risco. Neste caso há mais variedade, mas ainda assim, há muitos cursos que não passam do papel porque não se consegue reunir um grupo numa determinada zona ou horário.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Fora das grandes cidades, isto pode ser dramático. Ao contrário do que se julga, isto não afecta apenas o interior e as ilhas. Cidades litorais como as Caldas da Rainha e até capitais de distrito como Faro, sofrem do mesmo mal.</p>
<p class=""Body1""> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">COMO É QUE O VAMOS FAZER? <span style=""text-align: center;""> </span>
</h2>
<p class=""Body1""><strong>A REWINDD vai tornar o conhecimento acessível a todos. </strong>Estamos a desenvolver uma plataforma de formação de vídeo on demand, onde os formandos podem aceder aos cursos de 24 horas por dia, em qualquer lugar.</p>
<p>Queremos proporcionar uma experiência de formação bastante semelhante à sala de aula. Os cursos são desenhados especificamente para um ambiente online e usam técnicas específicas para assegurar que o aluno se sente como se tivesse o formador ao seu lado. Procuramos construir uma relações de empatia entre aluno e professor, apesar da distância.</p>
<p>Vamos lançar a plataforma com cursos nas áreas de finanças pessoais, design, web development, tecnologia, marketing, coaching, inteligência emocional, bem-estar e desenvolvimento pessoal, porque reconhecemos a necessidade para este temas no mercado. Ainda assim, pretendemos alargar a formação a outras áreas de conhecimento rapidamente e para isso contamos com a ajuda de nossos formandos que podem deixar sugestões no site.</p>
<p>Pretendemos levar a nossa plataforma de aprendizagem a todos os países de língua portuguesa como <span>Angola, Brasil, Cabo Verde, Guiné, Moçambique, S. Tomé e Principe e Timor Leste e às comunidades portuguesas espalhadas por esse mundo fora.</span></p>
<p>Os utilizadores REWINDD vão beneficiar de ...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Autonomia</strong>, deixam de estar dependentes de terceiros.</li>
<li>
<strong>Privacidade</strong>, podem fazer o curso no conforto da sua casa</li>
<li>
<strong>Ritmo</strong>, podem aprender ao seu ritmo, ver e rever os vídeos quantas vezes quiserem.</li>
<li>
<strong>Disponibilidade</strong>, os conteúdos estão disponíveis 24 horas por dia, 365 dias por semana.</li>
<li>
<strong>Liberdade</strong>, para iniciar, interromper e retomar o curso quando quiserem, sem terem de se sujeitar a um cronograma pré-definido que numa versão presencial seria condicionado à disponibilidade do grupo, formador e sala de formação. </li>
<li>
<strong>Mobilidade</strong>, podem ver o curso em qualquer lugar.</li>
<li>
<strong>Diversidade</strong>, formação em áreas relacionadas e complementares.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nichos, </strong>conteúdos específicos que não encontram no mercado convencional porque a necessidade de reunir um grupo com interesse nesses temas e com disponibilidade para um mesmo horário e local, os inviabiliza.</li>
<li>
<strong>Baixo preço</strong>, para a maioria, <strong>absolutamente grátis</strong> para aqueles que não podem pagar.</li>
<li>
<strong>Acesso privilegiado ao formador</strong> para esclarecimento de dúvidas.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>O QUE PODEMOS FAZER JUNTOS?</strong></h2>
<p class=""Body1"">Juntos podemos dar a oportunidade a cada formando de fazer a formação que precisa independentemente da região onde vive, da sua disponibilidade em termos de horário e das suas condições financeiras. <strong>juntos, podemos fazer a diferença na vida de alguém!</strong></p>
<h3 class=""Body1""> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">O QUE FIZÉMOS ATÉ AGORA?</h2>
<p>Lançámos há um ano atrás, uma experiência piloto e o feedback foi muito positivo. Os alunos que fizeram o curso webdesign que disponibilizámos disseram:</p>
<blockquote style=""font-size: 85%;""><em>Eu gosto de fazer as coisas ao meu ritmo, e aqui tenho a chance para isso. </em></blockquote>
<blockquote style=""font-size: 85%;""><em>Posso rever os vídeos quantas vezes quiser, voltar atrás, ver de novo de vez em quando e fazer o site no meu tempo.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote style=""font-size: 85%;""><em> Há sempre aqueles detalhes que se perdem na sala de aula, porque estávamos focados na tarefa anterior, porque o telefone tocou ou porque estamos cansados. Neste modelo é fácil. Basta pausar, ir buscar uma sanduíche e voltar exatamente ao lugar onde estávamos com Sofia.</em></blockquote>
<p>Desde então, desenvolvemos o conceito, desenhámos o logotipo, e começámos a desenvolver o site. Já estamos a reunir a equipa pedagógica e já temos alguém em mente para a produção dos vídeos. Precisamos agora de equipamento e software para aedição de vídeo e audio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""Body1"">PARA O QUE VAI SER USADO O DINHEIRO?</h2>
<p>O nosso objetivo é reunir fundos suficientes para financiar os primeiros 12 meses da REWINDD. Depois disso o projeto pagar-se-à a si próprio.</p>
<p>Temos como custos o desenvolvimento do site, a captura e edição dos videos de cada curso, bem como os custos de lançamento, expansão e divulgação para os próximos 12 meses. Agora precisamos de ajuda para terminar e lançar o projeto. Os recursos captados serão utilizados para finalizar o desenvolvimento do site, captura e edição de vídeo.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Os fundo recolhidos vão ser usados:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bolsas de estudos, para alunos sem condições financeiras  </li>
<li>Desenvolvimento e alojamento do site</li>
<li><span>Equipamento e software de edição de audio e vídeo</span></li>
<li><span><span>Despesas de voluntários</span></span></li>
<li>Aluguer de espaço para as gravações</li>
<li>Comissões do Indiegogo</li>
</ul>
<p>Se não conseguirmos a totalidade, o que for recolhido será usado:</p>
<ul>
<li>No alojamento do site</li>
<li>Equipamento e software de edição de audio e vídeo</li>
<li>Comissões do Indiegogo</li>

WHO WE ARE
We believe that everyone has the right to education, regardless of their location, availability or financial conditions, and therefore we assume as our mission to facilitate such access.
 
WHERE DID WE GET THIS IDEA?
The ideia has born a few years ago, when Sofia moved to a smaller town. She is both a teacher and a student, and she experienced in first hand what is like to live and study in a smaller town. She had lived most of her life in a big city, and when she moved away from the capital she realized she had lost the power to choose which courses she would like to do. In the new town, there was no diversity and whenever there was some interesting course to do, it ended canceled for lack of participants.
This is the reality of most small towns. There is no specialized or qualified training  because there is no market for it. But we believe that education is a right, therefore we should all be entitled to educate ourselves in any subject, regardless of our location, or time availability of our financial condition and therefore we created REWINDD that aims to turn this right into a reality.
 
 
WHO NEEDS THIS? 

Everyone. A closer look at the training market has revealed profound gaps regarding to the offer. With the exception of big cities where we can find specific training and some diversity, the rest of the country, we find always the same titles.
The reality is that our training centers have no choice. The implementation of government programs to support education led to the opening of dozens of training centers, jostling each other on offering financed training. This situation has created unrealistic expectations about the price of the training. Nowadays people are more awake to the need to qualify but less ready to invest their own money in such training.
The companies were forced to reduce their offer to the National Qualifications Catalogue and within this, to a small range of courses for which they are able to join groups easily.
The training activities that do not fit in this context, end up developing in a parallel market, where the trainers themselves take the organization of training action at their own risk. In this case there is more variety, but still, there are many courses that fail to open because the promotor can not gather a group in a given zone or time.
Outside the major cities, this can be dramatic. If you want something different, more specific, you just can´t find it.
 
 
HOW WILL WE DO IT?  

REWINDD will make knowledge accessible to all. 
We are developing an on demand video training platform where students may access they prefered courses 24 hours a day, from anywhere.
We want to provide a training experience quite similar to the environment in the classroom. Courses are designed specifically for online environment and use techniques to assure the student feels just like the tranches is by his side. We seek to build a relationship between student and teacher although they might be miles away.
We will begin with important themes like personal finances, design, webdevelopment, tecnology, marketing, coaching, emotional inteligence, wellness and personal development courses because we recognize the need for it In the market. Still, we want to extend the training to other areas of knowledge quickly and for this we rely on the help of our future trainees who can leave suggestions on our website.
We pretend to take our learning platform to all Portuguese-speaking countries, like Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea, Mozambique, S. Tome and Principe and East Timor and all portuguese communities out there.
REWINDD users will benefit from ...


Autonomy, they will no longer depend on others to have the oportunity to learn, because it would not be necessary to assemble a group with a common interest in these matters and availability for the same time and place.

Privacy, they can do it right from their couch

Pace, they can learn at their own pace. They may view and review the training videos as many times as they want to.

Availability, contents are available 24 hours a day, 365 days per week.

Freedom to start, stop and resume the course whenever they want without being limited to a predefined schedule that would be subject to the availability of the group, trainer and training room.

Mobility they may watch the course anywhere, they will only need a computer and internet access.

Diversity, the chance to find related courses that allow them to complement their training.

Niche contents, if we can find a trainer they will have the training no matter how specific the theme or area is.

Lower price, for the majority, absolutely free for those who can not afford it.

Privileged access to the trainer for inquiries.

 
 
WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER
By helping us, you are giving each studant the chance to study regardless of his location, availability or financial conditions. You can make a difference in someone's life.
 
 
WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?
We launched a year ago, a pilot experiment and the feedback was highly positive. Students who experienced the webdesign course we made available said:
I like to do things at my own pace, and here I have the chance for it.
I can review the videos as often as I want, backtrack, relearn from time to time and make the site on my time.
There are always those details that get lost in a classroom course, because we were focused to realize previous task, or because the phone rang at an important stage and we got distracted, or because we are tired. This model is easy. Just pause it, go for a sandwich and come back in exactly the place where we were with Sofia to join us.
Since then, we already have the developed the concept, designed the logo, and started developing the website. It's being built as we speak and we are already gathering the teaching team too. We already have someone in mind to produce the videos, still, we need the equipment and software for it.
 
 
WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?
Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the first 12 months of REWINDD. After that the project should pay for itself.
We have the costs of developing the website, capturing and editing each course, as well as the costs of launching, expanding program and doing outreach for the next 12 months.  Now we need help to finish getting it ready to launch. Funds raised will be used to finish development, video capture and editing.


The funds will be used entirely for:

Scholarships, for students with no financial conditions  
Website development and hosting
Video / audio equipment and software
Volunteer stipends
Office rent
Indiegogo's cut

If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funds will go to:

Website hosting
Video / audio equipment and software
Indiegogo's cut

About the team
The REWINDD team has more than 10 experience in classroom training and more than 15 years experience in webdesign and development. 
 
 

 
 
QUEM SOMOS?
Acreditamos que todos têm o direito à educação, independentemente da sua localização, disponibilidade ou condições financeiras e, portanto, assumimos como nossa missão facilitar esse acesso.
 
ONDE SURGIU A IDEIA?
A ideia surgiu há alguns anos, quando Sofia, se mudou para as Caldas da Rainha. Ela é formadora e uma eterna estudante, pelo que experimentou em primeira mão o que é viver e estudar numa cidade pequena. Sofia viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Lisboa, e quando se mudou percebeu que tinha perdido o poder de escolher os cursos que queria fazer. Não tinha diversidade e sempre que aparecia algum curso interessante para fazer, acabava cancelado por falta de participantes.
Esta é a realidade da maioria das cidades pequenas. Não há formação especializada ou qualificada, porque não há mercado para ela. Mas nós acreditamos que a educação é um direito, independentemente da nossa localização, disponibilidade  ou da nossa condição financeira e, por isso, criamos REWINDD que vem criar uma nova realidade.
 
 
QUEM PRECISA DISTO? 

Todos aqueles que gostam de aprender, de fazer formação contínua, demelhorar as suas competência e conhecimentos. Um olhar mais atento sobre o mercado de formação revelou lacunas profundas no que diz respeito à oferta.
Com excepção feita aos grandes centros como Lisboa e Porto onde podemos encontrar formação específica e diversidade, no resto do país, encontramos mais do mesmo.
A realidade é que os centros de formação não têm alternativa. A implementação do programa de Novas Oportunidades levou à abertura de dezenas de centros de formação, que se acotovelam entre si na oferta de formação financiada. Esta situação criou expetativas irrealistas sobre o preço da formação. Hoje em dia as pessoas estão mais despertas para a necessidade de se qualificarem mas menos disponíveis para investir o seu próprio dinheiro nessa formação.
Na prática, isto obrigou as empresas do setor a reduzirem a sua oferta formativa ao Catálogo Nacional de Qualificações e dentro deste, a um pequeno leque de cursos para os quais conseguem formar turmas com facilidade.
As ações de formação que não se enquadram neste contexto, acabam por se desenvolver num mercado paralelo, onde os próprios formadores assumem a organização da ação por sua conta e risco. Neste caso há mais variedade, mas ainda assim, há muitos cursos que não passam do papel porque não se consegue reunir um grupo numa determinada zona ou horário.
Fora das grandes cidades, isto pode ser dramático. Ao contrário do que se julga, isto não afecta apenas o interior e as ilhas. Cidades litorais como as Caldas da Rainha e até capitais de distrito como Faro, sofrem do mesmo mal.
 
COMO É QUE O VAMOS FAZER?  

A REWINDD vai tornar o conhecimento acessível a todos. Estamos a desenvolver uma plataforma de formação de vídeo on demand, onde os formandos podem aceder aos cursos de 24 horas por dia, em qualquer lugar.
Queremos proporcionar uma experiência de formação bastante semelhante à sala de aula. Os cursos são desenhados especificamente para um ambiente online e usam técnicas específicas para assegurar que o aluno se sente como se tivesse o formador ao seu lado. Procuramos construir uma relações de empatia entre aluno e professor, apesar da distância.
Vamos lançar a plataforma com cursos nas áreas de finanças pessoais, design, web development, tecnologia, marketing, coaching, inteligência emocional, bem-estar e desenvolvimento pessoal, porque reconhecemos a necessidade para este temas no mercado. Ainda assim, pretendemos alargar a formação a outras áreas de conhecimento rapidamente e para isso contamos com a ajuda de nossos formandos que podem deixar sugestões no site.
Pretendemos levar a nossa plataforma de aprendizagem a todos os países de língua portuguesa como Angola, Brasil, Cabo Verde, Guiné, Moçambique, S. Tomé e Principe e Timor Leste e às comunidades portuguesas espalhadas por esse mundo fora.
Os utilizadores REWINDD vão beneficiar de ...


Autonomia, deixam de estar dependentes de terceiros.

Privacidade, podem fazer o curso no conforto da sua casa

Ritmo, podem aprender ao seu ritmo, ver e rever os vídeos quantas vezes quiserem.

Disponibilidade, os conteúdos estão disponíveis 24 horas por dia, 365 dias por semana.

Liberdade, para iniciar, interromper e retomar o curso quando quiserem, sem terem de se sujeitar a um cronograma pré-definido que numa versão presencial seria condicionado à disponibilidade do grupo, formador e sala de formação. 

Mobilidade, podem ver o curso em qualquer lugar.

Diversidade, formação em áreas relacionadas e complementares.

Nichos, conteúdos específicos que não encontram no mercado convencional porque a necessidade de reunir um grupo com interesse nesses temas e com disponibilidade para um mesmo horário e local, os inviabiliza.

Baixo preço, para a maioria, absolutamente grátis para aqueles que não podem pagar.

Acesso privilegiado ao formador para esclarecimento de dúvidas.

 
 
O QUE PODEMOS FAZER JUNTOS?
Juntos podemos dar a oportunidade a cada formando de fazer a formação que precisa independentemente da região onde vive, da sua disponibilidade em termos de horário e das suas condições financeiras. juntos, podemos fazer a diferença na vida de alguém!
 
 
O QUE FIZÉMOS ATÉ AGORA?
Lançámos há um ano atrás, uma experiência piloto e o feedback foi muito positivo. Os alunos que fizeram o curso webdesign que disponibilizámos disseram:
Eu gosto de fazer as coisas ao meu ritmo, e aqui tenho a chance para isso. 
Posso rever os vídeos quantas vezes quiser, voltar atrás, ver de novo de vez em quando e fazer o site no meu tempo.
 Há sempre aqueles detalhes que se perdem na sala de aula, porque estávamos focados na tarefa anterior, porque o telefone tocou ou porque estamos cansados. Neste modelo é fácil. Basta pausar, ir buscar uma sanduíche e voltar exatamente ao lugar onde estávamos com Sofia.
Desde então, desenvolvemos o conceito, desenhámos o logotipo, e começámos a desenvolver o site. Já estamos a reunir a equipa pedagógica e já temos alguém em mente para a produção dos vídeos. Precisamos agora de equipamento e software para aedição de vídeo e audio.
 
 
PARA O QUE VAI SER USADO O DINHEIRO?
O nosso objetivo é reunir fundos suficientes para financiar os primeiros 12 meses da REWINDD. Depois disso o projeto pagar-se-à a si próprio.
Temos como custos o desenvolvimento do site, a captura e edição dos videos de cada curso, bem como os custos de lançamento, expansão e divulgação para os próximos 12 meses. Agora precisamos de ajuda para terminar e lançar o projeto. Os recursos captados serão utilizados para finalizar o desenvolvimento do site, captura e edição de vídeo.


Os fundo recolhidos vão ser usados:

Bolsas de estudos, para alunos sem condições financeiras  
Desenvolvimento e alojamento do site
Equipamento e software de edição de audio e vídeo
Despesas de voluntários
Aluguer de espaço para as gravações
Comissões do Indiegogo

Se não conseguirmos a totalidade, o que for recolhido será usado:

No alojamento do site
Equipamento e software de edição de audio e vídeo
Comissões do Indiegogo

</div>","Bonjour!Je m'appelles Jean, je suis étudiant en Langues à l'université de Rennes 2. J'ai eu la chance de voyager au Kenya en 2010. Le but du séjour était de découvrir ce pays dont les richesses culturelles et naturelles attirent chaque année des centaines de miliers de touristes du monde entier. A mon arrivée, j'ai été hébergé chez Mr Oyugi, directeur d'une école assez particulière qu'il a fondé il ya plus de 10 ans, il a été un vrai père pour de nombreux orphelins du district de Homa Bay.L'écoleLa ""King Solomon Junior School"" à un rôle social majeur à jouer dans la région car elle accueille des enfants issus de milieux défavorisés ainsi que des orphelins et leur offre l'opportunité d'accéder à une éducation de qualité. En effet, cette année l'école s'est classée deuxième du district à l'examen national, le KCPE (équivalent à notre Baccalaureat), sur plus de 300 écoles! Afin de venir en aide aux familles les plus démunies et de permettre à leurs enfants de se construire un avenir décent, la politique de l'école concernant le règlement des frais de scolarité est souple. Il s'agit de trouver, avec les parents qui ne peuvent pas payer, des solutions pratiques comme faire participer ces parents à la vie de l'école. Certains viennent aider à couper du bois pour la cuisine, d'autres viennent effectuer des travaux de peinture ou de maçonnerie, pour les familles qui travaillent dans l'agriculture et la pêche il est également possible de payer en aliments.La situationLe taux de VIH et de paludisme étant très élevé dans la région, de nombreux enfants deviennent orphelins très jeunes. Mr Oyugi fait de son mieux pour les élever convenablement avec de faibles ressources, cependant la tâche est rendue plus difficiles quand les conditions sanitaires ne sont pas bonnes. L'eau est un problème majeurAu cours de la saison sèche, la population n'accède que très difficilement à l'eau potable et se tourne bien souvent vers le lac Victoria, tout proche, pour aller y puiser l'eau qui servira à leurs besoins journaliers. Cette eau n'est pas propre à la consommation, pourtant beaucoup de personnes n'ont d'autre choix que de la boire pour survivre.Ainsi, nous avons décidé de construire un réservoir d'eau de pluie enterré, qui collectera l'eau durant la saison des pluies et pourra contenir suffisamment d'eau pour alimenter l'école tout au long de l'année.En participant à la réalisation de notre projet, vous permettrez aux enfants de Homa Bay de rendre leur futur plus digne. La devise de l'école est ""La Connaissance c'est la Vie"". Je crois que c'est une vérité. Seule l'éducation pourra permettre aux plus démunis d'améliorer leur niveau de vie.La saison des pluies commençant à peine, plus vite nous aurront réuni le budget nécessaire à la construction du réservoir, plus nous pourront collecter d'eau pour passer la saison sèche.Ci-dessous le budget prévisionnel détaillé:Si vous pensez que le jeu en vaut la chandelle, partagez notre projet autour de vous! Un grand merci à ceux qui permettront à ces enfants de se focaliser davantage sur leurs études que sur leur état de santé.
......................................................................................................................................Hello! My name is Jean, I'm a student, I live in France where I was born and raised. I travelled to Kenya in 2010 because I wanted to discover this beautiful country.I stayed for two months at Mr Oyugi's house who is a real father for many orphans of the district of Homa Bay. He has been running a very special school for more than 10 years. About the school ""King Solomon Junior School"" has an important social role to play in the province as it hosts children from humble backgrounds and gives them the possibility to access quality education. As a matter of fact, this year the school went second in terms of results at the national exam within the whole county, which counts more than 300 schools! In order to help the most needy families offering their children a future, the school's policy is to figure out case by case ways of arrangement concerning the fees. Some parents who can't afford the bill come to help by achieving some tasks there such as cutting firewood, painting walls, etc... Others may give some food if they work in the fields or if they fish. Here is the situation
As the rate of HIV and malaria contamination is very high, many children here become orphans very soon. Mr Oyugi tries his best to grow them safely. This task is made harder when sanitary conditions are bad. Water is a big problem there During the dry season people cannot access clean drinkable water and many go to the Lake Victoria nearby to fetch water for drinking. This water is not good for consumption. That is why we decided to help those children by building an underground water tank which will collect rainwater from the roofs of the school and enable the children to get clean water all through the year. By helping us achieving our goal, you will ensure the children of Homa Bay means to make their future brighter. The motto of the school is: ""Knowledge is Life"". I believe this is true. Education only can make solutions for the needy ones to improve their living.As the rainy season just starts, the faster we will manage to raise the amount needed, the better it will be as this would be an opportunity to start collecting clean water for the coming year.Hereinbelow our estimated budget for the building:If you think this is worth helping us, please share our project with your friends!Thanks a lot to those who will allow these children to focus more on their studies than on their health.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>H</b>ello,
my name is Lia Mari Menard. I am the CEO and Co-Founder of Living Lake
Global Community Center. I’ve volunteered to assist a dear friend
with his mission. <br/></p><p>Working with local officials, Zain Jaelani is building a school for his
daughter, and the children of his village on Lombok Island in
Indonesia. Zain has been working and saving for 3 years to build a
preschool. Without our help, it will take him another 3 years to save
the needed funds. I am utterly amazed what one man, alone, accomplish! <br/><br/>With Your help, the team on Lombok can have their
funds in less than 90 days, in time to build in the spring. So little
money can go so far with this project! We help them build the
preschool, and they will have generations of children learning in
an adequate and safe environment.<br/><br/>A better school will allow the parents, who are currently having to tuition their children out in
neighboring towns, to keep their children close to home, a new local school will allow families more time together, fathers might not have to leave the home and island for work, and the children will have more time to play too of course! <br/><br/>Because of high the costs families must pay for tuition and travel,
fathers are having to leave the village and often the island
altogether looking for higher paying work, to earn enough money to educate their children, thus leaving
families virtually fatherless. A vicious cycle this community is working diligently to break, they will continue to work, and they will succeed.<br/><br/>From these humble
beginnings, Zain and the team intend to use what they have learned through this process to assist other people around the world to
build needed schools in their communities. <br/></p><p>What we need and what you get...</p><p>When
I asked Zain how much money he needed, he said “$5,000”.<br/>I was
shocked… For us in the United States, it sounds like such a small goal for a group of people to reach.<br/></p><p>I have doubled Zain's figure and with good reason. As we all know, things never go
as planned, unexpected costs come up when building. If there are any surplus funds after building the preschool, these
funds will be used to buy
books, supplies, and possibly help offset the costs of the first year of teacher
salaries, to help them get off to a great start.<br/><br/>I am very hopeful we will raise these 'extra' funds for the books and supplies. I know that the children will have a better start in their new school when they have the adequate tools.</p><p>If we do not receive enough funds to begin building, the money we do collect will be placed in bank accounts, wisely accruing interest, as we locate the remaining funds needed as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>What you get: Aside from instant sincere gratitude, all contributors to the preschool project can download a free copy of one of my eBooks. That is, a contribution as little as a $5= A wonderfully inspirational book! The more you give, the more we give too! For $25, you get my eBook, but also you can download Len Branson's documentary, ""Superwise Me!"".  For $100 You receive the eBook, Len's movie, and you will also receive a signed photo of the children  in the new school once it's built.

<p>
</p>Many of the parents who have difficulty affording
the tuition costs,  are praying for the new school. The spacious Loving Energy of the New School is sure to attract quality teachers, and thus,

the main cause of the economic pressures families face on Lombok is due, in large part, to the poor
education received in early childhood. Of course, we know this is true. Lack of education is a leading factor in poverty and so many other social issues. I can empathize with Zain in his unwavering desire to do whatever it takes to give his daughter the education he was not able to get. We applaud his effort and dream.<br/><br/>Your generosity
with our campaign can not be measured in terms of your impact on this

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for visiting our fundraising page! We are 15 students attending Harvard University in Cambridge, MA and we are currently planning a service trip to the Philippines this January. Before our trip, we are amassing funds to help us carry out our chosen project.</p>
<p>The particular project we will be implementing in January is being planned in conjunction with <i>Child Hope Asia</i>, a non-profit organization which promotes education for Filipino street kids, most of whom live in cardboard boxes by the side of the road and are exposed to a variety of negative influences. Last year's team--the first group of undergraduates to ever do this service trip to the Philippines--held a series of self-expression workshops with the street kids, doing things from singing and dancing to art and photography. The project culminated in a giant showcase called ""Ang Kwento Ko"" (""My Story""), where the kids performed onstage and money was raised for the cause. The video above is a sneak preview into how the week went.</p>
<p>Mr. Timothy Boulton, superintendent at Aguinaldo International School who works closely with <i>Child Hope. </i>has expressed his desire to have us join them again for two weeks to strengthen the program and to possibly make this an annual trip. <i>Stairway Foundation,</i>a rehabilitation center for physically and sexually abused street children based in Mindoro, has invited us to visit them and interact with their kids as well.</p>
<p>Because of budget constraints, however, we’ve found that our ability to fund many of the costs associated with a trip to the Philippines is limited. On top of paying for airfare, we will also have to pay for food and internal travel expenses. As such, we are asking generous individuals such as yourself to consider donating to our cause.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact us, you may do so at hpfmentoring@gmail.com.  If you would like to learn more about last year's trip and what we achieved, please don’t hesitate to view the team's blog from last year: <a href=""http://www.harvardphilippinejterm.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.harvardphilippinejterm.wordpress.com</a> or website at <a href=""http://www.harvardphilippineforum.weebly.com/j-term-2014.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.harvardphilippineforum.weebly.com/j-term-2014.html</a> Thank you so much for all your help!</p>

<p>Another idea at the same time I was building KATE 1.0 was I think KATE would be a big help in interacting with kids with Autism and learning disability's and could help them increase their social interaction skills and communication and learning from young to old. <br/></p><p>As a former caretaker I also think KATE humanoids could be use in nursing homes to help patients with Alzheimer's or just a great companion for the lonely living at home. I was also a caretaker for over 10 years for my mom so I know the in's and out's of elderly patient care to be programmed into a Avatar robot AI sub systems, plus I want to have in KATE 1.0 ver2 a Bluetooth pendent or bracelet for the elderly to wear to call KATE for assistance at any time.<br/></p>
<p>KATE 1.0 is a humanoid robot for kids to adults was a quick 4-month project that started on April 2010 for fun. KATE is an autonomous robot as well as a Tele operated robot a cloud robot that never stops learning, a cloud robot. I can see you, I can hear you, I can smell dangerous gases and smoke from fires, and I can talk to you and express emotions, lots of smiles and if needed a hug. <br/></p>
<p>I have an 8 inch Android table for teleconferences and a touch input screen for teaching screen for the young. I have a 22 DOF or degrees of freedom of movement for my body so fare and will be upgraded to more DOF's as well I have a fully articulated mouth that can show emotions of happy or sadness and my lips move also when I talk to express realness. <br/></p>
<p>I have a nose that will sense invisible gases we can't like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, natural gas, temperature, humidity and smoke from a fire to keep you and your family safe with more sensors to be added to the final model ver 2 of KATE 1.0.</p><p>KATE 1.0 is not limited to the English language being see is a cloud robot she will be able to convert to any language at anytime  with ease, I also want her to do sign language for the deaf with new hand designs in KATE 1.0 ver 2 of her.<br/></p>
<p>I use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for motion detection and image depth processing and have sonar sensors for distance sensing also. I also have stereo vision for video conferencing and image processing and I can see I the dark with inferred sensors as well in smoke filled room if there was a fire to help people get out of a burning home. <br/></p>
<p>My robot unique rubber track system is very powerful and can move on all surfaces as well as on steep inclines and outdoors. For my KATE 1.0 brains I use the Intel Atom 450 microprocessor that was donated by Intel running at 1.5 Ghz with Windows XPe and various other embedded software AI components, this will be upgraded to the also Intel donated i5 dual core board 2.5 Ghz running Win 7e with various ROS, AI and CV software. <br/></p><p>Inside KATE 1.0 is a few Atmel micro-controllers like the ATMega 168 and ATMega 2560 for multi sensor input functions like accelerometers, gyros and the nose sensor assembly and motion control, also a few Microchip A/D converters and TI and Linear devices voltage regulators, there is other unique parts but best to keep them secret at this time.<br/></p><p>I also have 30 channel GPS to not get lost out doors, and soon Solar panels will be added for long duration outside use in the front and back yard or on the go. <br/></p><p>KATE 1.0 ver 2 will be upgrade to the newer Intel i5 dual core 2.5 Ghz highly embedded low power board that was also donated by Intel corp for the robot project earlier this year, Intel is an embedded partner for all my humanoid projects. The KATE 1.0 ver 2 will have the latest in new technology's, KATE 1.0 as you see her is a prototype and the final version will be even more fantastic and even more friendly and functional. Join me, lets make KATE 1.0 a reality.  <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/823198/files/20140830135345-kate1a.jpg?1409432025"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                Kate in the Tech News.<br/><span><a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57480882-1/kate-the-humanoid-robot-kids-lets-talk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KATE 1.0 humanoid project in the new CNET magazine July 24, 2012</a><br/><a href=""http://www.hizook.com/blog/2012/04/16/kate-new-humanoid-robot-futurebots-labs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KATE 1.0 humanoid project in the new HiZook magazine, April 16, 2012</a><br/><a href=""http://www.plasticpals.com/?p=31477"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> KATE 1.0 humanoid in Plastic Pals robotics magazine, April 18, 2012</a><br/><a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/video-friday-festo-exohand-russian-robonaut-and-hugvie-the-huggable-robot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KATE 1.0 featured in IEEE magazine, April 27, 2012</a><br/><hr/>

<p><strong>ABOUT ME:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan Mathias - CTO Robotics Scientist and Robotics visionary at <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>FutureBots Humanoid labs</strong><br/>I'm the owner and founder of <strong> FutureBots</strong>
 in 1985 with a few disciplines in Electrical engineering,  Mechanical 
engineering, Computer science, and  Software engineering, Robot builder 
to name a few with over 35 years of real world engineering experience.  <strong>FutureBots </strong> went full time in 1992 
it's an electronic components company specializing in robotic component 
parts for the hobbyist and professional for the last 29 years. The 
company was founded in 1985 after I built my first humanoid mobile robot
 George. I decided there was a need for a company to sell various parts 
like computer chips, motors, and robot body parts to the public that was
 building and experimenting with electronics and robotics. </p>

For me robotics is my passion since I was 10, my dad instilled in me a passion for engineering, I have built many robots and taken apart thousands of computers and printers, radios, TV's to see how they worked, even if I don't get the funding I need I will still build robots, but today to really make things happen we need cash flow and lots of it to stay ahead of the Google's that are taking over all tech devices, please help me make the KATE 1.0 project come alive, thanks.<br/><hr/>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/823032/files/20140830121658-timeline.jpg?1409426218"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The funding of $200,000 is kinda a minimum to make the KATE 1.0 project happen, rent on a new large robotics lab with office and manufacturing area with utility's for 3 years would cost some $50k to $70k for some 6000 square feet, buying a couple high end 3D printers and a high end 3 axis mill maybe cost another $30k+, buying all the plastics and electronics and hardware parts another $30K+ and hire a few engineers, interns and techs another $50k+ or more, does not leave much for squiggle room, but I have to try, to get the KATE 1.0 off the ground needs funding and that's why I'm here. <br/>$500k to a 1 million would be optimal to really make things happen, but time will tell on all of the funding here, this is very new to me. even if I don't reach my goal I will find a way, there is no turning back, just imagine a KATE 1.0 in every home teaching kids, helping adults, maybe even walk the dog. <br/>Your probably wondering what KATE 1.0 would cost to sell, I want to keep KATE 1.0  under $5,000 and in the range of maybe $3500 to $4000 as we gear up production, for that price you are getting a great amount of technology. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>KATE 1.0 will be the first full size humanoid for house use that will out perform all others that yet exist, there is None in the USA yet, not even Google has a intelligent home tele operated cloud humanoid yet, lets beat them to the punch and get this project funded plus some and going. <br/></p>
<p>The KATE 1.0 humanoid project will make jobs, help kids and adults, and also would be a great tool in the robot labs around the country being KATE is semi open source for hardware and software. KATE 1.0 uses off the self parts to make manufacturing a ease.</p>
<p>KATE 1.0 is not the only humanoid coming from the FutureBots Humanoid Lab there is also the ATOM 1.0 a full size humanoid being developed for the hard work to support the needs of mankind in Space exploration, Healthcare, Commercial and Industrial Manufacturing, Hazardous rescue activities and Chemical and Biological disposal applications. <br/></p>
<p>My ATOM 1.0 full-size humanoid is also entered in the DRC - DARPA challenge for mid 2015, we are 1 of only 17 teams entered. <a href=""http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/teams/futurebots"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> ATOM 1.0 Humanoid featured on the DARPA DRC site entered in the event 08/25/2014.</a><br/></p>
<p>ATOM 1.0 is a 8 year part-time project that is about ready to walk, he is 5'3"" tall @ 185 lbs, just imagine KATE humanoids working inside houses while ATOM humanoids do the dangerous hard work outside keeping us safe.<br/></p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even with funding it's a hard road, but just look at what I have built with NO funding KATE 1.0 and ATOM 1.0 and many other robots, just imagine what I could think up and make to create jobs and prosperity again in the USA and in that process helping the young to the old in need, I'm a go getter, I always find a way around any problem, my dad Calvin worked at Pratt &amp; Whitney as a engineer  and taught me how to solve engineering problems. <br/></p>
<p>There will be 10's of millions of elderly in the next decade and now that will need help at home and to have just some company to play checkers, remind to take there medicine or go to a doctors appointment or even help them in there exercises, one reason I built KATE and ATOM was for the kids and elderly in need, they need are help. <br/></p>
<p>I was a caretaker a few years back so I know what the elderly need to comfort them, please help me make this dream come true so we can help them.  <br/></p>
<p>A few years back in the mid 1970's when I was a teen there was a person named Bill Gates III and Steve Jobs or Dell or HP started with a small dream in a garage and now look at what it has created all around us technological prosperity, my FutureBots Humanoid Lab may be small at this time but we have BIG ideas, please help, let do it together, thanks!.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help and Perks<br/>
</h3>
<p>Please spread the word on social media about the KATE 1.0 humanoid project, all help is needed and appreciated, lets work together to make this dream happen. Thanks !</p>
<p>Just a idea example of the KATE 1.0 T-Shirt, Plaque, Sticker and Car plate will look like, the final version will be great.<br/></p>

My original idea in 2012 for KATE 1.0 humanoid was to build a robot that men and women parent's far away in a distant lands serving there country in the US military could use KATE 1.0 as a Tele operated robots to play games with there kids, teach there kids, or just give them a big hug from the front lines while on duty. 
Another idea at the same time I was building KATE 1.0 was I think KATE would be a big help in interacting with kids with Autism and learning disability's and could help them increase their social interaction skills and communication and learning from young to old. As a former caretaker I also think KATE humanoids could be use in nursing homes to help patients with Alzheimer's or just a great companion for the lonely living at home. I was also a caretaker for over 10 years for my mom so I know the in's and out's of elderly patient care to be programmed into a Avatar robot AI sub systems, plus I want to have in KATE 1.0 ver2 a Bluetooth pendent or bracelet for the elderly to wear to call KATE for assistance at any time.
KATE 1.0 is a humanoid robot for kids to adults was a quick 4-month project that started on April 2010 for fun. KATE is an autonomous robot as well as a Tele operated robot a cloud robot that never stops learning, a cloud robot. I can see you, I can hear you, I can smell dangerous gases and smoke from fires, and I can talk to you and express emotions, lots of smiles and if needed a hug. 
I have an 8 inch Android table for teleconferences and a touch input screen for teaching screen for the young. I have a 22 DOF or degrees of freedom of movement for my body so fare and will be upgraded to more DOF's as well I have a fully articulated mouth that can show emotions of happy or sadness and my lips move also when I talk to express realness. 
I have a nose that will sense invisible gases we can't like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, natural gas, temperature, humidity and smoke from a fire to keep you and your family safe with more sensors to be added to the final model ver 2 of KATE 1.0.KATE 1.0 is not limited to the English language being see is a cloud robot she will be able to convert to any language at anytime  with ease, I also want her to do sign language for the deaf with new hand designs in KATE 1.0 ver 2 of her.
I use the Microsoft Kinect sensor for motion detection and image depth processing and have sonar sensors for distance sensing also. I also have stereo vision for video conferencing and image processing and I can see I the dark with inferred sensors as well in smoke filled room if there was a fire to help people get out of a burning home. 
My robot unique rubber track system is very powerful and can move on all surfaces as well as on steep inclines and outdoors. For my KATE 1.0 brains I use the Intel Atom 450 microprocessor that was donated by Intel running at 1.5 Ghz with Windows XPe and various other embedded software AI components, this will be upgraded to the also Intel donated i5 dual core board 2.5 Ghz running Win 7e with various ROS, AI and CV software. Inside KATE 1.0 is a few Atmel micro-controllers like the ATMega 168 and ATMega 2560 for multi sensor input functions like accelerometers, gyros and the nose sensor assembly and motion control, also a few Microchip A/D converters and TI and Linear devices voltage regulators, there is other unique parts but best to keep them secret at this time.I also have 30 channel GPS to not get lost out doors, and soon Solar panels will be added for long duration outside use in the front and back yard or on the go. KATE 1.0 ver 2 will be upgrade to the newer Intel i5 dual core 2.5 Ghz highly embedded low power board that was also donated by Intel corp for the robot project earlier this year, Intel is an embedded partner for all my humanoid projects. The KATE 1.0 ver 2 will have the latest in new technology's, KATE 1.0 as you see her is a prototype and the final version will be even more fantastic and even more friendly and functional. Join me, lets make KATE 1.0 a reality.                                  Kate in the Tech News.KATE 1.0 humanoid project in the new CNET magazine July 24, 2012KATE 1.0 humanoid project in the new HiZook magazine, April 16, 2012 KATE 1.0 humanoid in Plastic Pals robotics magazine, April 18, 2012KATE 1.0 featured in IEEE magazine, April 27, 2012

ABOUT ME:
Dan Mathias - CTO Robotics Scientist and Robotics visionary at 
FutureBots Humanoid labsI'm the owner and founder of  FutureBots
 in 1985 with a few disciplines in Electrical engineering,  Mechanical 
engineering, Computer science, and  Software engineering, Robot builder 
to name a few with over 35 years of real world engineering experience.  FutureBots  went full time in 1992 
it's an electronic components company specializing in robotic component 
parts for the hobbyist and professional for the last 29 years. The 
company was founded in 1985 after I built my first humanoid mobile robot
 George. I decided there was a need for a company to sell various parts 
like computer chips, motors, and robot body parts to the public that was
 building and experimenting with electronics and robotics. 
KATE 1.0 and Dan Mathias Robotics Scientist

     My Small Robotics Lab

ABOUT:FutureBots Humanoid Lab - FBHL "" We are Building Tomorrow, Today"". We maybe small but we have BIG ideas. Dan Mathias a Robotics Scientist, CEO, Visionary and Extreme Maker at FutureBots.com. A hands on thinking out of the box Engineer having 35+ years of private sector experience. I have been building robots since the early 1980's. Skills like building fiberglass Boats, Molds, building Restaurant interiors, and Epoxy table tops. Building and driving Race cars, Engine and Chassis building, or working at a Major Semiconductor company on advanced Space and Military rated parts as a Senior Test and Design Engineer, or building robots and circuits since I was 15 with a vast knowledge of IC's, Micro's and 12 years of various engineering college degrees. My resume on LinkedIn.

                                          Some of my early robot creations
For me robotics is my passion since I was 10, my dad instilled in me a passion for engineering, I have built many robots and taken apart thousands of computers and printers, radios, TV's to see how they worked, even if I don't get the funding I need I will still build robots, but today to really make things happen we need cash flow and lots of it to stay ahead of the Google's that are taking over all tech devices, please help me make the KATE 1.0 project come alive, thanks.
The funding of $200,000 is kinda a minimum to make the KATE 1.0 project happen, rent on a new large robotics lab with office and manufacturing area with utility's for 3 years would cost some $50k to $70k for some 6000 square feet, buying a couple high end 3D printers and a high end 3 axis mill maybe cost another $30k+, buying all the plastics and electronics and hardware parts another $30K+ and hire a few engineers, interns and techs another $50k+ or more, does not leave much for squiggle room, but I have to try, to get the KATE 1.0 off the ground needs funding and that's why I'm here. $500k to a 1 million would be optimal to really make things happen, but time will tell on all of the funding here, this is very new to me. even if I don't reach my goal I will find a way, there is no turning back, just imagine a KATE 1.0 in every home teaching kids, helping adults, maybe even walk the dog. Your probably wondering what KATE 1.0 would cost to sell, I want to keep KATE 1.0  under $5,000 and in the range of maybe $3500 to $4000 as we gear up production, for that price you are getting a great amount of technology. 
  The Impact
KATE 1.0 will be the first full size humanoid for house use that will out perform all others that yet exist, there is None in the USA yet, not even Google has a intelligent home tele operated cloud humanoid yet, lets beat them to the punch and get this project funded plus some and going. 
The KATE 1.0 humanoid project will make jobs, help kids and adults, and also would be a great tool in the robot labs around the country being KATE is semi open source for hardware and software. KATE 1.0 uses off the self parts to make manufacturing a ease.
KATE 1.0 is not the only humanoid coming from the FutureBots Humanoid Lab there is also the ATOM 1.0 a full size humanoid being developed for the hard work to support the needs of mankind in Space exploration, Healthcare, Commercial and Industrial Manufacturing, Hazardous rescue activities and Chemical and Biological disposal applications. 
My ATOM 1.0 full-size humanoid is also entered in the DRC - DARPA challenge for mid 2015, we are 1 of only 17 teams entered.  ATOM 1.0 Humanoid featured on the DARPA DRC site entered in the event 08/25/2014.
ATOM 1.0 is a 8 year part-time project that is about ready to walk, he is 5'3"" tall @ 185 lbs, just imagine KATE humanoids working inside houses while ATOM humanoids do the dangerous hard work outside keeping us safe.
                 ATOM 1.0 Humanoid from the FutureBots Humanoid Lab.


  Risks & Challenges
Even with funding it's a hard road, but just look at what I have built with NO funding KATE 1.0 and ATOM 1.0 and many other robots, just imagine what I could think up and make to create jobs and prosperity again in the USA and in that process helping the young to the old in need, I'm a go getter, I always find a way around any problem, my dad Calvin worked at Pratt & Whitney as a engineer  and taught me how to solve engineering problems. 
There will be 10's of millions of elderly in the next decade and now that will need help at home and to have just some company to play checkers, remind to take there medicine or go to a doctors appointment or even help them in there exercises, one reason I built KATE and ATOM was for the kids and elderly in need, they need are help. 
I was a caretaker a few years back so I know what the elderly need to comfort them, please help me make this dream come true so we can help them.  
A few years back in the mid 1970's when I was a teen there was a person named Bill Gates III and Steve Jobs or Dell or HP started with a small dream in a garage and now look at what it has created all around us technological prosperity, my FutureBots Humanoid Lab may be small at this time but we have BIG ideas, please help, let do it together, thanks!.

  Other Ways You Can Help and Perks

Please spread the word on social media about the KATE 1.0 humanoid project, all help is needed and appreciated, lets work together to make this dream happen. Thanks !
Just a idea example of the KATE 1.0 T-Shirt, Plaque, Sticker and Car plate will look like, the final version will be great.

</div></div>","Short Summary
 How much do you hate having wet, cold feet on a rainy day? Well imagine your toes being cold all day and you are unable to have a hot shower or huddle around a fireplace!
We know people have Syria-war fatigue and sometimes we feel the same. But remember that behind the war lies many innocent victims caught up in it. 
This is a personal initiative to help Syrian refugees face the harsh winter months ahead. After having personally witnessed the terrible conditions many Syrian in the Lebanon's Bekaa Valley endure, which will only get worst as winter gets colder, a bunch of us (ordinary citizens) felt compelled to help. 
The one thing refugees don't get from aid agencies are clothes including winter boots and this is an area we can help in having done it before.
   
What We Need & What You Get
 
We plan to fundraise enough money to buy warm jackets and boots for every child in a chosen settlement in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. 
We have very little time to fundraise as we hope to distribute by mid December before snow arrives to this area in Lebanon, last year, storm Alexa buried the area in few centimetres of snow. This year winter started early and it's expected to be colder. 
$7-$10 dollars is the cost of a warm jacket. 
$10-$15 is the cost of warm waterproof boots. 
For $4000 we will dress all 222 children under the age of 10 living in this particularly bad settlement, boots and jackets. 
If we raise more we will work to help all 547 people in this settlement! 
We have set a lower target on this page so we can reach it and pay less in fees to this website, but the higher we raise the more people we can help. 

PERKS: The only perk we can offer is that we will pay the admin cost of fundraising on this website, WHICH IS LESS IF WE REACH OUR TARGET! and we will pay all transport costs and other things you don't want your money wasted on. 
WHEN WE SAY YOUR MONEY WILL GO INTO CLOTHES AND BOOTS ONLY, WE MEAN IT!

The Impact
 Some of us spent an hour in one of those damp tents in the video and our bones were aching all day from the cold. To say that refugees will suffer this winter is an understatement. Two Syrian toddlers have already died from cold conditions in Lebanon in the past month.
Distributions are chaotic and a hassle to do and having done one in 2012, we didn't think we will re-open this chapter again. But seeing this year's conditions was a wake up call. This is not about us or our comfort this is about the refugees. 
You have all seen the bad headlines and this is an opportunity for you and us to do something and not just turn off the TV and ignore. 

Risks & Challenges
 We have successfully done a similar distribution before, in December 2012. https://www.facebook.com/helpsyrianrefugeesthiswinter 
We buy the clothes from a local factory. They are of good quality and come at the cheapest price possible. 
We can provide receipts for money spent and a breakdown of where the money has gone as well as photos and videos of the distribution. 
Our challenge here is getting the funds to order the clothes and distribute them as soon as possible. Winter has already arrived here!

Other Ways You Can Help
 We totally understand if you can't contribute at this stage yourself but please spread the word and share the campaign page with your family and friends. 
When we did this last time, the most humbling thing was the number of people who contributed on trust without knowing us personally. This was all thanks to others bringing the campaign to their attention. Please help us spread the word.

<p>The school is private, like 90 percent of all schools in Haiti,

exceptionally high rating in state-administered exams, and is considered one of

Many people keep asking me how they can support this project or make a donation if they didn't get chance to first time around so I'm re-launching the fundraising project for 1 week. This is perfect timing as most of the money we originally raised has already been spent on food, medical supplies as well as sending some orphans to school. Any donations would be gratefully received. The fundraising will close in 1 week though as I need to know how much I have to spend in my final week here so get your donations in quick!</p><p><br/><b>A little more info...<br/></b>DRC, or the Democratic Republic of Congo, as it is officially known, lies in the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of the poorest countries in the world and has the highest rates of malnutrition and child mortality. Years of conflict between the Congolese Army and different rebel groups have ravaged the country, particularly in the east where DRC borders Uganda and Rwanda. This conflict has claimed more than five million lives making it the planet's deadliest war since World War II. In addition to the conflict, crippling poverty, corrupt governments, widespread HIV/AIDS and the world's highest rates of rape has resulted in over 4 million orphans. While the local communities do what they can to provide for these orphans and other vulnerable children, they still remain in desperate need of the most basic provisions such as food, clean water and medical services as well as education.</p><p><br/><b>My trip so far...<br/></b>I've been in eastern DRC for 3 weeks now and have spent that time working in Bunia, Beni, Butembo and Rwese. I have visited a number of different orphanages as well as schools, clinics and both church and women's groups that help orphans here. Most of the project money that we raised has been spent on food as that always seems to be the thing they need most when we arrive at a place although I have also bought medical supplies for clinics that will now treat the orphans for free and donated $1,160 to the Rwese orphanage so they could send 29 of their children to school. </p><p><br/>The most fun though has been giving out the clothes and toys that many people in the UK kindly donated before I left. These orphans have nothing and their clothes (if they are wearing any) are literally rags full of holes. Putting clean t-shirts and other clothes on them makes such a difference.<span><br/></span><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/536685/files/20140426225819-102.jpg?1398578299"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where does the project go from here?</b><br/>I've got 3 days left in Beni before I fly south to visit Goma and Bukavu. What I'd really like to do before I go is buy mattresses for all the orphanages where children are having to sleep on wooden bed frames or worse, on the bare floor.

Make a donation...<span><br/></span></b>Before I left the UK people generously donated clothes, shoes and toys for the orphans and a number of different companies donated school exercise books, pencils, crayons and mosquito nets. A number of people also generously supported the project by making a financial donation.</p><p>These orphans need food, milk powder for babies, medications (such as de-worming tablets) and mattresses to sleep on. If anyone would like to make a donation so that I can buy more of these items for the orphans then I'd be incredibly grateful.<span><br/></span><b><span><br/></span>2. Sponsor a child to get an education...<span><br/></span></b>Half of all children in DRC do not attend school because they can't afford the £25 per year school fees and for orphans this number goes up to 100% in some areas. Thanks to generous donations of my friends in the UK, 29 orphans in Rwese orphanage are now able to go to school but there are many more who can't. If you would like to make a donation of £25 to send a child to school that would be amazing. </p><p>Alternatively, once I return to the UK I will be setting up a system whereby you can have a monthly direct debit to spread the cost of sending an orphan to school over the whole year.

<p></p></div>","My mission...As most of you know, I'm currently on a mission to deliver food, medical and school supplies, clothes, toys and bed nets to orphans in eastern DRC as well as raise money to send them to school. Many people keep asking me how they can support this project or make a donation if they didn't get chance to first time around so I'm re-launching the fundraising project for 1 week. This is perfect timing as most of the money we originally raised has already been spent on food, medical supplies as well as sending some orphans to school. Any donations would be gratefully received. The fundraising will close in 1 week though as I need to know how much I have to spend in my final week here so get your donations in quick!A little more info...DRC, or the Democratic Republic of Congo, as it is officially known, lies in the heart of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is one of the poorest countries in the world and has the highest rates of malnutrition and child mortality. Years of conflict between the Congolese Army and different rebel groups have ravaged the country, particularly in the east where DRC borders Uganda and Rwanda. This conflict has claimed more than five million lives making it the planet's deadliest war since World War II. In addition to the conflict, crippling poverty, corrupt governments, widespread HIV/AIDS and the world's highest rates of rape has resulted in over 4 million orphans. While the local communities do what they can to provide for these orphans and other vulnerable children, they still remain in desperate need of the most basic provisions such as food, clean water and medical services as well as education.My trip so far...I've been in eastern DRC for 3 weeks now and have spent that time working in Bunia, Beni, Butembo and Rwese. I have visited a number of different orphanages as well as schools, clinics and both church and women's groups that help orphans here. Most of the project money that we raised has been spent on food as that always seems to be the thing they need most when we arrive at a place although I have also bought medical supplies for clinics that will now treat the orphans for free and donated $1,160 to the Rwese orphanage so they could send 29 of their children to school. The most fun though has been giving out the clothes and toys that many people in the UK kindly donated before I left. These orphans have nothing and their clothes (if they are wearing any) are literally rags full of holes. Putting clean t-shirts and other clothes on them makes such a difference.Where does the project go from here?I've got 3 days left in Beni before I fly south to visit Goma and Bukavu. What I'd really like to do before I go is buy mattresses for all the orphanages where children are having to sleep on wooden bed frames or worse, on the bare floor. This photo of a bedroom I took at one orphanage is where 28 children sleep, sometimes 6 little ones in 1 single bed with no mattress.I'd also like to be able to cover the costs of getting little Roda the medical attention she needs to make her walk as I can't even begin to think what her life is going to be like if we don't find a way to help her.As always, I'd really like to be able to buy food for these children, especially milk for the babies and continue to send those that can't afford the fees to school.How can you help?1. Make a donation...Before I left the UK people generously donated clothes, shoes and toys for the orphans and a number of different companies donated school exercise books, pencils, crayons and mosquito nets. A number of people also generously supported the project by making a financial donation.These orphans need food, milk powder for babies, medications (such as de-worming tablets) and mattresses to sleep on. If anyone would like to make a donation so that I can buy more of these items for the orphans then I'd be incredibly grateful.2. Sponsor a child to get an education...Half of all children in DRC do not attend school because they can't afford the £25 per year school fees and for orphans this number goes up to 100% in some areas. Thanks to generous donations of my friends in the UK, 29 orphans in Rwese orphanage are now able to go to school but there are many more who can't. If you would like to make a donation of £25 to send a child to school that would be amazing. Alternatively, once I return to the UK I will be setting up a system whereby you can have a monthly direct debit to spread the cost of sending an orphan to school over the whole year. If you would prefer to do this please email me at: oranguhan@gmail.com.Follow my journey ...Please visit my facebook page: www.facebook.com/missioncongo and like Mission Congo to show your supportFollow my blog: www.mission-congo.blogspot.co.uk to keep updated with the project and find out how your support is helping change the lives of orphans in DRC.Thanks!",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><span>#BlackLivesMatter Freedom School is a 3 week long summer program proposed for the summer of 2016 for children aged 4-10.  The purpose of the project is to respond to a lack of humanizing, self-affirming, queer positive educational opportunities for Black children in the GTA.  Freedom school will provide an alternative setting for parents who do not feel that our children are being taught self-love, and a passion for justice and liberation through their formal education.  The program is designed to teach children about Black Canadian and diasporic history, to engage children in political resistance to anti-Black racism and state violence through a trans-feminist lens, and to offer children an entry point into the #BlackLivesMatter movement.  #BlackLivesMatter Freedom School is designed to support children and families living and growing in a reality of witnessing police violence in our communities.  It is designed to support parent and youth voice through the development of a parent and youth advisory boards, that will help to guide the project.  </span></p>

#BlackLivesMatter-TO is creating educational resources for #BlackLivesMatter Freedom School, a 3 week long summer program for children aged 4-10 running this July.  Freedom School is a response to a lack of humanizing, self-affirming, queer positive educational opportunities for Black children in the GTA.  The money raised by this campaign will pay Black artists to create much needed educational resources for young children that teach Black Canadian and diasporic history.   
What kind of Educational Resources?
 
The lack of educational materials for children aged 4-10 that teach about Black Canadian and diasporic history is glaring, so we need to make it!  The Freedom School Committee will be working with Black Artists and allies to develop everything from Virtual Reality to Claymations to colouring books and beyond, covering topics like the Haitian Revolution to Sins Invalid to the #BlackLivesMatter Movement.  We intend to pay Black artists for their labour, while creating engaging and relevant new resources for students at Freedom School.
$25 will pay for the production of 1 Freedom School Workbook
$50 will pay for the materials to make a Black liberation leaders memory game
$150 will pay for the Black liberation advent calendar production
$300 will pay for an art piece about a historical event for a Black liberation timeline
$1000 will pay for translating our video resources to ASL
$2000 will pay material costs for a short video about the Bussa Revolution

More about #BlackLivesMatter Freedom School

#BlackLivesMatter Freedom School is a 3 week long summer program proposed for the summer of 2016 for children aged 4-10.  The purpose of the project is to respond to a lack of humanizing, self-affirming, queer positive educational opportunities for Black children in the GTA.  Freedom school will provide an alternative setting for parents who do not feel that our children are being taught self-love, and a passion for justice and liberation through their formal education.  The program is designed to teach children about Black Canadian and diasporic history, to engage children in political resistance to anti-Black racism and state violence through a trans-feminist lens, and to offer children an entry point into the #BlackLivesMatter movement.  #BlackLivesMatter Freedom School is designed to support children and families living and growing in a reality of witnessing police violence in our communities.  It is designed to support parent and youth voice through the development of a parent and youth advisory boards, that will help to guide the project.  


Through offering access to free childcare for young children, hot meals and bussing, #BlackLivesMatter freedom school will be geared towards families from working class neighbourhoods/contexts.  This is an acknowledgement that anti-Black racism and police violence and intrinsically connected to classism and poverty.

<h3><strong>Transforming How Children Learn</strong></h3>
<p>MiaoKids merges tactile exploration with innovative technology, thereby engaging children through a multi-sensory environment and adaptive curriculum. </p>
<p>MiaoKids includes 4 types of tactile blocks(math/logic/shape/letters) that add an important <strong>kinesthetic/tactile element to graphics and sounds</strong> as part of our award-winning early literacy system. </p>
<p><em>""The hands-on nature of the fun and learning brings a huge level of engagement that serves to anchor and reinforce the math and logic skills young learners so readily absorb from the app's enormously entertaining educational activities. ""</em> <strong>--  Tillywig Toy Award</strong></p>

<h3>Creative problem-solving</h3>
<p>MiaoKids helps children realize that there are <strong>multiple ways to solve problems</strong> and gives them the opportunity to select the method that works best for them.  This enables them to<strong> understand how something works</strong> and can then <strong>apply it to a variety of other problems</strong> <strong>later</strong>.</p>

<h3>Designed for ages 2-8</h3>
<p>There are math concepts (counting, addition, multiplication, etc.) suitable for everyone. As kids become more confident in one mode, they can move on to the next, allowing them to learn at their own pace.</p>
<p>MiaoKids Logic and Wonder Math become increasingly complex and interesting with each grade-level. The chart below describes some of the skills that await your child’s development. </p>

<p>We have expanded our math curriculum through the inclusion of another app that hosts a variety of logic games designed to expand and exercise kids' logical reasoning and critical thinking. Logic problems present children the opportunity to think through and analyze different solutions, enabling them to realize that there exists many methods to solve a situation. Each problem encourages children to tap into their past knowledge and incorporate them in novel and original ways.</p>

<h3>Build Logical Connections Between Things</h3>
<p>Younger children base their understanding of the world on what they see and hear, relying less so on logic. MiaoKids helps them to make connections between the shapes and objects, names of numbers and quantities they represent, etc. We encourage children to compare hands-on experiences utilizing charts and graphs to deeply analyze different scenarios.</p>

<h3>Understand Application of Everyday Experiences</h3>
<p>Kindergartners are developing the ability to hold information in their minds and drawing upon it to make comparisons. This is a sign of kids straddling the fence between concrete and abstract representations. With MiaoKids logic games, kids can begin to understand how to apply theory to everyday experiences.</p>

<p>Students engage the world around them in a host of ways. The MiaoKids ecosystem is constructed around the notion that <strong>play-based learning serves as an immensely valuable – and often underutilized – component of a child’s education</strong>. Recent research suggests that well-structured play-based learning experiences can <strong>yield a positive effect in language development and related arenas</strong>.[2]</p>
<p> </p>
<div data-id=""26103715""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/103/715/fb96684e6440f44a85cc21e2b3ddfd12_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1565516649&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=72dfd36c0d5a6d175e7a0d9de9e560ac"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>What does this mean for us at MiaoKids? Our goal is to keep learning at the forefront and strive to supplement the learning experiences our community is already getting in the traditional classroom. We jam-pack our games with relevant content that will maintain our users’ attention and forge transferable skills. We also build our offerings in a way that invites social collaboration with peers. And finally, to be conscious of screen time health, we construct our physical materials in a way that allows for “away-from-the-app” use in more conventional play environments.</p>
<p> </p>
<div data-id=""26034346""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/026/034/346/8dfdd2ba71621d569d710427da0edee1_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564989784&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b7271f580220cd95239be3755348452e"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<h3>Piaget’s Zone of Proximal Development</h3>
<p>Jean Piaget emphasizes the ​<strong>zone of proximal development</strong>​ (area labeled “learner can do with guidance”). <strong>It serves as a framework to understand the ideal difficulty of tasks that a learner should be engaged in</strong>. Some tasks are too easy, thus leaving the learners unchallenged. Other tasks might be too hard, making it impossible for the learner to grapple and disentangle the challenge. The zone of proximal development suggests that learners should ideally be presented with learning content somewhere in between, difficult enough to challenge the child but not overly difficult so that it ultimately becomes discouraging.</p>

A Standard MiaoKids Wonder Kit (No Add-on)

 
Transforming How Children Learn
MiaoKids merges tactile exploration with innovative technology, thereby engaging children through a multi-sensory environment and adaptive curriculum. 
MiaoKids includes 4 types of tactile blocks(math/logic/shape/letters) that add an important kinesthetic/tactile element to graphics and sounds as part of our award-winning early literacy system. 
""The hands-on nature of the fun and learning brings a huge level of engagement that serves to anchor and reinforce the math and logic skills young learners so readily absorb from the app's enormously entertaining educational activities. "" --  Tillywig Toy Award
 
 
 
The MiaoKids learning system is composed of three major elements—the app, the Pad, and the blocks. It's very easy to use. Just connect the Pad to your device and then play with our physical game pieces.
 

 
 
(1) MiaoKids App The MiaoKids’ apps are designed to nurture the learning interest of young children. It was designed by early education experts who studied at Harvard University. We currently have 3 individual apps (MiaoKids Logic, MiaoKids Wonder Math, and MiaoKids English) with more than 500 non-repetitive games included.
 
 

 
(2) MiaoKids Blocks/Cubes The blocks serve as the primary input mechanism for your child to interact with the on-screen games. There are 4 types of blocks: math, logic, shapes, and letters. They introduce a kinesthetic/tactile element to our learning ecosystem.
 


 
 
(3) MiaoKids Wonder Pad - The Wonder Pad ties everything together and serves as a communicative bridge between the App and Blocks/Cubes. 
 


 
How the MiaoKids System Works...

 


 
 
We dedicate ourselves to providing meaningful, fun learning experiences through incorporating tangible pieces that your child could feel and touch. MiaoKids comes with over 500 curriculum-mapped lesson plans, useful as a supplement to education programs all over the world. It is the easiest way to introduce basic math and logic concepts in early stages of learning.
 
 

Beginning learners love to play and explore with our multisensory learning games! The games are FREE to download —with more coming soon.
 
 
Hands-on Play With Numbers
With MiaoKids, kids will be arranging physical blocks, including mathematical signs and digits. Our apps instruct them on learning various concepts by assembling the correct assortment of blocks. Kids can play and engage with math without the pressure of time or the fear of getting the wrong answer. MiaoKids' real-time feedback allows kids to learn through experimentation in a stress-free environment, thereby helping them to build confidence.
 
 

Our suite of applications are designed for children ages 2-8.
 

Math Adventure Mode — helps kids track everyday progress of learning.
 
 
Creative problem-solving
MiaoKids helps children realize that there are multiple ways to solve problems and gives them the opportunity to select the method that works best for them.  This enables them to understand how something works and can then apply it to a variety of other problems later.
 
 
 

 
Designed for ages 2-8
There are math concepts (counting, addition, multiplication, etc.) suitable for everyone. As kids become more confident in one mode, they can move on to the next, allowing them to learn at their own pace.
MiaoKids Logic and Wonder Math become increasingly complex and interesting with each grade-level. The chart below describes some of the skills that await your child’s development. 
 

 
 
More games to come
Our portfolio of applications is constantly expanding, and we look forward to bringing even more subjects and learning content to you soon! For more footages of Math gameplay, visit our YouTube channel or download our free MiaoKids Math application. 
 

 
 
We have expanded our math curriculum through the inclusion of another app that hosts a variety of logic games designed to expand and exercise kids' logical reasoning and critical thinking. Logic problems present children the opportunity to think through and analyze different solutions, enabling them to realize that there exists many methods to solve a situation. Each problem encourages children to tap into their past knowledge and incorporate them in novel and original ways.
 

 
 
Build Logical Connections Between Things
Younger children base their understanding of the world on what they see and hear, relying less so on logic. MiaoKids helps them to make connections between the shapes and objects, names of numbers and quantities they represent, etc. We encourage children to compare hands-on experiences utilizing charts and graphs to deeply analyze different scenarios.

 
Identify shapes and objects
 
 
Understand Application of Everyday Experiences
Kindergartners are developing the ability to hold information in their minds and drawing upon it to make comparisons. This is a sign of kids straddling the fence between concrete and abstract representations. With MiaoKids logic games, kids can begin to understand how to apply theory to everyday experiences.
 
 
 
Judging by appearances / make predictions
For more footages of Logic gameplay, visit our YouTube channel or download our free MiaoKids Logic application.
  

 
 
Our MiaoKids English letter blocks and application function as a personalized English tutor. The app provides a robust curriculum that gradually scales in difficulty and helps to develop your child's vocabulary and language intuition. Children advance through the curriculum with continuous assessments that track their game progress and performance.
 

 
Why the English module
Give your child a head start in honing their linguistic aptitude while harnessing the additional cognitive capacities that your child is already developing.

85% of the neurological connections for language learning develop before age seven.[1]
Early exposure to language impacts learning.
MiaoKids supports reading readiness in children ages 2-8.

 
 
 
For more footages of English gameplay, download our MiaoKids English application, which is available for free.
 
Here are skills that MiaoKids enhances...

Letter identification
Phonemic sounds
Word construction
Word families
Word onsets
Vocabulary
Lower case letters
Print concepts
Spelling
Tracing and writing


 
*Please note that the English Learning Kit is an add-on that DOES NOT include the Wonder Pad. It is designed to complement the MiaoKids Standard Kit, which includes the Pad.  
 

 
Both the Smart Kit and Wonder Math have been well-received professionally with 11 industry awards, including Academics’ Choice, Tillywig, and Red Dot.
 

 
Given the success we’ve experienced in the past few years, we want to spread the MiaoKids joy to the entire world. This Kickstarter is the first step towards that aspiration.
 


 
We can say with confidence that an ever important skill is mathematics. A better aptitude for math will help children develop the computational capacity necessary to understand the future that has grown increasingly reliant on computer science and information systems. With MiaoKids, your child will be given concrete representations of mathematical and logical concepts.
 

 
Our endearing characters and colorful world will ensure that your child is properly stimulated through auditory and visual means. The Wonder Blocks/Cubes provide stimulation to another important sense, touch, and ultimately round out our play-based learning system.

 A Play-Based Game Mechanism
Students engage the world around them in a host of ways. The MiaoKids ecosystem is constructed around the notion that play-based learning serves as an immensely valuable – and often underutilized – component of a child’s education. Recent research suggests that well-structured play-based learning experiences can yield a positive effect in language development and related arenas.[2]
 

 
What does this mean for us at MiaoKids? Our goal is to keep learning at the forefront and strive to supplement the learning experiences our community is already getting in the traditional classroom. We jam-pack our games with relevant content that will maintain our users’ attention and forge transferable skills. We also build our offerings in a way that invites social collaboration with peers. And finally, to be conscious of screen time health, we construct our physical materials in a way that allows for “away-from-the-app” use in more conventional play environments.
 

 
These are a few of our goals to get play-based learning right and make it better for all, and we welcome feedback from our users as we continue to refine what we have to offer.

<h3>                                        SVQF's Work in Kenya:</h3>
<p>The first of SVQF’s community development projects was located in Salabwek, a rural Kipsigi tribal community living in extreme poverty. In Salabwek, <span>children were not given names until they reached the age of five </span><span>because so many died before then and there was a 90% rate of adult illiteracy.</span></p>

</div></div>","SVQF's Work in Kenya:
The first of SVQF’s community development projects was located in Salabwek, a rural Kipsigi tribal community living in extreme poverty. In Salabwek, children were not given names until they reached the age of five because so many died before then and there was a 90% rate of adult illiteracy.
SVQF provided for the construction and furnishing of 8 one-classroom schools and teachers’ quarters, as well as numerous other community resources, such as safe water sources, latrines and a mobile health clinic. Drawn by the improved facilities and social services, people from neighboring communities migrated to Salabwek over the course of the 3-year project, expanding its population from the original 1200 to 5000 inhabitants.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We want to thank everyone who helped us raise the money for Benjamin’s passport and airline ticket. You have made it possible for him to come home to his family, and have a chance at a good life. Although this is good news it has mixed feelings for Benjamin, Aaron and Yoel. They are brothers and have been looking out for each other since being placed in an orphanage. We never intended to separate them but if we didn’t get Benjamin here first, the judge would have rescinded the court order.</p>
<p>Now we have a new hurdle to overcome, we have to raise enough money to get the necessary paperwork started for Aaron and Joel, or they could be separated as well if one of them is adopted. Please help us keep them together so our family can be complete. All we ask is that you give what you can until we reach our goal. We need at least $5000.00 to get the ball rolling, adoptions are expensive and unless you are wealthy most people cannot afford it. During our last fund raiser on Indiegogo.com (<a href=""http://igg.me/p/125421?a=724924"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/p/125421?a=724924</a>) we compared the adoption fund raisers of Children opposed to animals. Sadly people give more to animals than Children who need a home, don’t get me wrong helping animals is honorable but helping children grow in a good family is even more rewarding.  Before you turn this away at least consider what a difference you will make in the life of a child who wants to come home and be with their brother.</p>

We need at least $5000.00 to get the ball rolling, adoptions are expensive and unless you are wealthy most people cannot afford it. During our last fund raiser on Indiegogo.com (http://igg.me/p/125421?a=724924) we compared the adoption fund raisers of Children opposed to animals. Sadly people give more to animals than Children who need a home, don’t get me wrong helping animals is honorable but helping children grow in a good family is even more rewarding.  Before you turn this away at least consider what a difference you will make in the life of a child who wants to come home and be with their brother.
God bless you
Angel & Angie Perez

<h3>Share Our Vision</h3>
<p>We are opening a mindfulness based community center, in Lucedale Mississippi. We have been working very hard at remodeling the building, but we need your help.</p>
<p>We wish to offer opportunities for individuals and families to understand and utilize their unlimited potential through self expression, awareness and anything that keeps us moving, thinking and creating. We believe that life should be experianced and enjoyed moment to moment, and our goal is to provide a space where people can go to fill those moments with mindful, healthy, creative experiances. Please check out our facebook page and meet some of our instructors. We will be creating an art wall in our art room next week, where anyone who wants their art to be a part of the center can come and claim a piece of wall. We will also be creating a Gratitude Tree the following week, where our ""thank yous"" will hang like ornaments, to remind us of all we have to be thankful for. Both events will be posted on our facebook page. Please join us as we create our space!! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Center-of-Infinite-Possibilities/331634450269337"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Center-of-Infinite-Possibilities/331634450269337</a></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
As stated in the description of the campaign. Since I can remember it has been my dream to create an industry changing video game!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was born in Uruguay and moved to the states when I was about 2 years old, we stayed there until a life threatening disease of one of my parents forced us to move back to Uruguay. Apprently the Drs suggested my mom to go to Uruguay for this surgery, since they were specialized.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've been back in Uruguay since 1994 and after quite a few attempts to receive formal programming education I have had to drop out due to family/life issues. Even though I was able to teach myself html and how to create websites, played around with Pascal and PHP, I was never confident enough to look for a job in that field.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I can say without a doubt in my mind that I have reached a point of my life where I just need to say, ""that's enough"".</div>
<div>
<br/>So I will get my formal programming education in the USA, planing on starting at Lansing Community College next August.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I need?</h3>
<p>Unfortunatelly, in order for me to get a student's visa I need to have at least 20,000 USD for each year I will be studying in the USA.</p>
<p>For starters this adds up to 40,000 for a 2 year degree and will go up to close to 100,000 for a bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>I was trying to work towards that goal by myself, but in Uruguay's economy it's not something I can do in the near future. This is why I need your help! :)</p>
</div>
<div>I understand that a lot of people are pretty tight on money, just like myself, so if you cannot contribute please spread the word around, maybe someone you know can! :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am also welcome to ideas on other ways to fund my goal.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>I will be updating this campaign as I have updates on working towards my goal. Every little bit helps!</strong></div></div>","Summary

Particularly, the roof is in a bad shape and allows water to infiltrate the building with every rain or snowfall. This situation made us suspend our activities altogether last winter. Because we still have to pay the rent and the utilities, regardless of not using the venue, such periods of inactivity are very damaging to our project <span> and to our audiences and community</span>. Repairing the roof has become our main priority and we estimate that we need <b>8000$</b> in order to do it.</p><p>This total cost consists of:</p><p><span>?<span>  </span></span><b>doing a professional assessment of the roof’s state</b></p><p><span>?<span>  </span></span><b>purchasing the necessary materials</b></p><p><span>?<span>  </span></span><b>waterproofing and thermal insulating</b></p><p><span>?<span>  </span></span><b>hiring a contractor</b></p><p>If we manage to raise more money than 8000$, we would use it to improve the building’s ventilation system and invest in lighting and sound equipment that was by the rain, thus improving the space and the experience of our audiences.</p><p>Your help and your financial support are essential for us, for continuing a project that managed to draw the interest of the people in the district, of kids and teenagers, of <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">teachers and artists. No amount is too small!</span></p><h2><b>What You Get</b></h2><p><span>We have a lot of special rewards to offer for your support. </span> As all of our donors will receive our eternal gratitude and will become friends of the venue, some of you could receive a real interaction with a character from a Replika<span> show, get to create a line that will be used in the next production or even be our guest to a rehearsal.</span></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459678784/prize_hfzs63.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p>You can help us spread the information about our campaign <span> to all your friends.</span> Use the Indiegogo share tools and be a part of our community of roof builders!</p><p>Donate for the space, donate for the roof.

A year after its inception, The Replika Center for Educational Theater organized 2 Educational Art Platforms, featuring 17 shows, with more than 80 artists involved, 21 presentations of books and studies  and 21 film screenings.
At The Replika Center for Educational Theater, in only one year, we produced 7 premieres, we organized 4 workshops with children and teenagers and more than 8000 spectators took part in our events.    Our impact and outreach goes beyond Bucharest with many  theater performances  presented on tour in Romania. We showed The Offline Family by Mihaela Michailov, performance which reflects the reality of children living on their own having their parents working abroad, in major cities from Transylvania (Bra?ov, Târgu Mure?, Sfântu Gheorghe, Media?, Sibiu, Alba Iulia) along with workshops on educational theater.Confessions of a Dog, based on Peter Mayle's novel and a Civic Educational Workshop on animal welfare, went on tour in cities with history of bad treatment towards the animals:  Bac?u, Boto?ani, F?lticeni, Pa?cani, Piatra Neam?, Roman, Suceava, Târgu Neam?, Târgu Frumos and Foc?ani.Our recent premiere In your own words by Peca ?tefan, was on tour in Br?ila, Sibiu and Cluj. Each premiere from last season was invited at Temps d'Images International Theater Festival Cluj Napoca.Our work has already been recognized by AFCN (The National Culture Fund) who offered us in January 2016 the Award for Social inclusion and Intercultural Dialogue. In March 2016 we were nominated at The Award for Cultural Programs and Festivals offered by The National Cultural Radio station. Our CommunityBut perhaps our greatest achievement was the large community we have brought together in our projects. Since its opening, thanks to its generous and versatile space characteristics (length&height, plenty possibilities to arrange the audience),  Replika Center gathered  many artists from the performative arts field. Thanks to our Educational Art Platforms, Replika Center became  a space where new films meet their audiences. Thanks to its location in a neighborhood from Bucharest, Replika Center hosted public meetings of the social activists. 
 

Our community consists now of teenagers, teachers and parents, of people from the neighbourhood,  of students and adults who became more than our public, but our partners.  We are grateful and happy for their interest  - they came once and then they kept coming to our programs - performances and workshops.
We collaborated with many artists and we thank them for being part of the Replika Center community:Arh Gabi Albu, Cristian Bala?, Alexa B?canu, Robert B?lan, C?t?lina B?l?l?u, Alexandru Berceanu, Alexandru Bibere, Miki Brani?te, M?d?lina Brându?e, Bogdan Burl?cianu, Andreea Chindri?, Ionu?

Choreographer Cosmin Manolescu will develop a series of workshops for children, followed by a dance performance.Pop-Up Theatrics (New York) will develop the first stage of a theatrical project called Altered Perception, an artistic exploration of the challenges and benefits of sense impairment.And from Cluj, director Leta Popescu and playwright Alexa B?canu, two young voices of Romanian Theater, in partnership with CEDP Step by Step will develop the first phase of a theatrical project that will explore the perspectives and implications of Sexual Education for children in Romania.Each residency will end up in 2017 with a theater performance.During 2016 we will be part of the IndependNet Platform, an exchange cultural program imagined by our partners from Cluj - Reactor de Crea?ie ?i Experiment. This means that Replika team will tour in Târgu Mure? and Cluj Napoca, and will host theater performances created by its partners from Colectiv A and ZugZone, both from Cluj.By the end of this season we plan to host four premiers: director Ioana P?un will stage a performance based on the outrageous untold histories of Romanian torturers during the Cold War; director Catinca Dr?g?nescu will develop a theater performance about the condition of women forced to work abroad, leaving their children alone back home; dramAcum will develop a theater performance based on contemporary Turkish plays; director Mihai Ion Alexandru will stage a theater performance based on the novel Kremlin Made Of Sugar by Vladimir Sorokin.  In September and October 2016 we will go on tour with Our Daily Hunger, a play developed by Peca ?tefan, directed by Ana M?rgineanu and Radu Apostol, performing in 7 different locations in Romania.Starting from September till November we will continue our Educational Art Platform, presenting theater performances, books and movies.   What We NeedDue to its previous use as a warehouse, the building needs certain improvements in order to adequately host theater work and live audiences. Particularly, the roof is in a bad shape and allows water to infiltrate the building with every rain or snowfall. This situation made us suspend our activities altogether last winter. Because we still have to pay the rent and the utilities, regardless of not using the venue, such periods of inactivity are very damaging to our project  and to our audiences and community. Repairing the roof has become our main priority and we estimate that we need 8000$ in order to do it.This total cost consists of:?  doing a professional assessment of the roof’s state?  purchasing the necessary materials?  waterproofing and thermal insulating?  hiring a contractorIf we manage to raise more money than 8000$, we would use it to improve the building’s ventilation system and invest in lighting and sound equipment that was by the rain, thus improving the space and the experience of our audiences.Your help and your financial support are essential for us, for continuing a project that managed to draw the interest of the people in the district, of kids and teenagers, of teachers and artists. No amount is too small!What You GetWe have a lot of special rewards to offer for your support.  As all of our donors will receive our eternal gratitude and will become friends of the venue, some of you could receive a real interaction with a character from a Replika show, get to create a line that will be used in the next production or even be our guest to a rehearsal. Other Ways You Can HelpYou can help us spread the information about our campaign  to all your friends. Use the Indiegogo share tools and be a part of our community of roof builders!Donate for the space, donate for the roof. The space belongs to those who build it up.Big thanks to Ada Milea, Ion Mure?an, Bobo Burl?cianu, Cristi Rigman who have generously offered us the song ""Acoperi?ul"" and to Kolectiv, Bogdan Sl?vescu (camera) and Roger Vl?doianu (editor) for the video.We would also like to thank to Goethe-Guerilla, a program initiated by Goethe-Institut Bucharest, for the collaboration.  Let’s raise the roof at REPLIKA!Pentru versiunea în limba român? accesa?i link-ul:https://tmblr.co/ZgNrhv24TFzJk",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

What We Need & What You Get


Depending on how many people commit further, the amount Laura needs to cover costs will vary. The event is too far a long to cancel, so even if you can only spare $5 it will help pay the outstanding $2800 currently owing.

If we don't reach our goal, Laura will definitely be out of pocket, but any funds raised will be pushed through to Laura.
If enough people contribute we can throw what will surely be a memorable party and any excess funds will be donated to a charity of Laura's choice.
For those that said they could make it and have bailed, this is the chance to make up for it, even if you can only spare a few dollars, please donate so we can make this a memorable night for the right reasons.

<p><b>My Story
 </b></p>
<p>My younger brother and I grew up in a family
deeply troubled by alcohol and violence.  Our parents, young themselves,
married because they were pregnant with me.  </p>
<p>Imagine me as the young girl in <i>Once were Warriors</i>. The difference is
that I lived. </p>
<p>I witnessed horrific beatings in my own
family. I told others about the fighting, but was always sent back home.
All I wanted to do was stop the drinking and end the physical abuse I was a
victim of. But I never could.  </p>
<p>Once my mother pushed me out of the car she
was driving. She didn’t want to hear my ‘over-simplified solution’ to the
problem of what to do about my Dad, who had passed out on someone’s doorstep.
 </p>
<p>I became hyper-vigilant, always on the alert
for the signs that arguments were escalating into full-blown fights. And my
life was threatened many times. </p>

child of about 10 </u></p>
<p><b>Sexual
Abuse and Rape</b></p>
<p>When I was 13, I was sexually abused. I
pretended to be asleep, then cried when he left my room. The second time
it happened, I stood up to my abuser and eventually told someone. But my
mum hated me more, and my brother and friends thought I was making it up. My
parents separated because I’d ‘told’. </p>
<p>My mother moved us away from the farm, and we
lived in poverty in town. Some days we had nothing at all to eat
and I never had the right clothes in winter. </p>
<p>When I was 14, I was raped. A cute guy with a
car had started taking notice of me. I pretended I was 16 and he pretended
he was 18. Actually he was much older. He picked me up to go to the
movies, drove me out into the forest, threatened me with a knife, covered my
face, and did what he did. He said if I told anyone I would find him
hanging on my doorstep. So I didn’t tell. </p>
<p>Later that year I met my high-school
sweetheart. He and his family were nice to me and welcomed me into their
home. They had food I’d never seen, and they didn’t argue.</p>
<p><b>15 and
Pregnant</b></p>
<p>At 15, I was pregnant. Without my parents’
consent, I asked doctors  to sign off to
terminate my pregnancy. They were easily persuaded. </p>
<p>At 17 I fell pregnant again. Too afraid to
terminate a second time, I hid my pregnancy for as long as I could. My daughter
was born 2 months before I turned 18. I didn’t go to prenatal classes and had
no idea what to expect. It was a very difficult birth.</p>
<p>Somehow I made my way through a Diploma in
Tourism and Travel, and moved to Australia with my high-school
sweetheart. We got married, had another baby, and bought a house. </p>
<p>I followed my husband, and his dreams because
it was easy and I felt safe. But in my heart, I knew I wasn’t being true to
myself. </p>

was the hardest decision to make, given the support he and his family had given
me over the years. If it wasn’t for them, my life would have taken a
different path for sure.  </p>
<p><b>My
Brother</b></p>
<p>From the age of 16, my brother spent his time
on the streets sniffing petrol. One day when he found shelter in an empty
shipping container, he ended up getting locked in and shipped from the North
Island of New Zealand to Christchurch on the South Island.</p>
<p>Now 37, he’s spent almost 20 years in a mental
facility suffering from drug-induced schizophrenia. How he’s survived no
one really knows, but at least he has a home. At least he’s
safe. </p>
<p><b>And Now</b></p>
<p>I live on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland,
Australia. I’m remarried and have two step-children. I’ve spent many years
on personal development, and have started a degree in psychology. I love

Teachers at St. Jude's develop a curriculum for soccer and handball, this summer they want me to teach them how to teach students baseball.  I have a background in playing, so my curriculum is ready, but I need some equipment to help teach that sport! The School of St. Jude currently has no baseball equipment, and there is no local place in Arusha to purchase it, so I'll bring it all along with me when I head over in June.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575447/files/20140512195207-USA_Renaming_Smith_Family_015.jpg?1399949527"" src="""" style=""width: 566.0401146131805px; height: 377px;""/></p>L to R: Kim Saville (St. Jude Staff), Grams, Uncle Bruce, Me, Mom!<p><br/></p><p>For those of you who don't know, my family has been working in close partnership with the School of St. Jude since 2005.  My mom, Cindy Skarbek, is on the board of directors for the school and spends about a month each year in Tanzania, and her other time at home developing new programs and partnerships for the school in the USA and beyond. In January 2012, I went to Tanzania with ""3 Peaks 3 Weeks"", and was able to raise $50,000 for the school and 2 other organizations in East Africa by climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Meru, and Mt. Kenya within a 3 week time span. Last summer, I joined a group of teacher from my high school in Louisville, KY on a teaching journey to St. Jude, where I got to teach a soccer program after school and mentor the P.E. teachers during the school day. My whole trip is being funded by a foundation, so none of this money will be going to offset my expenses, but will be used to help the school and P.E department get the equipment they need!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>Here is what I'm looking to bring over:</p><ul>
<li>15 durable foam baseball bats</li>
<li>45 dense foam ""true fly"" baseballs, so the students can learn the game safely and within the space available to them on campus.</li>
<li>10-15 baseball gloves</li>
<li>1 set of rubber bases</li>
<li>2 baseball rule books</li>
<li>Any extra funds I raise will go straight to the operating campaign of the school, which serves over 1,800 students and employs hundreds of local Tanzanians </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact </h3><p>Why is supporting a school in Arusha, Tanzania impactful?</p><ul>
<li>St. Jude's has proven itself as one of the best institutions of learning in Tanzania, ranking 4th out of 355 schools in the Northwest of the country, even competing against private schools! This is a true testament to the vision of the school's leaders, and to the hard work students and teachers put in every day.</li>
<li>I have been to the school many times, and can attest to the success of the students attending.  My brother and I sponsor a student now in his 9th year at the school...Vedasto's English is fantastic, he has aspirations to be a doctor, and he helps his younger brothers with their schoolwork when he is home. His family is so grateful he can attend St. Jude's.</li>
<li>St. Jude's is educating the future leader's of Tanzania, and ironically, these student's wouldn't be able to afford schooling at all because their families are so poor. St. Jude's is fighting the poverty cycle by providing these children with a quality education.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p>Can't contribute financially? That's OK!<p></p><ul>
<li>Spread the word among your friends...maybe someone you know has a passion for education, Africa, or just knows me and likes me! :)</li>
<li>Please ask me about the school when you see me! I've got so many stories I can share about St. Jude's...one of my favorite places on earth!</li>
</ul><p>Thanks for the support!

The School of St. Jude currently has no baseball equipment, and there is no local place in Arusha to purchase it, so I'll bring it all along with me when I head over in June.L to R: Kim Saville (St. Jude Staff), Grams, Uncle Bruce, Me, Mom!For those of you who don't know, my family has been working in close partnership with the School of St. Jude since 2005.  My mom, Cindy Skarbek, is on the board of directors for the school and spends about a month each year in Tanzania, and her other time at home developing new programs and partnerships for the school in the USA and beyond. In January 2012, I went to Tanzania with ""3 Peaks 3 Weeks"", and was able to raise $50,000 for the school and 2 other organizations in East Africa by climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mt. Meru, and Mt. Kenya within a 3 week time span. Last summer, I joined a group of teacher from my high school in Louisville, KY on a teaching journey to St. Jude, where I got to teach a soccer program after school and mentor the P.E. teachers during the school day. My whole trip is being funded by a foundation, so none of this money will be going to offset my expenses, but will be used to help the school and P.E department get the equipment they need!What We NeedHere is what I'm looking to bring over:
15 durable foam baseball bats
45 dense foam ""true fly"" baseballs, so the students can learn the game safely and within the space available to them on campus.
10-15 baseball gloves
1 set of rubber bases
2 baseball rule books
Any extra funds I raise will go straight to the operating campaign of the school, which serves over 1,800 students and employs hundreds of local Tanzanians 
The Impact Why is supporting a school in Arusha, Tanzania impactful?
St. Jude's has proven itself as one of the best institutions of learning in Tanzania, ranking 4th out of 355 schools in the Northwest of the country, even competing against private schools! This is a true testament to the vision of the school's leaders, and to the hard work students and teachers put in every day.
I have been to the school many times, and can attest to the success of the students attending.  My brother and I sponsor a student now in his 9th year at the school...Vedasto's English is fantastic, he has aspirations to be a doctor, and he helps his younger brothers with their schoolwork when he is home. His family is so grateful he can attend St. Jude's.
St. Jude's is educating the future leader's of Tanzania, and ironically, these student's wouldn't be able to afford schooling at all because their families are so poor. St. Jude's is fighting the poverty cycle by providing these children with a quality education.
Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute financially? That's OK!
Spread the word among your friends...maybe someone you know has a passion for education, Africa, or just knows me and likes me! :)
Please ask me about the school when you see me! I've got so many stories I can share about St. Jude's...one of my favorite places on earth!
Thanks for the support! If you need any more information or have any questions, feel free to ask.With Sincere Gratitude,Katherine",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>The Transfer Service Community (TSC) is a group of UC Berkeley and community college students that assist community college students in transferring to <i>any </i>four-year university, getting involved in public service, and connecting to resources. Our mission is to increase support for prospective transfer students in accomplishing their goals. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We believe in a holistic approach, and we meet students where they're at. A significant portion of community college students are homeless or food insecure. We think these basic needs must be addressed to achieve student success. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We also believe student involvement is crucial in the college experience and essential to retention and feeling supported.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<p>The TSC has served thousands of students around the San Francisco Bay Area and has provided over 40 transfer, scholarship, leadership, and service events since Spring 2010 (Please see our list of workshops and events below).  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We also meet with students one-on-one to share our personal experiences with community college and transferring, connect them to volunteer opportunities, as well as share resources as basic as food and housing. As students, we understand what students need, and we're able to support them in an empathetic, way that empowers them and encourages independence. </span></p>

<h3>How can you help? </h3>
<p>We need $50,000 for three main categories: staffing, supplies, and sustainability. </p>
<p><b><u>Staffing: </u></b>We currently have 10 Peer Advisors and Transfer Liaisons in our program, and we want to make sure that they receive scholarships for the work that they do! They donate 10 hours/week of their time to make our program happen, AND they're all full time students. </p>
<p><b><u>Supplies: </u></b>We're incredibly frugal and have gotten many of our supplies donated, however we still need money for marketing supplies (flyers, posters, business cards, t-shirts, and banners), office supplies (pens, tape, markers, staplers, etc.), and food supplies for our workshops and events.  </p>
<p><b><u>Sustainability: </u></b>In order to take the next step in our program, we need to hire a full time staff person to create a sustainable source of funding for our program. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll use the money that we make to fund a part time position and continue paying for our supplies. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>Perks: </h3>
<p>All donations are tax deductible. In exchange for your generous donation, you can get a Facebook shout-out, a handwritten letter, or a homemade video from grateful students who have been assisted by our program. You can also be entered to win one of our donated gift certificates. There's also an opportunity to receive an invitation to meet with our amazing team! </p>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our program began as a response to the education budget cuts that reduced and eliminated resources, staff, and faculty. Community Colleges were hit the hardest by these cuts compared to the K-12, Cal State, and University of California systems.  We were able to fund our program through two grants that we won and support from the UC Berkeley Public Service Center. Over the first two years, we built stronger relationships with programs and people at local community colleges and UC Berkeley and created workshops and events. In Spring 2013 we won two more grants to expand our services to Laney College and partner with Berkeley High School to provide a Leadership and Service Retreat.  </span></div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h4>Student testimonials:</h4>
<blockquote>The Transfer Service Community(TSC) is dedicated to helping community college students transfer. Their commitment to building an informational bridge between the community colleges and four-year universities significantly contributed to my successful transfer to the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business from Berkeley City College. I have attended and benefited from some of the workshops and events that contained extremely valuable information about resources and programs available to prospective transfer students. These included the Personal Statement and Application Workshop, Shadow Day at UC Berkeley, Resume and Interview Workshop, Scholarships Workshop, Transfer Student Panel, and the ""Next Steps"" for UC Berkeley Admitted Transfer Students Workshop. I am mostly grateful for the one-on-one advising sessions the TSC has offered me. My Transfer Liaison made me believe that transferring to Haas was not just a dream but reality. She guided me every step from giving me critical feedback on my personal statements to giving me advice about my classes and professors at UC Berkeley.  She always made time to fit me in her busy schedule, even if this meant early Sunday mornings or late evenings, and she cleared my uncertainties about the transferring process. Finally, she defiantly reached beyond herself in assisting others and has inspired me to get involved in my community and help other prospective transfer students.</blockquote>
<blockquote>-Rumyana (Business Major/Transfer student at UC Berkeley)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<br/>The Peer Advisors are one of the greatest assets a transfer student can utilize while completing the transfer process. Their competent and caring approach in guiding students is truly marvel. Using the Peer Advisors several times myself, I strongly recommend them to any student who wants to succeed while attending community college and beyond. <br/>-Michael (Political Science Major/Transfer student at UC Berkeley)</blockquote>
<blockquote>When I was the traditional age of going to university, there were no resources like The Transfer Service Community (""TSC""). Their mission (from my perspective) is to help prospective transfer students in transferring to higher education without getting the runaround. The founders of the TSC encountered frustration when they were seeking information on how to transfer to higher education. The TSC came into existence at about the same time when I contemplated transferring to UC Berkeley to pursue a BA in film and media studies. I participated in TSC's first Shadow Day in Spring 2010 at UC Berkeley. I learned what UC Berkeley is all about, what resources are available to transfer students, and what it means to be a UC Berkeley student. My favorite part of the program was the student panel. Hearing about their transfer stories gave me a lot of hope in transferring to UC Berkeley. And here I am in 2014, a UC Berkeley transfer student! TSC's mission is to encourage and help community college students transfer to much higher educational institutions in order to think more critically and to improve their quality of life. They provide assurance, assistance, and encouragement in the process of transferring such as guiding the prospective candidate in writing personal statements, providing information on scholarships and how to apply for them, organizing activities such as Shadow Day, holding seminars such as student panels, and much more. The Transfer Service Community needs our assistance in any way, shape, and/or form to keep their program going so they can continue providing assistance to transfer students in their dream pursuing higher education. Please give what you can to help them. Thank you. Fiat Lux! Go Bears!<br/>

</div></div>","What is the TSC?
The Transfer Service Community (TSC) is a group of UC Berkeley and community college students that assist community college students in transferring to any four-year university, getting involved in public service, and connecting to resources. Our mission is to increase support for prospective transfer students in accomplishing their goals. We believe in a holistic approach, and we meet students where they're at. A significant portion of community college students are homeless or food insecure. We think these basic needs must be addressed to achieve student success. We also believe student involvement is crucial in the college experience and essential to retention and feeling supported.


The TSC has served thousands of students around the San Francisco Bay Area and has provided over 40 transfer, scholarship, leadership, and service events since Spring 2010 (Please see our list of workshops and events below).  We also meet with students one-on-one to share our personal experiences with community college and transferring, connect them to volunteer opportunities, as well as share resources as basic as food and housing. As students, we understand what students need, and we're able to support them in an empathetic, way that empowers them and encourages independence.

How can you help? 
We need $50,000 for three main categories: staffing, supplies, and sustainability. 
Staffing: We currently have 10 Peer Advisors and Transfer Liaisons in our program, and we want to make sure that they receive scholarships for the work that they do! They donate 10 hours/week of their time to make our program happen, AND they're all full time students. 
Supplies: We're incredibly frugal and have gotten many of our supplies donated, however we still need money for marketing supplies (flyers, posters, business cards, t-shirts, and banners), office supplies (pens, tape, markers, staplers, etc.), and food supplies for our workshops and events.  
Sustainability: In order to take the next step in our program, we need to hire a full time staff person to create a sustainable source of funding for our program. 
If we don't reach our goal, we'll use the money that we make to fund a part time position and continue paying for our supplies. 


Perks: 
All donations are tax deductible. In exchange for your generous donation, you can get a Facebook shout-out, a handwritten letter, or a homemade video from grateful students who have been assisted by our program. You can also be entered to win one of our donated gift certificates. There's also an opportunity to receive an invitation to meet with our amazing team!

Brief History:
Our program began as a response to the education budget cuts that reduced and eliminated resources, staff, and faculty. Community Colleges were hit the hardest by these cuts compared to the K-12, Cal State, and University of California systems.  We were able to fund our program through two grants that we won and support from the UC Berkeley Public Service Center. Over the first two years, we built stronger relationships with programs and people at local community colleges and UC Berkeley and created workshops and events. In Spring 2013 we won two more grants to expand our services to Laney College and partner with Berkeley High School to provide a Leadership and Service Retreat.

The Impact
Student testimonials:
The Transfer Service Community(TSC) is dedicated to helping community college students transfer. Their commitment to building an informational bridge between the community colleges and four-year universities significantly contributed to my successful transfer to the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business from Berkeley City College. I have attended and benefited from some of the workshops and events that contained extremely valuable information about resources and programs available to prospective transfer students. These included the Personal Statement and Application Workshop, Shadow Day at UC Berkeley, Resume and Interview Workshop, Scholarships Workshop, Transfer Student Panel, and the ""Next Steps"" for UC Berkeley Admitted Transfer Students Workshop. I am mostly grateful for the one-on-one advising sessions the TSC has offered me. My Transfer Liaison made me believe that transferring to Haas was not just a dream but reality. She guided me every step from giving me critical feedback on my personal statements to giving me advice about my classes and professors at UC Berkeley.  She always made time to fit me in her busy schedule, even if this meant early Sunday mornings or late evenings, and she cleared my uncertainties about the transferring process. Finally, she defiantly reached beyond herself in assisting others and has inspired me to get involved in my community and help other prospective transfer students.
-Rumyana (Business Major/Transfer student at UC Berkeley)

The Peer Advisors are one of the greatest assets a transfer student can utilize while completing the transfer process. Their competent and caring approach in guiding students is truly marvel. Using the Peer Advisors several times myself, I strongly recommend them to any student who wants to succeed while attending community college and beyond. -Michael (Political Science Major/Transfer student at UC Berkeley)
When I was the traditional age of going to university, there were no resources like The Transfer Service Community (""TSC""). Their mission (from my perspective) is to help prospective transfer students in transferring to higher education without getting the runaround. The founders of the TSC encountered frustration when they were seeking information on how to transfer to higher education. The TSC came into existence at about the same time when I contemplated transferring to UC Berkeley to pursue a BA in film and media studies. I participated in TSC's first Shadow Day in Spring 2010 at UC Berkeley. I learned what UC Berkeley is all about, what resources are available to transfer students, and what it means to be a UC Berkeley student. My favorite part of the program was the student panel. Hearing about their transfer stories gave me a lot of hope in transferring to UC Berkeley. And here I am in 2014, a UC Berkeley transfer student! TSC's mission is to encourage and help community college students transfer to much higher educational institutions in order to think more critically and to improve their quality of life. They provide assurance, assistance, and encouragement in the process of transferring such as guiding the prospective candidate in writing personal statements, providing information on scholarships and how to apply for them, organizing activities such as Shadow Day, holding seminars such as student panels, and much more. The Transfer Service Community needs our assistance in any way, shape, and/or form to keep their program going so they can continue providing assistance to transfer students in their dream pursuing higher education. Please give what you can to help them. Thank you. Fiat Lux! Go Bears!

<h3>So, What is LEEP again?</h3>
</div><div> <p>For those of you who are new to LEEP, or if you just need a refresher, LEEP is a global initiative of Scottie's Place, a nonprofit organization based in the US that seeks to assist children affected by poverty and conflict. LEEP is predominately an after-school program that provides academic enrichment and leadership development for all grade 7 students living in the Dukwi refugee camp. With ongoing training and professional support, 12 qualified staff members from the refugee community offer students one-on-one tutoring and mentorship, as well as lead various games and activities designed to deepen students' personal growth and strengthen their leadership skills. As a result of their participation in LEEP, students enhance their self-esteem, confidence, self-awareness and commitment to learning. This growth, situated within an environment that emphasizes community well-being, conflict resolution, and service to others, translates to healthier, stronger relationships at home and sparks the beginning of greater positive social change. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How was LEEP 2014?</h3> <p>The impact of LEEP in 2014 was both deeper and wider than we had ever anticipated. We knew that offering a child one-on-one attention and providing assistance to their specific needs would make a big difference in their lives. This individualized approach is the essence of all our organization's programs. But personal change usually takes time and recognition of such growth isn't always so widespread. As you'll see from the points below, LEEP students made great progress both academically and in their personal development. Teachers, parents, siblings, community members, and even other local schools noticed and praised the students and staff for their achievements. It was the personal commitment of each student and staff member to the transformation of themselves and their community that made LEEP so successful.</p>

Every culture has its own interpretation of the night sky, yet the language of the night sky is universal, connecting all the peoples of the world. It speaks to the very soul of every human. The night sky is a bridge between cultures and a source of inspiration that can change lives.
Reach for the Stars - Afghanistan is an Astronomers Without Borders project managed by Christopher Phillips in collaboration with the Afghanistan Astronomy Association, with additional education advice and documentary support from Imperative Space in the UK.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""The impact of sexual abuse stunts a child's developmental growth. It not only rapes them physically, it also rapes them psychologically.  Dare I say spiritually""? -  M. Britto, 2012<br/></em></p>
<p><strong>InLightenMe Books</strong> is about creating conscious books that are interactive, educational and fun.  In my experience as a social worker and mom, I found that I was not satisfied with some of the material I found at my finger tips. After much research and several client situations, I discovered  multiple topics that need to be accessible to both children and caregivers.  I realized after surveying many parents, caregivers, daycare centers &amp; schools there was a lack of comfort, language  and expression for many topics that are becoming increasingly prevalent in our society. More children are acting out, being placed on medication, being violated at early ages and most importantly being dis-empowered. It is from this place of consciousness that the <em><strong>“What's Underneath our Tummy Tum”</strong></em> series was birthed.</p>
<p><strong><em>""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum""</em></strong> is a series of three books for children ages two and up, and it is designed to appeal to parents as much as to their kids. It is intended as a guide for parents to have dialogue with their children about the power of their voice, name and self-awareness, all in a gentle and powerful way.  </p>
<p>The “What’s Underneath Our Tummy Tum?” series is about empowering children to identify their whole selves at an early age and promote full body awareness. This awareness is acknowledged in three series called “My Breath, My Beauty and My Body.”  It is a MIND, BODY &amp; SPIRIT connection. It works from the inside out to assist children in creating healthy boundaries and having a voice and self- assurance at an early age. </p>
<p>It fosters loving healthy communications about self-esteem building, self- regulation through the breath and the total body, not excluding the typically taboo parts, the parts “Underneath Their Tummy Tum”.</p>
<p>The<strong><em> ""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum""</em></strong> series is broken down in the following way:</p>
<p><strong>MY BREATH</strong> (Book 1) - utilizes breathing techniques and basic tai-chi to teach children how to self calm and self-sooth</p>
<p><strong>MY BEAUTY</strong> (Book 2) - provides children with empowerment and the power of their voice and name</p>
<p><strong>MY BODY</strong> (Book 3) - the most important book in the series, teaches children about safe people, their bodies and how to protect themselves</p>
<p><strong>""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum""- the series:</strong></p>
<p>My professional career has awarded me the opportunity to develop a deeper insight of how critical the early stages of development are to the Mind, Body &amp; Spirit.</p>
<p>While there are several books available to our children for learning, my research showed that none explored the depth of language addressing the body in a way that children can understand, nor that provide parents with easy dialogue to have conversationally with children in a nurturing way.  Because children are curious about many things at an early age, this dialogue is organic and natural.  These books aide in identifying safe people, places, and boundaries in a way never explored before.  These books are colorful and interactive, and carefully designed using techniques I have learned during my professional career as a social worker. </p>
<p><strong>It is a know fact that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most parents/caregivers are unable to find books of this nature accessible to them</li>
<li>Most of these books can be found online, or in the court system after the abuse has taken place</li>
<li>Most children are spoken at and are underestimated as to their level of understanding important concepts</li>
</ul><p>It has been my experience that many children who have experienced sexual trauma, and speak about it as older children, wish they had the ability to articulate it.  After hearing many of these stories, and after the birth of my own daughter, it became clear to me that something had to be done and that I needed to be proactive.  The concept for ""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum"" was birthed in the process.</p>
<p><strong>The Illustrations:</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Illustrations"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/436864/pictures/full/20120913224334-My_Breath_Green_cover_art_220x194.jpg?1347601465"" src="""" style="""" title=""cover, My Breath""/><img alt=""Breath Card Male"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/451098/pictures/full/20120919202733-photo_1.JPG?1348111662"" src="""" style="""" title=""My Breath""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the most important steps in writing this book was choosing the right artist to work with. The illustrations needed to tell the story, while engaging children in an educational way. After much searching, I discovered a talented artist, Caroline Artayudianto, who has created the cover art seen in this campaign. </p>
<p>I have worked with the illustrator to bring you a sample of what is to come.  The bulk of the funding needed is required to complete all three books, and make copies available for distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what is needed (an estimate):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illustrator</strong>: $4500</p>

<p><strong>ISBN code</strong>:  $2,500 (for 100 books)</p>
<p><strong>T-shirts</strong>: $1,620.00 (100 shirts)</p>

<p><em>©InLightenMe Books, 2012<br/></em></p></div>","""The impact of sexual abuse stunts a child's developmental growth. It not only rapes them physically, it also rapes them psychologically.  Dare I say spiritually""? -  M. Britto, 2012
InLightenMe Books is about creating conscious books that are interactive, educational and fun.  In my experience as a social worker and mom, I found that I was not satisfied with some of the material I found at my finger tips. After much research and several client situations, I discovered  multiple topics that need to be accessible to both children and caregivers.  I realized after surveying many parents, caregivers, daycare centers & schools there was a lack of comfort, language  and expression for many topics that are becoming increasingly prevalent in our society. More children are acting out, being placed on medication, being violated at early ages and most importantly being dis-empowered. It is from this place of consciousness that the “What's Underneath our Tummy Tum” series was birthed.
""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum"" is a series of three books for children ages two and up, and it is designed to appeal to parents as much as to their kids. It is intended as a guide for parents to have dialogue with their children about the power of their voice, name and self-awareness, all in a gentle and powerful way.  
The “What’s Underneath Our Tummy Tum?” series is about empowering children to identify their whole selves at an early age and promote full body awareness. This awareness is acknowledged in three series called “My Breath, My Beauty and My Body.”  It is a MIND, BODY & SPIRIT connection. It works from the inside out to assist children in creating healthy boundaries and having a voice and self- assurance at an early age. 
It fosters loving healthy communications about self-esteem building, self- regulation through the breath and the total body, not excluding the typically taboo parts, the parts “Underneath Their Tummy Tum”.
The ""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum"" series is broken down in the following way:
MY BREATH (Book 1) - utilizes breathing techniques and basic tai-chi to teach children how to self calm and self-sooth
MY BEAUTY (Book 2) - provides children with empowerment and the power of their voice and name
MY BODY (Book 3) - the most important book in the series, teaches children about safe people, their bodies and how to protect themselves
""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum""- the series:
My professional career has awarded me the opportunity to develop a deeper insight of how critical the early stages of development are to the Mind, Body & Spirit.
While there are several books available to our children for learning, my research showed that none explored the depth of language addressing the body in a way that children can understand, nor that provide parents with easy dialogue to have conversationally with children in a nurturing way.  Because children are curious about many things at an early age, this dialogue is organic and natural.  These books aide in identifying safe people, places, and boundaries in a way never explored before.  These books are colorful and interactive, and carefully designed using techniques I have learned during my professional career as a social worker. 
It is a know fact that:

Most parents/caregivers are unable to find books of this nature accessible to them
Most of these books can be found online, or in the court system after the abuse has taken place
Most children are spoken at and are underestimated as to their level of understanding important concepts
It has been my experience that many children who have experienced sexual trauma, and speak about it as older children, wish they had the ability to articulate it.  After hearing many of these stories, and after the birth of my own daughter, it became clear to me that something had to be done and that I needed to be proactive.  The concept for ""What's Underneath our Tummy Tum"" was birthed in the process.
The Illustrations:

 
One of the most important steps in writing this book was choosing the right artist to work with. The illustrations needed to tell the story, while engaging children in an educational way. After much searching, I discovered a talented artist, Caroline Artayudianto, who has created the cover art seen in this campaign. 
I have worked with the illustrator to bring you a sample of what is to come.  The bulk of the funding needed is required to complete all three books, and make copies available for distribution.
Here is what is needed (an estimate):
Illustrator: $4500
Printing & Publishing: $1,242.60 (for 100 books, each series) / $414.20 per book (24 pages color and B&W)
ISBN code:  $2,500 (for 100 books)
T-shirts: $1,620.00 (100 shirts)

Total Funds needed:  $9,862
What you will receive for your donations:
$10 – PEACE:  A personal thank you note from the author for your donation.
$25 – KINDNESS: A personal thank you note and an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt.
$50 – JOY: A personal thank you note; a signed copy of the book; an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt.
$100 – PROSPERITY: A personal thank you note; 2 signed copies of the book; an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt.
$250 – GRATITUDE: A personal thank you note; 2 signed copies of the book; an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt; a child drawing.
$500 – COMPASSION: A personal thank you note; 2 signed copies of the book; an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt; a thank you mention in the book; and an invitation to a read aloud.
$1000 – LOVE:  A personal thank you note; 3 signed copies of the book; a signed illustration; a thank you mention in the book; an “InlightenMe Books” t-shirt; an invitation to a read aloud; and a child drawing.
*if the funding goal is not achieved, all proceeds will go towards illustrations and then we will regroup for a second round of funding needs.
Did you know?

There are over 70,000 ""registered"" sex offenders in the United States
1 in 3 girls will be sexually abused by the age of 18
1 in 5 boys will be sexually abused by the age of 18
But, only 1 in 10 of those victims will ever disclose that they have been sexually abused.  The average sex offender has over 114 victims in a lifetime, partly due to the low disclosure rate as indicated above.


34% of child sexual abuse victims are abused by family members

59% of child sexual abuse victims are abused by a friend and/or acquaintance

93% of child sexual abuse victims know their attacker


57% of convicted sex offenders report being sexually abused as a child

1 in 5 children will come in contact with a sex offender on the internet through various social network sites

<h3>What is Pipe Dreams?</h3>
<p>Remember when you were a kid and Super Mario always brightened up a rainy day?</p>
<p>Now imagine if you had no SNES, maybe your parents couldn't afford to buy you one, maybe you weren't well-behaved that year and Santa never made the drop.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you were born with a degenerative disease meaning most of your young life is spent in various hospital beds, not being quite old enough to understand what's going on.</p>
<p>Our aim is to create a charitable organisation aimed at improving the quality of life for children in difficult or emotionally challenging situations such as short or long term hospital stays and care homes.</p>
<p>To elaborate, we all know what a fantastic job our healthcare professionals do in looking after children with physical and mental disabilities, but they can only do so much. In the current economic climate funding for all public sectors is stretched thin, and while focus is moved on to the important things such as medicine and healthcare, it can often be easy to forget what children need most in times of need. Play.</p>
<p>Pipe Dreams aims to raise funds to buy toys, video games, consoles and more to donate to children in situations that would usually make them scared, paranoid and frightened in a bid to help them have the fun every child deserves. We will be primarily targetting gamers, running events for people of all ages such as video game tournaments to be held in local bars, sponsored gaming sessions (Most levels of Meat Boy without dying anyone?), colouring competitions for the young 'uns and more. In addition to this, we have the help of a budding graphic artist lending their hand to a range of attractive merchandise such as tshirts, pin badges and wrist bands amongst other things. A minimal amount of all money raised will be used towards advertising and covering the costs of the events themselves, but we pledge to donate a minimum of 70% of all funds raised directly to our cause. </p>
<p>In order to acheive this, we pledge to operate in an entirely transparent manner. A full list of all our ins-and-outs will be available on our website from the word go, helping those donating to see exactly what fun things their donation helped to purchase, and where those things were sent. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So how will my donation help?</h3>
<p>Primarily, the funds we raise through this site will go towards our cause. We aim to spend the bulk of the funds buying toys, games, books, arts &amp; craft supplies and more for children in vulnurable and distressing situations. As well as this, though, we want to make sure we can continue doing good things in the future.</p>
<p>When the inspiration to help children in these difficult and distressing situations first moved us to take action, we had the idea to hold some fundraising events, raise awareness and anything else it took to do what we could. If only it were that simple. </p>
<p>As we have a very specific goal in mind, it means a lot to myself and the wonderful people who have pledged their time to help that the money we raise is used in a way we agree with rather than disappearing in production costs and salaries. This involves firstly registering ourselves as a non-profit organisation. Secondly, in order to reach out to a larger audience we require a dedicated online presence. After this, our fundraising ventures will need, amongst other things, advertising and prizes. Eventually we hope to have all our events be self-sustaining, with each fundraiser being enough to help our chosen cause and to fund the next event. Initially, however, startup costs are required and much as we are more than willing to offer our time, we're not a financially blessed bunch... </p>
<p>Your donations will help with the up-front costs required to help us get this off the ground. Funds will be used to ensure we have a professional online presence, uniforms for our voulenteers, merchandise to provide as a reward for donations, advertising and up-front costs for our first major event and other various costs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What about the future?</h3>
<p>At present we're committed to ensuring Pipe Dreams becomes a respected and well-known charitible organisation in the Torbay area, but this isn't all. Once we become fully established in the South West we aim to branch out to other nearby cities such as Plymouth and Exeter, finding like-minded individuals to run events of their own under the Pipe Dreams banner to benifit hospitals and care homes in their area. The more people we can find to help, the bigger difference we can make!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I'm a local business owner, what can I do?</h3>
<p>A lot! As with anything of this nature, awareness is key. We can only make a difference if we spread our message to as many people as possible, and for that aim we need to become a recognised organisation in our local area. You can help by allowing us window space for posters, letting us place a collection jar on the counter, lending us your fine drinking establishment for a fundraising event or anything else you can think of, no matter how small. Every little helps, and we will be eternally grateful to anyone who can help us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I'm broke... But I want to help!</h3>
<p>We appreciate better than anyone (trust us...) that sometimes times are hard and while you may want to help, it might not be possible. In that case, all we ask is that you spread awareness of our campaign and help us to reach as many people as possible. As with any crowd-funding venture we are at the mercy of the people we can make aware of what we're trying to do. Share our page on facebook, throw us a tweet, even just text your friends and let them know of what we're trying to do!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if you don't meet your goals?</h3>
<p>While we really hope we do, if for any reason we don't meet our funding goal we may unfortunately be unable to provide any goods related to perks. Depending on the amount raised we will do our best with what we have, and if it turns out it's not enough all funds will be donated to charitible causes.</p>

<h3>Who are we and what are we about:</h3>
<p>The Okita Project encompasses the ambitions of three college students; Nick, Joe, and Kevin, to help communities in the developing world get access to necessities of life.  These include vaccinations from diseases, sustainable methods of producing energy, and, of course, clean drinking water. The disparity in global income and quality of life from the ""first world"" to the ""third world"" is alarming and not always obvious to those who do not stop to think about it. Thus, we aim to create some pause in your day to contemplate giving to our worthy cause. </p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Who are we and what are we about:
The Okita Project encompasses the ambitions of three college students; Nick, Joe, and Kevin, to help communities in the developing world get access to necessities of life.  These include vaccinations from diseases, sustainable methods of producing energy, and, of course, clean drinking water. The disparity in global income and quality of life from the ""first world"" to the ""third world"" is alarming and not always obvious to those who do not stop to think about it. Thus, we aim to create some pause in your day to contemplate giving to our worthy cause.

<h2 dir=""ltr"">We are Jim, Sara, Scott, and Stephanie, four professional classical music performers and teachers who are passionate about music education and inspired by the El Sistema movement.</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Jim Legge is principal violist of the Saskatoon Symphony and has a large teaching studio.  He has played and taught in Saskatoon for 17 years.</p>
<p>Sara Spigott grew up in Outlook, SK and studied oboe at the University of Saskatchewan, University of Ottawa, San Francisco Conservatory of Music and the Glenn Gould School in Toronto.  She is a freelance musician and is also a music and band teacher currently working for Saskatoon Public Schools.</p>
<p>Scott McKnight has been an active performer and teacher in Saskatoon since moving from Ontario in 2010.  He studied cello performance at the University of Ottawa and Wilfrid Laurier University.  He recently completed his Suzuki Training and keeps busy with his teaching studio.</p>
<p>Stephanie Unverricht grew up in Saskatoon and recently moved back to play principal bassoon with the Saskatoon Symphony.  She teaches several instruments around Saskatoon and surrounding communities, and plays and sings in Minor Matter, a local indie-folk band.</p>
<h3>Our Program</h3>
<p>Currently we are going into Vincent Massey Community School one day a week to work with two classes of children aged 7-9.  Our goal is to expand into a program that runs five days a week after school.</p>
<p>We will start with 40 kids, each with their own string instrument.  Playing in an orchestra teaches the importance of teamwork in a non-competitive environment.  Learning an instrument and playing as part of an orchestra teaches children to be well rounded, confident citizens in our community.  This type of opportunity is not readily available for most of these students.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">What We Need</h3>
<p>We were recently awarded a grant on the condition that we match its funding. This means that every dollar raised with this campaign turns into two!<br/>Whether we match, exceed, or fall short of our goal, this money will be used towards the purchase of 40 child-sized instruments.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Originating in Venezuela in 1975, Sistema-inspired programs have been created across the world.  In the past 4 years programs have started up in Canadian cities including Winnipeg, Moncton, Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.  We believe Saskatoon is in need of a Sistema program, and children in grades 2-4 don't have many opportunities for extracurricular activities.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have a gently used child-sized violin or cello please consider giving it another chance to be played by one of the kids in our program.</p>
<p>We are always looking for volunteers to help.  If you have any valuable skills you’d like to share please let us know.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2009, I was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer and subsequently lost my marriage within a year later. My daughter was born in the midst of all of this. Since then I have had to essentially retrain myself into viewing life in a different aspect. What I thought success meant, what I thought life was about had changed. After going through my treatment I started to see how God was using me in my broken state to touch and help others. I began to see how 36 lives had been changed just merely on the fact that I was open to share my story and lend a helping hand while I expected nothing in return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently I am registered and recieving training to because a Strategic Intervention Coach through the Robbins Madanes Training institute. My goal is to use these skills to further my abilities to reach others and change lives. I do not seek sympathy, but I know when I must be humble enough to understand when a little assistance is needed. Rest assured, whether I receive funding help or not, I will continue on and find a way. I sincerely believe that if you have a dream and a purpose, a way will be made, one way or another.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p><strong>Hello! </strong></p>
<p>My name is Emily McMillen and I am a 3rd teacher at Peabody Elementary, a Title 1 school in the middle of Memphis, TN. Throughout my early elementary years I struggled constantly with reading--but it was my 3rd grade teacher who cracked the code, who identified my dyslexia and got me the help that I needed in order to be successful throughout the rest of my life! </p>
<p>Now, this cause has gotten even more personal for me, for I have one very sweet and bright little girl in my classroom currently who is struggling herself with dyslexia, and is in need of the best possible help so that she too can succeed to her fullest ability!</p>
<p>But this isn't just for my classroom--there are brilliant, creative, wonderful children across our nation who are struggling to be understood, struggling academically...kids that need our help! </p>
<p>In bringing ""The Big Picture"" to Memphis, TN not only will we be raising awareness surrounding different learning styles, but we'll be partnering with professionals, experts, specialists, and educators across the nation so that we can help ALL children learn and succeed! </p>
<p><strong>What We Need From You</strong></p>
<p>We need the funding to purchase the film rights and pay for a screening venue in order to bring this magnificent event to Memphis, TN! Your contributions will also allow us to hold this screening at Studio on the Square, a public theather in the midtown neighborhood of Memphis! </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3>Flight4All! Let The children experience flight for free!</h3>
<p>Firs of all let me introduce myself: I am a 21 ys old University student with the passion for flying. I am a licensed private pilot, and I also want to fly for a living. (You can see some videos of me flying at this url: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/baldomito"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/baldomito</a>)</p>
<p>Growing up It was hard to keep the motivation high, since the costs and the accessibility to flying for children and teenagers in Europe are close to none. </p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to achieve my dream with scolarships, a part time job and the help of my parents, but I still see many dreams crushed to pieces! And many people giving up on flying without even a chance to try it!</p>
<p>Too many in my opinion! That why I want to share my love for flying with other people, (especially children) providing free trial flights across Europe.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here's what we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>An Aircraft! (Yes!): we need a second-hand 2 seater light airplane to do the job!</li>
<li>Hangar and travel expenses (including fuel and maintenance for up to 100 jolly flights)</li>
<li>All the money to start running the project! </li>
<li>A unique livery!</li>
</ol>
<p>As a unique perk we will write your name on the plane, or you can have that AND you can enjoy a ride on the plane free of charge! You can also decide to name the plane yourself! Be an active part of a dream! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Big Picture!</h3>
<p>The project is set to start locally (Italy). but the final goal is to make contact with children associations, foster homes, schools and even hospitals all across Europe to get even more children to experience fly!</p>
<p>NOTE: In case the funding goal is not reached the total amout will be given to the ground-breaking Stem Cell research by Dt. Vannoni (more info here <a href=""http://www.staminafoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.staminafoundation.org</a>). I am not affiliated in any way with this organization, i just believe in their work in curing children pathologies.  </p>

<h3>Hello! </h3>
<p>My name is Umar Momen and I am a Junior at York high school in Monterey, CA. During the winter of 2012, My family and I went to Bangladesh and I was given the chance to visit two BRAC slum schools. It was an incredibly moving experience. <strong>Children younger than me who had grown up in harsh conditions with impoverished parents earning pennies a day wanted to grow up to bring change to their community</strong>. The encounter left me inspired to help out those young children and help them acheve their dreams, and so I began this campaign. An article on my experience can be read <a href=""http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20130726/OFFSIXTYEIGHT06/307260017/Momem-visits-schools-Bangladesh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here.</a><a href=""http://www.thecalifornian.com/article/20130726/OFFSIXTYEIGHT06/307260017/Momem-visits-schools-Bangladesh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""here""><br/></a></p>
<p>Every contribution makes a massive impact on the lives of the students. <strong>It takes a mere $36 to fund a child for a full year.</strong> The education they recieve is comparable to or even better than that offered by the public school system and can completely alter a poverty-stricken child's future. <strong>Every dollar counts.</strong></p>
<h3>What is BRAC?</h3>
<p><span>Since the country’s independence in the 1970s, Bangladesh has been plagued with poverty. <strong>In 1972, BRAC was founded as a non-profit organization with the goal of empowering the impoverished and providing them with the opportunity to change their lives.</strong> Since its foundation, it has mushroomed from a small, local foundation to a large scale operation aiding over an estimated 135 million people.</span></p>
<h3>""No one else at home can read or write. I'm the only one who can.""</h3>
<p><strong>Those are the words of 11-year-old Sabina Yasmin. Thanks to donations from people like you, she was able to recieve a decent education regardless of the fact that she was growing up in one of the poorest areas of Bangladesh. </strong></p>
<p><strong>BRAC has been working since its inauguration to provide education to the most poverty-stricken slums and villages in Bangladesh.</strong> Bangladeshi slums are dirty, smelly, run-down communities where the poorest of the poor make their living. People wear simple, often worn out clothing and gutters overflowing with trash and waste line the streets. It is in places like these where BRAC is a saving grace, providing the children growing up in these harsh conditions with a chance at a proper education. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Hello! 
My name is Umar Momen and I am a Junior at York high school in Monterey, CA. During the winter of 2012, My family and I went to Bangladesh and I was given the chance to visit two BRAC slum schools. It was an incredibly moving experience. Children younger than me who had grown up in harsh conditions with impoverished parents earning pennies a day wanted to grow up to bring change to their community. The encounter left me inspired to help out those young children and help them acheve their dreams, and so I began this campaign. An article on my experience can be read here.
Every contribution makes a massive impact on the lives of the students. It takes a mere $36 to fund a child for a full year. The education they recieve is comparable to or even better than that offered by the public school system and can completely alter a poverty-stricken child's future. Every dollar counts.
What is BRAC?
Since the country’s independence in the 1970s, Bangladesh has been plagued with poverty. In 1972, BRAC was founded as a non-profit organization with the goal of empowering the impoverished and providing them with the opportunity to change their lives. Since its foundation, it has mushroomed from a small, local foundation to a large scale operation aiding over an estimated 135 million people.
""No one else at home can read or write. I'm the only one who can.""
Those are the words of 11-year-old Sabina Yasmin. Thanks to donations from people like you, she was able to recieve a decent education regardless of the fact that she was growing up in one of the poorest areas of Bangladesh. 
BRAC has been working since its inauguration to provide education to the most poverty-stricken slums and villages in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi slums are dirty, smelly, run-down communities where the poorest of the poor make their living. People wear simple, often worn out clothing and gutters overflowing with trash and waste line the streets. It is in places like these where BRAC is a saving grace, providing the children growing up in these harsh conditions with a chance at a proper education. 


What We Need & What You Get
This campaign aims to raise $5000 to send at least 130 primary or pre-primary age children from poor families to a BRAC school for one year. Upon completion of their time in a BRAC school, the children will transition into government-run schools. Children who come from the BRAC schools have been shown to do significantly better than children from regular schools. 
The money will be distributed to the areas where it is most needed in Bangladesh, and I will report back to you so you know how your money is changing lives.
Upon donating, you become a part of the BRAC movement and will recieve photos of your gift's impact. If you donate $35, then you know that a child half-way around the globe has a chance at making his or her dreams come true entirely thanks to you!
If you decide to donate and you are employed, check with your company to see if you can get a matching gift for your donation. An estimated $10 billion dollars of match funding is left unused every year. In this way, every dollar you donate becomes multiple dollars which can be put towards this good cause.


The Impact
Because of your donations, children who can only imagine going to a school can finally have that chance. Each school holds between 25 to 30 students, and $5,000 has the potential to open as many as five schools. In addition, new teachers can be trained and more equipment can be brought into the schools to enhance the education provided in the schools.
BRAC has already helped thousands of children build for themselves a better future, and with your donations, thousands more are soon to come.

<p><b><i>Initial Front End Development:</i> Between the three of us, we have
enough expertise with front end programming to manage and occasionally update
our user interface, but do not have enough expertise or time to develop the
full-scale professional grade user experience that we envision for
Internnection. Therefore, we have contracted a front-end designer to do this for
us.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Back End Development: </i>Internnection will provide an extremely
helpful software solution for science research, which means we will require
help with its development. We need funds to hire a contractual back-end
programmer to help us build Internnection.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Marketing/Outreach:</i> While the main goal of this campaign is to
raise funds for building the site, we also need a small amount of money to
start marketing Internnection. Our main marketing tactic (which we are very
confident in) is to sponsor Intel ISEF events. ISEF stands for Intel
International Science and Engineering Fair. Intel sponsors science and
engineering fairs annually throughout the country, all of which are qualifiers
for the final, prestigious, Intel ISEF Finals event in May. Internnection would
be able to sponsor these events, allowing us to travel to these events and
speak to hundreds of students and high school teachers, as well as reaching out
to the professional science researchers who attend as judges. </b></p>
<p><b>Even if we don’t
reach our goal, the money we do raise can still help us begin to develop our
website and reach out to high schools and research institutions.</b></p>
<br/><center><h1><font color=""#3a8c78"" size=""6"">More Website Details</font></h1></center><p>
</p><h4>Student Platform
</h4><p>  <b>When a student logs on, they are brought to their
student homepage. This includes a list of current assignments organized by teacher
assignments and laboratory mentor assignments (for when they are conducting
their research), a calendar highlighting deadlines for research competitions or
important research tasks. The student can then select the assignment or
calendar tabs to view these two components in more detail. Furthermore, the
student can select the messenger tab to communicate with their mentor or
teacher, or even share important documents with them. Lastly, the Search tab
brings the student to the internship search application. This will begin with
them on a page containing a search engine for finding relevant research
opportunities. This search engine will allow them to specify search parameters
like research keywords, time required for the internship, and location. Once
students find internship opportunities they are interested in, they can apply
to work for these mentors by “internnecting” with them. This action will
instantly send the students resume, coursework, cover letter, and any other
required material to the researcher to be organized in their applicant list.</b></p>
<h4>Teacher Organization Platform</h4>
<p><b>  When a
teacher logs on, they will be brought to their homepage, which will consist of
a calendar of important deadlines, an interface through which they can post an
announcement for certain students to see, and tabs for each of their classes or
groups. They will also have access to a master list of all of their research
students. Using this master list of students, they can create new groups of
students, whether this is for reorganizing students into classes for a new
school year, or grouping together students that are attending the same research
competition. This will help teachers send out assignments or announcements to
the right students at the right times. Teachers can navigate through the groups
to message an entire group, or find a specific student in order to contact them
or exchange documents, like research paper edits or competition application
essays.</b></p>
<h4>Researcher Organization Platform</h4>
<p>  <b>The research platform will be similar to the teach
platform. The researcher, after logging in, will view a homepage that contains
a calendar that highlights important deadlines for their lab. They will also
have an interface through which to send out announcements to their lab interns.
If the researcher has multiple labs, they can group interns together by lab.
These separate labs will then appear as tabs on the researcher’s homepage. They
will also have access to a master list of all students, through which they can
either select a student to message or exchange documents with, or use to create
new groups (i.e. those working on the same project, those working in the same
lab). </b></p>
<p><b>  The other
portion of the research platform takes care of the intern selection process.
Researchers can click on the profile tab to view their profile, which
interested students can view to learn more about their research. They can edit
this profile at any time. Furthermore, they can select the Applicants tab to
view an organized list of students who have applied to work in their research
lab. This will provide the researcher with an easy to use system through which
to sort through their possible interns.  To save time for the researcher if he/she so
chooses, they can allow approved lab members (i.e. graduate student, secretary)
to have login access to their Internnection account to help manage the intern
applicant process.</b></p>
<h4>Guest User Access</h4>
<p><b>  We understand that even if many researchers utilize
the lab organization platform we offer free to research institutions, science
researchers may still have interns that do not use Internnection. Since we
still want the researchers to be able to organize their lab interns to the
fullest extent, researchers will be able to make guest user accounts for
student interns to use. These temporary accounts will enable the interns to log
in and utilize the mentor communication functionality of the student platform
in order for their mentor to be able to use their lab organization tools. These
guest accounts will not allow students to communicate with teachers, search for
other research opportunities, or have access to any research competition
organization/planning tools/guides.</b></p>

Allocation
  We are looking to raise at least $10,000 through
this Indiegogo campaign. The reasons for this need are illustrated below.
Initial Front End Development: Between the three of us, we have
enough expertise with front end programming to manage and occasionally update
our user interface, but do not have enough expertise or time to develop the
full-scale professional grade user experience that we envision for
Internnection. Therefore, we have contracted a front-end designer to do this for
us.
Back End Development: Internnection will provide an extremely
helpful software solution for science research, which means we will require
help with its development. We need funds to hire a contractual back-end
programmer to help us build Internnection.
Marketing/Outreach: While the main goal of this campaign is to
raise funds for building the site, we also need a small amount of money to
start marketing Internnection. Our main marketing tactic (which we are very
confident in) is to sponsor Intel ISEF events. ISEF stands for Intel
International Science and Engineering Fair. Intel sponsors science and
engineering fairs annually throughout the country, all of which are qualifiers
for the final, prestigious, Intel ISEF Finals event in May. Internnection would
be able to sponsor these events, allowing us to travel to these events and
speak to hundreds of students and high school teachers, as well as reaching out
to the professional science researchers who attend as judges. 
Even if we don’t
reach our goal, the money we do raise can still help us begin to develop our
website and reach out to high schools and research institutions.
More Website Details
Student Platform
  When a student logs on, they are brought to their
student homepage. This includes a list of current assignments organized by teacher
assignments and laboratory mentor assignments (for when they are conducting
their research), a calendar highlighting deadlines for research competitions or
important research tasks. The student can then select the assignment or
calendar tabs to view these two components in more detail. Furthermore, the
student can select the messenger tab to communicate with their mentor or
teacher, or even share important documents with them. Lastly, the Search tab
brings the student to the internship search application. This will begin with
them on a page containing a search engine for finding relevant research
opportunities. This search engine will allow them to specify search parameters
like research keywords, time required for the internship, and location. Once
students find internship opportunities they are interested in, they can apply
to work for these mentors by “internnecting” with them. This action will
instantly send the students resume, coursework, cover letter, and any other
required material to the researcher to be organized in their applicant list.
Teacher Organization Platform
  When a
teacher logs on, they will be brought to their homepage, which will consist of
a calendar of important deadlines, an interface through which they can post an
announcement for certain students to see, and tabs for each of their classes or
groups. They will also have access to a master list of all of their research
students. Using this master list of students, they can create new groups of
students, whether this is for reorganizing students into classes for a new
school year, or grouping together students that are attending the same research
competition. This will help teachers send out assignments or announcements to
the right students at the right times. Teachers can navigate through the groups
to message an entire group, or find a specific student in order to contact them
or exchange documents, like research paper edits or competition application
essays.
Researcher Organization Platform
  The research platform will be similar to the teach
platform. The researcher, after logging in, will view a homepage that contains
a calendar that highlights important deadlines for their lab. They will also
have an interface through which to send out announcements to their lab interns.
If the researcher has multiple labs, they can group interns together by lab.
These separate labs will then appear as tabs on the researcher’s homepage. They
will also have access to a master list of all students, through which they can
either select a student to message or exchange documents with, or use to create
new groups (i.e. those working on the same project, those working in the same
lab). 
  The other
portion of the research platform takes care of the intern selection process.
Researchers can click on the profile tab to view their profile, which
interested students can view to learn more about their research. They can edit
this profile at any time. Furthermore, they can select the Applicants tab to
view an organized list of students who have applied to work in their research
lab. This will provide the researcher with an easy to use system through which
to sort through their possible interns.  To save time for the researcher if he/she so
chooses, they can allow approved lab members (i.e. graduate student, secretary)
to have login access to their Internnection account to help manage the intern
applicant process.
Guest User Access
  We understand that even if many researchers utilize
the lab organization platform we offer free to research institutions, science
researchers may still have interns that do not use Internnection. Since we
still want the researchers to be able to organize their lab interns to the
fullest extent, researchers will be able to make guest user accounts for
student interns to use. These temporary accounts will enable the interns to log
in and utilize the mentor communication functionality of the student platform
in order for their mentor to be able to use their lab organization tools. These
guest accounts will not allow students to communicate with teachers, search for
other research opportunities, or have access to any research competition

Is a US Army Veteran, a graduate of Sam Houston State
University with a degree in Criminal Justice and an advocate for fellow
Military Sexual Trauma victims and their family. 
PTSD is a disabling anxiety disorder battled on
a daily basis. It is a battle we win on some days and lose on other days. It
leaves the veteran with the constant feeling of danger and doom. It leaves us
in a constant state of fear, stress, anxiety, and distrust even when we know we
are safe. It leaves many of us in a depression so thick we try to mask it with
drugs, alcohol, and other self-harming acts even to the point of suicide. Military Sexual Trauma has lasting effects on the veteran, their families, friends, employers, and the government. 
Our families, friends and coworkers/employers live in this
constant chaotic tornado called PTSD, because our fears, stress, anxiety
and mistrust even applies to them. We trust no one! Not even ourselves! Our
loved ones become our enemies and targets even when they have done nothing but
support us.
The government suffers through lack of military readiness.
How can our military be strong when its service members cannot even trust the

</p><p>Following the devastation of World War II, there was a need for initiatives that could help to build and
    maintain peace. Dr. Doris Allen, a child pychologist, believed
    that <b><em>the ultimate source for peace, long range, lay with the children.</em></b> From this conviction came her vision of bringing together children from all over the globe to
    learn to respect different and common values. In 1951, she realized her dream when delegates from
    eight countries gathered in Cincinnati, USA for the first Children's International Summer Village
    (CISV). Since 1951, more than 190,000 people from 70 countries have

In these programs, the kids will be living for a month in an international camp setting where 9-12 different countries are represented by delegations of 4 youth and an adult leader.

</h3>
<div>We have been very fortunate with goods and labour donated that we have been able to reduce our required finances down to $20 000. <br/>Over the last month we have completed a great deal of work during our days off, and we have had a number of local tradies and business operators give their time to help complete technical and difficult work. </div>
<div>We are very happy to announce that our epoxy floor is complete and already in use through normal trade! <br/>We've also removed the dangerous wooden platform (ready for it to be recycled into benches) and we've completed the essential plastering on the ceiling and walls.</div>
<div>We still have a long way to go, but we are happy with our progress and we're exciting for the coming weeks!</div>
<h3>What we are and what we're doing</h3>
<p>We are not your average local cafe, we are your local safe place, your chat room and your food bowl. We make excellent coffee and tasty food, and we want to take care of our community. On top of that, I am a qualified trainer and assessor with a strong background in hospitality. </p>
<p>We operate 7 days a week, serving breakfast, lunch, coffee and cocktails and we provide a delivery service for both lunch (7 days a week) and breakfast (weekends only). </p>
<p>We take part in the suspended coffee program, and we provide accounts for people who need a feed but can't pay today. </p>
<p>We see our community struggling through tough times and we look for ways to make people happier, even if its just by turning up the cheerful music we play. </p>
<p>We enjoy our work, and want the community to enjoy our space and to have a place to go to finish school assignments, learn the art of coffee, or learn how to cook poached eggs. We proofread assignments, give advice on analysing poetry and help write job applications. </p>

<p>- Approximately $5000 for flooring and coving on the wall </p>

<p>- $15000 to completely support and plaster the ceiling in the proposed training area</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will focus on the floor as a priority. We plan for the floor to be completely non-slip and anti-fatigue to prevent injuries. Our second priority is the industrial cool-room to store the additional supplies we'll need for training. </p>
<p>If we come in under budget, all left over funds will be either donated to local food programs or put towards a similar funding project. We'll contact contributors if this happens for your input. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our community demographics are predominantly low socio-economic in make up, and much of the reason for this is the lack of employment opportunities in the area. At the moment, I have 10 employees on my roster, and not enough hours to give all of them. I receive between 5 and 15 employment enquiries every week, and most of these are new enquiries. Many of the new enquiries are from young people who either don't have experience in a work environment, or have limited experience and limited skills in a very small number of tasks. If we could provide targeted training to even 10% of these young people, I believe we could begin to rejuvenate the entire community with hope and new prospects. </p>
<p>Hope is contagious, and if we can give a young person hope for a bright future, we're doing the whole world a favour. </p>
<p>Our cafe is already a safe place for people to hangout and be themselves: we provide free wifi, and a good mix of music for people to enjoy and we are building a toy library for the small ones to enjoy. Providing targeted training is just the next step in building our business and entrenching ourselves as part of the community. </p>
<p>We already accept students from the local schools on work placement and work experience programs, and we see ourselves partnering with colleges and training centres to extend students learning into a more work based environment. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk we face is losing our customer base, so we are always reaching out to the community to grow and retain this customer base. We are doing this through visible advertising, rejuvenating the shop's appearance and providing a live music venue to the local performers. </p>
<p>We plan to continuously consult with other local (and successful) business owners, financial planners and accountants to ensure we stay on track. Let's face it: hospitality is a big risk and there's a lot of work that needs to be done to make a business successful and keep it that way.</p>
<p>We have a comprehensive business plan that is reviewed at the end of every quarter to make sure we're on track for our core goals. </p>
<p>We love our loyal customers and we have a strong repeat customer base that is growing every week. We are always marketing to new and potential customers while also taking care of our existing customers with loyalty programs and special deals.  </p>
<p>We believe that the more successful we are, the more successful the whole area will be, and we want this to be happy and prosperous community. </p>

<p>BlueStamp Engineering is an intensive six-week summer program for high school students to design technologies they find personally interesting. At BlueStamp, we give the students control of their projects and what they do. Students select a project from over 120 choices, or find one on their own that they are personally passionate about.  The focus of their time with the program is getting their project to work and posting full documentation online. They will be cutting, drilling, coding, soldering, and best of all, troubleshooting (all depending on the project of course). Our instructors and TAs are all engineering students at world-renowned universities, such as Stanford, Berkeley, Columbia, Cornell, NYU, Rice, etc. We maintain a ~3:1 student to teacher ratio so that students can get real help from the staff despite each student having their own individual project.</p>
<p><strong>We need your help</strong></p>
<p>Our unique, individually based curriculum, where we give the students the freedom to choose their projects, makes BlueStamp more expensive to run. We choose our students based on their motivation and interest. Yet, unfortunately, some of them cannot pay their entire tuition for the summer ($3,000 - $3500). The tuition covers space, instructors, and all project materials which the student keeps to further work on and impress colleges and companies. We need your help to ensure that they will be able to attend, learn, and grow regardless of financial situations.</p>
<p>We are launching this campaign with $10,000 on Indiegogo. Hopefully, with your help, we can surpass our goals and help more students!  Even if we do not reach our goal, we will use the money we receive to help these students reach their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This will be BlueStamp’s third summer, the last two having gone extremely well. Our first year was just 10 students based in New York. Last summer, we had 21 in New York and 8 in Houston. This summer we hope to have 40 in New York, 20 in Houston, and 20 in San Francisco. As you can see, we are expanding faster and faster to help more students gain the skills they will need to succeed.</p>
<p>Please browse our “<a href=""http://www.bluestampengineering.com/meet-the-students-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meet the Students</a>” page on our website to see first hand the students who benefit from our program and their projects. Our students leave with knowledge and skills that would have been difficult to get on their own.  Recently, several of our students were featured on Liberty TreeHouse, a cable tv show where they dsicussed their work.  In addition, just a few months ago we gave a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1xln8ou1pw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TED talk</a> where we discussed our motivation behind starting BlueStamp. </p>
<p>Your help will make all the difference to these students. They have worked hard to get to where they are, but only with your help, can they continue to rise against the barriers that face them.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute, there are other ways you can help us out:</p>
<p>Please try to get the word out about BlueStamp through social media or through parents and teachers you may know. We want to involve as many motivated students as possible!</p>
<p>If you know of any education or STEM investors, please tell us. We are always trying to find new ways to help our students.</p></div>","Short Summary

Your help will make all the difference to these students. They have worked hard to get to where they are, but only with your help, can they continue to rise against the barriers that face them.
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can’t contribute, there are other ways you can help us out:
Please try to get the word out about BlueStamp through social media or through parents and teachers you may know. We want to involve as many motivated students as possible!
If you know of any education or STEM investors, please tell us. We are always trying to find new ways to help our students.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>We are a small group of students from Kranj (Slovenia). We are discovering and presenting Slovenian cultural heritage.</p>
<p>We have already successfully finished a few projects, where we demonstrated our skills and know-how in presenting field work to those, who are interested. Our goal is to present our work in archaeology and national heritage to common people.</p>

<p>As it is visible from the link above, we are currently working on castles. We work as an unit, which means that all decisions are made together! We do this also for the revival of the past from the visual field remains to be presented to the public of the past archaeological sites. At the same time all our projects provide us with additional experience in archeology, history, architecture and multimedia world.</p>
<h2>OUR CURRENT PROJECT</h2>
<p>On February 23rd 2013 we will launch the presentation of our documentary film about the Castle Waldenberg (Pusti grad, Radovljica, Slovenia). Presentation of the documentary film will be launched on 24th of February on this page and Youtube.</p>
<h2>OUR VISION</h2>
<p>We would love to continue with our work, but face an obstacle – our leader, Rok Bremec, is moving to Canada by the end of March 2013, and is taking all the equipment that we used in our work, with him. That leaves us without any equipment. We want people to get to know their national history, from pre-historic era to the Second World War. Our goal is to present Slovenian herritage as effective as possible.</p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>Our current problem lies in terms of lack of financial support in Slovenia. For continuation of the project we would  need 5000 EUR. The money would be used for purchasing a camera, a videocamera and a computer. This would cost us about 2500 EUR. For the documentary (02/23/2013), we need a producer who would help us make a high quality film. That will be Uroš Šterbenk and it would cost around 500 EUR for all the video and audio work. For the 3D reconstruction of the castle Waldenberg we would hire Gregor Novaković (MAGELAN Skupina, d.o.o.), which costs 2000 EUR, but that would also include quality tutoring in working with AutoCAD, 3ds MAX and Cinema4D. The 2000 EUR also include the use of <a href=""http://hds.leica-geosystems.com/downloads123/hds/hds/ScanStation%20C10/brochures-datasheet/Leica_ScanStation_C10_DS_en.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leica Scanstation C10</a>. This would be signifficant in our future work.</p>
<p>WE OFFER:</p>
<p>Each donator will be mentioned in the credits of the documentary.</p>
<p>Other ways you can help</p>
<p>If you have a project that would benefit you (reconstruction, scanning and making scale models of any objects), we are also at your disposal.</p>
<p>In case of exceeding our goals, we would start our next project, the Gutenberg Castle in Tržič.</p>
