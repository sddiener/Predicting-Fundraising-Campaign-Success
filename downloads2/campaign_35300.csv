<h2><strong>WHAT IS RAMEN PARTY? </strong></h2>
<p>Ramen Party is a collection of characters that introduces preschool children (and their parents) to hip trends in culture, music and food.</p>
<p>We've created six characters based on ingredients found in traditional Japanese ramen.  Each of them have a distinct musical theme that matches their quirky personaliities, and when you mix them together, <em>you create a catchy tune</em>! Let us introduce them to you...</p>
<p><img alt=""Ramen Party Lineup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/749082/pictures/full/20130409214637-lineup_01.jpg?1365569202"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ramen Party Lineup""/><em>From left to right: <strong>Mr. Ramen</strong> (Noodles), <strong>T</strong><em><strong>omorokoshi</strong> (Corn)</em>, <strong>Ms. Tamago</strong> (Egg), <em><strong>Mr. Negi</strong> (Green Onion),</em> <em><strong>Ms. Naruto</strong> (Fishcake)</em>, and <strong>Mr. Chashu</strong> (BBQ Pork)<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WHY INDIEGOGO?</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking to raise 20K to launch Phase One of Ramen Party, which includes:</p>
<p><img alt=""Product Portfolio"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ramenparty.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/productportfolio_v07.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Product Portfolio""/></p>
<p><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ramen Party Interactive Storybook<br/></span>An interactive storybook app which tells the story of Mr. Ramen as he picks up his friends to go to a party. We’ll add interactive elements, puzzles and games (like shape-matching) as kids collect different characters and their musical themes.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ramen Party E-book </span><br/> We’ll also create an e-book series that focuses on the adventures of the individual characters as they encounter other ingredients and recipes in the Ramen Party world.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ramen Party Interactive website <br/></span>Finally, we’ll create a website where the characters will reside.  We’ll have games and activities for kids to play, and a place where they can learn more about the foods and recipes that the characters were based on.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>WHY RAMEN PARTY? </strong></h2>
<p>We all know that kids can be picky eaters.  Ramen Party represents a way to get kids excited about food by allowing them to combine ingredients in the same way that a DJ combines music.</p>
<p>We are also creating a resource for families to learn about foods from a wide-range of ethnicities.  While growing up, simply knowing about things like <em>bok-choy</em> or <em>kimchi </em>helped us connect to our Asian roots—and we’d love to pass that along to our own children. </p>
<p>So, why ramen? Well, it’s not only a delicious food that we grew up with, but it’s also one of the hottest trends in North America!  That said, we’d love to see characters based on ingredients from other cultures—all introducing kids to an entire universe of foods!<strong> <br/></strong></p>

</p><h2>1) Install
driver</h2>
<p>To reduce costs, the board adopted CP2102
as USB-to-serial conversion chipinstead of ATmega16U2, and
we also used CP2102 on Iteaduino
nano. You can
download installation instruction for the driver, which contains the
downloading address and the tutorial for installing on Windows
7:</p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Mainboard/IM130615004_ITeaduino_Nano/DOC_Driver_Installation.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DOC_Driver_Installation.pdf</a><br/></p>
<h2>2)Update Arduino IDE</h2>
<p>You need to download a native
Arduino IDE. The
latest version 1.05 can work normally as we have tested, while version 1.5x is unusable. Here you can download the latest IDE software.</p>
<p>After extracting and installing Arduino IDE, you
can download the patch package we
offered here:</p><p>Iteaduino Lite Patch for Arduino IDE.zip</p>
<p>After extracting the zipped file,copyand paste folder Iteaduino Lite to arduino-1.0.5 \ hardware.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245115/files/20131205224803-IL.jpg?1386312483"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Then open Arduino IDE, you can find
option Iteaduino Lite below Board, which you can useto upload the code. By
the way, do not forget to select serial port first.</p>
<h2>3)
Bootloader programming</h2>
<p>Each board will be programmed with bootloader
before leaving the factory, so that you can use it directly after connecting via USB adapter.</p>
<p>If you want to program bootloader
by yourself, you can refer to the tutorial on
our blog:</p><p><a href=""http://blog.iteadstudio.com/install-bootloader-for-iteaduino-lite/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Install the bootloeader for Iteaduino Lite</a></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269085/files/20131219005125-About_LGT8F88A.jpg?1387443085"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269087/files/20131219005525-sys.jpeg?1387443325"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>LGT8F88A
is a main control chip launched by LogicGreen, which is highly compatible with ATmega88 and
with same resources, electrical
properties and stability as
ATMega88. Moreover, its processing performance is improved through structure adjustment, thus it can work
at 32MHz between 1.8V and 5V. In addition, it is equipped with built-in control
circuits and registers for
touch buttons, which can be easily applied in a variety of small appliances and
small projects.</p>
<p>ITEAD
STUDIO, the global distributor of this new chip, launched Iteaduino Lite with LogicGreen - an Arduino-compatible
derivative board, and offered Ariuino IDE patches and Bootloader,
so that you can develop your
prototype more quickly. You can use Iteaduino Lite as a evaluation
development board for LGT8F88A
to develop your project. If you
need to order the chip or
customized PCB’s for your
project, feel free to contact
us.</p>
<p>Many users wondered how to program
bootloader for Iteaduino Lite
or how to download codes to
LGT8F88A with use of programmer. Here we would like to recommend SWDICE_mkII programming debugger with open-source hardware:</p>
<p>Opensource SWDICE_mkII debugger and programmer (Using LGT8F88A)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we are writing codes for
Iteaduino Lite that can be uploaded onto the bootloader through Arduino IDE,thus
Iteaduino Lite will be able to work as a programmer and can be used to programm
codes for those chips without bootloader.</p>
At present, we are
working on translation of the documents for the chip, and you can find the translated
documents in ""Downloads"" section. If you have any problems in the
process of use, please send E-mails to ITEAD STUDIO, we are glad to help you to
get them fixed. <br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269024/files/20131218232743-Download_1_.jpg?1387438063"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Mainboard/IM131209001_Iteaduino_Lite/sch_iteaduino_lite.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schematic of Iteaduino Lite</a></p><p>Datasheet of Iteaduino Lite</p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Mainboard/IM131209001_Iteaduino_Lite/Iteaduino_Lite.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino IDE Patch of Iteaduino Lite</a> (Includes bootloader code and HEX)</p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Microcontroller/IM131218002/DS_IM131218002.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LGT8F88A Overview_EN_v1.1.1</a><br/></p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Microcontroller/IM131218002/Migrating_from_ATmega88_to_LGT8F88A_v1.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Migrating from ATmega88 to LGT8F88A v1.0</a><br/></p><p><a href=""ftp://imall.iteadstudio.com/Microcontroller/IM131218002/lgtmix_isp_en_v2.1a_setup.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LGT ISP tool</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/246692/files/20131206181928-Packaging.jpg?1386382768"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>For orders
of a single board, we will use simple bubble bags; for orders of more than one board, we will use cartons. Both packaging will be filled
with sufficient protectivematerials

All SMD components on
the board will
be welded in advance. For DIP components, we will weld power socket and toggle switch only. To prevent from being damaged, 6pin and 8pin female headers will not be welded as which can be crushed easily, and we will attach them as accessories
in the package. All pin
locations on the board will remain untouched, so you can buy 2.54mm standard pins on your own.<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Pack List:</span></h3><p></p><ul>

<p>If you know about ITEAD STUDIO, you are
sure that we will arrange delivery as schedueled whether we can achieve the
funding target or not. The production cycle of the board is about one and a half
months, which is expected to be delivered in mid-January, 2014.</p>
<p>If you choose free shipping or airmail, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> the parcel will be sent via Hong
Kong Post or China Post with non- registered airmail, so we cannot offer you
the tracking number to check the shipping progress, and we can only provide you
with a number with which you can check in our logistics company website that the
parcel is received by them and sent to China Post or Hong Kong Post.</span></p>
<p>Since we are shipping in mid-January
, and the Chinese Spring Festival is by the end of January when the whole
country will be given about a 10-day long holiday, and it is often the busiest time
with an excess of parcels before the holiday – that is, we do not know whether
the parcels received during Christmas have been processed or not yet. Therefore,
do not expect to get your parcel in 2 to 3 weeks as usual, you may receive the
package at the end of March - although we did deliver the parcel in mid-January,
it is normal to take about two months to get it from our experience last year.</p>
<p><b>So please be noted that: We will send
the parckages via non-registered airmails and there will be no tracking numbers
offered ! Besides, as it will be sent out in the busiest time period plus a
10-day Spring Festival holiday, you might receive the parcel in about 1 to 2
months! If you are time demanding, you can choose group buying – for example,
you can compaign a DHL shipping package which contains 10 boards, and you can
distribute them to your group members after receiving it.</b></p>
<p>As the board is cheap and it is offered
to users to make various development, we do not provide any warranties nor
accept returns &amp; exchanges, but we do guarantee that each board will be strictly
tested before leaving the factory:</p>

Due to basically the same internal structure, with use of Arduino IDE expansion package we offered, it is proved that most of Arduino codes can be applied on Iteaduino Lite directly after being compiled.
1) Install
driver
To reduce costs, the board adopted CP2102
as USB-to-serial conversion chipinstead of ATmega16U2, and
we also used CP2102 on Iteaduino
nano. You can
download installation instruction for the driver, which contains the
downloading address and the tutorial for installing on Windows
7:DOC_Driver_Installation.pdf
2)Update Arduino IDE
You need to download a native
Arduino IDE. The
latest version 1.05 can work normally as we have tested, while version 1.5x is unusable. Here you can download the latest IDE software.
After extracting and installing Arduino IDE, you
can download the patch package we
offered here:Iteaduino Lite Patch for Arduino IDE.zip
After extracting the zipped file,copyand paste folder Iteaduino Lite to arduino-1.0.5 \ hardware.
Then open Arduino IDE, you can find
option Iteaduino Lite below Board, which you can useto upload the code. By
the way, do not forget to select serial port first.
3)
Bootloader programming
Each board will be programmed with bootloader
before leaving the factory, so that you can use it directly after connecting via USB adapter.
If you want to program bootloader
by yourself, you can refer to the tutorial on
our blog:Install the bootloeader for Iteaduino Lite
LGT8F88A
is a main control chip launched by LogicGreen, which is highly compatible with ATmega88 and
with same resources, electrical
properties and stability as
ATMega88. Moreover, its processing performance is improved through structure adjustment, thus it can work
at 32MHz between 1.8V and 5V. In addition, it is equipped with built-in control
circuits and registers for
touch buttons, which can be easily applied in a variety of small appliances and
small projects.
ITEAD
STUDIO, the global distributor of this new chip, launched Iteaduino Lite with LogicGreen - an Arduino-compatible
derivative board, and offered Ariuino IDE patches and Bootloader,
so that you can develop your
prototype more quickly. You can use Iteaduino Lite as a evaluation
development board for LGT8F88A
to develop your project. If you
need to order the chip or
customized PCB’s for your
project, feel free to contact
us.
Many users wondered how to program
bootloader for Iteaduino Lite
or how to download codes to
LGT8F88A with use of programmer. Here we would like to recommend SWDICE_mkII programming debugger with open-source hardware:
Opensource SWDICE_mkII debugger and programmer (Using LGT8F88A)
Meanwhile, we are writing codes for
Iteaduino Lite that can be uploaded onto the bootloader through Arduino IDE,thus
Iteaduino Lite will be able to work as a programmer and can be used to programm
codes for those chips without bootloader.
At present, we are
working on translation of the documents for the chip, and you can find the translated
documents in ""Downloads"" section. If you have any problems in the
process of use, please send E-mails to ITEAD STUDIO, we are glad to help you to
get them fixed. Schematic of Iteaduino LiteDatasheet of Iteaduino LiteArduino IDE Patch of Iteaduino Lite (Includes bootloader code and HEX)LGT8F88A Overview_EN_v1.1.1Migrating from ATmega88 to LGT8F88A v1.0LGT ISP tool
For orders
of a single board, we will use simple bubble bags; for orders of more than one board, we will use cartons. Both packaging will be filled
with sufficient protectivematerials
to ensure the board will not be damaged during
transportation.
All SMD components on
the board will
be welded in advance. For DIP components, we will weld power socket and toggle switch only. To prevent from being damaged, 6pin and 8pin female headers will not be welded as which can be crushed easily, and we will attach them as accessories
in the package. All pin
locations on the board will remain untouched, so you can buy 2.54mm standard pins on your own.Pack List:

1x Iteaduino Lite Board without headers


2x 2.54mm 8pin female header


1x 2.54mm 6pin female header

1x 2.54mm 10pin female header

If you know about ITEAD STUDIO, you are
sure that we will arrange delivery as schedueled whether we can achieve the
funding target or not. The production cycle of the board is about one and a half
months, which is expected to be delivered in mid-January, 2014.
If you choose free shipping or airmail,  the parcel will be sent via Hong
Kong Post or China Post with non- registered airmail, so we cannot offer you
the tracking number to check the shipping progress, and we can only provide you
with a number with which you can check in our logistics company website that the
parcel is received by them and sent to China Post or Hong Kong Post.
Since we are shipping in mid-January
, and the Chinese Spring Festival is by the end of January when the whole
country will be given about a 10-day long holiday, and it is often the busiest time
with an excess of parcels before the holiday – that is, we do not know whether
the parcels received during Christmas have been processed or not yet. Therefore,
do not expect to get your parcel in 2 to 3 weeks as usual, you may receive the
package at the end of March - although we did deliver the parcel in mid-January,
it is normal to take about two months to get it from our experience last year.
So please be noted that: We will send
the parckages via non-registered airmails and there will be no tracking numbers
offered ! Besides, as it will be sent out in the busiest time period plus a
10-day Spring Festival holiday, you might receive the parcel in about 1 to 2
months! If you are time demanding, you can choose group buying – for example,
you can compaign a DHL shipping package which contains 10 boards, and you can
distribute them to your group members after receiving it.
As the board is cheap and it is offered
to users to make various development, we do not provide any warranties nor
accept returns & exchanges, but we do guarantee that each board will be strictly
tested before leaving the factory:


Power Test


Programming bootloader


Passing Arduino IDE programming
test program


With the test fixture, run the
test program to test all GPIO’s and LED indicators to ensure proper functions.


If you cannot accept the above risk terms,
we are sorry that we cannot provide you with the products and services.",18.0,1,"7 Campaigns

<p>Namaskar beautiful people!</p>
<p>My name is Elena Colón and I am a Support Coordinator for Tender Heart, a non profit NGO which provides educational opportunities for women and children in rural Northern India.</p>
<p>I first went to volunteer in India almost three years ago with absolutely no experience with non government organizations, foreign countries and cultures, working with the underprivileged or doing any of the things I do now. I am a childcare worker and simply wanted to work with young children where I felt encouragement was needed the most. Seeing some of the world’s worst poverty completely broke my heart. I couldn't stand to see tiny children in the streets begging for food and better lives. I was crushed. I bounced around, teaching at different slum school projects in Delhi, but I felt lonely and discouraged with little support. I wound up at Tender Heart with a broken spirit, but they nurtured me and gave me a whole new perspective on the world. I organized a mural painting project with the children to allow their individual creativity to blossom, and I got a taste of the beautiful things that can happen when you invest yourself in others. I found myself inspired, encouraged, loved, overwhelmingly grateful and motivated to serve for the good of all beings.</p>
<p><img alt=""mural"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/208962_500783103268389_649014393_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I now support Tender Heart from Austin, TX through fundraising, selling handicrafts made by the women’s empowerment group, raising awareness through events and presentations, recruiting international volunteers, and creating new partnerships. My vision is to create an international non profit which will function as a fair trade marketplace, international volunteer connection, and support network for educational projects around the world – connecting those in need to those who are willing to offer a helping handJ</p>
<p>So that’s my story..</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Let me tell you a little more about Tender Heart..</strong></p>
<p>Tender Heart works to uplift, and provide social and educational opportunities for disadvantaged children and children with special needs. It is based on the outskirts of Faridabad, in one of the rural villages of northern India. The dedicated women who run the project apply a variety of methods with the developmentally disabled children, such as tactile sensory stimulating activities, music and dance therapy, speech pathology, physical therapy, and group sports therapy. Our primary school children are thriving as well, working hard to become accepted into India's competitive high school system, performing in religious and cultural events and learning about new cultures and language through the international volunteers who come to share heir own skills.</p>
<p>We also run a women's empowerment program to create educational and employment opportunities to widows and underprivileged women from the village of Bhatola. The program is very holistic, emphasizing the need for women to be empowered from the inside out. This involves giving them health education, women’s rights education, vocational training and an opportunity to earn a livelihood through our international fair trade marketplace.</p>
<p>Tender Heart provides these opportunities because we are working towards alleviating the poverty the rural villages of Northern India as they adjust to encroaching urbanization. We are motivated by the belief all of us are part of a singular whole to which we are responsible to protect, encourage and uplift. We are all brothers and sisters on this planet, and it is time we started working together for the good of humanity.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in seeing Tender Heart in action, you can watch a short documentary on the organization here:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>So what are we raising funds for?</strong></p>
<p>This November (just over a month!) I will be traveling to India to meet and work at Tender Heart with a group of international volunteers from Austin, TX. They will be the first volunteers recruited directly to the organization, a huge success for our volunteer recruiting project! I will also be working to facilitate a partnership with Tender Heart and the <a href=""http://www.amalafoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Amala Foundation"">amalafoundation.org</a>  of Austin, TX which supports another school in the area. Our objective is to bring the two communities together and integrate the women in their community with our women’s empowerment program, providing new options for them to not only live more sustainably, but thrive in their environment.</p>
<p>Additionally I am organizing a school supply and art supply drive in Austin, and I will be hand delivering all supplies to our school in the village Bhatola. I will also be able to transport fair trade handicrafts back to America to sell for the women’s empowerment group. This will save a lot of money on international postage and ensure safe and timely delivery of the products.</p>
<p>All of the work I do for Tender Heart is a unpaid volunteer effort, fueled by my passion and devotion to the cause. This fundraising campaign will ensure that I am able to afford</p>
<ul>
<li>A roundtrip ticket to India from Austin, TX</li>
<li>A visa for India</li>
<li>Costs associated with my three-a-half week volunteering venture including other transportation fees (taxis to and from airports), baggage fees for any extra school supplies or handicrafts I will need to transport, and coverage for my housing expenses here in Austin which will ensure storage for all Tender Heart materials and handicrafts in addition to all of my personal belongings</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>What will happen if I exceed my fundraising goal?</strong></p>
<p>Wonderful things will happen! If I exceed my fundraising goal, the extra funds will be contributed to one or more of our current fundraising projects..such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising funds for a new generator for our school in village Bhatola. This will allow us to teach the women and children using the computers that have been donated to Tender Heart. It will also maximize production for the women’s empowerment program since a lot of the hand work they do requires the use of electricity for sewing machines.</li>
<li>Raising funds for a new, internationally accessible website for the organization which will also function as an online fair trade store supporting our women’s empowerment group!</li>
<li>Raising funds for promotional materials such as signs and banners which will help us to promote and raise awareness for Tender Heart in America.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help!</strong></p>
<p>Although there is a huge need for fundraising and donations, if you find that you are not in a financial position to donate, we welcome you to get the word out to friends, family and any other networks you think may be interested in supporting this cause. If you feel passionate about this campaign, please share it with others!</p>

Thanks!  The PerksWe have worked hard to put together a collection of perks to ensure everyone who donates to our project will go home a winner!  We thank you for your donations.Risk and ChallengesThe Crossover that Won the Game is an independent film and we are working on a minimal budget to get this movie completed.  We have yet to acquire distribution but our team is working on getting full distribution.  In the meantime, The Crossover that Won the Game will be screened at various film festivals and private viewings with considerations for Amazon direct distribution and other outlets such as Netflix.  We cannot guarantee the scope of distribution.  What we can guarantee is the show will go on! The TeamJoseph Ponder, Co-Author, The Crossover that Won the GameJoseph is the Co-author of The Crossover that Won the Game and the creative consultant to script development for the production of Bentley’s Revenge:  The Movie.  Bringing over 10 years experience as a writer and author, Joseph is committed to the creative content of both the book and the movie.  Joseph is also the author of Bentley’s Revenge, and a myriad of children books.  Jamell Ponder, Co-Author, The Crossover that Won the GameJamell is the Co-Author of The Crossover that Won the Game and is in charge of personal impact of the team’s creative content.  With a Master’s Degree in Social Work from Roberts Wesleyan College, Jamell ensures all content meets stated requirements for age appropriateness and content impact on viewers of all ages.  Jamell is the Co-author of Bentley’s Revenge, author of Your Worst for the Best of Me, and a myriad of children books.Coal Under Pressure Publicationswww.coalunderpressure.com     Coal Under Pressure is the creative consultant for the screen adaptation of Bentley’s Revenge.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I remember asking myself the questions, ""Why? What have I done wrong?"". And just a couple of days ago, the answer came, ""You have not done anything wrong, but you have done everything right."" Sometimes we find ourselves in life, going through what may seem as the darkest of hour, but truly, there is always a shiny, bright morning after every dark night, and during the dark nights the stars always shine. So this is just one chapter of the many chapters in my life, although the chapter that sets the springboard for who I am, why I'm here, what my life's purpose is, and how I came to find it in the most unthinkable and unimaginable place.<br/><br/>About a month ago I was rushed off to the hospital, I had lost around 15kg's of weight to my 172cm of height, I was underweight, undernourished and I didn't recognize myself and a sudden grief overcame my entire being and soul. Being disconnected from my family and friends, feeling trapped and stuck in a hospital room, every single day I gazed outside my window, longing for freedom and liberation, and the feeling of joy, every time I got to go outside to enjoy the sun.<br/><br/>A few days after I was put in the hospital, a friend's friend came by, Veronika, and she had brought with her art-material, colors and brushes. And I still remember that day as if it was yesterday, as I took hold of the brush, and all of a sudden, I couldn't help myself but to get caught in the now-moment, as my body expressed so much rage over this experience, and I had not been able to cry for several days, but that day the tears just fell down. At that exact moment, I knew, this is my life's passion, this is how I get to heal.<br/><br/>Ever since that day, instead of gazing outside the window longing for freedom and liberation, I have slowly, bit by bit, day by day, realized in my heart, that my healing, liberation and freedom comes from my inspiration, passion and creativity. And today I don't fear those emotions in the way that I used to, but allowing myself to be completely overcome with that passion. Getting in touch with creativity, and realizing who I am, what I'm here to do, has literally brought the light of dawn inside of me.<br/><br/>Painting helps me to heal in way that words are not enough. For several days, I could barely eat or drink without a lot of anxiety, and starting to paint has helped me to release the anxiety and as soon as I grab my painting brush, I feel hungry.

</p><p><b>Hi
my name is Sergio Rey Avila, I
currently live in El Paso, Texas originally from Northern California.  My
background consist of being a family oriented, charitable individual with a go
getter attitude. A dreamer at time, yet realistic in achieving my goals in
life. Some of my many hobbies include helping others and traveling. I
enjoy immersing myself in other cultures to experience a new way of living
or possibly different way of thinking to ultimately find ways of helping.
 Expansion of the mind, body and soul is key to reaching ones
potential. With that said, I believe to have a natural knack for helping
people, especially the less fortunate. Combining both my desire for helping people along with my drive to make a positive impact within my community I came up with my great idea.</b></p>
<p><b>My idea is simple; help families, especially
ones with young children and elderly that have economic need or are below the
poverty line with a homemade A/C unit. Giving a helping hand will:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Help give some heat relief to families or
individuals that need it the most. </b></p>
<p><b>2. Help prevent possible illness due to heat
strokes and or dehydration.</b></p>
<p><b>3. Keep El Pasoans safe and away from death,
related to heat. </b></p>
<p><b>4. Give a sense of community throughout
the city and county of El Paso, TX.</b></p>
<p><b>For those who do not know or ever been to the
Southwest region of the states, well let me tell you, it gets hot. We are
located in a desert area where average temps during the summer reach upwards of
100+ degrees. Folks here either have refrigerated air or swamp coolers, the
latter only helps to a certain degree. As you can imagine no one is outdoors
from the hours of 10 AM to 5PM that doesn't need to be. Everyone stays indoors
and tries to keep cool. </b></p>
<p><b>Within the metropolis, El Paso has close to
800,000 residents within county lines, if we include Las Cruces, NM and Juarez,
MX the area is home to over 2 million people. About 30% of El Paso is
considered poor or living below the poverty line, a percentage much higher than
the state of Texas. <a href=""http://www.city-data.com/poverty/poverty-El-Paso-Texas.html."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.city-data.com/poverty/poverty-El-Paso-Texas.html.</a>
That's well over 200,000 people that are trying to survive. We can help,  a breath of fresh air can make a huge difference.
Sometimes in life it's the little things that mean the most, a small gesture
that keeps us going, helping us believe to never give up. We can be that
gesture of hope. Your donation will do so much good and at the same time you
get the satisfaction of knowing you were a part of something great, something
that brought hope, relief and safety from possible heat related illnesses. </b></p>
<p><b>I'm passionate about my campaign because I
want to give back to the community that has given a lot to me since I moved
here 7 years ago. During the summer months I see the struggle that the less
fortunate go through to try and stay cool. The city has suggested ""cool
zones"" for the disadvantaged to gather at, when temperatures are peaking.
Community centers and strip malls are among the suggested sites, yet for some it
is difficult to get there with no means of transportation. Others with little
to no money have a hard time getting to places or purchasing items to help keep
them keep cool and safe. </b></p>
<p><b>You can help make this happen, I can't do it
alone. I have discovered a way to make an affordable home made air conditioner
($25 please see video above) that is so simple and easy to use it can bring relief
to so many. My biggest concern is the elderly and families that have small children.
Together we can make a difference and here is how I plan to put your hard
earned money and my efforts to work. </b></p>
<p><b>With the help of local organizations, non
profits and religious groups, I will purchase the needed items to build
and assemble the A/C units (with funds raised here). With a collaborative
effort of  volunteers they will help me
build, store and give away the units at a set event to occur at the beginning of
summer. We will also target areas with a high concentration of both elderly and
needy families with small children to set up stations where they can have easy
access to the A/C units. </b></p>
<p><b>My humble goal is to have 1,000 units ready
to serve our community and with your help we can all say ""Stay Cool El
Paso"". All of the proceeds will go directly to this campaign. My efforts
and organization is my contribution to this cause. It is not an easy task, yet I'm
willing to put in the needed time to make this a success. As the campaign progresses,
updates will be given via this website and via the ""Stay Cool El
Paso"" website hopefully once we get a website built so all donors can
track our progress. Please make sure to give us your e-mail address. </b></p><p>Lastly, I set it up so everyone that wishes to participate can. Monetary donations start at $2.00 and go all the way up to $1,000.00. (remember the higher the donation the greater the ""perk"" received) Your non monetary support is greatly appreciated too, please share this campaign with family, neighbors and friends.

<b>Active Grading Sense</b>: <i>Our app will allow the teacher / test administrator to view the student's processing logic - so no need to rewrite complex formulas  / matrices on a separate sheet of paper just to show your work.

</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Instant Results</b>: <i>Unlike any of our competitor's, we offer instant grading so that as student's complete their calculator-supported answers, the classroom server will automatically send not only their work </i>(see Active Grading Sense) <i>but also a tally of the student's % correct, based on a custom-made answer key view-able and editable only by the teacher. Teachers can also easily set the % weight of each question  / sub-question as they deem necessary via their log-in credentials.</i>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<b>Anti-Cheating Feature</b>: <i>Finally, our flagship feature aims to build teacher / admin trust in using calculator apps during exams. As previously mentioned, w</i><i>e can accomplish this through the use of ground-breaking algorithms that prevent cheating by accurately identifying background-app-switching / CPU usage.

Instant Results: Unlike any of our competitor's, we offer instant grading so that as student's complete their calculator-supported answers, the classroom server will automatically send not only their work (see Active Grading Sense) but also a tally of the student's % correct, based on a custom-made answer key view-able and editable only by the teacher. Teachers can also easily set the % weight of each question  / sub-question as they deem necessary via their log-in credentials.

Anti-Cheating Feature: Finally, our flagship feature aims to build teacher / admin trust in using calculator apps during exams. As previously mentioned, we can accomplish this through the use of ground-breaking algorithms that prevent cheating by accurately identifying background-app-switching / CPU usage. If alerted, the app would notify the teacher account in control of the classroom via immediate text messaging, and also lock the student's access to the calculator unless voided by the teacher.
--We’ve done the research and built a prototype, but a lot of our ideas are still on paper. Without your help, we will not be able to fund the development of this app. (And we're still just students, so we can't even pretend to be capable of programming every aspect of this initiative).
We need YOU GUYS, the community, to take part in shaping our app through the BETA phases. To do your part, sign up for a reward by pledging $25 or more and become a valuable member of our  BETA & developer team.
Your money will be used to fund:Development: US-based and offshore software development teams to create a full version of the app.Business Registration: Initial legal costs / fees associated with bringing up a business here in the States. We are also vying to become a registered LLC, as well as a multi-platform compatible app. Initial release is set for the Android, iOS, and Windows App Stores, which together comprise 95.71% of our target audience (high school and college-attending students).--Risks & ChallengesWe, as high school students in higher-level mathematics & science courses ourselves, know we need to balance our time between school and well, extracurricular work such as this. Our school is such that by now, we know how to manage that time effectively and efficiently.Please know that your money will be used with the utmost caution and care, and we will not waste a single cent on personal objectives or anything else aside from this project, which we will try our best to complete at the aforementioned dates.Some setbacks (out of our hands) may include the level of funding we receive versus the level we need to develop our app into something competitive (not only competent). School work should not interfere with much because ensuring your money translates into tangible results IS our #1 priority.--Want to learn even more?

for their generosity.<br/><br/>4/21/2015<br/>Eight days into the campaign and we're nearly at 1/3 of our goal.  Ten donors nearly averaged $50 each.  Every contribution helps no matter if it's small

good.<br/><br/>4/28/2015<br/>Thanks to all who have donated.  Today we officially passed the 1/3 mark with 2 new donations.  To those of you considering a donation, please do so.  Even a $5 donation is important and the materials it can buy will go directly to the kids of Maya Center.  This is the first step of what I hope will be an ongoing effort to help the school at Maya Center.  I have been working on an idea for a computer lab for the school to prepare the students for the time they enter high school.  The success of the current campaign will set the course of future fundraising projects for Maya Center.  Please help if you can.<br/><br/>6/4/2015<br/>Nine days left and still a ways to go.  The campaign has been quiet for a few weeks but following an update we've had a spike in donations today and are finally over 50%.  Thanks to everyone who donated and to those passing along the word.  Every donation buys something for these kids.  Thanks so much.</p><p> </p><p>12/24/2016</p><p>Incredibly it was only two weeks ago that the supplies finally got in the hands of the kids.  By the time we received all the materials and got them ready to ship to Texas it was mid-August 2014;  they arrived in Texas by the end of August.  All was well but the pallet with the supplies missed the next shipment to Belize.  It was forwarded to a warehouse in Mobile, AL and was there until October 2016 when it was loaded into a container and left for Belize.  The supplies arrived in Belize City around the 6th of December, were picked up by our friends from

            From the first character in her childhood, an etymological picture sketched by her father, Hsiao-ying has been enchanted by the fantastic world of ideograms. Not surprisingly, she chose to study Chinese language and literature at university. After several years teaching Chinese literature in Taiwan, Hsiao-ying went on to further studies in England. She first pursued Museum Education as a means to facilitate voluntary learning, and then looked deeper into Cross-cultural Communication, so essential for the globe village we now live in. Along these lines, once she arrived England, she was blessed with a career opportunity that allowed her to put these points into practice - teaching Chinese as a foreign language.
        </p>
<p>
            As such, she counts herself as being very lucky to promote a greater understanding of world language and culture.

<p><b>Dr. Jason Xiong, Computer Scientist, NY, USA</b></p>
<p>Dr. Xiong is a veteran computer scientist who is always passionate about using information technology to make a positive impact on society. He believes that technology should improve people around the world to freely communicate with each other and truly appreciate the value of and differences between various cultures. He fell in love with the Beeline Chinese methodology the moment he experienced it himself, as he saw Beeline Chinese not only make learning Chinese easy and fun, but also help people understanding Chinese culture better and deeper. Therefore, he is determined to do his part to make the Beeline Chinese way of learning Chinese accessible to everyone.</p>

<b>Dr. Shao-Tzu Chen, Lecturer in Chinese Philology, Taiwan</b>
</p>
<p>
            Dr. Chen is a Chinese philologist. Having completed a bachelor degree in Chinese language and literature, she spent ten years pursuing her M.A. and Ph.D. in Chinese philology. She became an assistant professor and, since then, has lectured in her favorite subject. Shao-Tzu is a shy, reserved but amiable person. However, she is always ardent and tough in questioning doubts and clearing up confusion in her philological research.
        </p>
<p>
            Beeline Chinese has certainly benefited tremendously from Shao-Tzu’s most rigorous and thorough research.

<b>
                Dr. Anthony Rifkin, Developmental &amp; Neuropsychologist, NY, USA
            </b>
</p>
<p>Dr. Rifkin has a keen interest in how people’s psychology and language work together. The very special etymological work shared in Beeline Chinese gets at the very core of how we use language to think. And it does so in the most fascinating way – as with Beeline Chinese, we get to see how those first language users in ancient times were ‘thinking’, and how that’s wholly related to our own thinking today! Getting to work with the folks at Beeline Chinese has therefore been a rich experience for Dr. Rifkin, which he’s thankful for, as it has interfaced with both his research in how we categorize, as well as his clinical work with language-challenged individuals, all of whom are going to love using Beeline Chinese themselves! </p>

<p>The Beeline Chinese method therefore not only provides a means for easy absorption, but can also lay a foundation for appreciating Chinese literary classics, and comprehending academic concepts.

They could even complete their own professional studies in Chinese, as in their own native language.</p>
<p><b><b>Most importantly</b>, Beeline Chinese will help you to learn Chinese, 1 character at a time – as you’ll be able to master the recognition of 1 character in just 1 minute.</b></p>

<p><b>Oh! I get it now!</b></p>
<p>
            I often hear exclamations like these from my students, when I present them with the Chinese characters, using Beeline Chinese.
        </p>
<p>
            I used to dread teaching this reading and writing to my American students. It was just too hard. Even for Chinese kids, they hated having to memorize the characters by copying. But it doesn’t have to be that way anymore!
        </p>
<p>
            With Beeline Chinese, reading and writing the Chinese characters became my student’s favorite part of the lesson, no matter if they were 5 years old or adults. And once they learned the characters, it stays with them. The sounds may then be tricky, but they remember the meaning of each character, so they have something to attach the sounds too.
        </p>
<p>
            Beeline Chinese materials help students understand the characters by sharing the clues behind each character, connecting it to a history 5,000 years old, showing the philosophy, history, artefacts, and science of those times, and in that, how they used to live and think.
        </p>
<p>
            Lesson after lesson, each of my students are fascinated by the characters. Some of the characters are very poetic, with beautiful imagery, like the verb, 是, depicting a person walking at dawn, looking at the sun rising, and at his shadow behind him, his own existence and the existence of everything suddenly becoming so palpable.
        </p>
<p>
            Beeline Chinese is going to revolutionize learning Chinese. You will never look at the characters the same way again.
        </p>

<b>Beeline Chinese is fun and saves me a lot of time.</b>
<b></b><br/>
<p>
            All my father’s family members are English but my mother is Chinese, she is also a Chinese teacher. Luckily I have had the opportunities to go to China every year since I was little. So you can imagine that my Chinese is not too bad in terms of having Chinese lessons twice a week during the school time. It still involved a lot of hard work until my mum introduced me to the Beeline Chinese. I wouldn’t really say that my Chinese has been improved tremendously since, but I really enjoy learning on Beeline Chinese, it’s fun and saving me a lot of time as well as improving my range of Chinese vocabulary. I can then use the spare time to learn many other things such as saxophone and piano as well as playing with my friends.

</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>We’ve completed the research for all 6,000+ Chinese characters. We’ve also determined the method for arriving at appropriate pictures, and the way to present the various materials that make the learning process easy, effective, and fun. And we’ve compiled all of this content for the first 300 characters for two forthcoming products: the Beeline Chinese Dictionary and the Beeline Chinese Lesson App.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Beeline Chinese Dictionary</h3>
<span style=""color:#808080;"">An intuitive Chinese-English dictionary for all Chinese learners and teachers</span>
<p>
            While acquiring Chinese words is the vital first step to communication, learning Chinese has been greatly hampered by the lack of a good dictionary - till now.
        </p>
<p>
            Beeline Chinese utilizes an approach that makes searching for target words far easier. Our multi-index system even enables people who have no prior experience to start their search right away. <br/>

<p>
            The Beeline Chinese Lesson App is a great way for individuals to learn Chinese at their own pace. Characters have been carefully chosen for their arrangement together in lessons, and are presented in a convenient and intuitive interface.
        </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
            The interface smoothly integrates learning with reading, listening, handwriting, exercises, flashcards, and notes, each at the right level. 
        </p>
<p>The App also contains a handwriting interface that makes learning to write Chinese characters easy and fun. It includes features such as exercises with three levels that help one to develop one’s writing skill, step by step. An immediate scoring of one’s handwriting provides fast feedback for one’s learning. And the App allows easy access to one’s history and progress, to see how one is doing.</p>

<b>We are now seeking worldwide support on Indiegogo, releasing Beeline Chinese with the first 300 words of the Beeline Chinese course.</b><br/> <br/>
</p>
<p>
            Although Beeline Chinese will continue to grow and improve, we’ve completed all the essential research, and both the structure and the content of the program are now in place. <b>Our appeal here</b> is therefore to raise the money we need to complete the pictures and animations, and adapt the program for different digital platforms, to fully bring it the world.</p>
<p>
            We've been developing the project with the help of volunteer professionals, but we now need to expand the team to produce all of the content. Our plan is to complete the presentation of the first 1,200 characters in three months; and continue to produce the rest of 6,000+ characters, as presented in the TIME LINE in the section below (see June, 2016 there, and up!)<br/>
</p>
<p>
            To this end, WE'RE HOPING TO RAISE $100,000 (US)

<p>Beeline Chinese was developed over two generations: Hsiao-ying’s parents and Hsiao-ying. Both Hsiao-ying’s parents were educators responsible for setting up modern state schools in their home province in China during the 1930s. At home, they taught their children Chinese by revealing the etymological images of each word. When Hsiao-ying became a teacher, and taught Chinese language and literature, she used the same method and got to see how successful it was. Later Hsiao-ying went to England for her further studies and kept improving the method for both Chinese native and English speaking communities, working on the whole in terms of etymological analyses, and organizing it into the types of learning materials you see here.</p>
<p>Since the method was so well received, Hsiao-ying decided to build the full framework for Beeline Chinese online, in order to share this method with anyone who wants to learn Chinese. Over the last ten years, Hsiao-ying has been very lucky to have the constant support from so many of her colleagues, students and their parents. To her, they are the primary source for the birth of Beeline Chinese.</p>

Each word is presented through an animation. A picture is shown, a sound is heard, the character’s stroke sequence is shown, and an English translation and interpretation are provided. 




The images are important as they show the meaning of a word and what each stroke represents – as Chinese characters are ‘pictograms’!


Even our modern images are based on expert research of Chinese paleography – relating the ancient Chinese characters to what we know.



References to Chinese culture that contribute to the meaning of words are included too.




Words with shared visual elements are identified and presented together to pinpoint those elements, and promote the understanding and retention of those words.




… and words are linked thematically within pictures representing actual contexts, to enable learners to understand the words’ overlapping meanings, and more quickly grasp new vocabulary.







                BEELINE CHINESE ATTENDS TO FOUR ESSENTIAL ASPECTS
            






            A team of four professionals have laid the plan for the Beeline Chinese:
        
1. Teaching via audio and visual aids
2. The structural underpinnings of the Chinese language
3. Cross-cultural communication 
4. Developmental psychology and learning




Dr. Hsiao-ying Tseng, Chinese language learning program designer, NY, USA

Along these lines, once she arrived England, she was blessed with a career opportunity that allowed her to put these points into practice - teaching Chinese as a foreign language.

            In Chinese, there are no alphabetic letters. Chinese words are made out of characters, which might look strange to an English reader.
        


However, Chinese characters are actually pictures of what they represent.


Some Chinese words are expressed by a single character (like those you just saw on the screen), while others are expressed by combinations of characters.

So we include the exercise program for practicing the writing in the lessons App, as an additional option. 
Knowing the structure of a language allows one to learn it efficiently
Starting from characters, we analyze the patterns of Chinese expressions and sentences, so that the learners will know how to use the language straightaway.
A team of Chinese language experts, led by Dr. Chen, have done systematic paleographic research, using the most authoritative sources on the history and teaching of Chinese characters, and have converted the information into a format accessible by even young beginners.

For years, both aspects have been well received and continuously refined, based on users’ feedback.
The Beeline Chinese method therefore not only provides a means for easy absorption, but can also lay a foundation for appreciating Chinese literary classics, and comprehending academic concepts. A successful Beeline student will be able to understand subject matter such as found in the Tao Te Ching (道德經) and the theories behind Chinese traditional medicine. They could even complete their own professional studies in Chinese, as in their own native language.
Most importantly, Beeline Chinese will help you to learn Chinese, 1 character at a time – as you’ll be able to master the recognition of 1 character in just 1 minute.
… and with a bit more practice, you’ll know how to use that word! 



USERS' TESTIMONY








Oh! I get it now!

            I often hear exclamations like these from my students, when I present them with the Chinese characters, using Beeline Chinese.
        

            I used to dread teaching this reading and writing to my American students. It was just too hard. Even for Chinese kids, they hated having to memorize the characters by copying. But it doesn’t have to be that way anymore!
        

            With Beeline Chinese, reading and writing the Chinese characters became my student’s favorite part of the lesson, no matter if they were 5 years old or adults. And once they learned the characters, it stays with them. The sounds may then be tricky, but they remember the meaning of each character, so they have something to attach the sounds too.
        

            Beeline Chinese materials help students understand the characters by sharing the clues behind each character, connecting it to a history 5,000 years old, showing the philosophy, history, artefacts, and science of those times, and in that, how they used to live and think.
        

            Lesson after lesson, each of my students are fascinated by the characters. Some of the characters are very poetic, with beautiful imagery, like the verb, 是, depicting a person walking at dawn, looking at the sun rising, and at his shadow behind him, his own existence and the existence of everything suddenly becoming so palpable.
        

            Beeline Chinese is going to revolutionize learning Chinese. You will never look at the characters the same way again.
        


Beeline Chinese is fun and saves me a lot of time.


            All my father’s family members are English but my mother is Chinese, she is also a Chinese teacher. Luckily I have had the opportunities to go to China every year since I was little. So you can imagine that my Chinese is not too bad in terms of having Chinese lessons twice a week during the school time. It still involved a lot of hard work until my mum introduced me to the Beeline Chinese. I wouldn’t really say that my Chinese has been improved tremendously since, but I really enjoy learning on Beeline Chinese, it’s fun and saving me a lot of time as well as improving my range of Chinese vocabulary. I can then use the spare time to learn many other things such as saxophone and piano as well as playing with my friends.
        

 


WHAT WE’VE COMPLETED





We’ve completed the research for all 6,000+ Chinese characters. We’ve also determined the method for arriving at appropriate pictures, and the way to present the various materials that make the learning process easy, effective, and fun. And we’ve compiled all of this content for the first 300 characters for two forthcoming products: the Beeline Chinese Dictionary and the Beeline Chinese Lesson App.

Beeline Chinese Dictionary
An intuitive Chinese-English dictionary for all Chinese learners and teachers

            While acquiring Chinese words is the vital first step to communication, learning Chinese has been greatly hampered by the lack of a good dictionary - till now.
        

            Beeline Chinese utilizes an approach that makes searching for target words far easier. Our multi-index system even enables people who have no prior experience to start their search right away. 

Core features of Beeline Chinese Dictionay:


VARIOUS WAYS TO FIND A WORD

Quick Search
Simply key in any trace you know of the target word







Pictorial & Categorized
Find the target word from categorized pictures







Component Index
Find a word by click one of its elements

SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE SCREEN SIZES AND DEVICES




Beeline Chinese Lesson App
An App for individuals to learn through lessons

            The Beeline Chinese Lesson App is a great way for individuals to learn Chinese at their own pace. Characters have been carefully chosen for their arrangement together in lessons, and are presented in a convenient and intuitive interface.
        
 

            The interface smoothly integrates learning with reading, listening, handwriting, exercises, flashcards, and notes, each at the right level. 
        
The App also contains a handwriting interface that makes learning to write Chinese characters easy and fun. It includes features such as exercises with three levels that help one to develop one’s writing skill, step by step. An immediate scoring of one’s handwriting provides fast feedback for one’s learning. And the App allows easy access to one’s history and progress, to see how one is doing.



WHY WE'RE CROWDFUNDING


We are now seeking worldwide support on Indiegogo, releasing Beeline Chinese with the first 300 words of the Beeline Chinese course. 


            Although Beeline Chinese will continue to grow and improve, we’ve completed all the essential research, and both the structure and the content of the program are now in place. Our appeal here is therefore to raise the money we need to complete the pictures and animations, and adapt the program for different digital platforms, to fully bring it the world.

            We've been developing the project with the help of volunteer professionals, but we now need to expand the team to produce all of the content. Our plan is to complete the presentation of the first 1,200 characters in three months; and continue to produce the rest of 6,000+ characters, as presented in the TIME LINE in the section below (see June, 2016 there, and up!)


            To this end, WE'RE HOPING TO RAISE $100,000 (US)
        



TIME LINE









THE TEAM









OUR STORY



Beeline Chinese was developed over two generations: Hsiao-ying’s parents and Hsiao-ying. Both Hsiao-ying’s parents were educators responsible for setting up modern state schools in their home province in China during the 1930s. At home, they taught their children Chinese by revealing the etymological images of each word. When Hsiao-ying became a teacher, and taught Chinese language and literature, she used the same method and got to see how successful it was. Later Hsiao-ying went to England for her further studies and kept improving the method for both Chinese native and English speaking communities, working on the whole in terms of etymological analyses, and organizing it into the types of learning materials you see here.
Since the method was so well received, Hsiao-ying decided to build the full framework for Beeline Chinese online, in order to share this method with anyone who wants to learn Chinese. Over the last ten years, Hsiao-ying has been very lucky to have the constant support from so many of her colleagues, students and their parents. To her, they are the primary source for the birth of Beeline Chinese.

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>We are middle school students at Lesher International Baccalaureate (IB) World Middle School in Fort Collins, Colorado.  We applied for and were accepted into an Extended Learning Opportunity focused on sustainability.  One of the many treats we experience as a part of the service learning class is a trip to Catalina Environmental Leadership Program (CELP) in California from November 11 -16, 2016.

<h3>Fund my Journey</h3>
<p>I have been looking for an experiential leadership development experience - and I think I found the perfect one, the <a href=""http://millennialtrain.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Millennial Trains Project (MTP)</a>, an award-winning non-profit that leads crowd-funded transcontinental train journeys for diverse groups of young innovators to explore America’s new frontiers, grow as leaders, and launch projects that benefit and inspire their communities.</p>
<p>Participants get on board by pitching a project they want to advance across the communities where the train stops, and then race to crowdfund the cost of their ticket to ride.  My project proposal has been accepted, and now I need your help to raise $5,000 in the next month to secure my seat on the next journey.</p> </div> <div> <h3>MTP</h3>

As such, they will be tax-deductible. These funds help to underwrite the costs of the journey and its associated programming, transportation, and hospitality costs.  If I am not among the first 30 applicants to reach  my crowdfunding goal, none of my supporters will be charged.</p>

</div></div>","About Me I'm a young professional and civic engagement designer in Columbus.  In my community I manage member and community affairs for the Columbus Partnership, a non-profit CEO organization; run the Central Ohio Leadership Academy (COLA), our region's premier high school leadership development experience; and serve as Chair for the Create Columbus Commission, a millennial policy and grant making body appointed by the Mayor and Council President.  I am a pragmatic, result-driven, big picture thinker who endeavors to create structural support systems that drive continual improvements that have a wide-ranging impact.

Fund my Journey
I have been looking for an experiential leadership development experience - and I think I found the perfect one, the Millennial Trains Project (MTP), an award-winning non-profit that leads crowd-funded transcontinental train journeys for diverse groups of young innovators to explore America’s new frontiers, grow as leaders, and launch projects that benefit and inspire their communities.
Participants get on board by pitching a project they want to advance across the communities where the train stops, and then race to crowdfund the cost of their ticket to ride.  My project proposal has been accepted, and now I need your help to raise $5,000 in the next month to secure my seat on the next journey.   MTP

If my campaign is among the first 30 to reach its $5,000 goal, all funds raised will go to MTP, which is a 501(c)3 organization. As such, they will be tax-deductible. These funds help to underwrite the costs of the journey and its associated programming, transportation, and hospitality costs.  If I am not among the first 30 applicants to reach  my crowdfunding goal, none of my supporters will be charged.
Here is the experience you will be funding:


We travel in a caravan of vintage rail cars -- it is an incubator of ideas and symbol of progress powered by millennial aspirations and a world-class coalition of partners.  



On the train there are daily purpose-based leadership development sessions in partnership withCity Year and multiple world-class design-thinking workshops in partnership with IDEO. 
The on-train chef prepares meals with ingredients sourced from local farmers and food purveyors in each city.
This year's journeys are a week long and we'll visit 5 cities.  In each city where we stop, MTP establishes a local hub (usually a creative design studio or startup space) where we will attend morning workshops led by local leaders. Here, we learn about local innovation and where the city is headed from a creative development perspective.  I then will get 5 to 6 hours in each MTP destination to advance a project that benefits, serves and inspires others. 
The train will be full with ambitious, eager, entrepreneurial, and community minded peers from around the country!  I can't wait to meet my kindred spirits :).

<p> </p>
<p>I have known Astou for over a decade as our dance teacher and I am writing because Astou is going through a difficult time and needs our help. </p>
<p>She is between homes and her work permit is currently ""on hold."" While she has a lawyer helping her, she is unable to apply for a job at this time.</p>
<p>Year after year, with a tenacity of spirit,  Astou has offered her enormous voice, energy and dance to the community and it's time to give back.</p>
<p>Despite long days of housecleaning (at a hotel where she worked for 10 years) and despite the physically demanding nature of her job, she has come to class to teach every week with a smile regardless.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine the courage and strength that has been required of Astou, who from Senegal has worked hard to make a livelihood in America all these years.</p>
<p>When she teaches every week, she has a brave demeanor, but when I spoke to Astou a few days ago I witnessed her suffering a huge burden of stress. She is currently relying on the kindness of friends to put her up.</p>
<p>While her lawyer sorts out her work documents, we hope to help her find a stable situation. All proceeds will go directly in support of a more permanent residence.  </p>
<p><span>Although it seems not to be the case right now, if she is able to live rent free in a good situation while this gets sorted out, </span>the funds will go to when she does find a good new home.</p>
<p>In the meantime we are hoping to provide first month, last and security.</p>
<p>$10, $20 or $50 can go a long way to meet this short term goal of her renting in a home in the near future. </p>
<p>As there are also friends working on her case, we are doing this in good faith that she will be able to work in this country again soon and continue to give so much to this great community.</p>

<p><u><b>Help us raise $2,500 by December 27th to fund our training programs.</b></u></p>
<p><b>Our project start date is January 1, 2014 after what we hope will be a successful holiday season. We are not just asking you to donate money to our cause. We are asking you to support our artistry with a purchase of our work.</b></p>Our programs give opportunities for young artists to have a professional experience while still honing their craft.<br/><p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Bobby Fouther often called “Mr. Bobby” by my students, I am a visual and performing artist. I am a second-generation artist and native Oregonian. In my youth I was inspired by the wealth of artists and mentors in my life and the art that nurtured and surrounded me in my neighborhood. Some Portland, Oregon residents may remember the Albina Art Center of years gone by where many creative dreams like mine came to fruition.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create places for young people and their families to make high quality art in our community. We have been given an opportunity to continue our Open Door Art Gallery space on the accessible floor of a local alternative high school on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in NE Portland and the Kemba Shannon Dance Center in the North Portland, Kenton area. Both areas are in great need and painfully underserved.</p>
<p>After 20 years of saving my supplies, garnering the support of my artistic friends and community and 2 years of running on a zero budget (translation: out of our pockets) I feel the time is right to ask for your support to help us continue high quality arts activities to underserved young people and their families in our community.</p>
<p><strong>For our 2014 first quarter project the funding goal is $2,500.</strong></p>
<p>Project costs include:</p>
<p>$ 1500 will go toward taking a small group of very talented teens to the International Conference on Blacks in Dance in Dallas, Texas in January. This opportunity will be monumental in the lives and careers of our young dancers. You can view a video(in the gallery on this site) of these young people hard at work to pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>$ 1000 will be used as scholarships for young artists in the performing and visual arts. This includes classes, workshops, supplies and training. Last year we supported our students with free voice lessons, dance classes, opportunities to participate in major gallery showings, theatre tickets and ensemble performances throughout the city.</p>
<p><strong>OUR OFFER TO YOU</strong></p>
<p>We are Artisans who create works to be treasured throughout life and from generation to generation. We have selected a series of art pieces as gifts to our donors As little as $ 1.00 will help support our efforts and provide the giver with a piece of art from us.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR GIFT TO US - </strong>will change the paths of many lives.</p>

<p>We provide the training and space for our students to develop their skills, practice and showcase their work. Your gift will insure our ability to provide a permanent, safe, nurturing and creative environment in a traditionally underserved area of our city.

<p>After years of going undiagnosed, Klaire underwent a <strong>Davis Dyslexia Programme</strong> to address her personal challenges with dyslexia. “To say that that experience made a difference is a serious understatement,” says Klaire. “It changed my life completely and gave me the tools to achieve things I could only dream of before.”</p>

The programme originated out of Davis’ own experience of severe dyslexia and is now provided in over 30 languages and in more than 45 countries.

<p><span><span class=""fsl"">Dear everyone!<br/><br/> I'm Mari, a MA Social Anthropology student at SOAS. I created this page to invite you to support my field trip to Mongolia this summer! Many of you may know how difficult (impossible) it is to get funding for MA level fieldwork, I have looked and not found those grants. However, I feel the fieldwork is very much central to my project and future, hence I have decided to unite my first field trip with my first fundraising project. I welcome you to be part of it! <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class=""fsl"">The field trip would take me to Northern Mongolia, to a small group of reindeer herders called the <span><span class=""fsl""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">Dukha. Due to being nomadic and shamanistic - exotic - they have become a hotspot in Mongolian tourism. This has led to establishing a tourist oriented Reindeer Festival. I will be attending the event with the Dukha. The Reindeer Festival creates a new type of migratory route for the Dukha and their reindeer down from the mountains where they normally spend their summers <span><span class=""fsl""><span><span class=""fsl""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">to Tsagaannuur village</span></span></span></span></span>. I want to prepare for the event with the reindeer herders, participate in the festival and travel back to their summer pastures with them after the event. The project is to shed light on tourism's possible impacts on nomadic migration in this marginal part of the world. <br/></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Dear everyone! I'm Mari, a MA Social Anthropology student at SOAS. I created this page to invite you to support my field trip to Mongolia this summer! Many of you may know how difficult (impossible) it is to get funding for MA level fieldwork, I have looked and not found those grants. However, I feel the fieldwork is very much central to my project and future, hence I have decided to unite my first field trip with my first fundraising project. I welcome you to be part of it! 
The field trip would take me to Northern Mongolia, to a small group of reindeer herders called the Dukha. Due to being nomadic and shamanistic - exotic - they have become a hotspot in Mongolian tourism. This has led to establishing a tourist oriented Reindeer Festival. I will be attending the event with the Dukha. The Reindeer Festival creates a new type of migratory route for the Dukha and their reindeer down from the mountains where they normally spend their summers to Tsagaannuur village. I want to prepare for the event with the reindeer herders, participate in the festival and travel back to their summer pastures with them after the event. The project is to shed light on tourism's possible impacts on nomadic migration in this marginal part of the world. 
To be able to take up this field work I'm trying to raise £1326. This would cover all the costs from the moment I take off on June 13th until my return to London on July 11th. It does not include Mongolian inflation rate but should ofterwise be fairly accurate. Please see the full budget below. 
I am extremely grateful for any contributions you are able to make towards sending me to Mongolia. Your participation in this project will not be forgotten!
Please see http://marimongolia.wordpress.com/ for updates and progress concerningthis project.

<p><strong>What’s Our Purpose</strong> Simply put, we’re raising money! The Jack Story is a well written Screenplay that has touch to Hearts and Souls of many and should be seen on the big screen by many. On October 1st, Tomel sent an email to his Cast and Crew that despite a strong screenplay, a stellar cast, and rave reviews, the film would be put on hold - because there was not enough funding. We thought that since the Story itself is so unique, why should the funding come traditionally? We submit that the funds for this movie should come from the people who the Story actually impacts. It should come from the millions people whom the Story will help Save the Lives of. It should come from friends, families with youth, teens and adults and Companies that support new direction for Youth, Safety, Drugs, and Guns awareness. We are raising $50,000 to help in developing cost to get the actual budget needed to start production and January or February 2013. To make the impact needed to reach the thousands, we need to make a quality film that can compete with the todays market..... Be apart of something that will make a HUGE difference....</p>
<p><strong>Why We’re Doing It</strong> I’m just a average guy who decided to take a chance, a leap of Faith. When the Cast and Crew heard the news about the film being halted, we thought to ourselves; “There’s got to be another way.” We dreamed big and now here we are. We know this is possible. The Jack Story has reached a massive amount of people, the script has SAVED a LIFE and if it were to become a film, it would SAVE even more LIVES. Most importantly, we believe that this is going to be an incredible life changing story for many, mostly our single parents and youth. Think about it… investors back out, the movie's put on hold, then the family, friends, there friends, friends, families, organizations, companies step up and say; “No, we will HELP fund this movie.” That is a story we want to be a part of. Will you join us? Be apart of a great Film about CHANGE and REDEMPTION.</p>
<h3><strong>-- FAQs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Any Hollywood Actors Committed?</strong> ABSOLUTELY! The Actors that have read the Script are: Lou Gosset Jr., Leon Robinson, Charles S. Dutton, Vivica Fox, Brian McNight, Christian Keyes, Richard Tyson, Adrian Kali Turner, Cuba Goodings Jr. Clifton Powell, Cisco Reyes and several others. Some are fully committed, some will commit upon funding.. Can you imagine having this cast be apart of this Project.... With your help it's very possible.</p>
<p><strong>When exactly is “The Big Night?”</strong> The Big Night in HOLLYWOOD has yet to be scheduled, mainly because parts of the movie schedule itself are still up in the air. You can count on it being sometime in May or June 2013, weeks before the theatrical release of the movie. We promise we will give you a heads up WAY in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Can I Gift An Incentive?</strong> YES, Great idea. If you would like to donate to the film but give the reward to someone as a gift, go through all the normal process of making a donation in your name. For billing purposes, this action must be in your name. After our deadline, we will send a message to you on Indiegogo. (It will be forwarded to the email address you provided) We will request things like your t-shirt size and address from you at that time. Please reply with the entire person’s information that is to receive the reward. We will make sure they are the person who receives the reward.</p>
<p><strong>How will you get my number? How will you get my T-shirt size?</strong> We will be going through all the people who have donated to request their phone number. If you have donated, you will get a message from us pretty soon. Please reply. We hate rejection, and he wants to thank you. Please bear with us though, as we have thousands of phone calls to make. Once we cross our deadline we will immediately begin manufacturing and completing incentives for everyone involved. You will get a message from us requesting information from you like your T-shirt size, address, etc. At that time, please reply to us as soon as possible so that we can complete your incentive.</p>
<p><strong>Can I increase my pledge once it’s been made?</strong> YES! Once you donate to our campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount. To do so, go to Indiegogo and sign in. If you go to our campaign page, the green “Back This Project” button has been replaced with a blue “Manage Your Donation” button. Click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive.</p>
<p><strong>Can we exceed the goal?</strong> YES! What an amazing problem to have. Indiegogo will allow as much money as is given before the deadline. Maybe that would mean a more widespread theater release, or more unique physical copy packaging. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>How do we contact you?</strong> Glad you asked! You can contact us directly at thejackstory@yahoo.com. We check it everyday. We will get back to you. We promise!</p>
<p><strong>Is The Jack Story Project a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization?</strong> Unfortunately neither this movement nor The Jack Story is set up as a non-profit. Donations are raw gifts. Non-tax deductible.</p>
<p><strong>If I donate, when can I redeem the incentive?</strong> All incentives, big and small, will only happen if our goal is met. If we do meet our goal, immediately after our filming and post production we will start to manufacture and shipping out all products directly to you. It will be our priority to schedule the more personal incentives as soon as possible. You will hear from us. (More on this as we get closer to our deadline)</p>
<p><strong>Who does the money go to?</strong> Every penny (minus the fees for Indiegogo’s involvement) will go directly to Director Tomel Griggs movie budget escrow account - i.e. your money goes directly to the funding of this film.</p>
<p><strong>$50,000 seems like a low number for a developement budget. Doesn’t it?</strong> You are correct. Fortunately, we’ve have so many support that have come through for us, helping at no to low cost in area that would cost a huge amount of funding. The $50,000 figure is merely to help with Securing Hollywood Actors Contracts, Legal paper work, Casting, Attorney retainer  fee and some crew expensive and miscellaneous items for developement. Our goal is imperative for the film to be a reality and realistic. We would absolutely love to raise more. Please help this Life changing Project. We'd LOVE to raise enough to shoot the entire movie, YES!</p>

My mother insisted that college is a MUST and that she would ""make a way out of no way to send me"".As a Black male, the statistics were already against me, however I was taught from a young age that three elements would almost guarantee my success -- a driver's license, establishing and building good credit, and an education. My mother raised me as a single parent for 11 years until she was married to my step-father, who would finally complete our family unit. My biological father has been incarcerated for 15 of the 19 years of my life, and is currently serving out a twelve year sentence until his release in 2018. Your assistance would help pay off the total cost of tuition, undergraduate housing, books, uniforms and culinary supplies not covered by my Student Loans, grants and scholarships that have already been applied. The full annual tuition at Johnson & Wales is $32,000 per year as an out-of-state student.""I Just Want To Be Successful"", and with your help, I will.Jared",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I first arrived in Nicaragua in August 2008 for a six-week stint writing travel guides for a travel-writing publication based out of Ecuador. What I experienced while here, especially in the town of San Juan del Sur, touched me so deeply that I never left. I decided to stay and focus all of my energy on providing much-needed education to a well-deserving community who are ready and willing to work hard for opportunity.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, San Juan del Sur was just a small fisherman village. The majority of fishermen traditionally reside in the neighborhood <em>Barrio La Planta</em>, located just behind the port. As tourism rapidly grew, and the town began to gain notice for its beautiful beaches and laid back, friendly culture, many fishermen fishing for national companies lost their jobs to better-funded private companies and tour businesses. With little to no training in other fields and minimal education, residents of the community became increasingly impoverished in spite of the financial boom that the town has been experiencing.</p>
<p>When I arrived in San Juan del Sur, I stayed with a family in the Barrio La Planta. They looked after me with hospitality and generosity, sharing the little food they had, giving me advice, and offering their home to me. The experience was so humbling that I wanted to share something with them.  They suggested that I teach them English so they could begin to access all of the new opportunities the blossoming tourism industry had to offer. I agreed and posted a sign on my door that said <em>“Free English Classes. Sign Up Here”</em>. What started with ten children during the day and ten adults at night quickly grew to sixty children and twenty adults in just two months.</p>
<p>Four years later, we have hundreds of children attending the Barrio Planta Project, and have expanded programming to include dance, art, theater, computers, recreational activities and other events. I could never have guessed that an informal act of gratitude would change my life so dramatically. I am now the Executive Director of the Barrio Planta Project, a 501c3 and NGO that continues to grow alongside the community, providing free supplementary education for whoever wants to attend.</p>
<h2>Our Winter Creative Arts Workshop</h2>
<p>January is a very important month for us. Every year for five weeks from the beginning of January until mid-February, our students participate in our Winter Workshop: an intensive creative arts workshop culminating in a performance for the entire community. Past workshops include a theater workshop, a hip-hop workshop, and a rock &amp; roll workshop. This year, the workshop will be focused on the production of the musical Grease. The students will do everything from set and costume design, production, and singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many children are not able to participate in our year-round programming. Due to their economic situations, they often lack the resources to dedicate time outside of school to additional activities. Often, when something happens in the family like the birth of a sibling or a new job for their parents, they have to withdraw from classes in order to do household chores and take care of their younger relatives. We call these students our <em>safety-net</em> students. Many of our safety net students live in Barrio La Planta, the neighborhood that inspired me to start the project in the first place.</p>
<p> Although our safety net kids often miss too much class to continue with year-round English, we enroll them again every year, hoping for the best. Even though they often times can’t keep their commitments, they are still eager to participate somehow. Because the Winter Workshop is held while school is on break, we are able to reach most of our safety net kids during this time, and they are given priority in participation. Many of these students look forward to this workshop all year and leave with new skills, discovered talents, and enhanced confidence to start of the New Year. This year the performance of Grease will be held on Saturday February 9<sup>th</sup>, and again on Saturday February 23<sup>rd</sup> at San Juan del Sur’s 5<sup>th</sup> annual Earthship Pitaya Festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need</span></strong></h2>
<p>The Barrio Planta Project’s goal is to raise $10,000 by Saturday January 19<sup>th</sup>. This gives us the time we need to do bank transfers and access the funds in order to make the necessary investments in presentation materials such as cool fifties clothes, set design equipment, sound, lighting, student-designed playbills and other expenses. We also have some visitors coming from the States at the end of January who will be filming the workshop and can bring materials from there as well.</p>
<p>The money raised also goes to supporting our general operating expenses for the months of January and February and making investments in our upcoming school year. This will give us more time to focus on the workshop, which each of our five staff members participates in, directing our <em>non-teaching</em> time on securing long-term funding and launching our 2013 school year off with a bang. No gift is too large or too small. All of your contributions make a difference.</p>
<p>What happens if we don’t reach our goal? We will survive! We are dedicated to providing free education in Nicaragua, and will continue to work hard to towards this goal, regardless of setbacks.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></strong></h2>
<p>I started BPP with a $50.00 donation from a family friend in the small local library with no resources, no experience and no plan. What began as a simple gesture of gratitude suddenly took on a life of its own, fueled by the enthusiasm of our growing student body and facilitated by hundreds of generous donors and volunteers</p>
<p>The Barrio Planta Project has been featured in numerous national publications in Nicaragua, the U.S. and even Norway as well as made guest appearances on national television. The Ministry of Tourism (INTUR) as well as the President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, has officially endorsed us. BPP has renovated a previously unused school building and developed three classrooms and one office. We have developed and personalized five levels of school age English as a Second Language Curriculum, two pre-school levels and three adult levels, including a conversational level.  </p>
<p>On February 29<sup>th</sup>, 2013, we will have our four-year anniversary.</p>
<p>While there are so many things we have accomplished, there still remains much more to do. We look forward to expanding our programming and possibly taking the project into other communities in Nicaragua. Most importantly, we want to continue to provide an enriching environment for our students.</p>
<p>“At the Barrio Planta Project, we take advantage of our talents and our abilities, because we are capable of anything we put our minds to,” says student Israel Pizarro, age 14.</p>

<h3>What I need help with </h3>
<p>I have enrolled in college full-time while being Active Duty, perusing my degree in marketing online with <a href=""http://www.umuc.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UMUC.</a> I also love education, technology and entrepreneurship. Along with some wonderful people, I started a company, <a href=""http://www.readerup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ReaderUp INC</a>.

Although, some may think being the C.E.O. of a company is all sugar and candy, I can assure you it's the toughest part of my day. We're still in the development process so it is really putting food on the table.</p>
<p>However, I have followed my passion and savvies with business, technology, education, and all things Internet related to start a career in <strong>Web Analytics. </strong>I am passionate about helping businesses, foundations, and individuals with there online presence with the use of data. Everything I have learned has been self-taught so far. I want to receive some form of formal education. This new field doesn't offer a lot of options, which really limits my use of Military tuition programs. I have been researching and talking with leaders and determined the best place for m to get this education will be at the <strong><a href=""http://cstudies.ubc.ca/web-analytics-intelligence/award-of-achievement-in-digital-analytics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of British Columbia (UBC) Award of Achievement in digital Analytics</a> .</strong><strong> </strong>This program is online and starts every month. Its not covered by my Military G.I. Bill or tuition assistance.</p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Like Mentioned above, my earned Military tuition programs will not cover this program due to it being so new and also from an institution from another country. Hendrix, Cassie and I would appreciate all the help we can get. We have sacrificed so much in the last 4 years while serving in the Navy to make sure we can all get up the next day and be able to see our loved ones and have the freedom that is so sought out from people of other countries. You can help out by donating to help me pay for this certification program and jumpstart my career, I will take care of the rest. If you cannot give, you can help out by spreading the word to others, and lending any type of support you may have to offer. </p>
<h3>What I can do for you</h3>
<p>I don't have much to give besides my appreciation, however, my son Hendrix is the creative type. He loves to doodle and write and he's only 2! Hendrix makes custom cards for special occasions and his art is very sought after in the market. You'll recieve the gift of his finest creations, custom to you. Its very heart warming, trust me. </p>
<p>I will also have some things from the military for the Super American out there or for anyone who shows pride for the men and women who truly sacrifice it all for our freedoms. Check the rewards section out. </p>

<div>Every year my son Andrew is invited to participate the Academic Talent Search (ATS) program at Sacramento State University! ATS is a program started nearly 30 years ago to bring challenging summer classes to gifted children in the northern california area. Classes range from cooking and cartooning to mathematics and chemistry. Andrew has been participating in ATS since 4th grade. The week he spends at Sac State every summer are some of the best weeks of his life! Andrew has an incredible interest in learning, particularly in science and engineering.  Last year due to time and financial restraints we were unable to attend and I want to make sure that doesn't happen this summer! So I am asking now for you to help finance $1500 so we can ensure Andrew makes it this year! Each class ranges from $150-$420, with most of the classes in Andrew field of interest being on the higher end of the scale ;-) I want to ensure we have enough to cover transportation costs and registration for 2-3 classes. Every $1.00 counts so thank you for any donation! Check out the link below to learn more about the program!</div>

Classes range from cooking and cartooning to mathematics and chemistry. Andrew has been participating in ATS since 4th grade. The week he spends at Sac State every summer are some of the best weeks of his life! Andrew has an incredible interest in learning, particularly in science and engineering.  Last year due to time and financial restraints we were unable to attend and I want to make sure that doesn't happen this summer! So I am asking now for you to help finance $1500 so we can ensure Andrew makes it this year! Each class ranges from $150-$420, with most of the classes in Andrew field of interest being on the higher end of the scale ;-) I want to ensure we have enough to cover transportation costs and registration for 2-3 classes. Every $1.00 counts so thank you for any donation! Check out the link below to learn more about the program!

<h3>Why are we asking for support?</h3>
<p>We currently have courses on effective livestock management, extending the growing season for crops, basic dental hygiene, healthy sexual behavior, purification of water, and others. The people who have completed these courses have been surprised by the new information they learn and how it can improve their lives. We have already begun to see some significant impact from our courses.</p>
<p>We recently received a report from Tanzania that a rural community was learning from our course on healthy sexual behavior. Through taking the course they realized that FGM (female circumcision) is not healthy or beneficial. They have begun to change the practice, which carries with it myriad complications and health issues. FGM has been a major health issue in various communities througout the world and it is encouraging for us that our educational material is making a positive difference on the prevelance of such a brutal practice.</p>
<p>However, while we were meeting with community leaders throughout East Africa, one question was continually asked, ""do you have courses on micro-enterprise?"". Though it is on our list of courses to develop, we currently do not have a course on micro-business. Unfortunantly, developing new courses requires funds that we do not have. This is where you come in. <em>We need to develop a course on micro-enterprise and we need your help to do it.</em></p>
<h3><strong>The Numbers</strong></h3>
<p>Our Typical course is 14 sessions long. The numbers break down like this:</p>
<p>Cost of Production/session: $158<br/>Cost of Post-Production/session: $204<br/>Cost of Translation/session: $238<br/>Total Cost for 14 Sessions: $8,400<br/>Distribution Cost: $4000 (actual distribution costs are significantly higher, but this helps)<br/>Total Filming and Distribution Cost: $10,400<br/>Cost of Perks: $1,000 (postage, production of t-shirts, stickers, etc.)</p>
<p>Indiegogo Fee (9%): $936.00<br/>FirstGiving Fee (4%): $416.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total Campaign Funding Goal: $14,752.01 -- the penny is for good measure :)</p>
<p>It may seem high, but, when compared to the average cost of film production, the budget is incredibly low. The only reason we are able to film the courses on such a low budget is because our awesome volunteers donate so much time and talent into each course. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Not too long ago I was asked on a college survey whether I plan on studying abroad while attending the University of South Florida, St. Pete (USFSP). Study Abroad programs have always been appealing to me, but I never thought this was a realistic route for me so I never whole-heartedly researched any programs at my school. Because I only have a summer semester left until I am finished with my degree I thought that studying abroad now was even more unrealistic than before. Little did I know Universe had some different plans for me!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not too long after being asked if I plan on studying abroad and responding with a big fat NO, I was informed of a trip to Vietnam hosted by school, that my friend Le had actually went on last summer. I found the timing odd, but odd in a serendipitous way, I had to look into this program because it had come up twice in one week and I try to follow the signs I get in my life. The same week after already feeling suspicious about this trip, I was in an elevator that I don’t usually take on campus, there was a flyer for this trip to Vietnam that Le had been raving about! That was it, I was in…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le immediately made me an appointment to speak with Dr.  Biafora  the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and one of the head advisors for this program. When I arrived for my appointment Dean B spared no time in diving right into what this trip is about and what it means to me and how it will change my life. He pulled out a huge map of Vietnam, started naming places I had never heard of and pointing to locations all over the map. Despite having no idea what / where he was pointing to, his enthusiasm and passion for this program had me locked in. On my second visit with Dean B I felt comfortable in sharing with him the synchronicities that were popping up everywhere in my life pertaining to this journey (when I went to check on my passport I realized that it was issued to me on Aug. 13 (My late grandpa Buzz's B-day) and expires on Aug. 12 (My late Nana's B-Day) --If you know me, you know that I am a HUGE believer in signs/synchronicities/connection---so this was a HUGE nudge to go. While reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, in the middle of his chapter on ""ego"" he starts talking about VIETNAM! See the perfection?). His replies made me comfortable that I was in the right place at the right time and this trip is part of my destiny.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leaving our second meeting I was excited as hell and scared as hell… I had moments of fear based thoughts, when my mind told me I can’t make this happen and that it’s just too impossible, followed by moments of clarity and confidence. I have come to feel worthy and deserving of this trip. I am passionate about my journey in life. I practice being mindful and present throughout my day because I believe it keeps me growing in the right direction. This trip comes at the perfect time; this past year has been one of great losses, as well as extreme healing, and transformation. I am asking for your help in traveling to a country that I know very little about, a country with beauty and life. I am asking you to help me with this big/little dream of mine</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will arrive in Hanoi July 8th after traveling for 24 hours. When we arrive at our destination we will get settled into our hotels for the evening and spend the weekend in Hanoi. We then travel to Ha Long Bay, the beautiful place pictured above, where we will be exploring this little town and mingling with the locals. After our time here we take an overnight train ride to Vinh City where we will be staying on campus and paired with a Vietnamese student who will double as our tour guide and study buddy. I will be living and studying at Vinh University for 2 weeks. We will be engaging in hours of talk discussing our two cultures, similarities, differences, pros, cons, what we want to do about it, where we feel stuck, etc... The whole point of this trip is to discover who I am and where I fit into this great big world as a passionate, spiritual, resillient woman..</p>
<p> The breakdown of my trip:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$2,200.00- cost of Study Abroad Program. (I have paid for this)</p>
<p>$2,000.00- cost of plane trip. (Where your contributions will be used!)</p>

You can see in our updates what kind of education we offer our children. It goes beyond basic skills and survival. They thrive and breathe happiness, don't they?</p>
<p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
<p>My name is Muoy You. I am from Cambodia, home of the magnificent Angkor temples, exquisite Apsara dance but also the site of one of the most devastating genocides in history.</p>
<p>In 1975, the Khmer Rouge came to power and my country was ripped apart. Up to two million people were killed by the regime, among them my parents and siblings. A scholarship from the French Government saved my life - I was in France at the time. But I was forced to live in exile for 31 years, waiting for the chance to come home.</p>
<p>Now I am back in my country and my passion is to help children. Since education saved my life, this is the vehicle I have chosen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The school: <em>Seametrey Children’s Village</em></strong></p>
<p>I founded Seametrey Children’s Village, a Montessori school for children that come from all backgrounds and income levels. ""Seametrey"" stands for Freedom, Civilization and Love. In the school, poor and rich children work and play together and parents pay according to their income. We now have 104 students, aged from 2 to 22. The majority of them are poor.  Volunteers come from all over the world to help us and we have 10 children and five support staff who live under our roof.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we are raising money for</strong></p>
<p>We are now at a turning point. Our lease will not be renewed after 2015 and without a new location, our school will be forced to close. We cannot afford a new location in Phnom Penh where we are presently located. And we are also seeking new ways to provide quality education for those children residing in the countryside.</p>
<p>We are excited to have found land in TonleBatiLake (30km south of Phnom Penh) where we want to build a new and improved school.</p>
<p>My dream is to provide quality education to Khmer children.</p>
<p>Our first step, is to build a nursery and primary school as individual houses. We would like to build and equip the first house to be ready for September 2013. The cost will be $15,000 split between the construction of the buildings, the school equipment, and a year's salary for 2 teachers.</p>
<p>$2,000 to fill in the land and put in drain pipes.</p>
<p>$2,500 to build the foundation and hard floor</p>
<p>$2,500 to build the walls and roof</p>
<p>$1,000 for a bio-digestor and two toilets</p>
<p>$1,000 for fence and landscaping</p>
<p>$2,400 to equip the school.</p>
<p>$3,600 for the salaries of two nursery teachers for a year.</p>
<p>This will benefit 50 children in the surrounding villages who would otherwise have no access to early education. </p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Why</em></strong><strong> are we raising funds?</strong></p>
<p>I am passionate about education and want to empower poor children by providing them with access to quality education. I want to pass on my legacy to them so they are able to realise their own opportunities and dreams.</p>
<p>My dream for my country is to build academic excellence and human excellence, and I am convinced it must start from early childhood. Only then, will Cambodia truly develop.</p>
<p>I cannot do this alone. I need your help. So how can you help?  Firstly, by making a donation. Anything you give, no matter how small, will have an incredible ripple effect for years to come.For each donation, we have a unique way to thank you (see our perks).</p>
<p> Secondly, you can help by spreading the word about our unique project or, if visiting Cambodia, staying at You Khin House, the beautiful guesthouse we have opened to help sustain our school. You can also support us by joining our team of volunteers. No matter what you do, everything will make a difference. By working together we can make this beautiful dream come true for the benefit of children in Cambodia.</p>

<p>Rock climbing is one of Canada’s fastest growing sports. Climbing unites communities and contributes to an active, healthy lifestyle among adults &amp; youth.</p>
<p>To further the sport of climbing in Canada and help support Canadian athletes, we want to bring a World Cup climbing event to the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The 2-day event would be Eastern Canada's first chance to see World-Class climbing athletes perform in our city-center.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>To hold the event, our organizing committee of 6 volunteers must raise $10,000 before August, 2012.</p>
<p>That’s just $2 from 5,000 people. If you love rock climbing or just want to support Canadian athletics and the Toronto community, please contribute and help make this happen!</p>
<p>The funds will be used to pay the International Federation of Sport Climbing’s calendar fee. The fee is required for our event to be recognized as an official, World Cup event. Once our event is officially recognized, we can begin reaching out to sponsors to fundraise for the rest of the event (including a climbing wall, venue rental, staffing, etc).</p>
<p>The $10,000 fee is non-refundable and given that we’re are just regular folks, volunteering our time, it would be great to have your help!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>No matter what you call them - The iGeneration, Generation Me, The Millennial Generation - digital natives have educational needs that are much different from our own. In my Language Arts class at The Clinton School for Writers and Artists, many students speak the digital language so fluently that they can operate any kind of technology straight out of the box. Others have never had a computer at home and have rarely used one at school. And there is every range of student in between. The thing that they all have in common is that we are delivering them into a digital world where no matter where they come from or what kind of access to technology they’ve been exposed to, they will be required to speak the language of computers - a language that changes rapidly. The best thing for all students in this generation is complete preparedness for a working world that exists on the web, through social networking, in an ever changing landscape of the digital world. This project is about full immersion in the digital language. We truly believe this will help close the achievement gaps that exist not only in our school but in schools across the nation. This is an opportunity to prove that engaging students in the medium they are most comfortable in will help them see the value of their own literacy.<br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Through this experimental curriculum, we want to show that immersion in the digital world for a core subject area, in this case Language Arts, will lead to higher student achievement in all subgroups. My classroom is the perfect place for this study, as I teach in one of the most diverse schools in New York City. The reading and writing workshop model will be combined with outcomes based assessment in a completely students centered environment.<br/></p>

We prefer Macbooks because they are more trouble-free and our school does not have a full-time technology teacher, but we will go with the best we can afford. The budget for the project as envisioned ideally is $55,000, but we'll do what we can with every dollar we earn. We made the goal of this project $20,000 dollars because we wanted a better chance of reaching the goal so that the fee paid to this website stays at 4%.</p>

<h2>LAST YEAR</h2>
<p>The Peace Project and thousands of creatives worldwide joined hands with the people of Sierra Leone, Africa in one of the most unique collaborations ever attempted, <em>Operation Rise</em>. On September 21st, World Peace Day, 10,000 pairs of crutches were distributed across the country to amputees, war victims, polio survivors, women and children -- some who had been crawling on the ground for ten years.  </p>

<h2>INTRODUCING... </h2>
<p>Make Peace is a fundraising campaign that creates greater equality between donors and recipients.  Although many people in Sierra Leone can use a hand-up, they're not looking for a hand-out. We’ve turned traditional fundraising upside down and have invited everyone, including the most financially challenged in Sierra Leone, to participate.  As you’ll see by the video above, they’ve stepped up.</p>

</div>
<h2>LOFTY GOALS?</h2>
<p>We seek to raise a minimum of $50,000 (50% of the cost of the structure shown above). $100,000 will make this a reality.</p>

Make Peace is a fundraising campaign that creates greater equality between donors and recipients.  Although many people in Sierra Leone can use a hand-up, they're not looking for a hand-out. We’ve turned traditional fundraising upside down and have invited everyone, including the most financially challenged in Sierra Leone, to participate.  As you’ll see by the video above, they’ve stepped up.


LOFTY GOALS?
We seek to raise a minimum of $50,000 (50% of the cost of the structure shown above). $100,000 will make this a reality.

GIVE NOW, GET LATER
No matter where you are, you'll get something in return. See the incredible list of incentives that have been donated by creatives who believe that if we share our resources, we can ""make peace.""

<p> </p>
<p>I first felt called to give my life to Christ last New Year’s Eve at a Campus Outreach global conference.  At the end of the conference, there was an opportunity to text the words “send me” to Campus Outreach staff in order to find out where there was a need for staff inside and outside of the United States.  I received an email a few weeks later telling me that there was a position available for me at the Global Resource Center in Birmingham, and I knew in my heart that God was calling me there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                Campus Outreach specifically works with college students by building friendships, sharing the Gospel of Christ with them and teaching them how to grow in their faith.  The Global Resource Center helps enable staff to bring the Gospel to unreached students in Brazil, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and the United States.  As an Executive Administrative Assistant, I will work closely with the Global Resource Director, enabling him to focus intently on leading and equipping CO staff ministering to unreached people around the world.  This is also an amazing opportunity for me to grow professionally as well as personally in my walk with Christ.  I feel extremely blessed to have been offered this opportunity!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, I would be so honored if you would join my support team as a financial and prayer partner.  I am trusting that God will provide for me as I am raising support for the two years I will spend in Birmingham.  Please take some time to pray and consider how you might be involved.  I would love it if you would take some time to help me get the word out and share my link with your friends and family as well.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration; it really means a lot to me!</p>

So….

We are happy to present: BRAINY SPORTS!!!

The idea is to integrate sports with basic pre-school

We brought together some of the best educators and sport

<p>We truly believe there is something special about seeing a young athlete grow, we thoroughly enjoy development.

The truth is that if you have been young, you have been a young athlete.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>But There Is ""<em>No""</em> Place For Young Athletes To Go.</strong></h1>
<p>There are ton's of fitness centers &amp; community centers all over the world, but if you are young and you have fitness and or athletic goals -- trying to find the space, as well as the expertise to help guide you to accomplish your dreams &amp; goals couldn't be any more painful than it already is -- for the billions of young athletes out there in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>We Know - Your Fondest Memories of Athletics Happened In Your Youth.</h1>
<p>Whether it was winning your first championship, finally getting your first dunk in a game, scoring your first touchdown, hitting your first homerun, or having your first winning season - you still remember every intricate detail about it and you have taken something from those experiences and applied it to your life, and as a result you lead a successful life.</p>

<h1>
<strong>Finally - Something The Young Athlete Can Call Their Own</strong><strong>.</strong>
</h1>
<p>It's about time the young athlete had something they could call their home! It's time we made something that is innovative, super cool, and exclusive to the young athlete. Why are we still training out of places that really don't care about the young athlete? Young Athletes should be working with people in environment's that really truly care about their fitness &amp; athletic goals!</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>Elevated Athletics: The New Platform <em>For</em> Young Athletes</strong></h1>

We Love Young Athletes.
We truly believe there is something special about seeing a young athlete grow, we thoroughly enjoy development. We want to support young athletes in all sports; from baseball, football, basketball, soccer, volleyball, lacrosse, swimming to tennis & golf. The truth is that if you have been young, you have been a young athlete.
 
But There Is ""No"" Place For Young Athletes To Go.
There are ton's of fitness centers & community centers all over the world, but if you are young and you have fitness and or athletic goals -- trying to find the space, as well as the expertise to help guide you to accomplish your dreams & goals couldn't be any more painful than it already is -- for the billions of young athletes out there in the world.
 
We Know - Your Fondest Memories of Athletics Happened In Your Youth.
Whether it was winning your first championship, finally getting your first dunk in a game, scoring your first touchdown, hitting your first homerun, or having your first winning season - you still remember every intricate detail about it and you have taken something from those experiences and applied it to your life, and as a result you lead a successful life.

 

Finally - Something The Young Athlete Can Call Their Own.

It's about time the young athlete had something they could call their home! It's time we made something that is innovative, super cool, and exclusive to the young athlete. Why are we still training out of places that really don't care about the young athlete? Young Athletes should be working with people in environment's that really truly care about their fitness & athletic goals!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are the Gay Straight Alliance of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. It has become a tradition for us to go to the annual MBLGTACC conference.</p>
<p>""The Midwest Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Ally College Conference is the largest LGBTA college conference in the nation. It is an opportunity for LGBTA students and their allies and advisers to meet in a safe and supportive environment to learn and discuss issues of importance to the LGBTA community and other communities.""</p>
<p>Normally, going to this conference would not be an issue, but this year it is. Our university usually provides funds to student government to either approve or deny student organizations for traveling allocations. They were provided 20,000 dollars at the begining of the school year, but have somehow ""run out of funds"" very early on in the year. This means that our student organization can not recieve any money from the university to make it possible to attend the conference this year. Our organization normally depends on some of these funds to help our group travel to the conference, which this year, is taking place in Michigan.</p>
<p><strong><em>This conference is the main event that our students look forward to all year. It is the event that most of our fundraisers go towards, and what we work hard for all semseter. Even with all of our fundraisers, we will not be able to raise enough money to go alone.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The very minimum that we need to be able to attend this year is 500 dollars. This money will go towards renting a van (and gas) to carry about 10-15 students from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville to Michigan State University where the conference is taking place.</p>
<p>Any remaining funds will be used towards costs of the hotel.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All of the students in our organization are paying for their own registration ranging from $65-$75 per person. We know times are hard for everyone right now, so we are trying to help raise as much money as we can so that each student that wants to attend, can do so.</p>
<p>If we cant raise enough funds, this will be the first year in a very long time that we wont be able to make it to the conference.</p>
<p>We are trying our hardest with other fundraisers to help us raise enough funds for everyone in our student organization to go!</p>

I traveled to South Africa a couple of years ago and worked in various townships to renovate homes and install solar water heaters, as well as to educate school age children about HIV/AIDS prevention. This year, I've taken a class about the history of Apartheid and colonialism in South Africa, and will be taking an online course this spring through Omprakash, a volunteer organization that seeks to create responsible and informed volunteers.

</p><p><b>Short Brief</b></p><p>The Culture Bus needs a motor and gearbox to get it on the road. The first stage of funding will help the dream come true.<br/></p><p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Australia
has one of the richest living indigenous cultures in the world yet it is
disappearing faster than most would like to admit. The Culture Bus will attempt
to reach remote indigenous areas across Australia to document and archive indigenous
knowledge, culture, language and ancient dreaming stories. The bus will be set
up as a 4 wheel drive fully mobile sound proof recording studio that can travel
where its needed most. The bus will also be used to inspire indigenous youth
to reconnect with their elders and culture through remote music workshops.</p>
<p>The
bare bones of the bus is a 4x4 Toyota Coaster which is in dire need of a
facelift. The bus has been purchased but needs work. Stage one will see the bus
transported to a mechanic and have a new engine and gearbox fitted to get it on
the road. </p>
<p>After
the bus is roadworthy stage two of the project will commence. Stage two will
turn the bus into a mobile sound/dust proof studio. A fully functional studio
will be built by a team of specialists once further funding has been raised.</p>
<p>Help
keep indigenous culture alive!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605693/files/20140526160305-image_1_.jpeg?1401145385"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>STAGE ONE FUNDING - GETTING THE BUS ON THE ROAD</b></p>
<p>So
basically the bus has been purchased and is ready for its conversion. The bus
needs a lot of mechanical work so <b>stage
one </b>of the project will
provide the funding for that. The money will buy a reconditioned motor and
gearbox and get all the essential mechanics ready to make the bus a reliable
and a super tough desert dweller. Once this work has been completed the bus
will go through the registration process and then be ready for the road. The
next step is stage two, which will start with the build of a mobile studio in
the bus.</p>
<p><b>STAGE ONE FUNDING BREAKDOWN</b></p>
<p>Here's
a brief overview of what it will cost to get <b>Stage
One </b>on the road:</p>
<p><i>Reconditioned motor
$10,000</i></p>
<p><i>New gearbox $3000</i></p>
<p><i>Brakes $1300</i></p>
<p><i>Registration/third
party approx $1500</i></p>
<p><i>Parts etc $1200</i></p>
<p><i>Mechanical work $3000</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><b>STAGE TWO FUNDING AND FOLLOW UP</b></p>
<p>After
stage one is completed further funding will be raised to turn the bus into a
mobile sound recording studio. The back two thirds of the bus will be replaced
with a fully sound and dust proof room to house the studio in. After this the
studio room will be built and equipped with mobile recording equipment ie.
microphones, monitors, computer (music software), sound card etc. Movie editing
software will also be placed on the computers with the ability to edit and
produce film. </p>
<p>The
bus will also house a large solar array on the roof as well as a substantial
battery bank and powerful inverter to run the studio in remote locations.</p>
<p>The
bus recording room will be set up in a way as to enable elders to view their
country when recording. This will be done by installing double glazed panoramic
landscape windows on either side of the studio. This will have the benefit of
getting the elders to feel close to their homelands when telling stories or
singing songs. The studio will avoid the clinical approach and aim to create a
comfortable and creative environment for those recording in it. Inside the
studio a camera will be installed to help document the person/persons talking
as to aim in documenting the process. Also the studio will have to capability
to multi-track bands to and will house a variety of equipment to make this
possible. On the outside of the studio a stage box featuring external xlr
connectors will be present making it possible to also record live bands at
community events. There will also be outside power points on the bus to enable
it to become an outdoor power supply to.</p>
<p>The
bus will then hit the road on its mission to record and document indigenous
culture by means of gathering stories, language and songs. The bus will also be
used to record music workshop projects with youth across remote
communities. </p>
<p>The
bus will team up and partner with indigenous art galleries, local schools,
local councils and local indigenous groups and individuals.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605724/files/20140526162630-DSC_0619.JPG?1401146790"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Who Can Use the Bus?</b></p><p>The bus will be involved in its own funded projects but it will also be available for other community projects with similar goals. From return to country trips, to remote workshops to teaming up with art galleries across remote Australia, the bus will spend its life where its needed most. The bus will be available at a minimum cost as to keep up with running and admin costs.</p><br/><b>STAGE 3 FUNDING - ON THE ROAD</b><p><b><br/></b></p><p>Stage three will see the Culture Bus hit the road. The Culture Bus will not only be used for its own documenting and recording projects with elders and youth across the desert, but it will also be available for hire for other worthy community projects. The bus would be available for hire with or without a driver (bus licence needed). As there are costs associated with running such a bus there will be a fee associated with hiring it. Costs however will be kept fair as  to make the bus available to all groups and projects.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>WHY BUILD IT?</b></p>
<p>Over
the years I've worked across Australian in remote areas in makeshift studio's.
Some have been extreeme! I've setp up in old toilet blocks, in abandoned youth
centres, in lounge rooms of motels and even on remote beaches with
crocodiles (big ones too!). In my travels I've noticed three main
factors. </p>
<p><b>One:</b>
A lack of places and resources to record in and around a remote community.</p>
<p><b>Two:</b>
A lack of knowledge and skills in communities on how to document the many
stories present. </p>
<p><b>Three:</b>
Many of the last of the ancient aboriginal story tellers who hold vitally
important dreaming stories and cultural knowledge are dying without their
stories being documented.</p>
<p>The
sad fact is that although these elders hold such important knowledge, many of
the youth ie grandsons/granddaughter, have limited interest in their culture. Their are
still elders living today who are ""first contact"" ie. where born in
the bush and had no idea of white man or western culture until they walked in from the bush. These stories and
people need to be documented. Its of vital importance for all Australians both
aboriginal and non-aboriginal. </p>
<p>After
many years of oppression and cultural degradation through colonial culture at
times todays generations often depressed and disempowered and have lost
direction and a sense of meaning within their own society. Its sadly more
common today seeing youth more interested in westernised objects such as smart
phones, or just drinking their lives away in response to their situation.</p>
<p>There
is a dire need to document this ancient culture's songlines and stories so as
to not only keep the culture alive, but to also preserve it for future
generations to listen to and re-learn in the future. Their is also a real need
to reconnect the youth with their culture through music and film projects so as
to form bridges between these two worlds to help rekindle and interest in their
own history.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/605713/files/20140526162047-dsc_03221.jpg?1401146447"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

Feel free to take a look. No donation is ever too small.The Impact:The importance of music goes very unnoticed. Music classes are being cut out of schools left and right, leaving children with little opportunity to ever pick up an instrument or learn about the wonders of music. The Castro Valley School of Music will have such an amazing impact on the community and Bay Area.Other Ways You Can Help:Help spread the word about our school! We definitely understand that times are tough, so anything as simple as a referral would be greatly appreciated.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><p>I am
excited to report that I have been accepted in the Master’s program for the
Fall 2014-15 semester at the School for International Training (SIT) in
Brattleboro, Vermont.  This will give me
the opportunity to further my studies in the areas of trauma healing,
intercultural sensitivity, international management and a variety of other
subjects. I will study 3 months on campus in Vermont and 6 months doing an
internship in one of the leading international organizations in the field of
conflict management and resolution.</p>
<p>I have been
awarded a partial scholarship.  I also
plan to have work-study job on campus. However this will only cover a small
portion of the tuition. Friends in VT have agreed to provide room and partial
board but I have to pay for, some meals, a living stipend, transportation,
communication costs, books and health insurance.  Therefore, I am respectfully requesting your
assistance to help empower me to achieve my goals. </p>
<p><b><u>I
only have until June 22, 2014 to come up with the balance of $14.780.  Every penny it will bring me closer to my
goal.  Whatever you can afford will be
appreciated.   </u></b></p>
<p>I
don’t like having to ask for donations.  Having lived through wars both in Palestine and Iraq, I have
a personal desire and interest in resolving disputes and in bringing peace to
the world.  However, I face serious
obstacles to pursuing my dream, including a physical and economic siege on my
land and my people, political obstacles, social injustices, a lack of
democracy, and a denial of other basic human rights.In exchange for your support I am
willing to come and speak to your organization and do radio and TV interviews
on behalf of your organization.</p>
<p>Your financial
support will have an impact that extends far beyond me as an individual..Your investment in my education is not only an
investment in my future, and the future of the Palestinian people, but in the
prospects for a global peace.As
a Palestinian living in the Gaza Strip, I have both a professional and a
personal interest in learning new methods of addressing intercultural conflict.
I have searched very hard to find an
academic institution that offers programs which focus on trauma healing,
intercultural exchange and programs that bring people together from around the
world who  are working hard for finding
solutions to these thought-provoking challenges. </p>
<p>You will provide me
the opportunity to develop Trauma Healing skills that will help me to create a
more hopeful future for myself and for my people.  If you are unable to send a donation, then

<p>We encourage students to engage with
the STEM fields: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math by providing an
unforgettable aviation experience that complements the aviation and aerospace

succeed in school, pursue college and ultimately find a job in the STEM fields.
  TriStar’s ultimate success is helping
kids explore and achieve more than they thought possible.</p>
<p>We need funds to renovate the space
and install full-motion flight simulators at the Kansas City Downtown Airport.</p>
<p>Once the simulators are in place, we
can welcome groups of students to our facility for an aviation experience that

be on-call aviation education and experiential resource able to take
the mission into the air through flyable aircraft.
Although this campaign is
specifically directed at installing our full-motion simulators, the success of
this project will contribute to the success of our other programs, using our
flying aircraft to actually take students on a flight.  Over time, we will
also use these aircraft to do other charitable missions, such as Veterans'
Honor Flights, Make-A-Wish, airshows, etc. Although most of our impact
will be in the Kansas City area, our flying aircraft give us a national reach.  TriStar's Values
Business-minded, purpose-driven management
Transparent business and financial operation
Proactive communication & relationship management
Good stewardship of donations and gifts
Community-based, accretive partnerships driven by shared success
TriStar's AccomplishmentsThe TriStar team has already made great accomplishments, an indicator of our passion and capabilities to make things happen.  We own two jet aircraft and a full-motion, professional-grade simulator.  The L1011 pictured here is being restored and will make its ferry flight to Kansas City soon: N91011, a 1983 Lockheed L-1011 TriStarN999BW, a 1967 British Aircraft Corporation BAC1-11
BAC1-11 SimulatorThis is the full-motion simulator,
currently located in the UK, that will be installed at our facility in Kansas
City, MO.  It uses complicated electronics, hydraulics, and software to
provide the occupants with an amazingly life-like experience.  Students
will learn about all the technology that goes into the simulator and the range
of job fields available to them beyond pilot and crew that are  There’s a forecast shortage of new graduate
with the needed skills; the TriStar mission is important to the kid and to a
range of industries that support the aviation and aerospace industries.The Simulator SpaceHere are the initial construction drawings:We have already been working with the
design engineers, architects and construction firms that can complete our
vision once the funding is in place.

 Using a feminist secular humanist curriculum, WLP trains young women of
 color high school students to do peer education outreach on violence

undocumented youth advocacy and sexual assault awareness. The majority 
of our students are first generation (first in the family) college 
students and the WLP college prep curriculum sends girls of color to 
four year colleges and universities at above average rates. For example,
 the four-year college going rate at partner school Gardena High Schoool
 is approximately 20%.  WLP's four year rate is over 90%. WLP is the 
only program for girls of color that explicitly addresses the 
relationship between organized religion, sexism and misogyny and 
homophobia. The campaign will provide funding to keep this program 
sustainable with quality programming and mentorship. The past three WLP 
cohorts have received prestigious scholarships to top four year colleges

raised will contribute toward the program coordinator while we continue

<h3>Help Put the FIRE OUT!</h3>
<p>Macio and LaWanda's home caught fire on Thursday, July 19th. They were enjoying dinner upstairs with some friends and minutes later they discovered thick black smoke accompanying the alarming smoke detectors.

<p>Will you, please, help put the fire out in Macio and LaWanda's home and get them back what the fire took from them?</p>

<p>They have lost a great amount and will be unable to use and live in their home for a substantial amount of time until insurance and contractors begin helping restore the house back to a liveable home.</p>

<li>Damage that the insurance will be unable to cover</li>
<li>Clothes to replace what was damaged for both Macio and LaWanda and their two wonderful children.</li>
<li>Furniture to replace the couches they are unable to sit on.</li>

Macio and LaWanda's home caught fire on Thursday, July 19th. They were enjoying dinner upstairs with some friends and minutes later they discovered thick black smoke accompanying the alarming smoke detectors. A few flashes later, around 20 firefighters stormed the home to put out the physical fire. Thank God they are safe, unharmed and their kids were safely visiting their grandmother during this traumatic experience. The physical fire is out but it has left a horrendous cloud of damage.
The walls of the home are covered in dark, oily, black soot. Their downstairs floor is completely ruined and much of their clothes and belongings, also ruined by the soot and smoke. They can't even sit on their couches because of the damaging soot. Their carpets are over run by it. The firefighters busted windows, belongings, and walls to ensure the fire was put out and save what could be saved.

We put this campaign on to bring a community together, near and far, to help a great family in need.

The Impact
They have lost a great amount and will be unable to use and live in their home for a substantial amount of time until insurance and contractors begin helping restore the house back to a liveable home.
Contributing to this need would do the following:

Housing (Hotel) for the time their house will be repaired.
Damage that the insurance will be unable to cover
Clothes to replace what was damaged for both Macio and LaWanda and their two wonderful children.
Furniture to replace the couches they are unable to sit on.
Belongings that were broke while the firefighters rushed through the home.

Everything counts and please help make a miracle real to them.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're a small organisation (we only employ 9 people) that has for the last 30+ years given well over 5000 young people an experience in the bush that they may well have helped to shape their lives. In particular, our belief is that getting away from your usual peer group, away from technology (we have no electricity) and experiencing something different are catalysts for change. </p>
<p>We are based on a 400 acre stunning property and from here we hike up and camp in the mountains. Over winter we run alpine expeditions for those young people who may have never otherwise come in contact with the snow and extreme conditions. We supply all of the young people who visit with the gear they need, making skiing, a sport that is usually financially beyond reach for much of the population, accessible to all.</p>
<p>Our current supply of snow boots are wearing thin and without them we are unable to run programs in the snow. We need your help. Each pair of snow boot costs around $150 to purchase. We are hoping to get up to 30 pairs but need at least 20 to continue to run our programs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've been looking at snow boots to purchase and we can find pairs for $150 AUS that suit our programs.</p>
<p>For every $150 raised we will be able to purchase another pair of boots. We ultimately want to be able to purchase 20+ pairs of boots (this would mean we can run our programs at 80% capacity). For every $150 we go over, this means we can afford another pair. </p>
<p>We would be happy to show any contributor the receipts for our purchase so you know that the money you give goes directly to where we say it's going to. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>100% of young people who come on our programs get something from their experience. 66.67% of these people feel Mittagundi helped them to put things in perspective, gave them a love for the outdoors and an appreciation of nature.</p>
<p>""It's where kids get to be free and themselves for a few special days"" (mother of a participant)</p>
<p>""It helps to grow their ability to communicate with others, building friendships and self esteem"" (school teacher)</p>

ACE encourages young people to STEPï¿½ up to their future, by offering research-based educational enrichment courses focused on mastering the skills necessary to be successful in life. In addition to college planning and preparation, ACE provides valuable pre-career training, internships, and job placement for students wishing to enter the workforce. ACE also provides focused content college and career planning for students who would like to pursue athletics, or work in the arts or entertainment industries.<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Due to our location in Baltimore, ACE has the unique opportunity to work in neighborhoods with high dropout rates, and to encourage at-risk youth to STEPï¿½ up to their future and stay on the path to success. The goal of this campaign is to raise additional funds so that we can continue to provide these critical services for young people in Maryland.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Across the nation, 31% of ninth-graders do not graduate high school with a diploma within four years. The plight is even more drastic in urban areas, and in Baltimore City the number of students who do not make it to graduation is nearly twice the national average. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that school programs often lack the tools to reach students who are struggling with the inspiration and motivation necessary to successfully plan for the future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>By providing Student Transition and Entry Programs, as well as using constructive interests like athletics and the performing arts, ACE strives to motivate and inspire young people to plan and prepare for the future. Motivational seminars and personal coaching provide youth with the guidance and inspiration they need, while transition readiness programs provide students with tools for success in the real world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>ACE has already begun to make a difference in our community, providing preparation and readiness services to Maryland students. ACE has conducted middle and high school programs at <a href=""http://www.paulsplaceoutreach.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Paul's Place"">Paul's Place</a>, a community center focused on providing services to low-income and homeless families in Southwest Baltimore. ACE also works closely in conjunction with former Harlem Globetrotter Choo Smith and <a href=""http://chooyouth.com/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Choo Smith Youth Empowerment"">Choo Smith Youth Empowerment</a>, providing academic programs and college and career preparation for student-athletes.</p>

</div></div>","Our StoryThe Alliance for Career and Education Inc. (ACE) is a Maryland non-profit organization specializing in providing Student Transition and Entry Preparation (STEPï¿½) for positive youth development. ACE encourages young people to STEPï¿½ up to their future, by offering research-based educational enrichment courses focused on mastering the skills necessary to be successful in life. In addition to college planning and preparation, ACE provides valuable pre-career training, internships, and job placement for students wishing to enter the workforce. ACE also provides focused content college and career planning for students who would like to pursue athletics, or work in the arts or entertainment industries.

Due to our location in Baltimore, ACE has the unique opportunity to work in neighborhoods with high dropout rates, and to encourage at-risk youth to STEPï¿½ up to their future and stay on the path to success. The goal of this campaign is to raise additional funds so that we can continue to provide these critical services for young people in Maryland.


The Impact
Across the nation, 31% of ninth-graders do not graduate high school with a diploma within four years. The plight is even more drastic in urban areas, and in Baltimore City the number of students who do not make it to graduation is nearly twice the national average. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that school programs often lack the tools to reach students who are struggling with the inspiration and motivation necessary to successfully plan for the future.




By providing Student Transition and Entry Programs, as well as using constructive interests like athletics and the performing arts, ACE strives to motivate and inspire young people to plan and prepare for the future. Motivational seminars and personal coaching provide youth with the guidance and inspiration they need, while transition readiness programs provide students with tools for success in the real world.

ACE has already begun to make a difference in our community, providing preparation and readiness services to Maryland students. ACE has conducted middle and high school programs at Paul's Place, a community center focused on providing services to low-income and homeless families in Southwest Baltimore. ACE also works closely in conjunction with former Harlem Globetrotter Choo Smith and Choo Smith Youth Empowerment, providing academic programs and college and career preparation for student-athletes.


What We Need & What You Get



All funds raised by the campaign will be used to provide ACE services to middle and high school students in the state of Maryland. Your contribution will give our organization the wings to soar, and to expand the reach of our program to more children in need.

Due to ACE's status as a Maryland 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, all donations are tax deductible.

<h2>
<b>WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR?</b> </h2>
<p>In brief, we work with a formal, independent, non-profit backed homeless encampment group  - Nickelsville. Nickelsville comprises of a network of encampments in the Seattle area, all sitting on city-sanctioned land. Nickelsville camps are self-governed, meaning residents each put in work to maintaining, governing, and securing these small villages. Nickelsvilles are also entirely substance-free, with strict regulations around inebriation and behavior. Some are full tiny house villages, some include mostly tents, and some comprise a mix of the two.</p>
<p>Encampments are seen as an emergency, transitional homeless housing measure that has many benefits for residents. Safe storage, 24 hour security, coordinated meals, access to services, and, most importantly, a community, are often essential for people working to get themselves back on their feet. More than half of residents work during the day, but Seattle's housing boom has raised rents for everyone; statistics show that for every $100/month rents go up, homelessness rises by 15%. <br/><br/>Since 2015, Seattle has sanctioned six of these camps to act as transitional housing for people experiencing homelessness. The camps work in conjunction with the Low Income Housing Institute. Families who can't find affordable apartments in Seattle's booming economy frequently take refuge in one of the villages as they wait for housing to open up. Our houses and beyond go to these camps. <br/> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR</strong></h3>
<p>Last year, Indiegogo supporters helped us build seven new structures for the Nickelsville Homeless Community, and we're very proud to show the beautiful results of everybody's work!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Bathrooms</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478733392/xhnfudsfqimkoglv9tkw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> The first project Nickelsville requested that we build were bathrooms. This simple, double-stall structure has two bathrooms, including one wheelchair accessible bathroom. Now fully plumbed in, the bathroom includes sinks on both sides with heated water.<br/><strong>Status:</strong> Installed in Central District Tiny House Village January 2016</p>
<p><strong>Hinge House</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/190799611?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/><strong>Concept: </strong>That the tiny house villages are temporary means that each structure has to move; loading the houses on a truck constrains the height, and, therefore, the space available for a lofted bed. One design team decided to solve this by creating a house with a hinged roof. During transport, the roof can be lowered. Once the house is in place, the roof lifts, creating ample loft bed space in the interior!<br/><strong>Status: </strong>Built fall 2016</p>
<p><br/><strong>Salvage House<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478648022/zmagqgz6bzjdyljdiz8z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Concept: </strong>True to our original concept of building an eco-village, we designed this house to incorporate 80%+ salvaged materials. It incorporates a beautiful sheltered porch, storage outside and inside, and a loft bed with a desk on the interior as well. This tiny house represents the results from feedback from all previous tiny houses about loft beds, storage, a porch, and salvaged materials. Residents at a local homeless village refer to it as the ""cadillac"" of tiny houses.<br/><strong>Status: </strong>Completed spring 2016, installed at South Seattle Tiny House Village</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EASE.L House<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478645139/qn64xcqfpgxenrbzgdz2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Concept: </strong>Designed and built by our all-women's program, the EASE.L House takes into consideration residents' desire to shape their own spaces. High windows and high r-value insulation make a warm, cozy, and private space, while custom designed and built furniture is flexible enough for a family of 4 or a single occupant. One interior wall is entirely cork while the other is all chalkboard. Thus, the theme of a house that offers privacy, flexibility, and ample opportunity for self-expression comes to life!<br/><strong>Status: </strong>Completed summer 2016, will be installed soon at a tiny house village. </p>

These tiny but functional houses allow residents ample sleeping and storage space. A passive housing design and build approach maximizes interior space while allowing the warmest possible, eco-friendly house for a resident!<br/><strong>Status:</strong> Build in process, will be completed early December 2016</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p>We started Sawhorse Revolution's construction projects for the homeless in early 2014, and have maintained our commitment to engage youth in creating considerately-designed structures as needed, and as requested, by the camps. Since beginning this program, our impact has been both strong and unique!<br/><br/><strong>A New Model for Education and Community Service</strong><br/>For each home or other project built, 6-24 youth develop basic skills in carpentry, design, and more. They work with peers and mentors, and the homes become almost a story of education and learning; each successfully installed piece of wood acts as a journal of sorts, recording our students' perseverance in learning new skills, creative ideas for storage and dignity, and collaboration with peers and mentors. </p>
<p><strong>Crucial Shelter for Families in Need</strong><br/>Seattle’s homeless population is growing at an astonishing rate, and one of the measures the city has taken is to sanction legal, self-governed, substance-free encampments. Those we work with often have tiny houses and provide emergency housing for families waiting for transitional housing.  <br/><br/><strong>Cost-effective housing model</strong><br/>Though we’re not trying to solve homelessness with this model, we are hoping to show how small groups can come together with limited resources and create something amazing that makes a real difference. If more groups could take our model and run with it, imagine the possibilities for youth and homelessness around the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>BUDGET</strong></h2>
<p>Our projects achieve a low materials cost while incorporating high quality materials (see above: design is dignity) thanks to donations from generous companies who produce and sell high-performance building products. Still, purchased materials are always essential, and this is where you come in. </p>
<p>We've included specific budgets for each of the projects in the links below, but you can also reference the following quick budget summaries!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Family Duplex (Two Homes)</strong><br/>Funds needed from Indiegogo: $7,780<br/>Materials: $3,300/house ($6,600 total)<br/>Moving: $1180<br/><br/><strong>Security Office</strong><br/>Funds needed from Indiegogo: $5,590<br/>Materials: $5,500<br/>Moving: $590<br/><br/><strong>New Tiny Home:</strong><br/>Total requested from Indiegogo: $5,090<br/>Materials: $4,500<br/>Moving: $590</p>

As with all Sawhorse Revolution projects, the builds are guided by professionals in their fields - architecture, engineering, and construction. Sawhorse is a registered 501 (c)3 not-for-profit organization. 

 
Each project is tailored to the needs of the camp and crafted to be of the highest quality, incorporating sustainable materials and building techniques, beautiful design, and a user-centered approach to architecture. Since the LIHI / Nickelsville Homeless Communities we work with move every 3-18 months, every structure we build is easily transportable and designed to fit the needs of homeless residents in transition to permanent housing.
 

We've already built seven amazing structures thanks to a successful Indiegogo campaign last year, and we're hoping you'll help us create four more by donating now to the Impossible City.

""The Parabay Homes,"" a tiny house ""duplex"" that can house a family
Concept: After working with the villages, we discovered that many of the families who arrive at the camps are too large to fit in one, 120 square-foot tiny house. Last summer, a design team came up with the Parabay Homes, designed to enable easy communication and connection between family members in each space.Status: Design complete, construction has begun, funds needed to finish constructionSecurity Booth, essential safety infrastructure

Concept: The encampments that Sawhorse works with have 24 hour security, staffed by camp residents themselves. As the entrance to the village and the hub of many of its functions, a well-designed booth would greatly improve residents' lives.Status: Design complete; build scheduled with the all-women's program for spring 2017 
Tiny House #9
Concept: The continued gift of considerately-designed, eco-friendly passive homes is an ongoing need for people experiencing homeless in Seattle. This new tiny house will prototype murphy bed construction and other moving canopy parts that can expand living area without violating city codes.Status: Design Scheduled for Jan 2017, Build Scheduled to begin March 2017 

WHO ARE WE BUILDING FOR? 
In brief, we work with a formal, independent, non-profit backed homeless encampment group  - Nickelsville. Nickelsville comprises of a network of encampments in the Seattle area, all sitting on city-sanctioned land. Nickelsville camps are self-governed, meaning residents each put in work to maintaining, governing, and securing these small villages. Nickelsvilles are also entirely substance-free, with strict regulations around inebriation and behavior. Some are full tiny house villages, some include mostly tents, and some comprise a mix of the two.
Encampments are seen as an emergency, transitional homeless housing measure that has many benefits for residents. Safe storage, 24 hour security, coordinated meals, access to services, and, most importantly, a community, are often essential for people working to get themselves back on their feet. More than half of residents work during the day, but Seattle's housing boom has raised rents for everyone; statistics show that for every $100/month rents go up, homelessness rises by 15%. Since 2015, Seattle has sanctioned six of these camps to act as transitional housing for people experiencing homelessness. The camps work in conjunction with the Low Income Housing Institute. Families who can't find affordable apartments in Seattle's booming economy frequently take refuge in one of the villages as they wait for housing to open up. Our houses and beyond go to these camps.  
WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR
Last year, Indiegogo supporters helped us build seven new structures for the Nickelsville Homeless Community, and we're very proud to show the beautiful results of everybody's work! 
Bathrooms

Concept: The first project Nickelsville requested that we build were bathrooms. This simple, double-stall structure has two bathrooms, including one wheelchair accessible bathroom. Now fully plumbed in, the bathroom includes sinks on both sides with heated water.Status: Installed in Central District Tiny House Village January 2016
Hinge House

Concept: That the tiny house villages are temporary means that each structure has to move; loading the houses on a truck constrains the height, and, therefore, the space available for a lofted bed. One design team decided to solve this by creating a house with a hinged roof. During transport, the roof can be lowered. Once the house is in place, the roof lifts, creating ample loft bed space in the interior!Status: Built fall 2016
Salvage HouseConcept: True to our original concept of building an eco-village, we designed this house to incorporate 80%+ salvaged materials. It incorporates a beautiful sheltered porch, storage outside and inside, and a loft bed with a desk on the interior as well. This tiny house represents the results from feedback from all previous tiny houses about loft beds, storage, a porch, and salvaged materials. Residents at a local homeless village refer to it as the ""cadillac"" of tiny houses.Status: Completed spring 2016, installed at South Seattle Tiny House Village
 
EASE.L HouseConcept: Designed and built by our all-women's program, the EASE.L House takes into consideration residents' desire to shape their own spaces. High windows and high r-value insulation make a warm, cozy, and private space, while custom designed and built furniture is flexible enough for a family of 4 or a single occupant. One interior wall is entirely cork while the other is all chalkboard. Thus, the theme of a house that offers privacy, flexibility, and ample opportunity for self-expression comes to life!Status: Completed summer 2016, will be installed soon at a tiny house village. 
 
Wheelchair RampConcept: Where there was once just a set of ad-hoc stairs leading to the ADA-accommodating bathrooms in the Central District tiny house village, now there's a deluxe, cedar and engineered decking ramp in place, per the request of the Nickelsville camp!Status: Built spring 2016, installed at Central District Tiny House VillageA-Frames 1 + 2Concept: Originally designed to be one large tiny house built on a module, we split the original A-Frame into two to create two identical and adorable tiny homes. These tiny but functional houses allow residents ample sleeping and storage space. A passive housing design and build approach maximizes interior space while allowing the warmest possible, eco-friendly house for a resident!Status: Build in process, will be completed early December 2016
 
IMPACT
We started Sawhorse Revolution's construction projects for the homeless in early 2014, and have maintained our commitment to engage youth in creating considerately-designed structures as needed, and as requested, by the camps. Since beginning this program, our impact has been both strong and unique!A New Model for Education and Community ServiceFor each home or other project built, 6-24 youth develop basic skills in carpentry, design, and more. They work with peers and mentors, and the homes become almost a story of education and learning; each successfully installed piece of wood acts as a journal of sorts, recording our students' perseverance in learning new skills, creative ideas for storage and dignity, and collaboration with peers and mentors. 
Crucial Shelter for Families in NeedSeattle’s homeless population is growing at an astonishing rate, and one of the measures the city has taken is to sanction legal, self-governed, substance-free encampments. Those we work with often have tiny houses and provide emergency housing for families waiting for transitional housing.  Cost-effective housing modelThough we’re not trying to solve homelessness with this model, we are hoping to show how small groups can come together with limited resources and create something amazing that makes a real difference. If more groups could take our model and run with it, imagine the possibilities for youth and homelessness around the country.
 
BUDGET
Our projects achieve a low materials cost while incorporating high quality materials (see above: design is dignity) thanks to donations from generous companies who produce and sell high-performance building products. Still, purchased materials are always essential, and this is where you come in.

<p>Hello! Two outstanding students from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) in Islamabad, Pakistan have been selected as the first ever university student leaders (or Project Manager Fellows) for the One World Youth Project (OWYP) program in Pakistan. OWYP links schools across the world to create mutual respect and understanding among students. The two Project Manager Fellows manage the ""Hub"" on the NUST campus, which is comprised of their peers who facilitate cross-cultural exchanges between local Pakistani secondary school students and their peers abroad in countries like the USA, Turkey, Kosovo and Guyana.<br/><br/>In order to successfully lead this program in Pakistan, the Project Manager Fellows must attend a training in Kosovo to gain the essential skills in leadership, management, cross-cultural communication, and most importantly, to build a cohesive international community with their peers.<br/><br/>It promises to be an incredible trip for the NUST Project Manager Fellows to interact with similarly ambitious students who are seeking new ways to connect and collaborate with peers beyond national borders. The trip will allow Project Manager Fellows to develop leadership and management skills, learn about their peers' countries and cultures and prepare them for the upcoming service-learning work they will have in their communities. For most students in attendance, it will be their first opportunity abroad in a place that is so culturally different than where they are living. <br/><br/>Please help us empower local Pakistani youth to connect with others globally and make positive change within their local community!<br/><br/><strong>What is the Summer Training Conference?</strong><br/><br/>The Summer Training Conference (STC) is a weeklong experience where the Project Manager Fellows from OWYP Hub campuses worldwide come together to further develop their management, leadership and community-building skills.<br/><br/>This is a unique opportunity for OWYP's international leaders to come together as a team to learn from one another and form strong bonds across borders.

<p>Paying for graduate school isn't easy. Tuition, living expenses and supplies for a master's degree from the <a href=""http://www.utexas.edu/lbj/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LBJ School of Public Affairs</a> have eaten away my savings, forced me to sell belongings and take on odd jobs on campus whenever possible. I'm down to my last handful of credits, but my savings are tapped, scholarships are few, and as an international student, I can't get a loan. I'm close to finishing, and need just one last push to get over. Can you help me grab hold of a graduate degree in global policy and move on to change the world?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Global Citizens Don't Get FAFSA</h3>
<p>I need to raise about $12,000 to cover a final semester's worth of tuition and the living expenses needed. Half will go to cover the final semester's tuition and the rest toward getting books, paying my rent and paying for necessitites like food and utilities. I've cut my other expenditures to the bone.</p>
<p>My family has been with me every step of the way, but financially exhausted by having to put my three younger brothers through school and chip in to support family affected by the earthquake. They've had to scrape into savings to cover unexpected costs. It's rough back home, and you can understand I'd like to keep from adding to their burdens.</p>
<p>I'm still in the process of looking for additional opportunities like paid internships and on campus employment. I'm hoping that by the end of this campaign (which is set to expire on the 28th of July, my birthday) I'll have enough lined up to give myself some additional breathing room in addition to what I can raise here.</p>
<h3>Why this degree and Why Now?</h3>
<p>In an increasingly globalized world, we need leaders who understand the issues facing everyone. A degree in global policy studies provides both the analytical skills and the necessary cachette to make a difference in the greater world. I'm in the process of embarking on my long-term career. A graduate degree would give me a head start in bringing smart, effective policies to the global arena. I need your help.</p>
<p>This also comes at a time when I've started blogging about global issues facing the world. I'd like to have the opportunity to use the degree to help open doors that can help me raise awareness of global policy issues to a wider audience. It's too important to let esoteric language and jargon crowd out the real concerns.</p>
<p>The budget cuts at the University of Texas have made it hard to find opportunities that are able to sufficiently support my needs. It's unfortunate that my TAship with the great kids around me in the photo above wasn't renewed last year, but hopefully y'all can help.</p>
<h3>Making Global Issues More Understandable</h3>
<p>In addition to my studies, I've also tried to translate what I've learned into a format that can be digested without the fancy policy learning. I'm firmly committed to the idea that policy analysts need to better communicate their ideas with the public.</p>
<p>As a contributor at the <a href=""http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">League of Ordinary Gentlemen</a>,I blog about international affairs issues and associated policy, lending my expertise in a tangible way.<br/><br/>A sampling of my work can be found at <a href=""http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/author/nobakimoto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link.</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://equalizeyouth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Equalize Youth</strong></a> aims to become the world's support network for LGBTQ youth. We are a team of passionate young adults inspired by the impact of web-based initiatives like the <a href=""http://www.itgetsbetter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>It Gets Better Project</strong></a> and <a href=""http://www.allout.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>AllOut</strong></a>. Our project started from the heart and has developed with an eye on the safety, needs and behaviors of young LGBTQ people growing up in the world of iPhones, Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, and many other social media platforms. </p>
<p>Our site will make it easy for every adult make a difference in the lives of LGBTQ youth. LGBTQ adults, friends, and family will get to share their hope and wisdom, without compromising anyone's safety or privacy.  Adult contributors will out their stories and give young people like them hope and advice by sharing multimedia content themed around the unique things experiences of their own life path as LGBTQ folks.<strong>These will be stories of struggle, of success, of people simply being themselves. </strong>Real-life knowdlege on coming out, bullies, feeling ashamed, communicating with parents, handling crushes, being open in the workplace... Everyone gets to contribute, everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>There is a world of support out here, and we want to make it accessible for young people by harnessing the power of the technologies of our time.Help us to safely connect LGBTQ youth to the stories of people that have walked in their shoes: folks from their own town, school, ethnicity, or faith. We want create a genuine and safe place of hope and power generated by everyone who cares about the future of our communities.</p>
<p>If you can already hear the commotion... We invite you to visit <a href=""http://www.ihadcancer.com/location"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> powerful and <a href=""http://blog.squeakywheelmedia.com/index.php/tag/i-had-cancer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">award winning</a> resource. We want to provide something similar for LGBTQ youth everywhere. A place to insipire, and to be inspired. A place that gives youth the tools to move forward!

<p>Our platform innovates by bringing location markers and background tags into the user experience, and by keeping contributors anonymous. We want to use this new social media approach to safely connect youth with the stories and experiences that were part of those that have walked in their shoes before. With a savvy Google Maps application, contributors tie entries to physical locations and important places related to their story: high schools, congregations, summer camps, and community centers—anywhere around the globe counts!</p>
<p>Searches will be as simple as entering a zip code. Kids can find entries by folks just like them, whether in their own hometowns or around the globe. Contributors will tag their ethnic backgrounds and religious upbringings in their entry to facilitate effective searches. Additional tags for experiences like being deaf, blind, going through “anti-gay therapy,” or being HIV+ will also be included. No matter what, we want youth to see (literally!) that they are not alone, that their challenges can be overcome, and that there is a world of unconditional love and support out there.</p>
<p><strong>Let's be clear: we are serious about being a resource to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all</span> LGBTQ youth!</strong></p>
<p>Equalize Youth will be a safe and readily available source of hope and power, put forth by real-life people that youth can relate to. It will be like nothing else out there, and available worldwide—a place to inspire and to be inspired, and give youth the tools that can help them move forward into healthier, more resilient, and optimistic lives.</p>
<p>The end result?</p>
<p>Generations of young LGBTQ teens people won't feel ashamed and ostracized. Kids will understand that the hostility they may face is not their fault, and that it stems from ignorance 100% unrelated to themselves, their value, their perfect selves. These youth will gain crucial access and connection to people that have faced the same challenges. They'll get to know how someone just like them has gone through it before—not only that these people exist, but also how they felt, where they are now, and how things are changing across the globe.  </p>

We are a team of passionate young adults inspired by the impact of web-based initiatives like the It Gets Better Project and AllOut. Our project started from the heart and has developed with an eye on the safety, needs and behaviors of young LGBTQ people growing up in the world of iPhones, Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, and many other social media platforms. 
Our site will make it easy for every adult make a difference in the lives of LGBTQ youth. LGBTQ adults, friends, and family will get to share their hope and wisdom, without compromising anyone's safety or privacy.  Adult contributors will out their stories and give young people like them hope and advice by sharing multimedia content themed around the unique things experiences of their own life path as LGBTQ folks.These will be stories of struggle, of success, of people simply being themselves. Real-life knowdlege on coming out, bullies, feeling ashamed, communicating with parents, handling crushes, being open in the workplace... Everyone gets to contribute, everywhere in the world.
There is a world of support out here, and we want to make it accessible for young people by harnessing the power of the technologies of our time.Help us to safely connect LGBTQ youth to the stories of people that have walked in their shoes: folks from their own town, school, ethnicity, or faith. We want create a genuine and safe place of hope and power generated by everyone who cares about the future of our communities.
If you can already hear the commotion... We invite you to visit this powerful and award winning resource. We want to provide something similar for LGBTQ youth everywhere. A place to insipire, and to be inspired. A place that gives youth the tools to move forward! This is Queerty's take on this project: 
""Equalize Youth is the next logical step after the It Gets Better Campaign"" - Queerty, Sept 29th


Together we can make this worldwide tool a reality!

Our platform innovates by bringing location markers and background tags into the user experience, and by keeping contributors anonymous. We want to use this new social media approach to safely connect youth with the stories and experiences that were part of those that have walked in their shoes before. With a savvy Google Maps application, contributors tie entries to physical locations and important places related to their story: high schools, congregations, summer camps, and community centers—anywhere around the globe counts!
Searches will be as simple as entering a zip code. Kids can find entries by folks just like them, whether in their own hometowns or around the globe. Contributors will tag their ethnic backgrounds and religious upbringings in their entry to facilitate effective searches. Additional tags for experiences like being deaf, blind, going through “anti-gay therapy,” or being HIV+ will also be included. No matter what, we want youth to see (literally!) that they are not alone, that their challenges can be overcome, and that there is a world of unconditional love and support out there.
Let's be clear: we are serious about being a resource to all LGBTQ youth!
Equalize Youth will be a safe and readily available source of hope and power, put forth by real-life people that youth can relate to. It will be like nothing else out there, and available worldwide—a place to inspire and to be inspired, and give youth the tools that can help them move forward into healthier, more resilient, and optimistic lives.
The end result?
Generations of young LGBTQ teens people won't feel ashamed and ostracized. Kids will understand that the hostility they may face is not their fault, and that it stems from ignorance 100% unrelated to themselves, their value, their perfect selves. These youth will gain crucial access and connection to people that have faced the same challenges. They'll get to know how someone just like them has gone through it before—not only that these people exist, but also how they felt, where they are now, and how things are changing across the globe.  

Where will my money go? 
Our current platform can accept written entries, but can't yet perform searches or organize results… It’s like a stand-in: it’s missing the meat—and a lot of it. We've gotten this far with the help of lawyers, software companies, designers, web developers, photographers, media consultants, bloggers, local nonprofits, and more. But we can't grow further without funding: skilled developers cost over $100/hour! We need your help!
Your money will go towards the development of the back-end “machine” we need to support our platform. It will organize the data, enable searches, and expand functionality. Your resources will enable the infrastructure necessary for this platform to exist. These resources will contribute to:

<h3>The Shelter</h3>
<p>Since February, 2011 we have been volunteering at a shelter in Mumbai that houses sixteen homeless and semi-homeless boys between the ages of 6 and 17. The space is actually an ""emergency"" shelter where the boys can spend one night as they and their families scramble to find a more permanent place for them to live.  But instead of spending a night or a week at the shelter, the majority of the boys spend months, years, and for some even decades at the facility, some with no contact from any family other than the day they're dropped off. </p>
<p>The boys live in one all-purpose room, sharing everything with each other.  In this room they sleep, study, have exercise programs, and eat. Their shelter is on one of the glitziest streets in Mumbai, alongside some of the city's best 5-star hotels. The contrast between their lives and those of their neighbors is stark. The shelter is very, very basic, but better than the streets of Mumbai.<br/></p>
<p>We came there to volunteer and to teach English and math once a week, but we grew to care for the boys as if they were our own. Now, we spend nearly every day there, picking them up from school, teaching them, helping them access basic needs (toothbrushes, soap, etc), and bringing them to doctors and dentists in emergency situations. The kids all attend schools at the local government-run facility. During breaks and on Sundays, we watch movies or take them to a local park. <br/></p>

<p>Cyprus, located in the eastern Mediterranean, east of Greece, south of Turkey, north of Egypt and west of Syria, has been divided by a patrolled UN buffer zone since 1974, with Turkish-speaking Muslims on the north and Greek-speaking Christians on the south.  The <a href=""http://www.cyprusfriendship.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cyprus Friendship Program </a>(CFP) brings together teenagers from both Cypriot communities to promote peaceful interaction and understanding between the two groups. CFP is a year-long peace-building and leadership training program in Cyprus, with a four week cultural exchange component in the United States in the summer. By developing cross-cultural friendships, the teens build mutual respect for each other, breaking down the historical stereotypes and mistrust that exist. Upon return to Cyprus, the teens are in a position to share the message with family and friends of their own communities that Greek-speaking and Turkish-speaking Cypriots can live together peacefully. Indeed, many of the students who have participated in the program are doing just that – working together for peace.<br/></p>

<h2>How can you help?</h2>

<p>Each $3,400 in donations will cover the travel expenses and insurance for each pair of teens.  CFP, an all-volunteer organization, is recognized by <a href=""http://greatnonprofits.org/org/cyprus-friendship-program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Great Non-profits</a>, so you can be assured that every dollar you donate will go to bringing teens to the US.</p>

<h2>Why Cyprus?</h2>
<p>The conflict between the two communities (Greek-Cypriot in the south and Turkish-Cypriot in the north) has its roots in the 1950's and 1960's. In 1974, a war brought about a geographical militarized partition with UN Peacekeepers that continues to exist today, separating the two deeply divided communities.</p>
<p>●  Most Cypriots born after 1974 have grown up without contact with anyone from the other side.</p>
<p>●  Each community has its own version of history and “the demons” are the people on the other side of the divide.<span>  Because English is a common second language, communication is possible to address these differences.</span></p>
<p>●  The island is small enough that a program of Cyprus Friendship Program’s size can make a difference.</p>
<p>●  Both communities are filled with wonderful people who have much in common<br/>culturally, but the long years of separation have made most unaware of this<br/>fact.</p>
<p>●  There are adults willing to volunteer enormous efforts to help promote friendships between the two communities and teens in both communities seeking to become friends with members of the other side.</p>
<p>●  Since 2003 it has been possible for Cypriots to cross the divide through a small number of checkpoints.  Although it is possible, it is still politically and culturally complex to cross.</p>
<p>●  Cypriot society remains polarized.  Extremist groups have harassed program coordinators and teenagers. Despite these problems not even one member of the Cyprus Friendship Program’s family in Cyprus suggested giving up the struggle. On the contrary, the work continues to grow.</p>
<p>●  We know of no other youth programs that are as effective as Cyprus Friendship Program in bringing together Cypriot youth and their families from across the divide.</p>
<p>●  Cyprus is one of the more densely militarized places on the planet. Citizen peace<br/>building work that replaces fear with trust is a necessary component for any political agreement leading to the demilitarization of the island.</p>
<p>●  Hatred and prejudice against the other community is common amongst the youth of the island and cases of peaceful coexistence are very rare. Cyprus Friendship Program’s teenagers are a living example that peace is possible and have, in the first five years of the program, already inspired and given hope to many thousands of Cypriots.</p>
<p>●  Peace in Cyprus could offer a model elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>
<p>●  Families hosting Turkish and Greek Cypriot teens in their homes in the US show the goodwill, caring, and generosity of Americans. The strong relationships that develop between the host families and teens result in bonds between Americans and two Cypriot communities, both of which in recent decades have been strained.</p>
<p>●  Those in Cyprus seeking friendship between the two communities greatly appreciate the involvement of Americans who are without a political agenda and who treat communities, their cultures and their beliefs, with equal respect.</p>

<p> </p></span><p>For nearly 40 years, the island of Cyprus has been divided between the Greek-Cypriot side in the South and the Turkish-Cypriot side in the North. Following independence from British rule in 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was established and tension between the Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot communities intensified. In the ensuing years, hostility between the two sides increased.</p>
<p>In July 1974, a Greek-Cypriot coup took place in an effort to unite the island with Greece and, in response, Turkey landed troops on the island and fighting between the two sides broke out. About 160,000 Greek-Cypriots fled to the south and about 50,000 Turkish-Cypriots fled north. The two communities are separated by a physical barrier called the Green Line that is patrolled by UN troops on the longest peacekeeping mission ever undertaken by the United Nations. </p>
<p>In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared its independence, which today is only recognized by Turkey. On May 1, 2004, Cyprus as a whole (with the government in the south) was offered entry into the European Union without resolving the conflict.</p>
<p>Ever since 1974, there have been several failed plans and initiatives to negotiate an agreement to reunify the island, mostly under the guidance of the UN. In 2004, United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, drafted the 2004 Annan Plan intending to reunify the island. The northern Turkish-Cypriots accepted the Annan Plan with 64.9% voting in favor; however, 75.8% of Greek-Cypriots rejected it. Talks between the current leadership of the two communities continue, but no agreement has as yet been reached.</p>
<p>As a result, Cyprus remains a divided island, with the Turkish- speaking community in the northern part of island and the larger Greek-speaking community in the southern part, separated by UN peacekeepers. Each community has its own version of history and is familiar almost exclusively with the suffering that it has experienced at the hands of the other. So, there is a serious divide and little contact between the two communities. Teens in each community, indeed anyone 40 years or younger, have grown up with little, if any, contact with anyone from the other community. </p>
<p>Even those teens willing to explore a friendship with teens from the other community have little ability to do so. While it is possible to pass through one of the few checkpoint crossings in the Green Line, when they do, they enter a land that uses a different language, a land where their cellphones do not work, and where many of the people will be hostile to them. Moreover, they have no place to go where they know there will be counterparts from the other side who might have an interest in meeting them. CFP provides rare, safe opportunities for teens from the two communities to meet and to get to know one another. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p> </p></div>","One Pair of Teens has been funded!

The strong relationships that develop between the host families and teens result in bonds between Americans and two Cypriot communities, both of which in recent decades have been strained.
●  Those in Cyprus seeking friendship between the two communities greatly appreciate the involvement of Americans who are without a political agenda and who treat communities, their cultures and their beliefs, with equal respect.

 
About Cyprus


 For nearly 40 years, the island of Cyprus has been divided between the Greek-Cypriot side in the South and the Turkish-Cypriot side in the North. Following independence from British rule in 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was established and tension between the Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot communities intensified. In the ensuing years, hostility between the two sides increased.
In July 1974, a Greek-Cypriot coup took place in an effort to unite the island with Greece and, in response, Turkey landed troops on the island and fighting between the two sides broke out. About 160,000 Greek-Cypriots fled to the south and about 50,000 Turkish-Cypriots fled north. The two communities are separated by a physical barrier called the Green Line that is patrolled by UN troops on the longest peacekeeping mission ever undertaken by the United Nations. 
In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared its independence, which today is only recognized by Turkey. On May 1, 2004, Cyprus as a whole (with the government in the south) was offered entry into the European Union without resolving the conflict.
Ever since 1974, there have been several failed plans and initiatives to negotiate an agreement to reunify the island, mostly under the guidance of the UN. In 2004, United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, drafted the 2004 Annan Plan intending to reunify the island. The northern Turkish-Cypriots accepted the Annan Plan with 64.9% voting in favor; however, 75.8% of Greek-Cypriots rejected it. Talks between the current leadership of the two communities continue, but no agreement has as yet been reached.
As a result, Cyprus remains a divided island, with the Turkish- speaking community in the northern part of island and the larger Greek-speaking community in the southern part, separated by UN peacekeepers. Each community has its own version of history and is familiar almost exclusively with the suffering that it has experienced at the hands of the other. So, there is a serious divide and little contact between the two communities. Teens in each community, indeed anyone 40 years or younger, have grown up with little, if any, contact with anyone from the other community. 
Even those teens willing to explore a friendship with teens from the other community have little ability to do so. While it is possible to pass through one of the few checkpoint crossings in the Green Line, when they do, they enter a land that uses a different language, a land where their cellphones do not work, and where many of the people will be hostile to them. Moreover, they have no place to go where they know there will be counterparts from the other side who might have an interest in meeting them. CFP provides rare, safe opportunities for teens from the two communities to meet and to get to know one another.",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>I am always in contact with the people from Joomag, they have great and fast support, and they said they will do some big improvements the following months to their service, and the most anticipated one is to move away from Flash to HTML5 on the desktop.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We would like to introduce you to some of the students of Detroit Community High. We are artists and educators, and have been working with these folks since they started high school and we think the world of them.</p>
<p><br/>It's just a short month now between the end of classes and senior prom, and for most of these Detroiters the future is wide open. Remember that time of your life? Prom is one of the rituals bridging that gap. Who do you ask? Will someone ask you? This new world of formalities, social cues and miscues is part of the passage leading seniors into the less certain world that will follow after graduation, as they head off from the friends and people they've known. </p>
<p>It's easy to forget that this transition is even harder when you may not have the means to buy a dress or to rent a tuxedo. You can help us enable these students to embark on this journey.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution goes directly to buying or renting prom clothes for 22 students who have stepped up to let us know that they'd love to go to the prom, but can't afford clothes to wear. We are assembling a small book of pictures of prom dresses, and will make sure each girl gets her dream dress.</p>
<p>As part of our thanks to you, you'll get a group portraiit or a video message from these incredible people from their special evening</p>
<p>We'd love to achieve our total goal to make sure eveyone who has identified their needs is met with a full embrace. If we fall short of the goal, we'll work with what we have, and make our collected dollars stretch a little further.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>""I am a senior at Detroit Community High School. I am Class Secretary, work after school in our community wood working program and, in the fall, will be attending the College of Creative Studies in Detroit. I was struggling, wondering how I was going to get clothes for Prom. Then I heard about Prom attire on the intercom. I was nervous to go ask because I didn't want my firends to see me or anything like that so I never said anything. A few days later someone told my Mom about it and she said I should go ahead. I have my eyes on a pretty powder pink Cinderella dress. I don't know what I would have done without your amazing help, and I will be sure to save a picture just for you.""</p>

I have become very accustomed to having a comfort zone in my day to day life. As I grow more mature I have started to realize I will never reach my full potential if I don’t start doing things that make me feel a little uncomfortable. I made a decision when I heard about this opportunity to take a step by becoming a part of the US Brazil Connect program. It may seem like a leap, but as you read about me more, you will understand how determined I can be to move ahead with my life; once my mind and heart are set on a goal I make it a reality.</p>
<p>I know the only way to get what I want from life is to put my full effort into the task at hand. I have been doing just that.

Starting my second year of college presented many obstacles for me, my parents filed for divorce and I was facing financial problems. I ended up leaving mid way through the semester which ruined my grade point average. I took the rest of the year off to figure out how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. I returned to school this fall with a clear focus. During that time I realized the health field was not the path I wanted to continue I decided teaching was truly in my heart. Teaching has been something I have wanted to do ever since I can remember and I have finally begun my journey. My education classes are exciting for me and I can’t wait to become a teacher.</p>
<p>I had never felt confident that I would be able to fulfill the dreams I had planned for my life. I had always been a girl with big dreams but I had focused on pleasing my parents and being a good example for my younger sister for so long that I never really worried about improving myself. I have recently learned that the time to work on me is now. I began to work on my confidence and my sense of self and the more I started to grow as an individual the more I was ready to push myself further. I started making decisions based on what would make me the happiest. Hearing about the Brazil program seemed perfect to me. I’m in a position now where I want to keep pushing myself further and further outside of my comfort zone. If I had heard about this program my first year in college, I wouldn’t have ever applied. I wouldn’t have had the confidence to feel like I’d ever be accepted and I would not have felt comfortable being such a great distance from home for so long. I now feel through making my own decisions, I have gained confidence and a sense of readiness to embrace the world as me.</p>
<p>I have a very strong desire to be a part of this program and I have never been offered such an unbelievable experience. I feel my greatest fulfillment in life will be when I can make a positive influence in another individual’s life. I feel deep in my heart nothing can stop me from trying my hardest to be a finalist. I know all of the amazing doors this will open in my life and for that I will put in a 210% effort to be the best I can at adapting to a new country, culture, language, and to teach as much English as I can to the students. I am excited and honored to have been given this opportunity and I intend to give to the students in Brazil everything I have received by being a part of this exchange.</p>

I have become very accustomed to having a comfort zone in my day to day life. As I grow more mature I have started to realize I will never reach my full potential if I don’t start doing things that make me feel a little uncomfortable. I made a decision when I heard about this opportunity to take a step by becoming a part of the US Brazil Connect program. It may seem like a leap, but as you read about me more, you will understand how determined I can be to move ahead with my life; once my mind and heart are set on a goal I make it a reality.
I know the only way to get what I want from life is to put my full effort into the task at hand. I have been doing just that.
