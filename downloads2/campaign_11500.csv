Risks & Challenges


 
From day one we've been very focused on our commitment to deliver an excellent product on time. 
Manufacturing is a complex and demanding process. We've chosen a manufacturing partner with lot of experience in the field, who has guided us through the process of choosing the right molds and materials, selecting the right factories, etc.
Initially we wanted to launch our campaign by Q4 2015. We realized how important it was to be able to guarantee delivery dates and have our production chain set up before launching the campaign, so we took some time to get everything just right. We are confident in the quality of our components, as well as the speed and reliability of our manufacturers. 
Now we have everything set up for production. Our aim is to raise $15,000 for our first batch production. 
We will deliver on time. Guaranteed!
 


The future of Birdie
 
If our campaign is successfully funded and Birdiepics are being taken around the world, our focus will shift to building a second version of Birdie that will allow other cameras (including smartphones) to take aerial photography. 

The team behind Birdie
 
We are a team of Uruguayan engineers who have been working in the tech industry for a long time now.
As early adopters, technology fans, and enthusiastic travellers, we've worked on projects ranging from drones, NFC and value added services and platforms for mobile operators around the globe.
Shiran Engineering, a well known design company, with more than 25 years of experience taking products to the market, has joined our team.
While we’ve come far for an incredibly small team with a minimal budget we’ve almost reached the finish line. We need your help in making this technology a reality.

Overall we are excited to have such refined prototypes and to already be working on DFM (design for manufacturing)From early literal cardboard mockups, to 3D prints, to the prototype used in the video, these are just a few steps in Spark’s mechanical design. Spark wasn’t our first rodeo, and as you can see, we were able to nail down the electrical design very quickly. In 2012, Alpine Labs was born through crowdfunding. Fueled by a passion for time lapse we launched Radian, a compact device that allowed you to add motion to your shots and control it from your phone. Five years and four products later, we are back to launch Spark. We love being a part of this community. The support of backers like you has allowed us to bring our ideas to life and make some of the best photography gear on the market. We hope you’ll join us in the next step of the journey.Press Kit",34.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Adrian González, Undocumented and currently living in Anaheim, CA. I first began documenting the immigrant youth movement, through photography, during the summer of 2010 at a hunger strike in Los Angeles using a smart phone. As the months passed, I attended many events, protests, actions meetings where I continued to photograph the struggle to change policy. I am a strong believer that we must make our own marks. Through my phone, I was able to capture moments in our history that made it possible to change the conversations happening around those living in the United States without ""papers"". My photos were used in many publications and presentations. Here is a link to my flickr account <a href=""http://bit.ly/19LdLtg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/19LdLtg</a><br/><br/>In February of 2011, I was able to buy my first Digital SLR Camera. After purchasing my Nikon D3100, I began to take a step back during our demonstrations where I was no longer participating in the chants but rather experience it on a different level. I was now able to strategically look for a variety of angles to capture beautiful moments. For those of you who have seen me at a demonstration, you know that one can easily lose sight of me because if I'm not on the floor I'm on top of a tree. My camera and I have been from Northern California to San Diego, along the San Ysidro port of entry, to Florida, Texas, Colorado documenting our movement.<br/><br/>During the summer of last year, I was able to expand my subject matter and I began to take photos at birthday parties and even weddings. Although, as of now, It's not a career of mine to document a (life) celebration, I do take any opportunity I can to make an income. However, it's not very often that I am able to do so.<br/><br/>This is where you all come in to play. Because I want to be able to go further with my photography to make some sort of career with it, I am asking for some assistance. I would like to upgrade my current Nikon D3100 to a Nikon D600. The D600 will allow me to give better quality images for the next Birthday celebration, wedding or family gathering. I currently don't have the funds to purchase it all by myself. The only job I have now is babysitting twice a week. <br/><br/>I have always been willing to donate my photos to be used for class presentations, printed and online articles, to flyers and fundraisers. Whether I'm able to upgrade or not, I will continue to do donate my time and photos for the movement. However, if I am able to upgrade I can provide better quality images during photo gigs and be more confident in looking for those paying jobs than wait for them to come to me.<br/><br/>If you're unable to help financially, please share with those you who may be able to contribute.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h1 style=""color: #d80027;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">FAQs</span></h1>
<div>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span><b>Can you use it in the day?</b></span></span></p>
<p>Yes. We have a day mode switch which turns on the IR cut filter and the colours comes out natural.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Why use a small sensor?</b></p>
<p>Small sensor has several benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Smaller system size. A smaller sensor allows you to use a smaller lens and get more zoomed in.</p></li>
<li><p>Better technology. New technologies are proven on small sensors first. That’s why each new generation of small sensor cameras improve more than each new generation of large sensor cameras.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Why only 4MP?</b></p>
<p>TLDR: Pixel level perfection, crisp and sharp photos.</p>
<p>General consumer cameras advertise their cameras by their pixel count. It is easy to understand by customers and easy to market. However, the resolution only tells a small part of the story on how good a camera is.</p>
<p>More megapixels mean bigger enlargements. However, if you zoom into the photo captured by your 16MP smartphone, you will realize that you are just zooming into noise. There is no real information and it is a waste of storage.</p>
<p>You will get poorer performance in low light, as the gaps between pixels are not light sensitive. The losses means that the high megapixel sensors collects less light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r0YaDvCZA3ek0NCOMGRDOeTtz6eWHGGpa5lwptEAW1cqyLtp8q5w-1h2fwUVLijoYSea_JQGns5QLnIxyFlItH7a67aYMxWAS5FDOlVq4T-JGbNhe445wYl6jQmNAVf6_L34xpnX"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Can it shoot things other than astronomy stuff?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Tiny1 is designed for travel. Just switch off the astronomy mode, it will switch on the IR cut filter and plants stay green and humans stop glowing.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Can I do time lapse?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The original concept was a time lapse camera only; it will have a well featured time lapse mode built in.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Will it work in winter?</b></p>
<p>Depends on where you are. It’s designed for temperatures of -10 to 55 degree Celsius.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Can it shoot videos?</b></p>
<p>Yes. It even has audio in for external microphone and audio out for live monitoring. Do remember that space has no sound. We keep forgetting ;)</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Are your photos edited?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but the enhancements are built into the camera. You can disable them if you like.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>Isn’t the point to star system already on the Play Store on Android?</b></p>
<p>Yes, and no. The software is a derivative of Google’s API. We want to avoid reinventing the wheel. However, the implementation on a camera is novel. The sensors we use are higher specification than the even flagship phones. Further software enhancements will improve accuracy even further.</p>
<p style=""color: #d80027;""><b>The lens has coma</b></p>
<p>Yes, the camera’s kit lens has coma. The lens is optimised for large aperture and coma is unfortunately, a common trade-off.</p>

“This Tiny Camera Will Have You Reaching For The Stars”
Bokeh


As featured on TinyMOS Story TinyMOS began in 2014. I was a professional photographer and on a stargazing trip. I saw a sky full of stars - the Milky Way stretched horizon to horizon. Armed with a Nikon D4 DSLR and years of photography knowledge, I could not capture the sights before me. We built the Tiny1 so that now, you can. Tiny1 is the world's smallest, smartest and most social astronomy camera. It helps you plan, capture and share your star filled sky experience - all from the palm of your hands. Here's a gallery of what we have captured, over 2 years of development. Back us, to put the wonders of the night sky and exploration in the hands of everyone.

FAQs

Can you use it in the day?
Yes. We have a day mode switch which turns on the IR cut filter and the colours comes out natural.
Why use a small sensor?
Small sensor has several benefits.

Smaller system size. A smaller sensor allows you to use a smaller lens and get more zoomed in.
Better technology. New technologies are proven on small sensors first. That’s why each new generation of small sensor cameras improve more than each new generation of large sensor cameras.

Why only 4MP?
TLDR: Pixel level perfection, crisp and sharp photos.
General consumer cameras advertise their cameras by their pixel count. It is easy to understand by customers and easy to market. However, the resolution only tells a small part of the story on how good a camera is.
More megapixels mean bigger enlargements. However, if you zoom into the photo captured by your 16MP smartphone, you will realize that you are just zooming into noise. There is no real information and it is a waste of storage.
You will get poorer performance in low light, as the gaps between pixels are not light sensitive. The losses means that the high megapixel sensors collects less light.

Can it shoot things other than astronomy stuff?
Yes. Tiny1 is designed for travel. Just switch off the astronomy mode, it will switch on the IR cut filter and plants stay green and humans stop glowing.
Can I do time lapse?
Yes. The original concept was a time lapse camera only; it will have a well featured time lapse mode built in.
Will it work in winter?
Depends on where you are. It’s designed for temperatures of -10 to 55 degree Celsius.
Can it shoot videos?
Yes. It even has audio in for external microphone and audio out for live monitoring. Do remember that space has no sound. We keep forgetting ;)
Are your photos edited?
Yes, but the enhancements are built into the camera. You can disable them if you like.
Isn’t the point to star system already on the Play Store on Android?
Yes, and no. The software is a derivative of Google’s API. We want to avoid reinventing the wheel. However, the implementation on a camera is novel. The sensors we use are higher specification than the even flagship phones. Further software enhancements will improve accuracy even further.
The lens has coma
Yes, the camera’s kit lens has coma. The lens is optimised for large aperture and coma is unfortunately, a common trade-off.
We are looking into aspherical optics to solve that, they will be released after the crowdfunding campaign has been delivered.
Does it shoot RAW?
Yes, it shoots a variety of RAW.  .DNG and .RAW. We recommend DNG as it is lossless but compressed. .RAW is very troublesome to retrieve for minimal benefits. We may support .FITS in the future as an update.",50.0,5,"2 Campaigns

<p>Photography is about visual storytelling. The pictures I take with a camera represent the imagination I want to create with reality. Taking an image and freezing a moment in time reveals how precious life truly is. We live in a fast-paced world so life is too short to miss a moment that matters.</p>
<p>My love for photography and being able to preserve the moments is the reason for Beoncam’s birth and existence. It is a labor of love that spanned some 18 months and one made possible by passion, purpose &amp; persistence.</p>

Beoncam is built with an “always on,” single-touch system that is paired with a long-lasting rechargeable battery, ensuring you can capture that moment with just the touch of a button.



Beoncam is your ""always on"" smart camera companion that you can wear on your wrist, hook onto your bike or attach to a tripod. Take 360-degree photos and videos and even live stream video at a moment's notice.  
 
We live in a world full of wonder. From a baby’s first steps to love at first sight. We want you to be able to experience them, soak them up and capture them without having to stop everything to grab your camera. Beoncam is your solution to bulky, clumsy and slow cameras. It’s wearable, lightweight, compact and even splash proof. It’s also removable and attachable to different surfaces so it fits your lifestyle and creativity.

No longer settle for choosing between a selfie or the view in front of you. With Beoncam, you can capture you and the world around you in mere seconds in 360-degree HD.  It also allows you to view live streaming via the Beoncam companion app - you can even share it in a snap with your friends because moments that matter are even better when shared.



Photography is about visual storytelling. The pictures I take with a camera represent the imagination I want to create with reality. Taking an image and freezing a moment in time reveals how precious life truly is. We live in a fast-paced world so life is too short to miss a moment that matters.
My love for photography and being able to preserve the moments is the reason for Beoncam’s birth and existence. It is a labor of love that spanned some 18 months and one made possible by passion, purpose & persistence.
Chee Teck Lee
Founder


Beoncam is life changing, it allows you to be prepared for that special moment with the touch of the wrist. What could adding Beoncam into your life look like?

Waterproof Casing for Beoncam

Since Beoncam is only splash proof, we have designed a waterproof casing specifically for the camera so you can use it while in the pool or any water activities up to a depth of 20 feet (6 meters). The waterproof casing can be purchased for $19 and you can save up to 40% of its retail price. Actual product may vary from the image shown.


The Beoncam app allows you to remotely control the camera to capture and view images/videos, as well as share your moments with family and friends. We have created both iOS and Android versions of the app so everyone can use Beoncam.

Beoncam is connected to all of your loved ones near and far through its companion app for iOS and Android. 
Connect Beoncam to your iOS or Android device through Bluetooth for controlling and Wi-Fi (hotspot) to view live preview and downloading images/videos from Beoncam to the app.

Remotely control Beoncam’s 360-degree camera.

Immediately view capture images and video. 
Instantly share videos and pictures with friends and family through Facebook, Whatsapp and YouTube. 
Dress up any shot or video with image enhancing filters.

Beoncam is designed to work seamlessly with the mobile app. First, you will have to pair Beoncam with the app via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (which is the hotspot). Once paired, you can easily control Beoncam to do live previewing, capturing of image and recording of video.Other than that, you can also download the photos and videos from the camera onto the app (using your smartphone as a hotspot) and the photos and videos will be stored on the app for sharing on your social media anytime you want.Check out a sample video taken using our prototype (Note: the actual production units will have better resolution): The app also allows you to view the image and video in different views such as in Raw, Equirectangular, Spherical and Wide angle format.USING THE BEONCAM APP:Save Image / Video from App to GalleryTo store the Image / Video onto your smartphone gallery, select the Image / Video on the ‘SAVED TO APP’ Tab and click the download button. The Image / Video you have selected will be downloaded onto your Gallery for viewing them without using the Beoncam’s app.  Sharing Image / Video from Beoncam’s App to Social MediaTo share Image / Video to your social media account (E.g Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube), select the Image / Video and click the upload button and select and share the moments to your family and friends. Download Image / Video from Beoncam itself to AppGo to Album and select Beoncam Tab, click on the Image / Video and it will automatically download onto your app folder (Pictures\BEONCAM) so that you will have a copy of the Image / Video on your smartphone. Since the idea was born back in 2015, we have been busy working on building Beoncam to make it the best wearable camera ever. Our in-house optics expert has spent six months in designing the lens with several integrations along with extensive testing. Beoncam features seven glass lens designed to optimized the performance.The core principles that Beoncam is designed around are convenience, ease of use and a long stand-by time for the user. We have carefully selected a dedicated electronic system (SoC) which is customized for this wearable product to be the ""heart"" of Beoncam’s system. With it’s ultra low power consumption and sophisticated power management, Beoncam is able to achieve almost a week of stand-by time, three hours of continuous recording time, wireless live preview and many other features.   Beoncam is a 360° + 190° FOV wearable panoramic camera. The super wide-angle lens together with an efficient CMOS Sensor and the low power consumption SoC enable the camera to produce JPEG image and H.264 HD Video instantly. Beoncam is simple to use with only 3 buttons - On/Off, Image Capture and Video Recording. Image/video is stored into the 8GB built-in memory provided in the camera.The system has a ""Live Preview"" feature that allows downloading of images/videos via a Wi-Fi hotspot,all simply by using the free Beoncam mobile app (iOS and Android).Beoncam has a highly optimized PMU which enables long standby time (four days) and long video recording capability of three hours per charge with the embedded Li-Ion polymer cell.We have the working prototype ready so with the funds we raise from the campaign, we will use the majority of the funds to go into production and set-up quality control with testing to ensure every Beoncam is made perfectly. In addition, we will also use part of the funding to enhance photo and video post processing on the app along with other improvements to make your experience even better.Spacemap was founded two years ago in Singapore by our Founder Chee Teck Lee, a veteran in optics design and manufacturing. Keen to build a product that enables users to capture and share moments that are valuable to them, he embarked on the journey to develop Beoncam.Over the past 2 years, Spacemap has expanded to form a team of highly motivated and passionate individuals with expertise in optics, electronics, app software and business development.

Film production companies and well-off photographers buy these premium lenses without hesitation. But for cinematic enthusiasts, who adore the unique anamorphic features and cinematic look of anamorphic lenses, it is quite difficult for them to purchase one.However, SIRUI disrupted the anamorphic industry last year. With our innovative R&D and excellent manufacturing process, SIRUI launched the affordable and high-value 50mm F1.8 1.33x Anamorphic Lens, which amassed over $1.3 million in sales through Indiegogo  and earned rave reviews from numerous media outlets and photographers.    Drawing on our experience with the 50mm Anamorphic Lens, SIRUI achieved a focal length breakthrough, enabling us to deliver an affordable 35mm F/1.8 1.33x Anamorphic Lens.  With our newest lens on the market, there is now another high-quality and affordable, wider-frame anamorphic option for cinematographers and cinematic enthusiasts. By combining the two SIRUI Anamorphic Lenses, you can capture your imagination and create breathtaking, cinematic shots.Built according to the highest standards, this brand new anamorphic pro lens achieves  the field of view of a 26.3mm camera lens by widening the horizontal FOV up to 33%. Ideal for users who want a wider cinematic look, the 35mm Anamorphic Lens is a gamechanger, providing a superb, silky depth of field and oval bokeh. Due to the popularity of cinematic aesthetics, photographers and shutterbugs usually  convert a 16:9 camera shot into a 2.4:1 cinematic aspect ratio  via post-editing applications. Although this method achieves a cinematic look, it also degrades the footage and results in lower quality images.  Shot with general 35mm camera LensShot with SIRUI 35mm Anamorphic Lens When shooting with a compatible camera, the 35mm F1.8 Anamorphic Lens uses its 1.33x squeeze factor to widen the horizontal field of view and produce a wider, full HD 2.4:1 cinematic video without any post-cropping.Capture more through the 35mm focal length. With a simple switch to the SIRUI 50mm Anamorphic Lens, extend your shots for perfect cinematic work.Shot with SIRUI 50MM Anamorphic LensShot with SIRUI 35MM Anamorphic Lens Shot with SIRUI 50MM Anamorphic LensShot with SIRUI 35MM Anamorphic Lens Shot with SIRUI 50MM Anamorphic LensShot with SIRUI 35MM Anamorphic Lens  Special in its anamorphic structure and multilayer Nano-coatings, this 35mm lens softens and controls lights within a scene using the special function, Sci-Fi Blue Light Streaks with Pleasing Star Burst. Backlighting EffectAs users adjust the aperture, the unique light streaks and star burst will adapt to the aperture value for the optimum cinematic visual effect.Backlighting Effect + Blur Light Streak with Star Burst Eye your scenes through the lens and revive their beauty by adjusting the light setting between the F/1.8 and F/16 apertures. Even wide open at F/1.8, this lens can still produce sharp, quality imaging  with a smooth depth of field when targeting the subject/object using the 35mm focal length.

  Due to the 1.33x squeeze factor, the round light spots in the background will de-squeeze into an enchanting oval bokeh, which couples with the foreground for an aesthetic upgrade.

  Well-built with an innovative optical lens structure and German-manufactured Schott optical glass lens elements, the anamorphic expert lens minimizes optical distortion and lens breathing effects and functions perfectly to generate superb cinematic imaging.This portable lens also excels at controlling chromatic dispersion to produce unique visual characteristics and provide sharp, high resolution images. The 35mm Anamorphic Lens is solidly constructed with aircraft aluminum alloy and a precision CNC machining process.The compact lens further optimizes focusing and aperture control systems using the two additional Gear Rings (0.8 Module). They’re attached to the built-in Focus and Aperture Rings, and they’re designed with a comfortable anti-slip teeth surface..Manually adjust the focusing and light settings with  precision scale marks on the ultra-smooth, copper Focus and Aperture Rings. The 35mm lens can attach to an M4/3 mirrorless camera and fit onto an APS-C mirrorless camera with a selection of E, EF-M, and Z lens mounts by attaching the optional adapter rings.*  Switch to an APS-C format before shooting with a compatible full-frame camera.* In some scenarios, a little bit of vignetting might occur when using the lens while it’s attached with an adapter ring.Compared to general camera lenses, the SIRUI 35mm F1.8 1.33x Anamorphic Lens can easily produce a cinematic widescreen look for users without post-cropping or using additional tools to highlight their creative shots.Furthermore, this lightweight 35mm Anamorphic Lens delivers high-quality, cinematic imaging for users at a great value. It is a perfect companion for commercial directors, studio photographers, vloggers, cinematographers and cinematic enthusiasts.  Caution: Please remember to choose an ADD-ON for your selected Perk at CHECK-OUT if you need an adapter ring. Choosing an ADD-ON at a later date will cause delivery delays or results in additional shipping cost of customer's account.​ SIRUI’s August crowdfunding campaign is a pre-launch of our new product line and an opportunity for cinematographers and cinematic enthusiasts alike to be the first to experience the SIRUI 35mm F1.8 1.33x Camera Anamorphic Lens in advance of our official launch.     Since 2001, SIRUI has always striven to move forward and continue expanding the SIRUI Brand.

<p>We have ten prototypes of roughly the final spec fixtures, and mostly we need the help to get reasonable pricing for the project to scale up the production from the get go.

<p>Underwater is much more complicated than originally anticipated.

We decided to go with the BTO option when the battery and controller compartment is filled with solid foam so there would be no room for water to get in. </p>
<p>We have made some of the supplier deals, and some we are still working on. The bigger support we can get on the campaign the better deal we will get to you by testing and releasing software features faster. Please support our project!</p>
</div></div>","The Smart Light is a fixture concept which combines light source, battery, and remote controller into a single product. All you need to add is a phone or a computer as an interface. No extra software licenses and no more hardware needed.The Voyager is the next step in the Digital Sputnik product range. We have taken our DS product line and packed the full feature set into this small fixture. Then, we added batteries, an animation controller and made the package waterproof. When using current light controller boards, a technician needs to address every single light manually. With Voyager the software can autodetect fixtures on the set making this manual labor obsolete.The Devil is in the details, and we have ten finished prototypes that look and sometimes even behave like finished products. Now we need to take the final step.The last 10% of the project costs as much as the first 90% - therefore, providing a high-quality product in a timely fashion with bug-free software requires a lot of effort, and that is where you can help! Please support this endeavor so we could provide tools for your next creative project.With the Voyager it is possible to use Your favorite diffusion filter by LEE or Rosco. There are two slots to install the filter. The first layer is inside the diffuser tube. The second layer is right over the LEDs, and the cutout strip mounts right into the groove around the LEDs. We have a myriad of features planned for the future releases. Having more money to invest into our development team, we can have some of the features implemented much faster. Once the support for the project reaches 500 000 stretch goal, we can introduce the built-in WiFi router for every Voyager unit shipped.The biggest hurdle with WiFi controlled devices on set is the work of setting up the reliable network. There are very few routers available that are suitable for on-set work. Every Voyager unit would offer a straightforward wireless network setup procedure. All You have to do is set one unit as the router and continue to build Your set. Once You switch on the following fixtures, they will automatically connect to the router within one minute. The system will work best within 10 meters (30 feet) radius. By reaching 600 000 stretch goal, the Voyager units will ship with 200fps animation engine. DMX512 allows only ~42fps as maximum update speed becoming a major limitation for high frame rate VR/AR applications. All the Voyager units will ship with 200fps animation engine that is configurable with Lightgrading software but usable via ArtNet, sACN or OSC devices. The user can create custom animations with a simple point and click interface and use the fixture in DMX controlled set. The 1st channel will select preset animation saved in the fixture, and the rest will manage the animation properties.  If You guys help us reach 800 000 stretch goal, we will offer one free Voyager Converter (DMX/RDM interface) dongle to every backer. The Voyager Converter will incorporate any RGB LED fixture into Lightgrading software realm. The Lightgrading software allows simple color control and a finger drawn animation of lights. The auto-detection system will be modified to accommodate any 3rd party fixture detection. Advanced AI learning makes it possible to detect any lighting product even with modifiers. The unit will require 1A 5V power over micro USB connector.  The fixture can be used fully submerged up to 2 meters of depth for short time periods (30min). The 2-meter maximum is to keep the manufacturing cost and weight of the unit reasonable.We will provide a BTO option for an extra 150USD/2ft, 200USD/4ft per fixture to enhance the operational depth to 10 meters. These units will ship with wired control for fixed large-scale installations. Voyager is ideal for photography. A single operator workflow is much simpler with all the light controls under your fingertips. The animation feature can be used for long exposure takes. Voyager has a manual flash function, and it is possible to time it down to 1/500th/sec.  Yes, You might have. Here is one video production that has used Voyager very early and it was then a hyper-fragile prototype.
 
Voyager is also a great fit for social media use

<p> </p></div>","Summary
I'm a photographer working in the Chicago area. My work can be seen at my portiflio site: http://sdphotographer.virb.com/
and on flickr at http://www.flickr.com/photos/90612705@N07
 
Earlier this month, my camera was stolen on my way home from an event. This loss, in addition to being traumatic and costly, comes at a particularly unfortunate time, as I am in the process of greatly expanding my practice and building my professional body of work. I am in the middle of several major projects, one of which I can afford to lose very little time from (as documenting seasonal change is an important theme). It is therefore imperative that I replace my camera and get back to work as soon as possible.

What We Need & What You Get
 
I am a working artist and to put it bluntly cannot afford to replace the gear that I lost out of pocket. Without your help, I will be unable to continue my practice and will have to abandon the body of work I have labored to build. This loss of productive time will be far more devastating and have far greater consequences than the mere loss of personal property. Therefore, time is of the essence.
 
My goal is to replace my lost kit with the same or similar used gear, which will cost approximately $800.
 
In exchange for your contribution, I am offering photographic prints on the following schedule:
 
Contributions of $25-49: one 5x7 inch print
 
Contributions of $50-99: one 8x19 inch print
 
Contributions of 100-199: one 11x14 inch print
 
Contributions of 200 and up: one 14x17 inch print
 
All images on my flickr account are available!
 
If you wish to request a specific image for your print, please contact me with its flickr url. Otherwise, I will select one of my favorite images from my recent work for your reward.
 
All prints will be signed and numbered by the artist.
 
PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR CONTATCT INFORMATION either via leaving a comment or PM. I can not send you your print without your contact information.
 

The Impact
Your contribution will be directly responsible for permitting a young professional artist to continue their practice. This is no small matter and whether you give $25 or $200, I will be forever grateful for your help in my recovery from this horrible episode in my early career.

<p>although i am hesitant to ask for money from my friends and family, i am really excited about this opportunity to expand my photography experience and provide more for clients, and sometimes you gotta just ask.  ANYTHING HELPS! $20-$10-$5 !  </p>
<p>For those of you who dont know me, or as well as some- I am a 'retired' real estate appraiser and been enjoying photography for 40 years so it seemed like a natural expansion to offer services to real estate agents, and others.  I work with a great company called Look2 Homes (look2homes.com) that a close friend built with a little input from me (thanks Tyler). We have developed some great processes and love what we do.  Lately however the market is demanding a wider range of products to help sell homes. I wanted to do this some time back and now that the Colorado Springs branch is offering this aerial option it has seen success and happy clients. </p>
<p>I dont have the money to drop for the new equipment (especially since my current still camera gear was not cheap either) and i am still currently in grad school. The flexible schedule of shooting real estate is priceless for my studies!  I enjoy my job so much, it doesnt feel like a job most days. The people i work for are always great and the homeowners frequently call to thank me for the wonderful images of thier home.  Recently i have had a few clients ask if i have this aerial  capability and it pains me to lose business to other companies who do, but thats business right? so here we are...</p>

<p>With super light reduction capability, the Aurora PowerND family of fixed neutral density filters is the best light reduction tool for the uncompromising photographer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317049/jbsk9ieyrovlzuuuum5r.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Aurora PowerND family consists of three light reduction ratings: </p>
<p>ND64 - 6 stops </p>
<p>ND4000 - 12 stops </p>
<p>ND65000 - 16 stops</p>
<p>The 6 stop filter is typically used in low light conditions such as sunrise and sunset. Using a 6 stop filter can reduce shutter speed to a few seconds in those conditions. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317274/r84069l2qfevnyacry5s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The 12 stop filter can be used to slow down shutter speed further to minutes in dusk and dawn conditions, or a few seconds during daylight. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317384/xhnnqaiswrmltnvypkpb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The 16 stop filter can do magic during bright daylight, making it possible to expose up to several minutes or more. It can convert a bright day into night, allowing photographers to use two minute exposure time with ISO 100 and f/8 aperture during a bright day. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317427/edumfyqglplo45jxq8tq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The ND4000 and ND65000 have distinct advantages in having more stops than the typical ND1000 or ND32000. They allow users to avoid diffraction softening by enabling users to avoid very small aperture settings or alternatively allowing for longer exposures. In the case of the PowerND 4000 that means two more stops than the typical ND1000 and for the Power ND65000 there's one additional stop.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Aurora PowerND family comes with four different formats:</p>
<p>Circular format for most of lenses with filter thread sizes from 37mm to 95mm </p>
<p>Square format of 100 x 100 x 2mm compatible with filter holders from Cokin, Lee, and others </p>
<p>Circular 150mm with adapter for Nikon AF-S 14-24/2.8G </p>
<p>Aurora CR format for Canon lenses that support rear gel filter </p>
<p>The CR format filter is an industry first rear mount glass format for Canon EF lenses, such as the popular EF 11-24mm F4L USM. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317631/uoqsvtxfo1kpijmopdhl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Aurora PowerND CR format filters are very small and easy to carry. Gorilla Glass is used to provide rigidity and durability for such small filter.</p>
<p>The CR filters come with a metal filter holder that replaces the original plastic gel filter in the Canon lens. Gel filters are optically inferior with significant deflation of resolution and have strong color cast.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496317691/osrndafjksx4iboixgjn.png"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","With super light reduction capability, the Aurora PowerND family of fixed neutral density filters is the best light reduction tool for the uncompromising photographer.
 


 
The Aurora PowerND family consists of three light reduction ratings: 
ND64 - 6 stops 
ND4000 - 12 stops 
ND65000 - 16 stops
The 6 stop filter is typically used in low light conditions such as sunrise and sunset. Using a 6 stop filter can reduce shutter speed to a few seconds in those conditions. 

The 12 stop filter can be used to slow down shutter speed further to minutes in dusk and dawn conditions, or a few seconds during daylight. 

The 16 stop filter can do magic during bright daylight, making it possible to expose up to several minutes or more. It can convert a bright day into night, allowing photographers to use two minute exposure time with ISO 100 and f/8 aperture during a bright day. 

The ND4000 and ND65000 have distinct advantages in having more stops than the typical ND1000 or ND32000. They allow users to avoid diffraction softening by enabling users to avoid very small aperture settings or alternatively allowing for longer exposures. In the case of the PowerND 4000 that means two more stops than the typical ND1000 and for the Power ND65000 there's one additional stop.



 
The Aurora PowerND family comes with four different formats:
Circular format for most of lenses with filter thread sizes from 37mm to 95mm 
Square format of 100 x 100 x 2mm compatible with filter holders from Cokin, Lee, and others 
Circular 150mm with adapter for Nikon AF-S 14-24/2.8G 
Aurora CR format for Canon lenses that support rear gel filter 
The CR format filter is an industry first rear mount glass format for Canon EF lenses, such as the popular EF 11-24mm F4L USM. 

The Aurora PowerND CR format filters are very small and easy to carry. Gorilla Glass is used to provide rigidity and durability for such small filter.
The CR filters come with a metal filter holder that replaces the original plastic gel filter in the Canon lens. Gel filters are optically inferior with significant deflation of resolution and have strong color cast.


All PowerND filters use the same multi-layer nano coatings techniques for both light reduction and surface protection. In order to provide accurate color reproduction and high resolution, we apply multi-layer nano coating to both sides of the the PowerND 4000 and PowerND 65000 filters. The end result is that we achieve excellent result in resolution and color rendition.

PowerND 4000 Spectrum Transmittance
As avid landscape photographers ourselves, we understand these filters are used in harsh environment, in places that could be rough, dirty, and wet. Therefore, filters should be able to repel water, oil, dust and dirt.

Static contact angle of PowerND coating
Multiple layer of nano coating technology is applied to glass surfaces. Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) are used as hydrophobic and oleophobic coating agent. The end result is that water drop on the surface of the filter can maintain a static contact angle of 110 degrees. Untreated glass can barely maintain 15 degrees. Even a well known brand’s 10 stop filter keeps less than 40 degrees and their 6 and 15 stop filters do not even have water repel coating.

Static contact angle of Brand L (no coating)
Independent lab tests show the PowerND filters having very high resolution and color accuracy.

Well known Schott B 270® i Ultra-White Glass is used for the PowerND filters, except the CR format which employs CORNING® GORILLA® GLASS.


In order to minimize vignetting on wide angle lenses, the circular filters (37-82mm) feature a very thin filter profile of 3.4mm (not counting the thread).
The 100mm square filters conform to the industry de facto standard so they can be used in Cokin (Z), LEE 100mm, and other compatible 100mm filter holders. Both the 100mm PowerND 4000 and PowerND 65000 filters have a dense dark foam padding and paint sealing of edges to prevent light leakage during long exposure.

<p><strong>Lifetime Replacement Warranty</strong></p>
<p>The Universal Lens Cap does have a warranty. In fact, a lifetime warranty! For as long as you own the product, you are 100% insured against defects in material and workmanship. </p>
<p>However, we do NOT provide a warranty against damage or any other defects/issues caused to your lenses WHILE using or NOT using the Universal Lens Cap. In addition, we will not replace lost or stolen Universal Lens Caps.</p>
<p>If your lens breaks while using our product, we are not liable for your camera gear, its repair/replacement, nor act as a financial insurance agency against potentially harmful issues to your camera equipment, especially your lenses. The Universal Lens Cap acts as an aversion tool to mother nature and potentially harmful elements. That is it. We strongly advise you seek out and invest in insurance for your gear just as any other professional would do in any other industry! :)</p>
<p><strong>Customs &amp; Duties</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot mark any pledge/reward as a 'gift'. It is illegal to do so. In addition, import duties and taxes are NOT INCLUDED in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control. We are shipping the Universal Lens Cap all over the world and it is impossible for us to build the various customs charges into the various reward levels of Kickstarter.</p>
<p>But, this online tool can help you calculate additional costs;</p>

<p>Remember, we are the creators of KUVRD and the Universal Lens Cap, not international customs. You can use this tool as estimates when determining additional costs in receiving our products.</p>
<p><strong>30-Day Money Back Guarantee </strong></p>
<p>As stated in our warranty section, we will happily replace the ULC for any defects in material and/or workmanship. </p>
<p>We also provide a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee Policy. If you're unsatisfied with the Universal Lens Cap for any reason - within the first 30 days of receiving the Universal Lens Cap - we'll send you a full refund. We're not here to take advantage of our backers nor exploit their belief in us by sending them something they weren't expecting with the ULCII.</p>
<p>Just remember, every dollar from this campaign will be directly used to paying off mold fees, patent fees, initial start-up costs, actually producing the lens caps, producing the packaging, fulfilling those orders and paying off all other expenses incurred thus far.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest foreseeable challenge will be properly calculating, negotiating, and fixating costs and pricing with manufacturers for materials. Silicone is a rather volatile material, where, based on municipal laws, seasons and other related material-based industries, much of the cost of material used in the Universal Lens Cap can almost double overnight thanks to some shift or change in one of those aforementioned factors.</p>
<p>Luckily, we've already made a Purchase Order for 25,000 of the ULCII and fulfilled most of our Kickstarter Orders from just a couple months ago! Hopefully if we need to make another PO for this Campaign, based on the demand and current pricing of silicone, we'll be able to fixate or even decrease the unit cost!</p>
<p>Our second biggest challenge is determining a realistic 'estimated date of delivery'. Based on our history with our current chosen manufacturers, we can have a unit created and in our hands within 45 days. Taking into account holidays, quantity of units, priority of our order with the manufacturer and shipping to customers worldwide, we gave ourselves a buffer of an additional 60 days to handle any 'hiccups' throughout the process.</p>
<p>There are always unforeseeable risks, setbacks and hiccups which is why we plan to be transparent and do everything we can to keep our customers (you, the backer) happy.</p>

On September 18, 2013, all of my possessions were stolen and I was left with nothing. Literally nothing. Among the stolen items was my Canon 40D DSLR camera body, and 4 L-series Canon lenses. It was more than just camera gear. It was my livelihood. As I found myself penniless and possessionless, I was given one of the greatest gifts... the ability to rebuild smarter and better. Gone were all the creative projects I had done up to date. Gone were the back ups. But I was left with an overwhelming desire to make something beautiful out of the utter devastation that struck my life.</p><p>Now I am embarking on a great journey to produce travel guides to many of the worlds best kept secrets and a few of the known gems. More than just a book of what to do and where to stay, this series is built on the premise that by sharing the stories of the people that call these places home and by capturing images that depict the soul of the city, readers can be transported to a different place just by flipping the pages of a book. And if they do travel to one of the locations, they will have a glimpse into their new environment that was previously impossible simply by booking a hotel and dining out each night.</p><p>This series is designed to tell the story of a city, by telling the story of those that call it home. What makes them tick. What inspires them. What do they have in common with us all. What are their dreams. It's part travelogue, part memoir. It's meant to make a future trip more magnificent and take readers that can't travel on mental journey to the far reaches of the Earth.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here it is in simple terms:</p><ul>
<li>I have a pen, I have paper, but I have no camera equipment. The funds will go towards purchasing camera gear to take professional pictures. A camera body similar to the one I had is roughly $1,100. And a basic lens that is high quality (able to shoot in most lighting situations) is $300. A backup battery and memory card adds on a few extra hundred dollars.</li>
<li>This is the only missing element to make the travel guide series a reality. Every donation will help - no matter how small. It will all get me one step closer towards being able to work professionally again. If the entire goal is not reached... The funds will be used to either rent gear to produce one book in the series of travel books, or purchase a camera model slightly less expensive (and significantly less versatile).</li>
<li>On the rare chance that only $20 or $40 is raised. The money used will be put towards purchasing lenses that are used on the iPhone and take pictures with the camera on the phone. No matter what, someone can take my possessions, but they can't take my drive to create or my desire to make beautiful artistic expressions that enhance the lives of those around me.</li>
<li>This is one of those projects where the perks are never ending. Every donor will have the option of being included on my ""forever thankful"" list. To those that are one the list. I will forever offer free photos/prints - special personalized cards for holidays - advanced copies of future books - and even customized work in the future. Aside from the perks listed in this campaign. Those that help give me the gift of work and allow me to earn a living again will have my gratitude forever and will always be able to get prints, photo sessions, poems or anything else I ever create. For without you, there would be no me.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>I have always given back to the community. While living in Idaho, I took family photos of homeless people living in the region and printed them out for them to keep. This small gift was meant to inspire the most vulnerable when they needed it the most. The idea was that a homeless man could pull out the photo of his family and get the inspiration he needed to continue looking for work, or remember why he needed to live.</p><p>I have always worked within all budgets. I always felt that great photos should be accessible by all people. So I operated with a sliding scale. I barter, and once even accepted a ""Thank You"" as paid in full.</p><p>The donations on here will not be taken for granted. I have lost everything. But I was also given more motivation than I knew possible. This travel series will be an inspiration, an interesting read and may just open the eyes of folks to the world around them.</p><p>Your contributions now will help me dedicate my life to making the world around me a better place and adding beauty in everything I do.</p><p>Every gift will be rewarded with a copy of the first book in the series centered around Cartegena, Colombia. In addition, I will be offering prints and additional photos, along with discounts on other books.</p><p>Have a photographic need? Don't live in Florida?

<h3>The Story of Hangbeam</h3>
<p><img alt=""Happy Hangbeam user."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fastfibr.com/images/hangbeam-girl.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p>There are millions of tablets out there with no lighting for the front facing camera. We've done all we can to create a solution to an annoying problem, bad light when video chatting on your tablet computer.  Even with most cell phones having front facing cameras, often times the way we look to ourselves discourages us from engaging in a video chat because we just don't look our best. Now there is a solution.</p>
<p>Hangbeam is a compact and convenient, battery powered device that works with virtually any tablet computer such as an iPad, Nexus or Surface tablet.  It sits over the edge of the device and can even work with your laptop computer as well! It provides a warm, flattering glow of light that looks great amongst a broad range of skin tones.</p>
<p>Arriving at this product was an arduous process and we have made it this far because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hangbeam team is made up of me, an industrial process engineer and my partner who handles the web and the business end.</li>
<li>We decided to launch the project on IndieGoGo because we like the social impact IndieGoGo is making, allowing small projects to have an explosive impact.</li>
<li>With the support of IndieGoGo supporters, we will not only be able to get products out in the hands of great techies, but we'll actually be able to finally launch the business offering a series of cool innovations to consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the most of your mobile device and get the right light, we're sure it will make all of the difference in your picture taking at dinner, and especially when video chatting if you're in a long distance relationship, overseas friends and family, military families and loved service members abroad, distance learning, consultants, bloggers and Internet content providers everywhere.</p>
<p>It also makes a great gift!  We will happily provide digital vouchers to those who are giving a Hangbeam as a gift just so they know you're thinking of that special someone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Hangbeam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fastfibr.com/images/hb.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We need 1,000 Hangbeams pledged</h3>
<p>Current manufacturing start-up costs are expensive and complex, especially when electronics are concerned. So in order for us to get up and running at a cost that makes sense for supporters, we need a minimum of 1,000 units in the hands of supporters.</p>
<ul>
<li>$40,000 is what we need to get the final engineering, tooling, customized electoronic switches and led lighting made and assembled to bring a Hangbeam into the hands of users.  We have a lineup of manufacturers already qualified and proven to be able to get to work as soon as we get funded.</li>
<li>All units will be manufactured here in the USA to begin with.  We cannot guarantee this to be the case in the future, so if you'd like to own a Made In The U.S.A. product and innovation, support Hangbeam!</li>
</ul>
<p>The MSRP or full retail price of Hangbeam in stores is pegged at $59.95 due to the high quality materials and finish we've put into it.  At that price, it would be a real value considering many cell phone cases cost about that, have no electronics in them and are made completely out of plastic.  So, we're ready to get people excited about a product that will encourage you to video chat and take pictures in places you didn't think of before, by getting early supporters a great price for trusting in us.</p>
<p>Hangbeam can be yours for only $39 over 33% off! Save more by getting a Couples Kit and get a set of two for only $70 shipped to a single address.</p>
<p>If for some reason we do not reach the $40,000 sales mark, but come close, we will still be able to deliver on the units supporters have committed to, but, production will take an additional 6 weeks due to the need for us to have tooling made overseas, instead of right here in America.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fastfibr.com/images/hb-pic.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Be Among The First</h3>
<p>Your contribution and participation makes a big difference because every unit that is being manufactured is the result of hard work of a serious two man team bringing a product into the market.  We both have experience and successes in the digital world creating and building apps, web-based software, as well as computer solutions for industry.  Now is your opportunity to support a ground floor innovation that we feel confident has a genuine appeal to the mobile technology market. </p>

Now there is a solution.
Hangbeam is a compact and convenient, battery powered device that works with virtually any tablet computer such as an iPad, Nexus or Surface tablet.  It sits over the edge of the device and can even work with your laptop computer as well! It provides a warm, flattering glow of light that looks great amongst a broad range of skin tones.
Arriving at this product was an arduous process and we have made it this far because:

The Hangbeam team is made up of me, an industrial process engineer and my partner who handles the web and the business end.
We decided to launch the project on IndieGoGo because we like the social impact IndieGoGo is making, allowing small projects to have an explosive impact.
With the support of IndieGoGo supporters, we will not only be able to get products out in the hands of great techies, but we'll actually be able to finally launch the business offering a series of cool innovations to consumers.

Make the most of your mobile device and get the right light, we're sure it will make all of the difference in your picture taking at dinner, and especially when video chatting if you're in a long distance relationship, overseas friends and family, military families and loved service members abroad, distance learning, consultants, bloggers and Internet content providers everywhere.
It also makes a great gift!  We will happily provide digital vouchers to those who are giving a Hangbeam as a gift just so they know you're thinking of that special someone.



We need 1,000 Hangbeams pledged
Current manufacturing start-up costs are expensive and complex, especially when electronics are concerned. So in order for us to get up and running at a cost that makes sense for supporters, we need a minimum of 1,000 units in the hands of supporters.

$40,000 is what we need to get the final engineering, tooling, customized electoronic switches and led lighting made and assembled to bring a Hangbeam into the hands of users.  We have a lineup of manufacturers already qualified and proven to be able to get to work as soon as we get funded.
All units will be manufactured here in the USA to begin with.  We cannot guarantee this to be the case in the future, so if you'd like to own a Made In The U.S.A. product and innovation, support Hangbeam!

The MSRP or full retail price of Hangbeam in stores is pegged at $59.95 due to the high quality materials and finish we've put into it.  At that price, it would be a real value considering many cell phone cases cost about that, have no electronics in them and are made completely out of plastic.  So, we're ready to get people excited about a product that will encourage you to video chat and take pictures in places you didn't think of before, by getting early supporters a great price for trusting in us.
Hangbeam can be yours for only $39 over 33% off! Save more by getting a Couples Kit and get a set of two for only $70 shipped to a single address.
If for some reason we do not reach the $40,000 sales mark, but come close, we will still be able to deliver on the units supporters have committed to, but, production will take an additional 6 weeks due to the need for us to have tooling made overseas, instead of right here in America.



Be Among The First
Your contribution and participation makes a big difference because every unit that is being manufactured is the result of hard work of a serious two man team bringing a product into the market.  We both have experience and successes in the digital world creating and building apps, web-based software, as well as computer solutions for industry.  Now is your opportunity to support a ground floor innovation that we feel confident has a genuine appeal to the mobile technology market.

Within one year, SIRUI launched the affordable and portable 50mm and 35mm F1.8 1.33x Anamorphic lenses which amassed over 3.8 million in sales through Indiegogo and gains tremendous popularity in the Industry. In just 6 months, the third SIRUI Anamorphic lens - 24mm F2.8 1.33x, finally get access to the market.


Although all the SIRUI Anamorphic lenses can deliver you a 2.4:1 widescreen look, the 50mm performs best in portrait shots, especially when moving close to catch the subject’s facial details. In addition, the 35mm excels at harmonizing the subject and the background.The brand-new SIRUI 24mm Anamorphic lens can broaden the camera coverage to the maximum, effective in a wide variety of scenes.Getting one of the SIRUI Anamorphic lenses can make your cinematic dream come true, but having the three lenses all in your bag helps you to express your cinematic art to the acme. Want a cinematic look
Without hurting your wallet bad?
Now you can!Using an anamorphic lens can capture more horizontal information from a scene while not changing the height. The 24mm lens with the front-mounted cylindrical element compresses the image along the longer dimension to fit into the available sensor space, so when de-squeezing the recorded image with a post-edition software, you can get the superior widescreen cinematic footage where all pixels you paid are used.Besides, the anamorphic element group in the lens squeezes the horizontal field of view 1.33 times to produce the 2.4:1 aspect ratio. As the focal length shortened to 24mm, the angle of view also gets wider, rendering an expansive horizon.



Landscape
With the view angle extended, this wide-angle anamorphic lens can cover a wider range of the landscape.
Background Rendering
Perfectly balance your composition by generating a smooth extensive background while highlighting the subject.
Street Snap
Quickly capture a distinct street snap with obvious geometric perception, particularly over a long distance.
Limited Space
Break the space limit to show more information of a cramped position, such as an in-car shoot.
Night Photography
For a vivid city or starry night shot, opening the aperture wide allows more lights entering to speed up focusing. Compared to the other two brothers, one of the obvious changes for the 24mm lens is reducing the minimum focusing distance to 0.6m, therefore, you don’t have to back away too much to focus the subject when shooting space is limited.The front cylinder lens element can elongate the shape of out-of-focus details into the oval bokeh and also can spread the bluish light out left and right across the frame. The two anamorphic light features can enrich your footage and leave a deep impression on your audiences.

Shift the apertures via the smooth Aperture ring to achieve the optimum overall brightness and sharpness of an image. As the aperture movement range up or down, both the depth of field and background blurring vary in degree, consequently deciding the extent of captured details.Not just for video use, this lens allows you to distinguish your photo from a standard 16:9 photo, with all the noticeable anamorphic elements including a spectacular 2.4:1 rectangular look, blue light streak, and oval bokeh.The precision aluminum alloy enhances the strength of the lens housing. Assembling with the solid housing, the copper Aperture and Focus rings are designed with an anti-slip teeth surface for smooth, comfortable focus and light adjustment.The high-class Schott glass lens elements with Nano-coating can suppress aberration and vignette, rendering excellent resolution and sharpness to a cinematic image.Providing excellent portability and functionality, the SIRUI Anamorphic lenses are a prior choice for both individual and team uses to improve the film’s aesthetics.Since 2001, SIRUI has always striven to move forward towards and continue expanding the SIRUI Brand.

I spent my first couple of years in London prowling the East End, searching for the ‘Decisive Moment’ – that undefinable split second that finds greatness even in the most mundane of things.</p>
<p>A few years after finishing a Diploma in Art and Design at Sir John Cass School of Art I managed to open my own studio in Spitalfields Market and spent the 90’s shooting the pop stars of the day;All Saints and the Spice Girls, Boyzone and The Back Street Boys,Natalie Imbruglia and even JayZ.</p>
<p>The Decisive Moment, I discovered, exisits in portraiture as well as street photography. Expression is a moving target and I found the instincts required to capture somebody’s character already developed by my experience in the street.</p>
<p>During long and varied carreer, in everything from business to fiction, I have never lost the will to capture people and their world in camera – it’s time to now pick-up, proffesionally, where I left off.</p>
<p>If you would like to become part of my new folio and simultainiously help raise the money needed for up to date equipment here is your chance. I am aiming to raise £3000 over the next 60 days. To that end I’m providing my services for a fraction of my old dayrate.</p>
<p>The money raised is mostly for a new camera as I still have most of my old studio lighting gear. If you need your pictures before the end date don’t worry as I still  have access to proffesional gear via my hire accounts and the old buddies favour bank.</p>
<p>Although most of my work was portraiture I have also covered many other subjects including theatre, interiors, live concerts and events. I have even been known to shoot the odd wedding for special friends.</p>
<p>Please check out the link here to my Facebook photography page (via the Facebook icon below) and share it if you have a mind to.  Some shots are also in the gallery here (tab at the top above the little girls).</p>
<p>The work you see here is a small propotion of what I shot in the 90’s, quite a lot of it went missing when I closed the studio and put stuff into storage at the end of the 90’s. I hope it gives you a flavour of what I do.</p>

<p>Who is tired of having to choose between OVER EXPENSIVE  and LOW QUALITY cameras?</p>
<p>We have created the perfect solution for anyone in need of a camera. Smooth quality 4K video with AKTIV.</p>
<p>The most stable action camera. We have worked on this a lot, in order to make AKTIV as stable as possible. New technology has been integrated in AKTIV + physical stabilization.</p>
<p>Share with friends and family instantly!</p>
<p>Action camera:</p>
<p>With its tough exterior AKTIV can easily be taken anywhere with you. Don’t worry about dropping, or hitting it on hard surfaces.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480682038/nfyqgsub0nxjuhbwudqw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>AKTIV has been tested under water and has passed tests of up to 3.5 meters under water.  It can easily be used while doing water sports from swimming to kite boarding and surfing.  Attach it by using the special attachments.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480682074/agktx27eiyf60sucyrvy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Attach AKTIV to bikes and motorcycles while riding. Capture the best images with the stabilization that AKTIV provides. This makes it easier for you when editing the images you want to use. Most of the time these don’t even need editing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480682107/szwfisnc43flfbo5td87.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Security- manage home security in a simple and easy way.</p>
<p>With the new software we are working on, Aktiv will learn your homes patterns, so that it can alert you when something is different. Keep your home safe while you are away.</p>
<p>Get these notifications directly to your smart phone!</p>

<p>Use voice control to make it easy to tell Aktiv what to do and when to do it. Start recording, take pictures, or even share with friends and family via Social Networks.</p>

<p>Attach Aktiv to your car and record your journey while travelling, or use it as a way to keep it safe while away for long periods of time.</p>

<p>You can also attach more than one device to see all the difficult angles.</p>

Who is tired of having to choose between OVER EXPENSIVE  and LOW QUALITY cameras?
We have created the perfect solution for anyone in need of a camera. Smooth quality 4K video with AKTIV.
The most stable action camera. We have worked on this a lot, in order to make AKTIV as stable as possible. New technology has been integrated in AKTIV + physical stabilization.
Share with friends and family instantly!
Action camera:
With its tough exterior AKTIV can easily be taken anywhere with you. Don’t worry about dropping, or hitting it on hard surfaces.

AKTIV has been tested under water and has passed tests of up to 3.5 meters under water.  It can easily be used while doing water sports from swimming to kite boarding and surfing.  Attach it by using the special attachments.

Attach AKTIV to bikes and motorcycles while riding. Capture the best images with the stabilization that AKTIV provides. This makes it easier for you when editing the images you want to use. Most of the time these don’t even need editing.

Security- manage home security in a simple and easy way.
With the new software we are working on, Aktiv will learn your homes patterns, so that it can alert you when something is different. Keep your home safe while you are away.
Get these notifications directly to your smart phone!

Use voice control to make it easy to tell Aktiv what to do and when to do it. Start recording, take pictures, or even share with friends and family via Social Networks.

Attach Aktiv to your car and record your journey while travelling, or use it as a way to keep it safe while away for long periods of time.
Attach to the back of your vehicle and use it to help you park in hard locations.
You can also attach more than one device to see all the difficult angles.

Attach Aktiv to your helmet, or back pack while doing outdoor activities. Share instantly through the Wi-Fi connection available.Choose and cut exactly the segments that you want to share with friends and your network on any platforms.

Aktiv has a protective, shock resistant cover that is water proof, so it can be taken on all types of adventures and won’t ever be left behind.

Basically attach to any surface with the attachments available and use at any time.

Take a look at how the first prototype was made and what will be done after the campaign is over.


On the road to building AKTIV –action camera we have made many friends and collaborated with many people from all over the world.  Thank you all for your help and the insight you gave us throughout the project.

<p><b>Safety</b> – Spectacam will be the silent scarecrow and eyewitness. Cyclists and motorcyclists will have footage of any accidents and incidents that happen on the road. This is especially important if they were assaulted or hit by a hit and run driver for example.

<br/><h1><b>HOW IT ALL STARTED</b></h1>
<p>Spectacam was conceptualized when 3-time Olympian Josiah Ng first saw a need for a streamlined helmet camera to use on a daily basis, which would help to analyze his training as well as to record his rides for safety reasons. He spent a lot of time training on public roads and often encountered motorists who acted inappropriately or even dangerously towards him. He envisioned having dual cameras recording any potentially negative incidents as well as anything exciting on his rides. <br/><br/>Josiah formed Specta Technologies to partner with Outerspace Design Group from Melbourne, Australia to design and develop the dual camera prototype. The alpha-prototype was constructed in July 2012. <br/><br/>Specta Technologies LLC was incorporated in Nevada. Our objective is to bring to market the world’s first dual video sports camera with WiFi capabilities for the sports enthusiast wanting a lightweight, streamlined, functional and cool looking camera to document their adventures.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","About this project

Spectacam is a dual video sports camera with WiFi capabilities for the sports enthusiast wanting a lightweight, streamlined, functional and cool looking camera to document their adventures.


Safety – Spectacam will be the silent scarecrow and eyewitness. Cyclists and motorcyclists will have footage of any accidents and incidents that happen on the road. This is especially important if they were assaulted or hit by a hit and run driver for example. Footage can be used to prosecute offending motor vehicles, but hopefully motorists will realize that they are being recorded and treat the Spectacam user with more respect and courtesy. 
Training – Spectacam’s versatile camera adjustment can record multiple angles of the sportsman’s training to have double the footage for post activity analysis.
Experience – Spectacam will record the users experience so they can share it with others. Consumers are reaching a state of “hypermobility,” rapidly adopting mobile technologies and downloading apps that keep them connected anywhere, anytime.





Dual-camera view capability allows user to shoot front and rear videos simultaneously  


Smartphone integration allows user to control camera functions live and remotely


Blue LED Lights indicate camera power mode.


Smart adjustability of both cameras makes it easy to change angles of view.


Compact and aerodynamic design makes it one of the smallest and most streamlined helmet cameras in the world.


Versatile mounts can fit a wide variety of helmets as well as handlebars, and other surfaces using included 3M double-sided adhesive. The above image illustrates an example of the camera on the cycling handlebar - front and rear view, with rear view pointing upwards to face cyclist, to capture facial expressions.

That´s not the only way you can help, you can spread the word
to your friends who might be looking for an easy and accessible way of
carrying a camera with instant access and do great shots just like I have experienced with the QUADCLIP. Hi, I am JC Martinez, a father, a husband,  a handyman, a passionate outdoorsman and a hobbyist Mechanical Engineer who would like to introduce to you the QUADCLIP , what I believe is ""The Swiss Army Knife of Camera Clips and Quick Release Systems"".
WHAT IS THE QUADCLIP?
The QUADCLIP is a multipurpose Camera Clip and Quick Release System for D & SLR Cameras and other
Electronic Devices. 
QUADCLIP allows you to carry with you a DSLR camera or any device with ¼” or
3/8” screw mounting hole easily and safely to almost anywhere. Take your camera
without the hassle of having the camera hanging on your neck, swinging around
or inside the bag without quick access. 
It’s a Quick Release System that thanks to the
Hexabit connector piece it is compatible with almost all the Tripods, Monopods,
Dollies, Stabilizers, Flash Brackets and other elements, surfaces, etc.
QUADCLIP can be attached to Belts, Straps, and other
Standing Elements such as tripods. Your camera will be now accessible with a
click. The Locking Knob prevents any accidental release of your camera.
Furthermore it allows you to use your camera with hand straps or necklaces,
also your camera can be safely secure to the Clamping Plates or any element by means of strap or webbing attached
to one of its fixing loops.




FRONTAL CONNECTION

Frontal connection that makes the
QUADCLIP more accessible and easy to use.
You don´t need to look directly at
the insertion slot in order to secure your camera.
The frontal gesture is more natural
as other ""slide in"" clip systems.



QRD WITH REALEASE BUTTON

The release button is in the quick
release plate, which attaches to the camera making the QUADCLIP easier to
detach with one hand and one finger in any position of the camera. 
The camera goes with you and so the
control of your quick release system.
The mechanism and stoppers are made
with industrial grade Stainless Steel and not plastic like others... this clip
strong and durable.
The camera can be connected in 12
different ways with the Hexabit and Clamping plates and not only a maximum of 4
ways with the special plate.



HEXABIT CONNECTOR

Attach and detach your camera from
almost anywhere.
The HEXABIT connector piece allows
quick release of your camera from almost any gadget like tripods, brackets,
stabilizers, monopods, utility belts, etc., as well as any base with 1/4""
or 3/8"" mounting screw. 
You only need one Quick Release
Plate and as many HEXABIT´s as gadgets you have. 
This is real Versatile and High
Compatible Quick Release System and unlike others, Clamping Plates are not needed
as an ""Adapter"" for your Photography gadgets.



DYNAMIC CLAMPLING PLATES

Tethering directly from the release
attachment to the clamping plates is possible thanks to the multiple slots and
loops.
The QUADCLIP comprises multiple
mounting screw holes to fix the Clamping Plates in many different ways and
surfaces.
The effective (real) clamping
plate’s clearance is a bit bigger than other clips.
The swivel lug nuts in the clamping
plates allows an easier way to attach the plates to thicker materials, just compress
the plates, insert the swivel lug nut and tighten. Forget about the hassle of compressing
while twisting to tighten the plates like in other clips.
In conjunction with QRD and the
HEXABIT, your camera can be connected in 8 different ways.



GoPro™ ACTION CAMERA COMPATIBILITY
Thanks to the 1/4"" mounting
screw, it is possible to connect GoPro ™ standard mounting accessories directly
to the clamping plates without using the release plate.



The HEXABIT, an universal and
small connector piece, compatible with any tripod, dolly, monopod, etc. , with 3/8”
or 1/4” mounting screw. It is made of industrial grade CNC Stainless Steel for
any professional use. With multiple HEXABITS
and one QRD you can connect the same
camera in different places.
QRD is the Quick Release Device that fixes to your camera and allows you to
easily connect the camera with the HEXABIT.
It makes your camera accessible by pressing a smooth button with one single

means of screws with 6mm diameter ( ¼” screws), those mounting holes are also
thought to attach future products. The HEXABIT
mounted on the CLAMPING PLATES connects to the QRD in 8
different directions.
The COVER BAG protects your
camera from dust, water splash and avoids the lens without lock switch going
down while walking, it is lightweight and easy to use. It comes in 4 different
sizes covering most of cameras and lens sizes. It is made of nylon “ripstop”, a
tough and water resistant material.
Additional accessories totally
compatible with the QUADCLIP. Camera Clip & Quick Release System will be soon available.
Even when we have business
agreements with serious and reliable international manufacturers, we are
vulnerable to some delays caused by their schedule process. Also Customs
clearance execution time varies depending on your country of residence.


If any delay or setback occurs
during the execution of this project we will keep you informed and we will let
you know our countermeasures. 
We are going to do the best
possible to meet our time schedule for this project, we want your products at
the door of your house as soon as possible so you can put hands on the QUADCLIP
and start your photo Adventures.",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>GuardDrive Pro: Redundant SSD Storage</h3>
<p>Have you ever lost important files because they weren't backed up? Do you record video with SSDs and wish there was a way to have redundant recording? Have you lost money or business because you had a storage device fail losing irreplaceable files? If you've ever had a memory card or hard drive die or if you have a business where this scenario would cost you dearly, GuardDrive Pro is the solution to your needs.</p>
<p>GuardDrive Pro is a fully-contained redundant storage device that fits into a standard 2.5"" form factor. It works by having two separate solid state drives along with a RAID controller inside the enclosure. This raid controller seamlessly copies your data onto both drives in real-time. This means that if one of the drives or even the controller were to fail, your data would still be safe on the second drive.</p>
<p>Approaching redundancy in this way has many benefits! For one it allows you to add redundancy to situations where it was previously impossible such as many industry standard video recorders from companies like Atomos and Blackmagic Design. There are also no issues with compatibility as the redundant nature is totally hidden from the devices using the GuardDrive Pro. It also means that if you ever needed to, you can remove the internal drives and use them with any computer to retrieve files.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is where you come in! To offer the affordable pricing that we want, we need a minimum number of drive orders to produce them in volume. All of the funding from this campaign will go directly to the production of the first batch of GuardDrive Pro units. So we're asking you to back this campaign and pre-order your GuardDrive Pro today. We've already done all of the preparation so that once the campaign is funded it won't take long to begin shipping orders.</p>
<p>As a reward and thank you for funding our campaign, we are offering a limited number of drives below the final retail price! So hurry and claim yours today!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>GuardDrive Pro was initially designed for professional videographers. At Meros we have extensive experience with videography and have experienced the frustrations of not having a product like the GuardDrive Pro. We love to use cameras and recorders that utilize SSDs because they're convenient, affordable, and relatively fast. However, these devices usually force you to compromise and lost redundant recording to utilize an SSD. As such the GuardDrive Pro has real tangible benefits for many use-cases. </p>
<p>The funding of this campaign will also have a large impact upon the production and evolution of the GuardDrive Pro. Without your help we won't be able to offer the GuardDrive Pro at the kind of affordable pricing we want. We also won't have the capital to continue developing future versions of the GuardDrive Pro.</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The GuardDrive Pro is designed for creative professionals that need the best from their devices. As such we utilize NAS-grade SSDs that are designed for 24/7 operation and heavy usage. Here are some of the performance numbers that you'll be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read speeds up to 560 MB/s</li>

<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>There is currently no other product on the market that is designed for video and offers this feature-set and performance. There are many SSD and flash storage providers that market to creative professionals and charge very large markups. For instance, one SSD that is specifically designed for Atomos recorders costs $200 per 500GB. It has comparable performance to the GuardDrive Pro but offers no redundancy. We offer twice the amount of internal storage, plus an advanced controller, with the same performance for less than twice the price. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Fortunately for you, we have taken all of the risks and challenges head on before starting this campaign. The GuardDrive Pro is complete and ready for mass production. The images and videos you see are of the final production version. All we need at this point is your help in securing volume orders with our suppliers so that we can offer the pricing you deserve.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need help spreading the word about the GuardDrive Pro, so please share our campaign with your world! </p>

</div></div>","GuardDrive Pro: Redundant SSD Storage
Have you ever lost important files because they weren't backed up? Do you record video with SSDs and wish there was a way to have redundant recording? Have you lost money or business because you had a storage device fail losing irreplaceable files? If you've ever had a memory card or hard drive die or if you have a business where this scenario would cost you dearly, GuardDrive Pro is the solution to your needs.
GuardDrive Pro is a fully-contained redundant storage device that fits into a standard 2.5"" form factor. It works by having two separate solid state drives along with a RAID controller inside the enclosure. This raid controller seamlessly copies your data onto both drives in real-time. This means that if one of the drives or even the controller were to fail, your data would still be safe on the second drive.
Approaching redundancy in this way has many benefits! For one it allows you to add redundancy to situations where it was previously impossible such as many industry standard video recorders from companies like Atomos and Blackmagic Design. There are also no issues with compatibility as the redundant nature is totally hidden from the devices using the GuardDrive Pro. It also means that if you ever needed to, you can remove the internal drives and use them with any computer to retrieve files.

What We Need & What You Get
This is where you come in! To offer the affordable pricing that we want, we need a minimum number of drive orders to produce them in volume. All of the funding from this campaign will go directly to the production of the first batch of GuardDrive Pro units. So we're asking you to back this campaign and pre-order your GuardDrive Pro today. We've already done all of the preparation so that once the campaign is funded it won't take long to begin shipping orders.
As a reward and thank you for funding our campaign, we are offering a limited number of drives below the final retail price! So hurry and claim yours today!

The Impact
GuardDrive Pro was initially designed for professional videographers. At Meros we have extensive experience with videography and have experienced the frustrations of not having a product like the GuardDrive Pro. We love to use cameras and recorders that utilize SSDs because they're convenient, affordable, and relatively fast. However, these devices usually force you to compromise and lost redundant recording to utilize an SSD. As such the GuardDrive Pro has real tangible benefits for many use-cases. 
The funding of this campaign will also have a large impact upon the production and evolution of the GuardDrive Pro. Without your help we won't be able to offer the GuardDrive Pro at the kind of affordable pricing we want. We also won't have the capital to continue developing future versions of the GuardDrive Pro.
Performance
The GuardDrive Pro is designed for creative professionals that need the best from their devices. As such we utilize NAS-grade SSDs that are designed for 24/7 operation and heavy usage. Here are some of the performance numbers that you'll be interested in:

Read speeds up to 560 MB/s
Write speeds up to 530 MB/s
Up to 95K IOPS
Up to 1300TBW

<p>We have the concept for Idolcam for couple of years now and last year, we try to raise fund with the Idolcam 3D prototype but it didn't perform well as we want. But we didn't give up rather; we spent the past year investing in developing Idolcam to bring it near production ready state. We are passionate about Idolcam and we will make every effort to make it the best product we possibly can.</p>

Testing early Idolcam prototype with Youtube Sensation, Naomi Wu aka ""SexyCyborg"" 


Idolcam is the world's first pocket-sized camera to harness the state-of-the-art 3 axis gimbal from drones, inter-changeable lenses from DSLR, beauty lighting from fashion photography, 180 degree flip-able touchscreen from vlogging camera and compactness and ease of use of action cameras!

You can fit all the lenses that you needed inside a match box, true compact size. Idolcam also features an innovative magnetic lens system for quick lens changes!



 While most cameras lack lighting options, we understand the importance of lighting, filling in those harsh shadows and make you look more flattering.


 With flip-able touchscreen along with an app for preview and allow control to aim of the lens, selfie is no longer limited by the length of your arm.  

Our app will allow users to preview selfies and videos and give them the ability to control the aim of the camera up to 100 ft. away. The App is currently under development.


Never been easier with Idolcam's flip-able screen, 3 axis gimbal and lightweight makes it the perfect camera to work with the selfie stick and empowers anyone to easily capture stunning videos like you have a production team.
Youtube Sensation, Naomi Wu aka ""SexyCyborg"" testing Idolcam!






The 3 axis gimbal provide very stable footage that will satisfy most users, but for perfectionist users, a 4th axis suspension arm will further reduce the vertical motion that 3 axis gimbal can't compensate and produce true flying motion comparable to drones and steady-cams.








Since most drones can only film forward and downward, mounting Idolcam on drones allow for filming upward for creative shots and inspecting bridges and etc.


Rc car with Idolcam and 4th axis makes a fast action filming machine for low perspective. Imagine you can capture shots going underneath a car and coming out on the other size of the car!




 Battery Life - Approx. 135 mins @ 2.5K, 90 mins with gimbal on.

STRETCH GOAL #1 - $500K - Manual Exposure Control.
STRETCH GOAL #2 - $1 Million - Manual ISO Control and Digital Zoom.

We have the concept for Idolcam for couple of years now and last year, we try to raise fund with the Idolcam 3D prototype but it didn't perform well as we want. But we didn't give up rather; we spent the past year investing in developing Idolcam to bring it near production ready state. We are passionate about Idolcam and we will make every effort to make it the best product we possibly can.

<p>Whereas most VR cameras require you to do the image stitching yourself, Hubblo does all the hard work in camera, saving hours of tedious post-processing. It gathers data from all six cameras simultaneously; correcting and stitching images in real-time to create a stunning 360° spherical, 3D-immersive video stream. The video can be broadcasted or stored in 4K 30fps quality, and viewed with any cellphone VR headset using the Hubblo iOS and Android apps.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p> </p>
</div><p><strong>Q: </strong>Are 6 lenses enough to capture a 360° panorama?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Some cameras use just 1 or 2 lenses, others use 12 or more! Less lenses means lower quality, but more lenses can mean mountains of data. Hubblo PX6 is designed to be both portable and high quality. Watch our sample videos to see for yourself!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Why is real-time stitching technology such a big deal?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> With real-time stitching you not only save bags of money on software, but also a lot of time. Manually post-processing a short video could take hours and involve a highly complex workflow. On top of all that, real-time stitching makes live streaming as simple as point and shoot. Until Hubblo came along real-time stitching and 3D 360 4K live streaming was only possible for professionals. Now anyone can do it with the push of a button!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Is the stitching template-based or optical flow?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Optical flow requires 10-fold computation, which is very big and very hungry! If you’re not making a Hollywood movie then all that power is very inefficient, so the PX6 uses template-based stitching instead. It means you can achieve optimal quality for today’s technology, along with an affordable price tag.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Does the PX6 perform well in low light?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> You can control exposure using the Hubblo Camera Control smartphone app, available for iOS and Android.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>How is the battery life and potential for overheating?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> With a 4000mAH battery we estimate you could live stream for around 1 hour. The smartphone app has a battery status indicator so you’ll know how much juice you’ve got left. If you need to recharge, it will take around 3 hours to charge from scratch. You can also use a 10,000mAH external power pack to increase its longevity. Heat dissipation depends on the environment. If you’re heading to the Sahara desert then bring a few ice packs along with you… The PX6 is constructed from aluminum-alloy with air intakes at the top and bottom, as well as a fan for increased ventilation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What accessories will I need?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The Hubblo PX6 is a standalone camera so you don’t really need any accessories beyond an external battery pack or power adapter and a smartphone. The stitching is optimized so the camera can be mounted on a monopod or tripod (via a standard 1/4 inch tripod mount) with no blind spot below. Additionally, if you need to capture ambisonic audio or clear speech we recommend you use external microphones which can be connected to the camera via a 3.5mm mic jack on the camera.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>How much video can I record at once?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The camera itself has 32GB internal memory, plus a Micro-SD card slot supporting up to 128GB*. At 4K 30fps, we estimate you could record for around 4.5 hours with just 64GB. The smartphone app will show you how much space you have left. If you’re live streaming, however, the capacity for cloud storage is practically limitless.</p><p>* SD card not included. PX6 supports micro SD cards upto SDHC and SDXC.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Does Hubblo offer a warranty?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> We offer a one-year warranty for hardware faults. Terms and conditions apply.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Will you offer worldwide delivery?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> We will definitely deliver to the USA, Europe and most of Asia. If you can’t find your country listed on Indiegogo then please contact us to confirm.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>When will the Hubblo PX6 be ready for delivery?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Production is scheduled for June and delivery in July.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Is there an HDR mode?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The PX6 doesn’t support HDR.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What is the wifi range?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> The effective range is 10 - 20 meters.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Will the API be made available?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488283576/utytbatjezjjdzylgazp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Performance Without Compromise</h2><p>Eric Tsang, a hardware pioneer who worked at OPTi, Broadcom, and bFrame Logic is a self-proclaimed “hardware geek” with a special interest in video related technology.

It gathers data from all six cameras simultaneously; correcting and stitching images in real-time to create a stunning 360° spherical, 3D-immersive video stream. The video can be broadcasted or stored in 4K 30fps quality, and viewed with any cellphone VR headset using the Hubblo iOS and Android apps.



Using biomimicry to simulate immersive 3D vision, as well as in-hardware (not software) processing, the PX6 offers VR prosumers and enthusiasts a long awaited one-click solution that’s about the same height as an iPhone 6.
The triangular design delivers 360° spherical, panoramic vision with three pairs of 200° fish-eye lenses. Dedicated sensors on each lens provide the high quality image-capture free from gaps at the top or bottom of the image creating true-to-life depth perception for a fully-immersive 3D experience.

For professionals who need to show multiple scenes simultaneously,  connect multiple PX6 cameras to a live-streaming server and you have a very powerful, affordable VR broadcasting platform that’s suitable for huge events with massive audience interactions.The Hubblo VR camera is portable and lightweight, handheld or tripod mountable. The height of the camera is less than an iPhone 6! You don’t need any additional software, just high speed Internet access and cell phone apps that can be downloaded for iOS or Android. Setup is easy as can be; just connect to your network and live stream at the click of a button. Hubblo, isn’t only looks, speed and futuristic tech, it’s also a safe bet. The PX6 is being created by a 20+ member team - led by CEO Eric Tsang - a former Silicon Valley engineer who worked for the likes of OPTi, bFrame Logic and Broadcom. After 10 years in the US, Eric came back to Shanghai and went on to found two startups including Montage Technology Group that achieved IPO and a 70+ million dollar valuation.From left to right, top to bottom: Eric (CEO), Dan (Global Marketing), Sunny (App designer), Stephen (Hardware engineer), Max (Social media), Peter (Hardware engineer), Craig (General Manager), Janus (Hardware engineer), Myka (Social media), Supercat (App designer), Jack (Software engineer), Tina (Graphic designer), Lucky (App designer), Somepig (App designer), Vincent (Software engineer), Warnus (Software engineer), Jane (Accounting), Steve (Hardware engineer), Yuntao (Software engineer), Bobby (Graphic designer)Lexy Savvides demoes Hubblo VR live streaming for CNETCES 2017 & Last Gadget Standing Finalist

FAQ
 
Q: Are 6 lenses enough to capture a 360° panorama?A: Some cameras use just 1 or 2 lenses, others use 12 or more! Less lenses means lower quality, but more lenses can mean mountains of data. Hubblo PX6 is designed to be both portable and high quality. Watch our sample videos to see for yourself! Q: Why is real-time stitching technology such a big deal?A: With real-time stitching you not only save bags of money on software, but also a lot of time. Manually post-processing a short video could take hours and involve a highly complex workflow. On top of all that, real-time stitching makes live streaming as simple as point and shoot. Until Hubblo came along real-time stitching and 3D 360 4K live streaming was only possible for professionals. Now anyone can do it with the push of a button! Q: Is the stitching template-based or optical flow?A: Optical flow requires 10-fold computation, which is very big and very hungry! If you’re not making a Hollywood movie then all that power is very inefficient, so the PX6 uses template-based stitching instead. It means you can achieve optimal quality for today’s technology, along with an affordable price tag. Q: Does the PX6 perform well in low light?A: You can control exposure using the Hubblo Camera Control smartphone app, available for iOS and Android. Q: How is the battery life and potential for overheating?A: With a 4000mAH battery we estimate you could live stream for around 1 hour. The smartphone app has a battery status indicator so you’ll know how much juice you’ve got left. If you need to recharge, it will take around 3 hours to charge from scratch. You can also use a 10,000mAH external power pack to increase its longevity. Heat dissipation depends on the environment. If you’re heading to the Sahara desert then bring a few ice packs along with you… The PX6 is constructed from aluminum-alloy with air intakes at the top and bottom, as well as a fan for increased ventilation. Q: What accessories will I need?A: The Hubblo PX6 is a standalone camera so you don’t really need any accessories beyond an external battery pack or power adapter and a smartphone. The stitching is optimized so the camera can be mounted on a monopod or tripod (via a standard 1/4 inch tripod mount) with no blind spot below. Additionally, if you need to capture ambisonic audio or clear speech we recommend you use external microphones which can be connected to the camera via a 3.5mm mic jack on the camera. Q: How much video can I record at once?A: The camera itself has 32GB internal memory, plus a Micro-SD card slot supporting up to 128GB*. At 4K 30fps, we estimate you could record for around 4.5 hours with just 64GB. The smartphone app will show you how much space you have left. If you’re live streaming, however, the capacity for cloud storage is practically limitless.* SD card not included. PX6 supports micro SD cards upto SDHC and SDXC. Q: Does Hubblo offer a warranty?A: We offer a one-year warranty for hardware faults. Terms and conditions apply. Q: Will you offer worldwide delivery?A: We will definitely deliver to the USA, Europe and most of Asia. If you can’t find your country listed on Indiegogo then please contact us to confirm. Q: When will the Hubblo PX6 be ready for delivery?A: Production is scheduled for June and delivery in July. Q: Is there an HDR mode?A: The PX6 doesn’t support HDR. Q: What is the wifi range?A: The effective range is 10 - 20 meters. Q: Will the API be made available?A: Yes.Performance Without CompromiseEric Tsang, a hardware pioneer who worked at OPTi, Broadcom, and bFrame Logic is a self-proclaimed “hardware geek” with a special interest in video related technology. He started Hubblo out of frustration with the trade-offs in existing 3D recording technology. “We wanted to deliver an all-in-one package: 4K live streaming and great stitching; 360-degrees and full 3D vision; affordability and great design. None of the winners of this year’s CES Innovation Awards in virtual reality categories, for example, have all of these features in a single package.”His last startup project, Montage Technology Group reached IPO in 2014 valuing over $70 million. He headed the main product line, TV set top boxes that accounted for around 90% of the company’s profits at the time of IPO.The Hubblo team has developed patent-pending hardware algorithms that deliver stunning video correction and stitching using FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) as the developing framework, and optimizing the outcome with RTL (Register Transfer Level) hardware programming logic. “We are making products for 2 to 3 years in the future, not copying something that already exists,” Tsang said.  “Our core innovation has to do with video streaming quality and immersiveness; this tech is at least one year ahead of the market.”About Hubblo TechnologyHubblo Technology is a leading developer of pro-consumer grade VR technology for artists, performers, and anyone that wants to share a live, 3D-immersive experience with remote audiences. The company’s flagship product, the Hubblo PX6 offers an unprecedented combination of features including 360° recording, 4K resolution, real-time stitching, and live streaming for just $999*. Hubblo Technology was founded by video technology pioneer Eric Tsang and has offices in China and Silicon Valley.

We are a team of professionals from Finland. We wanted to create modern photo and video light for our own use as there wasn't suitable product available on the market. The prototype turned out to be so good that we wanted to turn it to a real product. Now we need your help to get the production up and running and lights flashing!



We have designed totally new high quality flash and constant light source for photography and video recording. It is fully featured and ready to use out of the box. It features micro-controller and it can be updated and you can make changes to the firmware as you want, it's open source.

The world's first programmable flash for photography and videography.






You can use it as a flash or as a constant light source. It’s also possible to combine these two to get modelling light and flash.




It is really fast and easy to create different lighting
setups with the VALO flash. Use it as main light, hair light, fill light or background
light.
Take one VALO with you for a photo walk or crate large
studio lighting setups, you can always add on.





Flash and video light in one
Modular design to build huge light panels or just use as single light source.
Adjustable color temperature 2700K...5700K via mobile app
Power control via mobile app
Compatible with Android and iPhone/iPad
Zero flash recycling time
Wireless radio frequency triggering
Easy to use and get started. Endless possibilities via programming.
Compatible with all cameras with hot shoe or flash port.
Custom functions: Flash, Modelling Light, Flash + Modelling Light, Strobe
Snap connect flash to another. No wires!
Standard 3/8"" thread on bottom for easy mounting
Internal battery. Charging via USB connector
Sync via hot shoe, sync cable, light sensitive slave or go wireless 
Black, non reflective housing
Powerful and energy efficient LEDs
Made of high quality materials



The flash units connect to each other by neodymium magnets. Electrical connection is made by contacts on each side. There is no
need to connect any wires or adapters. This makes VALO the fastest and easiest
to use LED flash on the market.

You don't have to have flat light source anymore. With VALO you can have 1/4 circle, half circle or even full circle of light and get creative! You can even make custom shapes, for example letters.





Technical specifications are subject to change. The features and values here are considered as minimum requirement for the design.



To get the most out of your VALO we suggest using four or more units interconnected. This ensures powerful and even light from larger area to complement the subject.
There is 1 inch graphic display and control buttons on back of the unit. The high power LED’s are on the front. Contacts for interconnecting the units are on each side.








After initial planning the concept was clear and we were ready to push the project forward. The fun part for engineers.

</div>
<div>By focusing light onto a piece of Photographic Paper for long periods of time [from weeks to years] the Light Wait Camera [LWC] captures trails left by the sun. Traditional landmarks gain an ephemeral feel, as the movements of people and vehicles are too fast to be captured on a Solargraph. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A Pinhole Camera uses a really small hole as its ""lens"" - no complicated optics required. The tiny hole enables a sharp picture to be formed on the film. The LWC is essentially a solargraphy-optimized analogue pinhole camera. But with the super long exposures involved, t<span style=""font-size: medium;"">here's no messy chemicals, no darkroom equipment, no safelights to worry about. Your film comes out of the camera fully exposed and developed. To digitise your shots, all you need is a scanner or even a mobile phone's camera. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span></div>
<div>In other words, it's a ready-to-shoot package that lets you take your own Solargraphs at a fraction of the time, cost and effort required to build your own pinhole camera. Like the GoPro of pinhole photography, the LWC can be left outdoors for years and still thrive!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>While anyone can build a pinhole camera with sufficient time, effort and money, being able to buy a pre-made camera and simply expose the photo would remove significant barriers to entry. This will allow everyone to take solargraphs as easily as they would snap a picture with their cellphones. [The only difference being the amount of time captured by the camera.]</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With this Project, we hope to ignite a <i>revival</i> of <b>Solargraphy</b>.</div>

<h3>About Solargraphy</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Time Lapse Videography has completely changed the way we see the world. The passage of days, weeks and months is compressed thousands of times, and the best hyperlapse videos are works of utter genius.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Solargraphy is the Photographic equivalent of the time lapse video. Picture a semitransparent ghost image of a new building - a picture taken over 4 years as the building is slowly constructed. Or bright white lines that fill the sky, shifting trails left by the passage of the sun over many weeks. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/940676/files/20141018115535-Screen_Shot_2014-10-19_at_2.55.22_am.png?1413658535"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>
</p>
<p>In many ways, it is the exact antithesis to the increasing demand today for instant results. The Solargrapher plants his camera, and then he waits. And waits. And waits. But the result is something that you can never see with the naked eye. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The beauty of the Solargraph is undeniable. It is thus a complete tragedy that it is nowhere near as ubiquitous as the time lapse video. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Google for solargraphs of your city, and you will be hard-pressed to find any.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The Light Wait project will change that.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By bringing <i>simple, affordable</i>, <i>tough</i>, and <i>great</i>-<i>quality</i> Solargraphy Cameras to <b>you</b>, the Light Wait project aims to ignite a revival of Solargraphy. </p>
<p>Instead of hunting down parts, scrounging around for old film canisters, trying to drill a perfect pinhole, all you’d need to do focus on the creative process. Every Light Wait Camera comes pre-loaded with film, and all you have to do is to pick the best place to plant the Light Wait Camera.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the sheer amount of light that the camera is exposed to results in an “instant” image - there’s no need to send your camera to the lab. In fact, you don’t even need a darkroom to process your shots, you simply remove the film from the camera - the sheer amount light ""automatically"" exposes and develops the film!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But the Light Wait Camera is only the means to and end. The true purpose of the Project is to make Solargraphy a part of <i>every photographer’s vocabulary</i>. It is to enable everyone to appreciate the ephemeral beauty of the places they live in. And YOU can be part of that.</p>

<h3>How the Light Wait Camera [LWC] Works</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It’s really simple. All you need is a scanner, a stable place to plant your camera, and time. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>1 - FIND a good spot</b></p>
<p>This should be a firm, stable surface. Solargraphs only work if they’re taken of outdoor scenes, so plan accordingly. It helps to aim your camera north or south, so that the Sun Trails will travel ACROSS your shot!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>2 - PLANT your camera</b></p>
<p>Aim your LWC’s pinhole. Remove the backing from the included 3M Command Adhesive, and mount it to your camera. Then plant your camera on the spot you picked. Remove the little piece of black tape covering the pinhole.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>3 - WAIT.</b></p>
<p>No, don’t wait there. Taking a solargraphic Selfie is probable not a good idea, either, unless you are prepared to sit unmoving in the same spot for a week. This step will take a fortnight at least. One-week photos do work, but the image will be very feint. So give it time, a month or two is best! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>4 - RECOVER your camera</b></p>
<p>While holding on to the camera, pull the little tab on the 3M Command Adhesive to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>5 - SCAN your pictures</b></p>
<p>The resulting short will be orange-on-white: this is an inverted image! Scan in the picture or take a photo of it using a digital camera or smartphone. Invert the resulting image using your favourite photo editor!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>6 - SHARE the love!</b></p>
<p>Put it up as your cover photo, print an immense floor-to-ceiling version of your masterpiece - it’s entirely up to you! Just make sure that the picture is not forgotten on your hard disk: share the Solargraphic Love!</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Fully functioning cameras have taken <b>all the solargraphs</b> you see on this page! But we do face several limitations:</p>
<p>Currently, we have been cutting our film ""by feel"" while completely blind in the dark. Also, the round film canisters used as our camera bodies don't respond too kindly to conventional drill bits.<br/></p>
<p>Also, analogue is Expensive. Even though we don't have to spend on costly darkroom chemicals, we would need to purchase a good film cutter and a red safelight in order to cut precise slips of photo paper. We will also require a drill press to work better with our pesky rounded film canisters. </p>
<p><b>All these will allow us to drastically ramp up production, allowing us to bring affordable Solargraphy to everyone!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, the last bit of funding will go towards increasing the online presence of the Light Wait project! Remember - this is about creating a Solargraphic Revolution, so it doesn’t matter what camera is used, as long as solargraphs are being taken!</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>My first solargraph is the Logo image of the Project, and that picture was taken with the ancient predecessor of the Light Wait Camera way back in 2008. As a proud owner of a still-functioning Canon EOS 30D, I have been passionate about Photography since I was 13. I was first hooked onto Photography when experimenting with 4-second long exposures on my ancient Kyocera point-and-shoot camera. Pinhole Photography was introduced to me when I was the president at the Raffles Junior College Photographic Society, and I’ve been fascinated since by the beauty and simple elegance of the Pinhole Camera. </p>

<p><b>The supply of film canisters</b> - film manufacturers are shifting to translucent canisters.

<p></p>
<h3>Technical Details </h3>
<p>In essence, the Light Wait Camera is a pinhole camera that lets you skip the developing and darkroom process due to its extreme exposure time. It saves you the trouble of having to purchase a huge batch of photographic paper only to cut a small piece out it in a pitch-black darkroom, or the trouble of light-proofing a soda-can pinhole camera. </p>
<p>More importantly, while building your own conventional pinhole camera is crazy fun, not all of them can withstand the rigours of being left outdoors in the sun for years. Also, imagine the emotional attachment you will have to the first pinhole camera you build - it’s not something you’d want to stick to the wall of a building.</p>
<p>Right now, the working prototypes have been tested and proven for optimal image quality. Take the build of the camera for example. While using a drink can to build a pinhole camera will produce satisfactory results during conventional exposure times, the length of a solargraphy exposure makes the internal reflections off aluminium unacceptable. As a result, Light Wait Cameras are built out of black film canisters ONLY. Even our Aperture Plates have been darkened with matte black spraypaint to reduce internal reflections. </p>
<p>Or consider our aperture plates. Every pinhole has been made with a 28 gauge needle, which is in turn replaced every 50 holes made. The ridiculously thin but incredibly strong stainless steel sheets used contribute to the sharpness of the resulting image.  Before we install them onto our cameras, each and every aperture is then light-tested for optimal roundness. A key goal behind our funding would be the ordering of customised, even-thinner needles for longer exposures and greater sharpness, and the purchase of a drill press to ensure consistent perforation of our film canisters.</p>

</div></div>","What would the world look like if you experienced time a hundred times as fast?


Buildings would spring into existence. You would see trees bend towards the light. People would move too quickly to be seen. The sun would streak through the sky like a bullet. Sounds impossible?


The $16 Light Wait Camera lets you see that.




By focusing light onto a piece of Photographic Paper for long periods of time [from weeks to years] the Light Wait Camera [LWC] captures trails left by the sun. Traditional landmarks gain an ephemeral feel, as the movements of people and vehicles are too fast to be captured on a Solargraph. 

A Pinhole Camera uses a really small hole as its ""lens"" - no complicated optics required. The tiny hole enables a sharp picture to be formed on the film. The LWC is essentially a solargraphy-optimized analogue pinhole camera. But with the super long exposures involved, there's no messy chemicals, no darkroom equipment, no safelights to worry about. Your film comes out of the camera fully exposed and developed. To digitise your shots, all you need is a scanner or even a mobile phone's camera. 


In other words, it's a ready-to-shoot package that lets you take your own Solargraphs at a fraction of the time, cost and effort required to build your own pinhole camera. Like the GoPro of pinhole photography, the LWC can be left outdoors for years and still thrive!

While anyone can build a pinhole camera with sufficient time, effort and money, being able to buy a pre-made camera and simply expose the photo would remove significant barriers to entry. This will allow everyone to take solargraphs as easily as they would snap a picture with their cellphones. [The only difference being the amount of time captured by the camera.]

With this Project, we hope to ignite a revival of Solargraphy.





About Solargraphy

Time Lapse Videography has completely changed the way we see the world. The passage of days, weeks and months is compressed thousands of times, and the best hyperlapse videos are works of utter genius.



Solargraphy is the Photographic equivalent of the time lapse video. Picture a semitransparent ghost image of a new building - a picture taken over 4 years as the building is slowly constructed. Or bright white lines that fill the sky, shifting trails left by the passage of the sun over many weeks. 




In many ways, it is the exact antithesis to the increasing demand today for instant results. The Solargrapher plants his camera, and then he waits. And waits. And waits. But the result is something that you can never see with the naked eye. 


The beauty of the Solargraph is undeniable. It is thus a complete tragedy that it is nowhere near as ubiquitous as the time lapse video. Google for solargraphs of your city, and you will be hard-pressed to find any.


The Light Wait project will change that.


By bringing simple, affordable, tough, and great-quality Solargraphy Cameras to you, the Light Wait project aims to ignite a revival of Solargraphy. 
Instead of hunting down parts, scrounging around for old film canisters, trying to drill a perfect pinhole, all you’d need to do focus on the creative process. Every Light Wait Camera comes pre-loaded with film, and all you have to do is to pick the best place to plant the Light Wait Camera.


As an added bonus, the sheer amount of light that the camera is exposed to results in an “instant” image - there’s no need to send your camera to the lab. In fact, you don’t even need a darkroom to process your shots, you simply remove the film from the camera - the sheer amount light ""automatically"" exposes and develops the film!


But the Light Wait Camera is only the means to and end. The true purpose of the Project is to make Solargraphy a part of every photographer’s vocabulary. It is to enable everyone to appreciate the ephemeral beauty of the places they live in. And YOU can be part of that.

We are a team of creatives who are eager to produce innovative, beautiful, functional & high-performance products.




 The core intention of ""MCZ"" is to persistently refine the DJI Mavic Pro Propeller appearance, functionality and performance through structural design, material technology and product knowledge.
MCZ~ MAVICPRO / Real Carbon Propeller
Our MCZ Carbon Fibre props were lovingly crafted, we try not to sacrifice real craftsmanship at the altar of expediency. They are built with care and passion, and presented with pride that befits a marvelously well-made item.We focused on the propeller parts and thought about how to improve the look, performance & safety.



AppearanceAlthough DJI already did a great job with the design, you may still want to modify your Mavic Pro with your own style. A team member, who is a car enthusiast brought the car accessory concept to the forefront of the MCZ project. We treat carbon fibre props like a  tire and our spinner as a rim.That is the reason why we have put so much care and     passion into our spinner. Right now we provide unique and stylishly finished rims for your Mavic Pro. 
PerformanceCarbon Fibre material maintains the same weight but is much stronger. Our MCZ Carbon props improve vertical lift, horizontal speed, reduce noise and provide the extra flight time.
Improve flight SafetyCarbon Fibre makes our prop much stronger. When you collide with vegetation using plastic props you may have a crash even if it is with smaller plants.But the MCZ series are much stronger, when your Mavic Pro collides with smaller vegetation, you should have no problem.These props allow you to reduce the braking distant, because MCZ carbon prop produce less inertia. Therefore the controls are more responsive and it is much easier to put on the brakes in an emergency situation.

Carbon Fibre Prop Balancing Every set of MCZ carbon fibre props go through a rigorous  post production balancing process to ensure our propellers are 100% balanced.
Carbon Fibre Propeller relative researchThere has been a lot of documentation supporting the claims that, Carbon fibre propellers perform up to 25% better than traditional plastic, wooden or even CFRP props.This leads to a more efficient flight, snappier response and quieter operation in all conditions, giving those extra minutes of air time that can make the difference when the battery gauge is approaching the lower threshold.Do you want your Mavic Pro more stylish or Unique?Do you want Extra flight time?Run time test MCZ-01 : 27Mins.48Sec vs Original 24Mins 55

<p dir=""ltr""><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What is it and why do I want it?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The ability to play 3D movies is a common feature in most of today’s TV’s, however the commercially available 3D cameras are both bulky and expensive. WANT3D presents Scandinavian design with a cheap and easy way for anyone to make their own 3D videos.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Making 3D videos is no magic, in fact it is both easy and fun, and also it is a great way of learning the basics of 2D as well as 3D filming and editing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong> </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How to use it?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Here follows a quick guide on how to create your first 3D video, if you have any questions please check out the in-depth video tutorial (coming soon!) or the FAQ. Otherwise you are most welcome to send us an email!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 1 - Mounting your phone</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Adjust the camera mount to fit your smartphone by sliding the brackets. Make sure that they tighten around the phone and fasten the screws, this’ll keep your phone in place making the video more steady.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you have pledged for the WANT3D professional edition, also attach the mount to the minitripod, this will greatly reduce the steadiness of the video hence improving performance. We recommend that the WANT3D system is used with some kind of tripod or other stabilizing equipment for optimal results.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 2 - Recording a video</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Navigate to your smartphones’ camera applications, switch them to video mode and start the recordning roughly simultaniously on both devices. The sync will be fine tuned later on in the computer. To further simplify the sync try to add some start signal, for example clap your hands in front of the cameras.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Note that the distances between the cameras should be of the order 5-7 centimeters (2-3 inches for those of you who fancy such units), this means that one phone will need to be flipped. Also the cameras should be adjusted into the same height using the long screws supplied  with your WANT3D system.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 3 - Getting your videos into your computer</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Connect your smartphones to your computer and navigate to your smartphones’ camera map, usually called DCIM, locate the video and copy it onto your hard drive. Note that you might have turn on USB-debugging or such in your smartphone in order to view it as a portable disc in your computer, for more information on this matter consult Google with the inquiry “connect phone to computer”, “browse files on phone over USB” or such.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Make sure to label your video files after which is from the smartphone to the right, and which is from the right!</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 4 - Converting the files</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Find a video converter that allows you to convert the files from your phone (usually .mp4 or .mov) into .avi files with the MPEG-2 codex. An easy way to do this is to download the “<a href=""http://www.videotovideo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Video to Video</a>” converter (direct link: <a href=""http://www.videotovideo.org/download/videotovideo_setup.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.videotovideo.org/download/videotovideo_setup.exe</a>). Install and open the program, choose “Add video” and navigate to your right and left videos. Mark “MPEG” II in the box that appears and in the table to the right that appears scroll to “Video Size”, choose the same video size as that which your smartphones output (usually full HD: 1920 x 1080), if you are unsure you can check under details under properties if you left click on your files. Also change “Video Bitrate” to something between 4000 and 8000.</p>

<p> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em> </em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 5 - Making the 3D video</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Download the program <a href=""http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stvmkr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stereo Video Maker</a> (direct link: <a href=""http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stvmkr/files/stvmkre130.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stvmkr/files/stvmkre130.zip</a>), and unpack it. Open the program and choose “Open Left/Right Movies”, navigate to your movies and add first the left movie and then the right. Note that the video from camera that you flipped need to be inverted, to do this simply check the“Invert” box for this video when adding the videos.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In Stereo Video Maker you will want to make two corrections to your video: sync and 3D focus. To synchronize the videos play them by clicking the screen once, stop right after you see your start signal from Step 2 by clicking again, and fine tune the timing by using the arrows underlined red and blue at the bottom of the window in such a way that the two videos shows start signal simultaneously.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Now navigate to “Easy Adjustment” under ""Adjust"", and use the bars to adjust the focus of the video, double click the image to zoom. You will want to focus at something at the back of the image, e.g. a lamp post, power outlet, tree, or such. To do this, slide the bars so that the cyan and red images completely overlap at this point.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Now save your 3D video by choosing “Save as Stereo Video” under “File”. When asked if you want to compress the image choose Microsoft Video and choose quality 75.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Step 6 - Playing your 3D video</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The quickest way of viewing your video in 3D is to download the media player <a href=""http://www.3dtv.at/Products/Player/Index_en.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stereoscopic Player</a>, direct link: <a href=""http://www.3dtv.at/Downloads/StereoscopicPlayer207_en.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.3dtv.at/Downloads/StereoscopicPlayer207_en.exe</a>. Open the 3D video you created in Step 5 and in the dialog box choose “Side by Side, Left Image First”. Now go to View → Viewing method and choose “Side by Side, Left Image First” and under View → Aspect Ratio choose “Half Width”. Now connect your computer to your 3DTV and play the video.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Finally, if you want to share the video with others simply upload it to youtube adding the tag “yt3d:enable=true”, this way the video will be displayed in 3D.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What devices does it work with?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The WANT3D camera system works with most major smartphone brands, you don’t even have to use two phones of the same brand och size! However, if you use different phone models it is strongly recommended to have some skills in video editing since one of the videos may have to be cropped.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We have tested the WANT3D with Iphone 4 / 4S / 5, Samsung Galaxy S3 / S4, Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC one X. Other brands or models should work as well provided that they meet the maximum measurement requirements shown below:</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Maximum phone width: 140 mm (5.5”)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Maximum thickness: 10 mm (0.4”)</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em>Is there any max length for the video?</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nope, the only limitation is the amount of space on your hard drive and smart phones.</p></div>","The WANT3D system makes it possible to record your own 3D videos, all you need is two smartphones!
 
 

 
What is it and why do I want it?
The ability to play 3D movies is a common feature in most of today’s TV’s, however the commercially available 3D cameras are both bulky and expensive. WANT3D presents Scandinavian design with a cheap and easy way for anyone to make their own 3D videos.
Making 3D videos is no magic, in fact it is both easy and fun, and also it is a great way of learning the basics of 2D as well as 3D filming and editing.
 

 
What do I get?
 

 
How to use it?
Here follows a quick guide on how to create your first 3D video, if you have any questions please check out the in-depth video tutorial (coming soon!) or the FAQ. Otherwise you are most welcome to send us an email!
Step 1 - Mounting your phone
Adjust the camera mount to fit your smartphone by sliding the brackets. Make sure that they tighten around the phone and fasten the screws, this’ll keep your phone in place making the video more steady.
If you have pledged for the WANT3D professional edition, also attach the mount to the minitripod, this will greatly reduce the steadiness of the video hence improving performance. We recommend that the WANT3D system is used with some kind of tripod or other stabilizing equipment for optimal results.
Step 2 - Recording a video
Navigate to your smartphones’ camera applications, switch them to video mode and start the recordning roughly simultaniously on both devices. The sync will be fine tuned later on in the computer. To further simplify the sync try to add some start signal, for example clap your hands in front of the cameras.
Note that the distances between the cameras should be of the order 5-7 centimeters (2-3 inches for those of you who fancy such units), this means that one phone will need to be flipped. Also the cameras should be adjusted into the same height using the long screws supplied  with your WANT3D system.
Step 3 - Getting your videos into your computer
Connect your smartphones to your computer and navigate to your smartphones’ camera map, usually called DCIM, locate the video and copy it onto your hard drive. Note that you might have turn on USB-debugging or such in your smartphone in order to view it as a portable disc in your computer, for more information on this matter consult Google with the inquiry “connect phone to computer”, “browse files on phone over USB” or such.
Make sure to label your video files after which is from the smartphone to the right, and which is from the right!
Step 4 - Converting the files
Find a video converter that allows you to convert the files from your phone (usually .mp4 or .mov) into .avi files with the MPEG-2 codex. An easy way to do this is to download the “Video to Video” converter (direct link: http://www.videotovideo.org/download/videotovideo_setup.exe). Install and open the program, choose “Add video” and navigate to your right and left videos. Mark “MPEG” II in the box that appears and in the table to the right that appears scroll to “Video Size”, choose the same video size as that which your smartphones output (usually full HD: 1920 x 1080), if you are unsure you can check under details under properties if you left click on your files. Also change “Video Bitrate” to something between 4000 and 8000.
 

 
 
Step 5 - Making the 3D video
Download the program Stereo Video Maker (direct link: http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stvmkr/files/stvmkre130.zip), and unpack it. Open the program and choose “Open Left/Right Movies”, navigate to your movies and add first the left movie and then the right. Note that the video from camera that you flipped need to be inverted, to do this simply check the“Invert” box for this video when adding the videos.
In Stereo Video Maker you will want to make two corrections to your video: sync and 3D focus. To synchronize the videos play them by clicking the screen once, stop right after you see your start signal from Step 2 by clicking again, and fine tune the timing by using the arrows underlined red and blue at the bottom of the window in such a way that the two videos shows start signal simultaneously.
 

 
Now navigate to “Easy Adjustment” under ""Adjust"", and use the bars to adjust the focus of the video, double click the image to zoom. You will want to focus at something at the back of the image, e.g. a lamp post, power outlet, tree, or such. To do this, slide the bars so that the cyan and red images completely overlap at this point.
 

 
Now save your 3D video by choosing “Save as Stereo Video” under “File”. When asked if you want to compress the image choose Microsoft Video and choose quality 75.
Step 6 - Playing your 3D video
The quickest way of viewing your video in 3D is to download the media player Stereoscopic Player, direct link: http://www.3dtv.at/Downloads/StereoscopicPlayer207_en.exe. Open the 3D video you created in Step 5 and in the dialog box choose “Side by Side, Left Image First”. Now go to View → Viewing method and choose “Side by Side, Left Image First” and under View → Aspect Ratio choose “Half Width”. Now connect your computer to your 3DTV and play the video.
Finally, if you want to share the video with others simply upload it to youtube adding the tag “yt3d:enable=true”, this way the video will be displayed in 3D.

<p> </p>
<p><em>Blumoth is a new gadget which connects your digital camera to your smartphone via Bluetooth, opening up a world of opportunities. We have built an intuitive smartphone app which allows you to take control on your camera and share photos over the Internet in just a few taps. </em></p>
<p>
</p>
<div> <p></p>
<p>With Blumoth you can use your smartphone or tablet to: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>View and share the pictures saved on your camera </li>
<li>View the camera’s live view screen and take pictures remotely </li>
<li>Adjust shooting settings and set the camera trigger to take automatic shooting sequences </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>It is the perfect way to share high quality photography on the Internet, wherever you are, whenever you want – without the need for a laptop or WiFi connection. Blumoth has been designed for people like us, who love being outdoor, taking great photos and sharing them with the world. The Blumoth app makes it simple to take advantage of digital camera’s functionality from your phone’s screen. </p>
<p>We have already developed an operational prototype of Blumoth, including an Android app, and we’re already testing it on different camera models. Now we need your help to complete the project and get Blumoth into production. In the future we’re also planning to make it available for iPhone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Blumoth connected to a camera"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://blumoth.com/files/images/blumoth_with_camera_large.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Blumoth connected to a camera""/></p>
<h1>How Blumoth Works</h1>
<p><strong>Wireless Connectivity </strong></p>
<p>Using Blumoth is easy – simply plug the device into your camera, turn on the Bluetooth and pair it with your smartphone.You will then be able to use your phone to access the camera.</p>
<p><strong>Liveview and Camera Control</strong></p>
<p>With Liveview feature you can view your camera’s live screen on your phone. This means you can see through the camera’s viewfinder even when you are feet away from it so you can see what you shoot. Additionally, you can adjust shooting settings and shoot photos remotely. </p>
<p><strong>Download and Share Photos </strong></p>
<p>When your camera is connected to Blumoth you can use your smartphone to view all of the photos that are saved on your camera. When entering the Device Gallery screen, these photos will first come up as thumbnails. You can then select the photos you want to save to your phone, download them and then share them any way you like - on social networks, by email or any other way. Local Gallery will keep and provide access to all downloaded photos on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>“Timelapse” and other pre-programmed tasks </strong></p>
<p>One of the key features of Blumoth is programmed shooting. The device allows you to make timelapses, HDR, bracketing or even create a custom script that changes the camera’s parameters and shoots photos over a period of time. </p>
<p><strong>Ease of Use </strong></p>
<p>The Blumoth app is very intuitive and easy to use. A simple user interface has been designed to allow photographers to take control of their cameras in seconds. The Blumoth device itself is so small and lightweight that you will soon see it as an extension of your camera. It is powered by a long standing rechargeable battery, so you will always have the power you need. </p>
<p><strong>Simplifying Your Photography Experience </strong></p>
<p>We all carry our smartphones with us all the time, so we always have an Internet connection in our pockets. Blumoth allows you to harness that online power and extend your camera’s functionalities further than you could have imagined. With Blumoth you can leave your laptop at home and forget about investing in an expensive automatic triggering hardware.</p>

We are a team of friends who like sports. My personal preference is downhill skiing and biking. It can be a challenge to take a video of yourself doing sports. Holding an ordinary selfie stick takes one hand out of the action which is not acceptable in some sports like skiing, biking and many others. This is why we’ve designed Q-Rig -  the Hands Free Selfie Rig which holds the selfie sticks for you. Specifically, the selfie sticks are mounted on a helmet. Q-Rig is light and doesn’t obstruct head movement.</p><p>The unique self-leveling feature stabilizes camera for better video. No more hands “glued” to the selfie stick on your videos. Both of your hands are free for action.</p><p>To make design simple, robust, waterproof and affordable there are no electronics and batteries.</p><p>Q-Rig is crowd friendly. Selfie sticks are easy to collapse when you are in a chair lift or just done recording. As Q-Rig is lightweight it can be left on the helmet even if not in use.</p><p>Q-Rig is highly customizable. Another selfie sticks can be installed and it’s easy to replace parts if they were broken in action.</p><p>3D printing technology allowed us to go through a series of different designs and test all of them. What you see is a fully functional prototype.</p><h3>Q-Rig benefits</h3><p>To summarize the advantages (our goals during the design phase) of Q-Rig:</p><ul>
<li>Hands free;</li>
<li>Lightweight, shouldn’t obstruct head movement;</li>
<li>Self-stabilized (patent pending);</li>
<li>Flexible/modular, allow use of wide range of existing equipment like selfie sticks;</li>
<li>Waterproof;</li>
<li>Easy to use and transport (foldable);</li>
<li>Easy to take apart (for cleaning);</li>
<li>Flexible packaging: the whole set-up or just the pivot mount (Q-Rig core);</li>
<li>Made in USA;</li>
<li>Affordable;</li>
</ul><p>Q-Rig was tested with GoPro cameras, but widely available adapters allow use of any action camera including 360<sup>0</sup> ones.</p><h3>Set-ups</h3><p>There are two ways to set-up Q-Rig: self-stabilized and high point of view.</p><p><u>Self-stabilized set-up</u></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508108869/ynsowtkfalelx8v0xfnk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>With this set-up selfie sticks are pointing slightly down and Q-rig center of gravity is lower than the mounting point. This results in self-leveling, supports additional image stabilization and doesn't restrict head movements.</p><p>Second camera or a water tight case filled with water can be used as a counterweight. There is no limit to your creativity. It's possible to use a sound system as a counterweight or you can get rid of the camera altogether, mount two sound systems and enjoy a stereo sound :-)</p><p><u>High point of view set-up</u></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508109359/f2yqn6n9umgm0tgt57oe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In some cases it is important to make video from a higher point of view. I such case Q-Rig core is mounted ""upside down"" and selfie sticks are pointing slightly up. Due to the higher center of gravity the self-leveling feature is off, but point of view is higher.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508306926/rgzqmbsffergoxtbevsc.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>To ensure the secure coupling between Q-Rig core and GoPro mounting buckle the thumb screw #1 should be tighten up with GoPro wrench.</p><p>Thumb screw #2 can be tightened to dampen or prevent movement of the upper part of the Q-Rig (the selfie stick holder.)</p><h3>Packaging</h3><p>There are 6 packages.</p><p><u>#1 Golden Core</u></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508306698/fzhb8vu9qcjsaogrco0p.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The package includes:</p><ul>

This is where we need your help!</p><p>Supply chain is ready. The missing parts are molds for the injection molding which will be used to manufacture Q-Rig core. Injection molding company will use the same 3D models of the parts that were used in 3D printing process, so starting production is the matter of signing the contract.</p><p><strong>We believe that you deserve to have and share video of your most exciting moments. This is why we created the Q-Rig - a hands-free selfie rig that is lightweight, easy to use, and affordable. Get the word out and let Q-Rig become a reality!</strong></p></div>","OverviewHello, I’m Sergiy and have a pleasure to present the Hands Free Selfie Rig to you.

Holding an ordinary selfie stick takes one hand out of the action which is not acceptable in some sports like skiing, biking and many others. This is why we’ve designed Q-Rig -  the Hands Free Selfie Rig which holds the selfie sticks for you. Specifically, the selfie sticks are mounted on a helmet. Q-Rig is light and doesn’t obstruct head movement.The unique self-leveling feature stabilizes camera for better video. No more hands “glued” to the selfie stick on your videos. Both of your hands are free for action.To make design simple, robust, waterproof and affordable there are no electronics and batteries.Q-Rig is crowd friendly. Selfie sticks are easy to collapse when you are in a chair lift or just done recording. As Q-Rig is lightweight it can be left on the helmet even if not in use.Q-Rig is highly customizable. Another selfie sticks can be installed and it’s easy to replace parts if they were broken in action.3D printing technology allowed us to go through a series of different designs and test all of them. What you see is a fully functional prototype.Q-Rig benefitsTo summarize the advantages (our goals during the design phase) of Q-Rig:
Hands free;
Lightweight, shouldn’t obstruct head movement;
Self-stabilized (patent pending);
Flexible/modular, allow use of wide range of existing equipment like selfie sticks;
Waterproof;
Easy to use and transport (foldable);
Easy to take apart (for cleaning);
Flexible packaging: the whole set-up or just the pivot mount (Q-Rig core);
Made in USA;
Affordable;
Q-Rig was tested with GoPro cameras, but widely available adapters allow use of any action camera including 3600 ones.Set-upsThere are two ways to set-up Q-Rig: self-stabilized and high point of view.Self-stabilized set-upWith this set-up selfie sticks are pointing slightly down and Q-rig center of gravity is lower than the mounting point. This results in self-leveling, supports additional image stabilization and doesn't restrict head movements.Second camera or a water tight case filled with water can be used as a counterweight. There is no limit to your creativity. It's possible to use a sound system as a counterweight or you can get rid of the camera altogether, mount two sound systems and enjoy a stereo sound :-)High point of view set-upIn some cases it is important to make video from a higher point of view. I such case Q-Rig core is mounted ""upside down"" and selfie sticks are pointing slightly up. Due to the higher center of gravity the self-leveling feature is off, but point of view is higher.To ensure the secure coupling between Q-Rig core and GoPro mounting buckle the thumb screw #1 should be tighten up with GoPro wrench.Thumb screw #2 can be tightened to dampen or prevent movement of the upper part of the Q-Rig (the selfie stick holder.)PackagingThere are 6 packages.#1 Golden CoreThe package includes:
Q-Rig Core with ""Golden"" clamps;
GoPro wrench (to tight GoPro screws);
Add your selfie sticks, counterweight, camera and you are ready to go.#2 Black Diamond CoreThe package includes:

Add your camera and you are ready to go.Let's do it!We are passionate about supporting US manufacturers, so the plan is to produce Q-Rig core right here in US.Crowdfunding will allow starting the mass production and bring our product to the market at a very affordable price. This is where we need your help!Supply chain is ready. The missing parts are molds for the injection molding which will be used to manufacture Q-Rig core. Injection molding company will use the same 3D models of the parts that were used in 3D printing process, so starting production is the matter of signing the contract.We believe that you deserve to have and share video of your most exciting moments. This is why we created the Q-Rig - a hands-free selfie rig that is lightweight, easy to use, and affordable. Get the word out and let Q-Rig become a reality!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We spent a lot of time in research to find a material that would look good, be comfortable and take the weight of a dSLR &amp; lens.

TIMELINE RISK and CHALLENGESWe at NAVIN have previously brought crowdfunded ProView S3 smartphone stabilizer to the hands of our backers and successfully launched to the market. We have working prototype of ProView G3, so there should be little chance for surprises later on. That being said, no manufacturing could be guaranteed without hiccups or delay beforehand. It could due to other sudden large order shortening originally planned capacity, or delay in receiving ordered materials, and so on. We have sufficient experience to reduce such risk to minimum. If there is a delay that will shift our shipping timeline, we will update you. We'll bend over backwards to get ProView G3 to you.  Thanks you!The NAVIN Team Media kit available here: http://bit.ly/2CnpyCs Email Contact: info@navin.com.tw =================================================================Below is in above contents in Chinese.  ProView G3 穿載式雲台為 GoPro 動相機提供三軸穩定, 讓您在極限運動中拍出的影片能有專業攝影般的流暢.穿載應用如同 GoPro 相機是以穿戴應用為主, ProView G3 設計也一樣是以穿戴應用為考量. 其底部與後方的 1/4 英吋螺孔讓您可以把它栓在您平常栓 GoPro 相機處來提供三軸穩定效果. 消除影像搖晃ProView G3 讓您輕鬆拍出專業般的流暢穩定畫質.

<p>We created a camera that will deliver images in all direction with one click. NEO is equipped with two pairs of 190’ fisheyes lenses that are placed back and forth, which brings up an image of a fish in a standing posture. Each lens collects 180’ horizontal and 130’ vertical view, which allows you to check all 620’ views at the same time.</p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING NEO
 
We created a camera that will deliver images in all direction with one click. NEO is equipped with two pairs of 190’ fisheyes lenses that are placed back and forth, which brings up an image of a fish in a standing posture. Each lens collects 180’ horizontal and 130’ vertical view, which allows you to check all 620’ views at the same time.

How NEO Works
 
Each Lens

Real Time Stitching

NEO captures two distinct images and stitches in real time. When you begin recording, NEO automatically stitches all the images it captured. 
 
 
 
 
WHY NEO?
 
 
620' Cylindrical Panorama 

 
 
Problems in real-time image processing in embedded environment
Processing through individual operations on limited resources is difficult to process in real time. This is why other IP cameras are dependent on specific PCs or high-end mobile devices. 
Neo is able to collect each step results into one LUT(coordianate reference table). It will drive into reducing the time by excecuting  simple iterative accelerated operation based on GPU. 
 

Easy to Setup and Easy to USE!

 
In build wifi NEO can be installed without any electric wires!
•Without DVR, NEO can be placed in anywhere to record on its own. Controlled directly from Internet and Smart devices, NEO allows you to monitor in real-time and check the recorded videos.

<p>Lifting your stabilizer shouldn’t come with a groan. Or back pain (remember, bend those knees!). Pocket only weighs 145 grams. So, holding it is just like holding an iPhone6S.

<h3>Feel your focus, don’t rest on it</h3>
<p>Shooting handheld while pulling your own focus usually means giving up the three-point stability of your rig or putting some of the camera’s weight on your focus hand, limiting your nuance of movement and fatiguing your hand faster. When placed in Verité mode, the patented Verité Handle rests in the crook of your elbow, leaving your hand free to focus without  destabilizing your rig.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/264112313?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Shoot how you want, when you want</h3>
<p>When you don’t need to continuously pull focus, twist the Verité Handle into the traditional “handlebars” setup to shoot handheld the way you always have. When it’s time to pull focus again, another quick twist gets you back into Verité mode without missing a shot or putting your camera down.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/264112420?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Keep your shoot moving</h3>
<p>Removing your Verité Handle is easy, thanks to our patent-pending Quick-Clamping Bridge. Just twist the lever lock on the bottom of the Verité Handle to release the bridge, without having to remove your matte box or other accessories. The Verité Handle fits neatly in your camera bag for easy traveling and storage.</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>To make the Verité Handle accessible as possible to new and bootstrapped filmmakers while also offering a strong and reliable product, I opted to manufacture it out of high-impact plastic using an injection molding process. </p>
<p>Copolymer is plastic mixed with strengthening materials to create a high-impact hybrid material. This enabled us to balance the need for affordability with the demands of creating a product that you can trust to support up to 5lbs.</p>
<p>I worked with a former Volvo plastic engineer to turn my patented CAD renderings into a mold-ready design. After that, we began a year-long refinement process using 3D-printed plastic prototypes that enabled us to test for strength, functionality, comfort, and overall usability.  </p>
<p>We have sourced our vendors and locked down our budget numbers. Now we just need your backing to fund the initial mold creation and first round of manufacturing, packaging, and delivery.</p>
<h3>Where we’re going</h3>
<p>The Verité Handle is the first in a line of practically minded camera accessory products built by filmmakers for filmmakers. Your backing for this project not only brings a new handle setup to life, but will carry forward to other products that improve indie filmmaking.</p>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>Following the close of this crowdfunding campaign, we’ll jump into production and plan to have the Verité Handle in your hands by mid-summer of this year.</p>
<h3>About the creator</h3>
<p>I’m Brent – an indie filmmaker with a background in engineering and product design. I came up with the Verité Handle in 2009 when I was the DP on a feature film with a shoestring budget. </p>
<p>We didn’t have the money for secondary focus tools or crew members. I had to pull my own focus, and I didn’t want to give up three-point stability to do so. I DIY-ed an early version of the Verité Handle, and the idea was born.  </p>
<p>When shooting wrapped, I started designing, prototyping, and testing various approaches, and that led to the patented product I’m offering today. The product design has been readied for injection molding to deliver a strong, reliable, focus-ready shoulder rig handle to you.  </p>
<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>The Verité Handle has been almost a decade in the making, and I’m excited to invite you along for the rest of the journey. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions you might have. And thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for considering supporting this project and the future of Verité.</p>

The Verité Handle is the first in a line of practically minded camera accessory products built by filmmakers for filmmakers. Your backing for this project not only brings a new handle setup to life, but will carry forward to other products that improve indie filmmaking.
Delivery
Following the close of this crowdfunding campaign, we’ll jump into production and plan to have the Verité Handle in your hands by mid-summer of this year.
About the creator
I’m Brent – an indie filmmaker with a background in engineering and product design. I came up with the Verité Handle in 2009 when I was the DP on a feature film with a shoestring budget. 
We didn’t have the money for secondary focus tools or crew members. I had to pull my own focus, and I didn’t want to give up three-point stability to do so. I DIY-ed an early version of the Verité Handle, and the idea was born.  
When shooting wrapped, I started designing, prototyping, and testing various approaches, and that led to the patented product I’m offering today. The product design has been readied for injection molding to deliver a strong, reliable, focus-ready shoulder rig handle to you.  
Thank you
The Verité Handle has been almost a decade in the making, and I’m excited to invite you along for the rest of the journey. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions you might have. And thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for considering supporting this project and the future of Verité.",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>Knife-Hand</strong> is a mute ninja with the ability to generate energy blades from his hands that can cut through <strong>ANYTHING. </strong>As a boy, he was kidnapped and held for <strong>ransom</strong>...but his wealthy father <strong>refused</strong> to pay the kidnappers, so they sold him to a <strong>ninja clan. </strong>After years of brutal training, he <strong>stole</strong> the power of the Knife-Hand and went <strong>AWOL</strong>...searching for his father to get his <strong>revenge.</strong> But the ninja clan <strong>never</strong> stopped hunting for him, so he joined the <strong>JAWBREAKERS</strong> in order to use them as a gang to <strong>protect </strong>him. His<strong> disdain</strong> for his teammates is unknown to them. But as much as he <strong>hates</strong> them...he <strong>NEEDS</strong> them. So when the rest of the team is <strong>kidnapped,</strong> it is up to Knife-Hand to <strong>rescue</strong> them! </p>

KNIFE-HAND must rescue the JAWBREAKERS from a Death Trap inside a Floating Castle!


The Story
Knife-Hand is a mute ninja with the ability to generate energy blades from his hands that can cut through ANYTHING. As a boy, he was kidnapped and held for ransom...but his wealthy father refused to pay the kidnappers, so they sold him to a ninja clan. After years of brutal training, he stole the power of the Knife-Hand and went AWOL...searching for his father to get his revenge. But the ninja clan never stopped hunting for him, so he joined the JAWBREAKERS in order to use them as a gang to protect him. His disdain for his teammates is unknown to them. But as much as he hates them...he NEEDS them. So when the rest of the team is kidnapped, it is up to Knife-Hand to rescue them!

But, gathering together his own team, he will prove to the world that he’s worthy of the title, Hero.   Internal Pages by Renzo Rodriguez  For those of you who are familiar with my You Tube content, you will know that I love the idea of a traditional hero. And I believe that 1) stories should be told in the well worn methods developed over millennia, and 2) true quality and audience appeal come from this traditional method of storytelling and the presentation of a traditional hero. Therefore, what you see before you is my humble attempt to bring all of that to life. I have been blessed enough to find two artists that are as passionate about this kind of storytelling as I am, and, together, we present to you THOMAS VALIANT – a breakneck action/adventure about underdogs trying to live up to the ideals of being true heroes. The PerksPerks include:1) 4 Pin-up posters - 3 by Renzo Rodriguez, 1 by Nik Axe (11"" x 17"")2) Script (typos and all) detailing the world and book layout3) Original art pages (Internal pages) from Renzo Rodriguez4) Original Cover art from Nik Axe4) Map of City (Rubicon City) the story takes place in (11"" x 17"")5) Character Cards - 12 Pack Pin-up - Phantasm by Nik Axe Pin-up - Disk by Nik Axe (FREE WITH EVERY BOOK) Pin-up - Phantasm by Renzo Rodriguez Map by Patrick Benjamin (to be finished) The Stretch GoalsFull Color Pages at $16 K - UNLOCKED!Increased page count to a minimum 80 PAGES at $18K - UNLOCKED!Signed copies of the book (by RJ Shaw) at $22K - SO CloseA free pinup poster by Nik Axe at $25K Progress so farBefore even launching here’s what we have DONE20 Internal Pages completedCOVER rough draft4 Pin-Up posters drawn (1 colored so far) Character sketch by Renzo RodriguezWhat you can do to help make this project a successThe #1 priority is to Get the Word Out about THOMAS VALIANT!

LEGENDARY COMICS CREATOR MIKE BARON DELIVERS A RIOTOUSLY FUNNY, HEART-FELT, AND ULTIMATELY UPLIFTING STORY WITH HIS LATEST COMIC BOOK PROJECT 'FLORIDA MAN'
 

 
WHO IS FLORIDA MAN?
 
Gary Duba’s having a bad day. There’s a snake in his toilet, a rabid raccoon in the yard, and his gal Krystal’s in jail for getting naked at a Waffle Castle and licking the manager. Gary is just a southern redneck living in a trailer down by the swamp, but he’s got dreams, big dreams. But it seems like every time he tries to get ahead, fate deals him a low blow.
 
Then one day he gets lucky…
 

Along with his best friend, Floyd, Gary sets out to sell his prized Barry Bonds rookie card to raise the five hundred bucks needed for Krystal's bail, but like always, things find a way of getting out of hand. In fact, Duba's got a way of getting caught in all the wrong places.

We're Bringing Back Funny Books, Ya'll!

<p>It's 1952 and the west is in the grip of social and political fear of Communism and the Red Scare, Hollywood finds itself in an uncomfortable spotlight that will cast a shadow on many names in the industry and many will never recover. Dogged by continuous accusation of Communist sympathies, Chaplin is informed that unless he declares his political leaning in front of HUAC (House of Un-American Activities Committee) he will not be allowed to return to the United States of America. </p>

<p>Chaplin's path crossed with many Hollywood greats! Buster Keaton, Marlon Brando and even Sophia Loren all shared the silver screen with our hero. However, one such name many people do not realise graced the music hall stages  with Chaplin was none other than, Stan Laurel of Laurel and Hardy fame!</p>

<p>Witness the developing friendship that flourished under the watchful eye of Fred Karno and his Fun Factory deep in the heart of Kennington, South London. Follow them as they perfect their craft upon the stages of Victorian London and the multitude of extravagant Vaudeville shows of their US tour. </p>
<p>As Chaplin is wooed by the bright lights of America, Stan also finds his calling as an enigmatic but hapless part of a comedic double act. Sadly, the feeling is not mutual. Upon their return to London Charlie longs for the Transatlantic life he left behind as a solo star! These decisions made by both men would pave the way for the movie personas they would later carefully cultivate. </p>

</div></div>","Welcome Indiegogo Backers to Charlie's London!
 
Delve into this unique 64 page graphic novel experience OFFICIALLY licensed by the Chaplin Estate! Learn the back story to one of the greatest rags to riches stories of our time!
 

 
As the world awaits the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's eagerly anticipated motion picture Limelight, the most famous comedian on the planet finds himself at a professional and emotional crossroad.
 

 
It's 1952 and the west is in the grip of social and political fear of Communism and the Red Scare, Hollywood finds itself in an uncomfortable spotlight that will cast a shadow on many names in the industry and many will never recover. Dogged by continuous accusation of Communist sympathies, Chaplin is informed that unless he declares his political leaning in front of HUAC (House of Un-American Activities Committee) he will not be allowed to return to the United States of America. 
 

 
All this and the fear of rejection on his home soil he finds the London streets of his youth are both a source of comfort and a painful reflection of a time once forgotten. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
With every step he remembers and with every step we see it with him! 
 
So, how did the harsh Dickensian streets of London help to shape one of the most iconic cinematic legends the world has ever seen?
 

 
With covers by V Tartamella, D DeLay and K Stephan and internal art by Micky and colours by InkSpots, this book is a must for film collectors and comic fans alike. 
 
 
A Story Within a Story.....
Chaplin's path crossed with many Hollywood greats! Buster Keaton, Marlon Brando and even Sophia Loren all shared the silver screen with our hero. However, one such name many people do not realise graced the music hall stages  with Chaplin was none other than, Stan Laurel of Laurel and Hardy fame!

 

Witness the developing friendship that flourished under the watchful eye of Fred Karno and his Fun Factory deep in the heart of Kennington, South London. Follow them as they perfect their craft upon the stages of Victorian London and the multitude of extravagant Vaudeville shows of their US tour. 
As Chaplin is wooed by the bright lights of America, Stan also finds his calling as an enigmatic but hapless part of a comedic double act. Sadly, the feeling is not mutual. Upon their return to London Charlie longs for the Transatlantic life he left behind as a solo star! These decisions made by both men would pave the way for the movie personas they would later carefully cultivate. 
Charlie and Stan: From Kennington to Keystone  expands the Chaplin story and incorporates another great of the Golden Age of cinema by the fantastic William Crawford Hazle, creator of Ailsa Dark Werewolves and Bampots!

The Covers!
 

 
Karl Stephan's, creator of Mary Boys brings the Tramp home and makes London town his playground in this stunning black and white cover.
 
Vinnie Tartamella brings the classic Tramp image together with the Victorian streets of his youth in this stunning colour variant. 
 
Donal DeLay gives us a beautiful young and vulnerable child Chaplin and his iconic tramp his ever-constant in the London rain. With Colours by Kyle Ritter, this cover is a totally different take on the Tramp we all know and love!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>With the help of the very talented <i>Jeff Kraven </i>comes the first story of the notorious and mysterious Dr. Alpha.</li>
<li>The Dr. Alpha: Miracle Child storyline has been in development for a year.</li>
<li>The world of Dr. Alpha has been in development for over five years.</li>
<li>Even as a kid, I've always been fascinated with the art of storytelling. I ended up studying English and literature in college. And of course, I've always wanted to produce something people could one day read and enjoy. I also happen to be a fan of the pulp-era stories and the writers behind them. <i>Dr. Alpha was born from the fast-paced pulp style</i>.</li>
<li>While I enjoy the over-the-top action of Expendables or Commando - I could never keep myself away from diving into the underbelly of humanity. Asking what lies beneath a normally two-dimensional character. I guess that's why I love the paragon hero with unshakable morals, but can't help but write about villains. I mean, what better way to explore the more tragic side of humanity and with a tragically human character?</li>
<li>
<i>Dr. Alpha: Miracle Child is a complete story with a beginning and a definitive ending.</i> No cliffhanger that'll force the reader to wait for the thrilling conclusion to the Miracle Child storyline. This isn't a part I. This will be a beginning, middle, and end. </li>
<li>Dr. Alpha: Miracle Child will be a 112 page comic. However, <i>the world of Dr. Alpha has been fleshed out far beyond the Miracle Child storyline.</i> The book will have hints and easter eggs for future storylines and characters hidden in the details. Even some of the art shown here give hints to things that have occurred in the world. <i>In other words, the promotional art is canon.</i>
</li>
<li>Any contribution will not only go toward funding this book but <i>helping to launch a whole new franchise.</i><i>​</i>
