For those of you who don't know me, I’m twenty-three years old and grew up in Minneapolis, MN. I come from a hardworking, middle class family and have one older brother. I've been playing sports my entire life and started playing rugby when I was eleven years old. I continued to play throughout high school, which is when I really fell in love with the game.</p>
<p>In 2008, I was lucky enough to gain admission to the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) and was blessed to be able to continue to play rugby at an elite level. In my first year of college, I decided that I would like to pursue playing rugby professionally. Additionally, I realized that there was not a doubt in my mind that I want to represent my country.</p>
<p>I put in a lot of hard work throughout college to advance my rugby career, while also pursuing my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Sociology. Each summer I competed at the men’s club level along with attending invitational elite rugby camps (Serevi). My Men’s club was fortunate to compete in two national championship tournaments and these events were instrumental in establishing my name as an elite player on the national scene. I was extremely proud to graduate with my degree in the spring of 2012, proving to myself that I could achieve greatness off the field as well as on.</p>
<p>The following summer I showed enough potential to get called into a Men’s USA Rugby Sevens camp as they prepared for the beginning of their season and in September, at the USA 7’s camp, I got the opportunity to show my dedication, talent, hard work, and passion for the game. I was humbled to receive a developmental contract that would keep me around for the season of 2012-2013. </p>
<p>I was then selected to go on tour and compete with the best rugby players in the world on the World Series Sevens Rugby Circuit in Dubai, UAE and Port Elizabeth, South Africa where I represented the USA for the first time in my career. In one of life's many twists, I was soon sidelined when I  broke my fibula while playing for the developmental USA team in Las Vegas. Once again I was able to demonstrate the attributes I bring to the team on and off the field. Only two months and two weeks after my surgery I was running at full speed and back practicing with the team.</p>
<p>Sevens Rugby was recently inducted into the Olympics and will be hosted for the first time at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My dream is to be there and play for the USA. I don’t just want to represent my country; I am determined to be a centerpiece of the team and help lead our country to a gold medal!  I have many goals I intend to accomplish over the next few seasons with USA team. I am, and will remain, a student of the game, always trying to gain experience and boost my rugby I.Q. and I will never get complacent. I’m driven by the ultimate goal of performing in front of the entire world, not just the international rugby community, and making my country proud. I’m very ambitious, passionate, and confident about achieving this goal, but I could use a little help. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can only contribute so much to my rugby goals while in Minneapolis. I need to be in Southern California at the Chula Vista Olympic Training Center training full time with my other USA teammates. The good news is that I was awarded a contract with the USA 7’s team for the 2013-14 season. However, due to cutbacks to the program and my lack of tenure with the team, the contract is only partial at this time. This is why I’m soliciting monetary donations.</p>
<p>I’m looking to raise about 3,000 dollars to continue my journey. Below please find a summary of my financial needs over and above my partial contract:</p>
<p>• Monthly Rent</p>
<p>• Living Expenses (i.e. Food, Bills, Cleaning Supplies, etc.)</p>
<p>• Bicycle for transportation </p>
<p>• Emergencies, Illnesses</p>
<p>• Plane Ticket Home for the holiday </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anything that you can give will mean the world to me!</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone will be able to help with a donation, but I want you to know that I very much appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to read my story and I ask that you share this link with your friends, family, coworkers, acquaintances, and anyone else who you think might want to help me live my dream</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Dry Dock provides a sober alternative to the community. A friendly, open and supportive place where fellowship is the cornerstone of recovery, an envirnment where an open heart, mind and understanding of recovery and it's pitfalls is openly shared, where living in the principles of a twelve step program is encouraged.</p>
<p>I am Rich Figlewski, founder and President of the Dry Dock. I am also a recovering alchoholic and addict.</p>
<p>In January of 2010 two friends in recovery died. One drank himself to death and was found in his apartment 4 days later. The other wrote a note to his mother, went in the bathroom and shot up an overdose of heroin. The lonliness and pain weree just too much for them. This story repeats itself over and over, daily at times, in the recovery community. I left my job in Febuary 2010, took may severance and retirement and started the Dry Dock. I believe that by having a safe place for people saves lives. We survive on donations and the kindness of others. There are no salaries.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help keep us open. Your contribution will help save lives.</p>
Remember, ""if you are not careful, you might just help somebody.""<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your funding contribution will go directly to our overhead for the next 10 months. We will use the comtributions to pay our rent, $900.00 a month, and a portion of the utilities. We expect to be able to cover the other expenses with the donations and support we normaly receive.</p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Also, we need to expand our peer mentoring and outreach programs to get the word out that there is a safe place to go among people who care and many who have ""been there.""</span></p>
<p><br/>We are hoping to increase our donor base over the next few months as well. The community is begining to understand the work we do. I partner with the local soup kitchen, the town social services group, the school superintendant's  office, the Rotary Club, the mayors council on substance abuse, the local substance abuse council, the local heath department and the Spanish community center.</p>
<p>We are a 501[c]3 corporation so all donations are tax deductible.</p>
<p>For every donation of $25  or more we will provide a dry dock baseball cap.</p>
<p>For every donation of $50  or more we will provide a dry dock t-shirt.</p>
<p>All contributions we recieve will be used towards the stated purpose, to help pay our overhead and expand community outreach.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We provide whatever help we can, rides to hospitals, to detox facilities, help in placing folks in treatment, food when you are hungry, a place to sit and read, to talk with others about where you are that day. To share with whatever we have with families struggling, kids who are losing their childhood much to fast, and to parents watching their children slowly die in front of them.</p>
<p>We try to live in a place where an open heart, mind and arms is the routine, not the exception. Kindness, Love and Understanding, is all that matters.</p>
<p>This is a disease, not a life choice. The gift of sobriety requires constant vigilance and support. There are few places for people to gather in a social place without alchohol or drugs being around. Music, open mics, cookouts, dances, motorcycle rides, cards, meditation, reiki and a little diner serving breakfast, lunch and dinner is what we provide. We also have 12 step meetings daily, about 20 a week.</p>
<p>We provide what we can at little or no cost. We have recently been accepted as a United Way agency. We are a legitimate business providing what we can. The need surpasses the funds available.</p>
When the cold weather comes more people will be coming in to eat and stay warm. We have been succesful helping some of the homeless get and stay sober for the past two winters. We need to be able to provide more as this population is growing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The precription drug abuse problem is epidemic in this area. This leads to more deaths and heroin addictions. especially among the young people on our community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We cannot save everyone. In fact a power greater than us is at work, we just act as a conduit. Please join us on this journey. The love shown to others is the redemption of ouselves.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
I am fully aware how tough the times are today.</div>
<div>Money is tight and we recognize that not all can contribute financially. Your support by sharing this campaign with those you know would be great.</div>
<div><span class=""notranslate""> </span></div>
<div>More than anything please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.</div>
<div>
<br/>Peace &amp; Blessings</div>

Your funding contribution will go directly to our overhead for the next 10 months. We will use the comtributions to pay our rent, $900.00 a month, and a portion of the utilities. We expect to be able to cover the other expenses with the donations and support we normaly receive.
Also, we need to expand our peer mentoring and outreach programs to get the word out that there is a safe place to go among people who care and many who have ""been there.""
We are hoping to increase our donor base over the next few months as well. The community is begining to understand the work we do. I partner with the local soup kitchen, the town social services group, the school superintendant's  office, the Rotary Club, the mayors council on substance abuse, the local substance abuse council, the local heath department and the Spanish community center.
We are a 501[c]3 corporation so all donations are tax deductible.
For every donation of $25  or more we will provide a dry dock baseball cap.
For every donation of $50  or more we will provide a dry dock t-shirt.
All contributions we recieve will be used towards the stated purpose, to help pay our overhead and expand community outreach.


The Impact
We provide whatever help we can, rides to hospitals, to detox facilities, help in placing folks in treatment, food when you are hungry, a place to sit and read, to talk with others about where you are that day. To share with whatever we have with families struggling, kids who are losing their childhood much to fast, and to parents watching their children slowly die in front of them.
We try to live in a place where an open heart, mind and arms is the routine, not the exception. Kindness, Love and Understanding, is all that matters.
This is a disease, not a life choice. The gift of sobriety requires constant vigilance and support. There are few places for people to gather in a social place without alchohol or drugs being around. Music, open mics, cookouts, dances, motorcycle rides, cards, meditation, reiki and a little diner serving breakfast, lunch and dinner is what we provide. We also have 12 step meetings daily, about 20 a week.
We provide what we can at little or no cost. We have recently been accepted as a United Way agency. We are a legitimate business providing what we can. The need surpasses the funds available.
When the cold weather comes more people will be coming in to eat and stay warm. We have been succesful helping some of the homeless get and stay sober for the past two winters. We need to be able to provide more as this population is growing.
 
The precription drug abuse problem is epidemic in this area. This leads to more deaths and heroin addictions. especially among the young people on our community.
 
We cannot save everyone. In fact a power greater than us is at work, we just act as a conduit. Please join us on this journey. The love shown to others is the redemption of ouselves.

Other Ways You Can Help
I am fully aware how tough the times are today.
Money is tight and we recognize that not all can contribute financially. Your support by sharing this campaign with those you know would be great.
 
More than anything please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.

Peace & Blessings

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fundamental diseases
are extreme and rare genetic disorders, which offer a unique opportunity to better
understand other diseases, including many common conditions. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Take the drug statins for example. Statins were originally developed as a result of research into the mechanisms of an ultra-rare disease called familial hypercholesterolemia. Statins are now the most common treatment for high cholesterol, prescribed to millions of people.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another great example is the ultra-rare disease alkaptonuria. Latest research into alkaptonuria is revealing new insights into the causes of osteoarthritis, which could lead to the development of new treatments. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, research into a group of rare neurological diseases called neuroacanthocytosis is helping to understand Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases.<br/></p><h2>Why do fundamental disease patients need support?</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are hundreds of millions of people worldwide with
these diseases, but they are mainly ignored due to their rarity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a result, patients are often overlooked, isolated, and
neglected due to the rarity of their conditions. Many go through life without
ever meeting another person with the same condition. If patient groups are set
up, they usually only offer basic support and do not have the time to expand
the organisation. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, for fundamental diseases, the patient groups are a
vital partner. Research from Rare Disease UK shows that patient groups act as a
vital source of information and support for patients. They are also the first port of call for
pharmaceutical companies and academics preparing clinical trials for possible
treatments. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yet there is no support structure to help fundamental disease
patients to set up their own formalised patient groups. Many do not have the knowledge to run these
organisations and do not know how to get involved in research.</p><h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How we want to help:</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We aim to fill this unmet need by developing a support
system to help fundamental disease patient groups to grow and professionalise
their work. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We propose setting up an easily accessible online toolkit and
series of free workshops covering pertinent issues for these patient groups,
ranging from how to manage a patient organisation to working with academia to
help advance research into their disease.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have already had one patient workshop in January, on the topic of
accessing funding as a small patient group. It was a
big success. We had over 40 patient advocates attending and four speakers; two from
successfully-funded patient groups and two from fundraising consultancies. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The toolkit will comprise of a website which will display
vital and useful information about important issues for fundamental disease
patients and patient groups. This information will be complemented by a series
of short videos that summarise technical topics into coherent, concise
explanations.</p>

We've been very blessed by friends offering their vehicles so I may be there with Ria at KGH as much as possible during this time.  With your contributions we'll have options for Ria's treatments that are not covered in our medical system as the need is required.  With the medical options limited to surgery, radiation or chemotherapy and Ria's doctors recommending all 3 for her, yet they only estimate a 15-20% cure rate for Ria with this specific cancer using all 3 of their options.  With her 6 hours of surgery just completed, it took her 12 hours in the recovery room and an epidural for her pain.

You may even know that she has been dealing with health issues. They are quite serious and require ongoing treatment and maintenance to keep her healthy.

Managing the disease requires constant treatment to keep her from having acute flare-ups that require emergency hospitalization. Lack of access to funds and therefore treatment has resulted in three hospitalizations in the last three months alone.</span></p><p>Here’s what’s been happening lately. After she was discharged from the hospital in December, Mary found out that her health insurance had been retroactively canceled without notice, due to a series of internal “processing errors.” After a struggle with the insurance company, they finally agreed to reinstate her,<b> but not until she pays them $1,935 for the past due months</b>. During the time without insurance, she has not been able to afford or receive her prescriptions, steroid treatments, and chemotherapy; her condition has taken a turn for the worse. Despite this, she has been working tirelessly (too tirelessly for her own good, health-wise, perhaps, but with no other option) to secure full-time employment but hasn't been successful thus far. Mary is a giving person, but like many of us, when it comes to her own situation she doesn't want to burden her friends.  But, she needs our help so we are asking on her behalf.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/345753/files/20140203000209-2014-02-03_02.53.56.jpg?1391414529"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""></b></h3><p style=""display: inline !important;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/349464/files/20140204160924-what_we_need.JPG?1391558964"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span><b>We urgently need $5,472</b> just to cover her past due insurance, prescriptions, housing and treatments.

<p></p></div>","If you are reading this you probably know someone who knows our friend Mary. You may even know that she has been dealing with health issues. They are quite serious and require ongoing treatment and maintenance to keep her healthy. What you may not know is that due to a series of circumstances outside her control, she has found herself in dire financial straits that are a serious and immediate threat to her health and well being. As people that love and care about her, we've decided to coordinate an emergency fundraising campaign to help her get out of this situation as soon as possible. We are asking you to please give as generously as you can within your means.Mary was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in November 2012 and has an especially aggressive case. Managing the disease requires constant treatment to keep her from having acute flare-ups that require emergency hospitalization. Lack of access to funds and therefore treatment has resulted in three hospitalizations in the last three months alone.Here’s what’s been happening lately. After she was discharged from the hospital in December, Mary found out that her health insurance had been retroactively canceled without notice, due to a series of internal “processing errors.” After a struggle with the insurance company, they finally agreed to reinstate her, but not until she pays them $1,935 for the past due months. During the time without insurance, she has not been able to afford or receive her prescriptions, steroid treatments, and chemotherapy; her condition has taken a turn for the worse. Despite this, she has been working tirelessly (too tirelessly for her own good, health-wise, perhaps, but with no other option) to secure full-time employment but hasn't been successful thus far. Mary is a giving person, but like many of us, when it comes to her own situation she doesn't want to burden her friends.  But, she needs our help so we are asking on her behalf.We urgently need $5,472 just to cover her past due insurance, prescriptions, housing and treatments. While this will greatly improve her current situation, it will, at best, only put her back where she was before the this domino effect began. The reality is, Mary may need to stop freelancing and focus on regaining her health, so that ultimately she is well enough to secure and maintain full-time employment with benefits. For this reason, our goal is to raise a minimum of $10,000.We can do this. We just need you to give what you can, whether that is $50 or $5000. No amount is too small, and certainly no amount is too large!Here are some examples of how your donations can help: 
$30 = copay for a regular doctor’s visit
$50 = a visit to her GI specialist
$300 = one month’s worth of supplements, vitamins, probiotics, and protein powders
$515 = one month’s treatment of Remicade, a crucial part of her treatment regimen that is currently missing due to its cost (yes, this is the co-pay with insurance)
$1935 = immediate reinstatement of her health insurance
$5472 = Mary gets caught up on all outstanding medical bills and living expenses!
$10000 = all past due medical bills plus one month of living expenses through February 2014
Want to help beyond supporting this campaign and being a friend to Mary? Wow, you are excellent! Email us privately if you’d like to help with another resource, or if you can specifically help with the following:
We are looking for a health advocate based in NYC who can navigate insurance options: Medicare, ACA, Cobra, disability benefits, etc.
Naturopathy experts and acupuncturists who operate on a sliding scale fee in NYC.
Professional (employment-related) resources
New or refurbished-like-new mac laptop
If you're interested in donating any ""perks"" in exchange for donation amounts through our campaign, please get in contact with any of us (see our contact info below) directly. 
The seriousness and urgency of Mary's situation has necessitated us opening this campaign to the public. However, for personal and professional reasons, we still want to do our utmost to preserve Mary’s privacy. Please exercise discretion and good judgment with this information.Thank you in advance for helping us (or your friend) to help Mary. She is very special to us!Friends and family of Mary Pryor are uniting to help with medical and living expenses.We’re encouraging people to give within their means.  That may be $5, $50, $500 or $5000.  All are welcomed! We’ll need donations of all sizes to make our goals. Every donation helps!Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition and, like many illnesses, has very real symptoms that are often not visible to the naked eye. Crohn’s is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract and how the body is able to process and absorb nutrients with symptoms that manifest differently in each person.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As Bangladesh turned 40 in 2011, Wasfia Nazreen, a rights-activist,

<p><strong>Think Globally, Cook Locally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kitchen Passports: Trinidad and Tobago</strong> invites young cooks and their adult helpers to drop everything and travel to Trinidad and Tobago – right in their own kitchens. Each recipe is a passport to tasty ingredients and yummy dishes enjoyed in Trinidad and Tobago, the second largest nation in the West Indies. <strong>Kitchen Passports</strong> aims to encourage kids to travel through their taste buds, to create meals and share them with others, and to learn about a culture unfamiliar to them, all while developing their skills as young cooks. </p>
<p>This project began when my daughter started helping me in the kitchen when she was about 18 months old. She learned what a circle is by stirring batter in a bowl in small and large circles. When my son was old enough, he joined us in the kitchen, squishing, mixing, and cutting ingredients to include in dishes the whole family would eat. As they cook with my husband and I, our children are also learning how to make foods that we grew up eating – for my husband, foods largely from Trinidad and Tobago. </p>
<p>Kitchen Passports is easy to navigate. The recipes are organized by level of difficulty – 1 island recipes, 2 island recipes, and 3 island recipes. There are 30 recipes in all. Colorful photographs (some shot on location in Trinidad) accompany each recipe. There are also special notes about cooking tips and cultural, social, and other information about Trinidad. Scattered throughout the cookbook are postcards from a young girl growing up in Trinidad. </p>
<p>Recognizing that there are no children’s cookbooks focusing on Trinidadian cuisine, <strong>Kitchen Passports</strong> provides young chefs with unique opportunities to create healthy, fun, traditional foods that would otherwise be too difficult for them to make. Inspired by early memories of cooking with my parents as a child, I designed the cookbook to answer these questions: How can we involve kids more in making the food they eat? How can kids become more excited about trying new foods and, through them, experiencing different cultures? How can children develop their literacy skills – reading, social, and cultural literacies – through their kitchen travels? </p>
<p>I adapted some of the recipes – all of which were tested by young chefs in homes and in classrooms – from traditional recipes provided by my mother-in-law and her mother; both were born and raised in Trinidad. Most of the recipes take ingredients common in Trinidad cuisine – like mangoes and curry – and use them in dishes that allow children to experiment with different spices in a more familiar food context – for instance, putting pineapples in buttermilk pancakes.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help defray the costs of producing and distributing Kitchen Passports. Your contribution will also help us provide funds to Ray of Hope, a nonprofit organization that supports orphanages and children centers in Trinidad and Tobago. A portion of the funds raised through this campaign will help purchase food, books, and supplies for 200 children in Trinidad. </p>

<p><strong>My name is James Howell and I have been heavily involved in sports since the age of 2. I am 26 years old and a Business Marketing graduate from Angelo State University. Ever since I picked up a football at 2 years old, it has been my lifelong goal to become a professional athlete. I started off playing Pop Warner football and running for a youth track club, in Long Beach, California, at 6 years old. I was never the biggest, tallest, or strongest but I was always known for my speed. My mindset has always been that regardless of my stature, you could never measure my heart or desire to accomplish any goal I set out. I played football and ran track through high school and made it to the California State Track Meet in the hurdles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hypoglycemia is a clinic syndrome that results from low blood sugar, that I was diagnosed with my senior year in high school. I was diagnosed with this disorder after an episode, when my sugar level dropped below a stable range, at football practice which caused me to get rushed to the hospital. But I had always been such a healthy kid? Hypoglycemia has been a non-stop concern in my life ever sense, because I always have to be aware of the specific foods I put into my body. Otherwise I will crash into another episode. These episodes do not allow my body to move and make me sleepy; which is dangerous because I can go straight into a coma if I do so. My college coaches were always surprised when they would hear about my situation, because of my work ethic. But the truth is; I do get drained out faster than the average person. 2012 was a season where I didn’t have the college support to keep my healthy life style and doctor guidance to keep my sugar level balanced and stable. This disorder has put me in a category, but I have kept myself out of the class of a quitter. I have overcome obstacle after obstacle and Hypoglycemia Is just another stepping stone in my path towards my goal of being a Track &amp; Field Champion. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After being diagnosed and learning how to control my Hypoglycemia, my achievements in high school, due to my God given abilities and strong work ethic, earned me a scholarship to the University of Akron. There I played football for one year and decided to focus 100% of my energy on becoming a USA and World Track &amp; Field Champion. The first year I stepped onto the NCAA Track I wasn’t the fastest, but by the end of the season I broke the school record, became the MAC Indoor Champion and MAC Outdoor Runner-Up in the 400 meters. After the 2007 season I went through a life changing situation that almost ended my athletic career. After that turning point, I knew I had to fully commit myself to God and my childhood goal, of becoming a professional athlete. So I dedicated my life to that transition, and the end result was another school record at Angelo State and a 3<sup>rd</sup> place finish in the 2011 USA Indoor Championships. I had finally made a dream become a reality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After the 2011 season I didn’t have the money to receive the proper training, treatment for recovery, and travel expenses to make it to high profile meets. I lacked equipment and good facilities to keep up the great times and record setting pace I was on the year before. I struggled for a year and also missed the 2012 Olympic team. That experience gave me the fuel to learn how to adapt to any situation in life. I now have a great coach, which coached the 2012 Olympic Gold Medalist in the Men's 400 hurdles, and a great track to train on at UCLA. </strong></p>
<p><strong>With your support I have faith that I will accomplish my goals of competing in the USA and World Track &amp; Field Championships. I have no plans of coming home without a medal. Your donations/sponsorships will contribute to the expenses as followed: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Travel (flight and lodging only) = $11,000</strong><ol>
<li>Trip for international competition : ($2,000 / trip x 2 trips) = $4,000</li>
<li>Trip within USA for competition : ($1,000 / trip x 7 trips) = $7,000</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medical = $3,192</strong><ol>
<li>Chiropractor / A.R.T : ($38 / visit x 24 visits) = $912</li>
<li>Massage Therapist : ($20 / visit x 24 visits) = $480</li>

<li>Medical insurance (specific to athletes) : (unknown) = $1,500</li>

<li>Running coaching : ($0 / coach x 1 coach) = $0</li>
<li>24 hour Fitness membership : ($30 / month x 12 months) = $360</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Total 2013 Running Expenses = $15,682</strong></li>
</ol><p><strong>This is the total expense projection for the 2013 Indoor and Outdoor season, totaling in $15,682. The $6,000 I am seeking will get me through the first half of the season. I am confident that by the midpoint of the season I will be competing on a high enough level to get paid for my wins and hopefully get a contract with a large sponsorship. All I need is the help to jump start my season and my performance will propel me through the rest of the year and a Championship. </strong></p>

I would truly appreciate any help you can provide; whether it is $1, or just letting someone know about my story and dream.

<p><strong>Thank you for your time and God bless...</strong></p></div>","Please visit www.jameshowellusa.com.
My name is James Howell and I have been heavily involved in sports since the age of 2. I am 26 years old and a Business Marketing graduate from Angelo State University. Ever since I picked up a football at 2 years old, it has been my lifelong goal to become a professional athlete. I started off playing Pop Warner football and running for a youth track club, in Long Beach, California, at 6 years old. I was never the biggest, tallest, or strongest but I was always known for my speed. My mindset has always been that regardless of my stature, you could never measure my heart or desire to accomplish any goal I set out. I played football and ran track through high school and made it to the California State Track Meet in the hurdles.
Hypoglycemia is a clinic syndrome that results from low blood sugar, that I was diagnosed with my senior year in high school. I was diagnosed with this disorder after an episode, when my sugar level dropped below a stable range, at football practice which caused me to get rushed to the hospital. But I had always been such a healthy kid? Hypoglycemia has been a non-stop concern in my life ever sense, because I always have to be aware of the specific foods I put into my body. Otherwise I will crash into another episode. These episodes do not allow my body to move and make me sleepy; which is dangerous because I can go straight into a coma if I do so. My college coaches were always surprised when they would hear about my situation, because of my work ethic. But the truth is; I do get drained out faster than the average person. 2012 was a season where I didn’t have the college support to keep my healthy life style and doctor guidance to keep my sugar level balanced and stable. This disorder has put me in a category, but I have kept myself out of the class of a quitter. I have overcome obstacle after obstacle and Hypoglycemia Is just another stepping stone in my path towards my goal of being a Track & Field Champion. 
After being diagnosed and learning how to control my Hypoglycemia, my achievements in high school, due to my God given abilities and strong work ethic, earned me a scholarship to the University of Akron. There I played football for one year and decided to focus 100% of my energy on becoming a USA and World Track & Field Champion. The first year I stepped onto the NCAA Track I wasn’t the fastest, but by the end of the season I broke the school record, became the MAC Indoor Champion and MAC Outdoor Runner-Up in the 400 meters. After the 2007 season I went through a life changing situation that almost ended my athletic career. After that turning point, I knew I had to fully commit myself to God and my childhood goal, of becoming a professional athlete. So I dedicated my life to that transition, and the end result was another school record at Angelo State and a 3rd place finish in the 2011 USA Indoor Championships. I had finally made a dream become a reality. 
After the 2011 season I didn’t have the money to receive the proper training, treatment for recovery, and travel expenses to make it to high profile meets. I lacked equipment and good facilities to keep up the great times and record setting pace I was on the year before. I struggled for a year and also missed the 2012 Olympic team. That experience gave me the fuel to learn how to adapt to any situation in life. I now have a great coach, which coached the 2012 Olympic Gold Medalist in the Men's 400 hurdles, and a great track to train on at UCLA. 
With your support I have faith that I will accomplish my goals of competing in the USA and World Track & Field Championships. I have no plans of coming home without a medal. Your donations/sponsorships will contribute to the expenses as followed: 


Travel (flight and lodging only) = $11,000
Trip for international competition : ($2,000 / trip x 2 trips) = $4,000
Trip within USA for competition : ($1,000 / trip x 7 trips) = $7,000



Medical = $3,192
Chiropractor / A.R.T : ($38 / visit x 24 visits) = $912
Massage Therapist : ($20 / visit x 24 visits) = $480
Sports physician / Physio : ($60 / visit x 5 visits) = $300
Medical insurance (specific to athletes) : (unknown) = $1,500



Gear = $1130
Nike Zoom Ja Spikes : ($110 / pair x 3 pairs) = $330
Nike Air Pegasus : ($100 / pair x 4 pairs) = $400
Athletic clothing : (unknown) = $400



Training = $360
Running coaching : ($0 / coach x 1 coach) = $0
24 hour Fitness membership : ($30 / month x 12 months) = $360


Total 2013 Running Expenses = $15,682
This is the total expense projection for the 2013 Indoor and Outdoor season, totaling in $15,682. The $6,000 I am seeking will get me through the first half of the season. I am confident that by the midpoint of the season I will be competing on a high enough level to get paid for my wins and hopefully get a contract with a large sponsorship. All I need is the help to jump start my season and my performance will propel me through the rest of the year and a Championship. 
Please remember to visit my website, jameshowellusa.com, to keep up with my schedule, results, news, and other things going on in the life of James Howell. The site also provides you with my past accomplishments, records, multimedia, and a more in depth biography. 
I know that not everyone will be able to contribute or donate a large amount of money. I would truly appreciate any help you can provide; whether it is $1, or just letting someone know about my story and dream. I will be utilizing Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Socialcam, as well as the share tool on Indiegogo.com. It would be a blessing if you could do the same. Please help me spread the word.

My parents were told I wouldn't live past 16, I am currently 31. My Mother who I lived with most of my life was my full time caregiver and suffers from Multiple Sclerosis.

<h3><font color=""#000000"">My Story:</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Message from Mark Skinner (17 year old, grade 12 student)-<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Iâ€™m excited to introduce you to the Empathy Factory and my
new awareness campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Empathy Factory is a registered not-for-profit that
works with youth in Nova Scotia from 8 year olds all the way to High School
seniors like me. They teach us what empathy is, why itâ€™s important, and they
empower us to use it to make the world a better place.</p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The program Iâ€™m in encourages 17 and 18 year olds to take an
idea for a social enterprise and put it into action. I saw a problem, worked on
a solution, and here I am to introduce you to my enterprise, Phone Home, Save a
Life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<font color=""#000000"">Introduction</font>:</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thirty percent of Canadians who are awaiting an organ will
die before they receive it. It has been proven that the vast majority of
Canadians support organ donation, but less than half are actually registered
donors. To add to this, studies suggest that between 20% and 40% of eligible,
registered donors do not ultimately donate their organs because they didnâ€™t
make their wishes known to their immediate family - <b><font color=""#000000"">Donation can take place
only if the donorâ€™s family has given consent at the time of death.</font><br/><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the event that the prospective donor makes his or her
desires known to their family, the chances that their wishes are respected
increase to between 90% and 95%.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because signing your donor card is not legally binding, itâ€™s of the utmost importance that the final decision makers â€“ oneâ€™s
next of kin â€“ be consulted. We must make our wishes known.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><font color=""#000000"">Phone Home, Save a Life:</font></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Phone Home, Save a Life (PHSL) is a campaign that will
facilitate the conversation about organ donation between university students
across Canada and their loved ones at home.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">PHSL aims to host an event at every university and college
in the country. The events will encourage and engage students who are
registered donors to phone home (for free) and express their wishes. In the
event that a student is not registered, they will also be able to call and talk
about what donation means to them and their family. They will have the
opportunity to learn more about the topic, and sign up on the spot if that is
their choice. PHSL will bring their events to students, and host events
that are engaging, eye-catching, and inspiring. We will help save lives by registering new donors, creating
awareness, and facilitating important conversations. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#000000"">What We Need:</font></h3>
<p>Before we kick off our campaign, and start our tour around the country, we need to run a pilot event; to work out the kinks. Our Indiegogo project is in hopes of raising enough money to purchase some of the start up products and materials we'll need to make it happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll need a booth, banners, and other promotional materials. We'll also need to train volunteers, pay for long distance calls, and supply prizes, music, snacks, etc. (to make it a real kick-butt event).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've put in our budget that it will cost us $4,750 to run our first event, but most of those costs will not recur for each subsequent event. That is, once we have a branded booth and banners, for instance, we'll never need to buy them again. We'll spend time on developing training manuals and materials for volunteers, so that they can easily run these events at other schools across the country.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will also be compiling video footage, testimonials, and appeals into a Phone Home, Save a Life documentary. Trust me, you'll want to be a part of that!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#000000"">How You Can Help:</font></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Indiegogo makes it easy! All you have to do is click - and pledge! It's that simple.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We make it easy, too. Our pledge levels start as low as $10.00 and go up to $2,500.00</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm hoping that you'll see the value in this campaign, maybe think it's kind of neat that I'm doing this, and really just want to ride the wave and save a life or two. If you're not able to pledge (and I know not everyone can) you could still help by passing this link on to your friends, post it on Facebook, or Tweet it!</p>
<p><br/>Remember: Don't take your organs to Heaven. Heaven knows we need them here :) </p>

The program Iâ€™m in encourages 17 and 18 year olds to take an
idea for a social enterprise and put it into action. I saw a problem, worked on
a solution, and here I am to introduce you to my enterprise, Phone Home, Save a
Life.





Introduction:

Thirty percent of Canadians who are awaiting an organ will
die before they receive it. It has been proven that the vast majority of
Canadians support organ donation, but less than half are actually registered
donors. To add to this, studies suggest that between 20% and 40% of eligible,
registered donors do not ultimately donate their organs because they didnâ€™t
make their wishes known to their immediate family - Donation can take place
only if the donorâ€™s family has given consent at the time of death.

In the event that the prospective donor makes his or her
desires known to their family, the chances that their wishes are respected
increase to between 90% and 95%.

Because signing your donor card is not legally binding, itâ€™s of the utmost importance that the final decision makers â€“ oneâ€™s
next of kin â€“ be consulted. We must make our wishes known.

Phone Home, Save a Life:
Phone Home, Save a Life (PHSL) is a campaign that will
facilitate the conversation about organ donation between university students
across Canada and their loved ones at home.

PHSL aims to host an event at every university and college
in the country. The events will encourage and engage students who are
registered donors to phone home (for free) and express their wishes. In the
event that a student is not registered, they will also be able to call and talk
about what donation means to them and their family. They will have the
opportunity to learn more about the topic, and sign up on the spot if that is
their choice. PHSL will bring their events to students, and host events
that are engaging, eye-catching, and inspiring. We will help save lives by registering new donors, creating
awareness, and facilitating important conversations. 





What We Need:
Before we kick off our campaign, and start our tour around the country, we need to run a pilot event; to work out the kinks. Our Indiegogo project is in hopes of raising enough money to purchase some of the start up products and materials we'll need to make it happen.

We'll need a booth, banners, and other promotional materials. We'll also need to train volunteers, pay for long distance calls, and supply prizes, music, snacks, etc. (to make it a real kick-butt event).

We've put in our budget that it will cost us $4,750 to run our first event, but most of those costs will not recur for each subsequent event. That is, once we have a branded booth and banners, for instance, we'll never need to buy them again. We'll spend time on developing training manuals and materials for volunteers, so that they can easily run these events at other schools across the country.

We will also be compiling video footage, testimonials, and appeals into a Phone Home, Save a Life documentary. Trust me, you'll want to be a part of that!


How You Can Help:

Indiegogo makes it easy! All you have to do is click - and pledge! It's that simple.

We make it easy, too. Our pledge levels start as low as $10.00 and go up to $2,500.00

I'm hoping that you'll see the value in this campaign, maybe think it's kind of neat that I'm doing this, and really just want to ride the wave and save a life or two. If you're not able to pledge (and I know not everyone can) you could still help by passing this link on to your friends, post it on Facebook, or Tweet it!
Remember: Don't take your organs to Heaven. Heaven knows we need them here :)

<h3>Our (no) baby story...</h3>
<p>Like a lot of young girls, I imagined my life following a certain path – growing-up, meeting the man of my dreams, getting married, and having a baby (in a baby carriage, no less). The problem – that last part has been a little harder to attain than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember – I’ve wanted to be a mommy. Unfortunately, my lady parts don’t function as they were intended and getting a baby bump of my own has been challenging to say the least. Back in 2002, at the age of 19, I was (finally) diagnosed with Endometriosis – which ultimately made trying to start our family naturally, from 2005-2010, nearly impossible. In 2010, physically worn and mentally drained, we took a break from fertility treatments and in early 2012, our journey took another turn and lead us to where we are today, ready to take the leap and begin IVF (In Vitro Fertilization). We are left with a new sense of hope – that with the help of IVF, someday soon, our family will be complete.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that the only thing standing between us and a baby is money. Our insurance company refuses to cover any portion of testing or treatment for infertility and the cost of IVF is <em>very</em> expensive - to the tune of around $18,000.</p>

<h3>On November 6, 2012 Melissa was rear ended in a car accident. The impact of the accident caused the seat to break away from the truck which caused her to slam forward and back. Her head hit the rear window and shattered the window. She was taken to the hospital and received a CT and MRI. The MRI revealed a Meningioma (brain tumor) behind her left eye. It is approximately the size of a nickel and needs to be removed. It is close to several important structures and will be a complicated surgery. Doctors are hopeful that it is benign, but will not know for certain until after the surgery.</h3>

<h3>Melissa is a single woman with many dear friends and family. She is a valuable member of the community. Melissa is the type of person to bring a meal when you have a baby or are sick. She hosts cookie parties for children several times a year. Melissa is the type of person that we all feel proud to know. Melissa has built her own house cleaning business and that is her only source of income.</h3>
<h3>Melissa is currently recovering from her injuries from the car accident. This has caused her to be unable to work until her doctors release her. It appears that insurance is covering her vehicle repairs, which are extensive, and her rental car except possibly one day. There are many expenses that she does need assistance with. At this time the loss of her income is a financial challenge. Friends and family have pitched in to help with bringing meals and money to help with groceries and getting her immediate expenses paid (food, utilities, house payment etc.) We are attempting to raise $6,000 for her which will specifically cover her $5,000 insurance deductible for the brain surgery, expected to happen in January. The remaining $1,000 is to cover her prescriptions. After she has paid $1,000 for prescriptions her insurance will cover the remaining. These two items total the $6,000 requested. Anything over that amount would truly be a blessing, as she does not know how much work she will have to miss.</h3>
<h3>Melissa is living the American Dream and has fallen on tough times. The accident may have been a blessing in disguise, but the impact of the accident and the tumor is incredibly difficult. This could happen to any of us. Your help is truly appreciated. </h3>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<h3>If you are unable to make a financial contribution please help to get her story out.  Please share with everyone you know and ask them to share with others.</h3>

Friends and family have pitched in to help with bringing meals and money to help with groceries and getting her immediate expenses paid (food, utilities, house payment etc.) We are attempting to raise $6,000 for her which will specifically cover her $5,000 insurance deductible for the brain surgery, expected to happen in January. The remaining $1,000 is to cover her prescriptions. After she has paid $1,000 for prescriptions her insurance will cover the remaining. These two items total the $6,000 requested. Anything over that amount would truly be a blessing, as she does not know how much work she will have to miss.
Melissa is living the American Dream and has fallen on tough times. The accident may have been a blessing in disguise, but the impact of the accident and the tumor is incredibly difficult. This could happen to any of us. Your help is truly appreciated.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Kelton Hollister, and I am a 21-year-old trans man living in Greensboro, North Carolina. I am in need of vital gender confirmation surgery, otherwise known as top surgery, to remove breast tissue and give me a flat chest. I currently wear a compression top to help disguise the appearance of my breast tissue, and this has begun to cause me some serious health complications. Due to the constricting nature of this chest binder, I have begun to suffer from rib pain, back problems, chest pains, difficulty breathing, and lung inflammation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've been saving up for this needed surgery, but I'm currently very far away from my financial goal. So now, I'm turning to fundraising to help afford surgery before these health complications get worse.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<em>So how much do I need?</em>
</div>
<div>I'm trying to raise enough money to cover the surgery itself. This amounts to $6,500. I'm planning on covering prescription costs, travel expenses, and the cost of staying in a hotel during the recovery process myself. If I raise more than the $6,500 goal, the additional funds will go toward these other expenses, as well as paying off the indiegogo fees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>What do you get?</em></div>
<div>As well as my undying gratitude, I am providing a range of perks for those who donate certain set amounts. Depending on the amount you donate, you can get a postcard, handmade friendship bracelets, free food or drinks (I'll be taking you out to lunch, coffee, or drinks, you lucky duck!), digital art commissions, or knit sweatbands.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If I can fundraise enough money to at least partially pay for top surgery, the impact on my life will be immeasurable. Being able to get this surgery as soon as possible will prevent my current binding-related health problems from getting worse. Binding over a long period of time has proven to often cause irreversible health problems, including but not limited to rib breaking or deformation, permanent organ deformation and damage, and heart and lung problems. In addition, the longer I wear a binder over a protracted period of time, the more my breast tissue and skin elasticity degrade, making the surgery more difficult and less effective.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fundraising for the top surgery will also have other long-reaching effects in my life. I plan on going into LGBTQ* advocacy and education in the future, and I will need to complete a graduate degree in order to do so. As it is right now, all of my savings are going toward top surgery. If I can use fundraising to fund the surgery, more of my savings can go toward affording grad school. I truly believe that if I can afford graduate school and move into advocacy and education, I can have a positive impact on the world and the lives of LGBTQ* individuals. Being able to get top surgery out of the way would help me do this sooner rather than later.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to donate and spread the word, and plenty of impact your contribution will have on my life and the world!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>Please note:</em> While I am accepting donations both through credit card and paypal, credit card is preferred over paypal, as paypal takes a tax from donations. If you must use paypal, please list the donation as a ""gift"" so that the tax is lesser. Thank you!</div></div>","Short Summary

<p>It would be useless for us to give any description of the events that transpired on Monday, April 15th at the Boston Marathon. We’ve all seen them on TV, heard them on radio and read about them in the press. Americans from across the country sat glued to their TVs and the Internet as updates came pouring in from Boston. Thoughts and prayers flooded social networks with iconic images spurring from all over the country. We are taking these thoughts and prayers one step further! We believe Americans and especially Bostonians are resilient people! In times of need, we look toward the San Diego community to unite in helping in any way we can!</p>
<h3>Why a fundraising campaign?</h3>
<p>Actions speak louder than words! While none of our statements can turn back time, we can move forward and help out! We are fundraising for a total of $5000 (min) and hoping to bring San Diego together and send a message of brotherhood and love to our friends in Boston.</p>
<p>We have decided to focus our fundraising campaign on Mr. Jeff Bauman Jr., the man pictured below, who lost both legs in the blast and is currently in the hospital recovering. Mr. Bauman Jr. didn't even get out of intensive care and already has helped the FBI identify the individuals responsible for the Boston attacks. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/boston-bombing-victim-in-iconic-photo-helped-identify-attackers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read more here.</a></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p>We had initially started the campaign with the thought of splitting the donations between Mr. Bauman Jr. and the Red Cross and fully intend on honoring that commitment to our donors who have ALREADY DONATED as of 4/19 at 4:15PM Pacific Standard Time (PST). We have reached out to our donors to determine how much of the money will be going to the Red Cross. Anything raised BEYOND the timepoint above will be going to Mr. Bauman Jr.</p>

<p>We were hesitant to mention Jeff's name for a while until we were able to reach his family and get permission. Good news! We were able to reach Jennifer Maybury and John Sullivan who are there with Jeff. They gave permission and now the San Diego community knows the positive identity of our beneficiary! </p>

Carroll just turned 40, and is a single mother to two children, Jacob 9 and Alyssa 13. She has donated blood since she was old enough to do so- started at age 17. Carroll felt donating blood was vital, but that it seemed like there was more she could do. She wasn’t sure what that was until a friend from high school told her about a Facebook page called, “Are you and O?” As it turned out, Carroll was, indeed, and O! She read about Gord Johnson, and how his kidneys failed after a cut received playing hockey became infected. She read how he has two young children with whom he can no longer run and play because he feels like he constantly has the flu. She discovered Gord was on the deceased donor list for kidney, but they estimated it would take many more years, by which time he would most likely be too sick to be a candidate for the surgery. She thought about the children, and how their dad had been sick for so long that they didn’t really remember what he was like healthy. Gord’s story touched her heart, and she decided that <em>this</em> was that something more she could do. Many tests later, Carroll has discovered she is a perfect match and an excellent donor candidate. Now, she is simply waiting for them to book the surgery.</p>
<p>Most people’s reactions have been positive, but some people think she is a bit crazy, especially when they discover she has an 8-10 week recovery period to get through. When I found out about the recovery being so long, I asked her how she would get by missing so much work. I figured there must be some sort of fund to help donors get through such a long period without work. As it turns out, there isn't a lot. She can go on unemployment during this time, but that is nowhere near her usual pay. I can’t believe my sister is going to lose money donating her kidney. Of course, this isn’t holding her back. She’s determined to go through with her donation, and now I am determined to make sure she is not going to suffer financially from her act of kindness.</p>
<p>Carroll wants people to know how easy it is to get tested for donating. There are many tests, that is for certain. The upside, she says, is that she has been scanned and tested from top to bottom, and now she knows she is in excellent health. She also thinks more people would donate if there was a way they wouldn’t lose money doing so.</p>
<p>One way we are trying to help Carroll, is through fundraising with Indiegogo. We want to raise just $1000 through this site to get her through the weeks she isn’t working. We will be fundraising in any other way we can, but I hope the kind people of the internet can help Carroll as well.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your kindness!</p>

She read about Gord Johnson, and how his kidneys failed after a cut received playing hockey became infected. She read how he has two young children with whom he can no longer run and play because he feels like he constantly has the flu. She discovered Gord was on the deceased donor list for kidney, but they estimated it would take many more years, by which time he would most likely be too sick to be a candidate for the surgery. She thought about the children, and how their dad had been sick for so long that they didn’t really remember what he was like healthy. Gord’s story touched her heart, and she decided that this was that something more she could do. Many tests later, Carroll has discovered she is a perfect match and an excellent donor candidate. Now, she is simply waiting for them to book the surgery.
Most people’s reactions have been positive, but some people think she is a bit crazy, especially when they discover she has an 8-10 week recovery period to get through. When I found out about the recovery being so long, I asked her how she would get by missing so much work. I figured there must be some sort of fund to help donors get through such a long period without work. As it turns out, there isn't a lot. She can go on unemployment during this time, but that is nowhere near her usual pay. I can’t believe my sister is going to lose money donating her kidney. Of course, this isn’t holding her back. She’s determined to go through with her donation, and now I am determined to make sure she is not going to suffer financially from her act of kindness.
Carroll wants people to know how easy it is to get tested for donating. There are many tests, that is for certain. The upside, she says, is that she has been scanned and tested from top to bottom, and now she knows she is in excellent health. She also thinks more people would donate if there was a way they wouldn’t lose money doing so.
One way we are trying to help Carroll, is through fundraising with Indiegogo. We want to raise just $1000 through this site to get her through the weeks she isn’t working. We will be fundraising in any other way we can, but I hope the kind people of the internet can help Carroll as well.
Thank you in advance for your kindness!

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ali McWeeny, 24 year old athlete and above knee amputee. I've played sports my entire life, went off to college to become a coach and Physical Education teacher and collegiate athlete at Central Washington University.</p>
<p>7/4/2009-At the age of 20, as a Jr. at CWU I was in a boating accident that changed my life. I was left with an above knee amputation on my left side and severe damage to my right hamstring and gluteus maximus. My doctors told me I had to change my hobbies (sports) and my career goal (a Physical Education teacher). I refused to do so and now 3 years later I have graduated college with a Physical Education Degree and a Coaching Minor.</p>
<p>My medical insurance only covers one prosthetic leg and that is the one I use for everyday life, coaching, and teaching, but I want to do more!</p>
<p>I have found a prosthetic leg that will allow me to return to the extreme sports I love before my accident; wake boarding, snow boarding, natural rock climbing, surfing, etc.  I'm asking for helping to purchase a new leg and most importantly new life!</p>
<p>Not only will this new prosthetic allow me to return to my extreme sport hobbies, it will also assist my teaching.  With the ""new"" P.E. that I have been educated to apply includes rock climbing, hiking, geocaching, watersports, etc. This new prosthetic knee will allow me to teach all of these skills to my students without having to worry about water, weather, and heavy resistance damage.  With the prosthesis my insurance covers I cannot risk any sports or activities that could damage or leave the ability of my only prosthetic in question.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; The Possibilities</strong></p>
<p>The prosthetic knee that this is for is the Bartlett Tendon Universal Knee, designed by professional downhill mountain biker and above knee amputee, Brian Bartlett. Brian works with my prosthetic doctor, Dave Hughes, out of Cornerstone Prosthetics in Everett, Washington. </p>
<p>The price of the leg after taxes is just under $7,000 and I have been told it is worth every penny.  This leg will allow me to return to:</p>
<p><strong>Winter Sports</strong>: Snowboarding, Alpine skiing, Telemark skiing, Cross country skiing, and Snow kiting.</p>
<p><strong>Water Sports</strong>: Water skiing, Wakeboarding, Wind surfing, Kite boarding, Scuba diving, Swimming, and Surfing.</p>
<p><strong>Summer Sports</strong>: Mountain biking, Road cycling, Skate boarding, and Inline skating.</p>
<p><strong>Moto Sports</strong>: Moto-cross, Trail riding, and Snowmobile riding.</p>
<p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong>: Build muscle, Promote general fitness, Increase active, and quality time with family</p>
<p>This is everything I've been asking for and more!!</p>
<p>All of the funds raised will go straight to the purchase of this leg, but if we raise more than what is needed I plan to give the rest to a charity for others in need of help in getting a prosthetic.</p>
<p><strong>website for the prosthetic: </strong><a href=""http://leftsideinc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://leftsideinc.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>After being told I would never compete in the same sports again, I have become the Only girl in the World to compete in Powerlifting fully on one leg without a prosthesis.  My new personal records for my one-legged competitions @ 125 lbs. are Bench-172 lbs., Squat-104 lbs. and Deadlift-204 lbs.  My next competition is in Elizabethton, Tennessee at the Night of The Living Deadlift where all of the best deadlifters in the world come to compete on the same stage. My personal goal will be deadlift 250 lbs. at this meet and my fundraiser will run until the day after this meet, October 13th and end October 14th.</p>
<p>This prosthetic leg will allow me to become the Physical Education teacher that I've aspired to be for so long. With losing my leg when I was only half way finished with my teaching degree I could've listened to the doctors and given up, but I didn't. I knew that it would not be easy finishing college and adapting my teaching and life to my new condition, but I conquered that as well. Now I've finished college and soon entering the teaching world all I can think of is what I won't be able to do with my students since my insured prosthetic is so sensitive to being damaged and out of commission.  I have finally found the leg that will allow me to reach any height I want as well as with my students, not holding anyone around me back. </p>
<p>With your help we can make this happen! I am also starting a personal blog very soon that I will be documenting all of my adventures on so you can follow what you've done for me!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you are financially unable to donate, you can help by sharing my story and fundraisers with anyone and everyone you can!!  </p>
<p>There is Indiegogo sharing tools to post this on your facebook, twitter, myspace, email, etc. as well.</p>

Special thanks goes to Dr Ding, General Secretary of the Shaolin Culture Center, Berlin, Germany for his efforts and encouragement. And last but not least, we like to thank the monks and the community of the Shaolin Culture Center in Berlin for their support. May our joint effort ensure the global use of a clean, renewable and affordable energy technology.<br/><br/><strong>Aims</strong><br/>Ensure the application of the Potential Energy Drive (PE-Drive) as a key-technology to overcome environmental problems and threats such as air pollution (caused by CO2 emissions) or shortages of drinking water (due to the lack of energy for water conditioning and purification treatment). This would be achieved by collecting funds to present the PE-Drive and to acquire licensees.<br/><br/><strong>Why an international Indiegogo campagne?</strong><br/>Because Indiegogo provides a suitable, professional platform to generate enthusiasm throughout the world, get in touch with supporters, promote the idea and last but not least, collect funds. Moreover, people can contribute their capabilities to make this campaign a success. Supporters and patrons will be kept informed of the progress via the Indiegogo campaign page.<br/><br/><strong>What is the solution?</strong><br/>The PE-Drive uses patent-pending mechanics to avoid the loss of a supported load's potential energy while compensating drive resistances, maintaining the state of equilibrium and overcome solely frictional resistance. This way you could use existing infrastructure without making a detour through generating steam to drive turbines. Besides, this technology is available at any time and anywhere.<br/><br/><strong>What makes the PE-Drive unique?</strong><br/>It is a reversible, self-sufficient, safe and clean technology providing an adjusted energy balance, a coefficient of performance (COP) &gt; 9, hence exceeding the state of the art techniques.<br/><br/><strong>Plea</strong><br/>Dear reader, become a team member or patron and support our initiative to use a clean technology to protect the environment! Everybody is welcome to participate.

LanguagesThis campaign text is, of course, available in ENGLISH as well as GERMAN (Bitte scrollen Sie nach unten, um zur deutschen Version zu gelangen.)Supporters from the very beginningNestled in the Songshan Mountains, Henan Province and with a history of more than 1,500 years, Shaolin Temple is UNESCO heritage listed and has long been considered as the cradle of Chinese kung fu and home of Zen Buddhism.
AcknowledgmentWe like to express our deepest gratitude to the Venerable Grandmaster Shi Yong Chuan, Abbot of the Shaolin Temple Germany for granting permission to support our campaign. Special thanks goes to Dr Ding, General Secretary of the Shaolin Culture Center, Berlin, Germany for his efforts and encouragement. And last but not least, we like to thank the monks and the community of the Shaolin Culture Center in Berlin for their support. May our joint effort ensure the global use of a clean, renewable and affordable energy technology.AimsEnsure the application of the Potential Energy Drive (PE-Drive) as a key-technology to overcome environmental problems and threats such as air pollution (caused by CO2 emissions) or shortages of drinking water (due to the lack of energy for water conditioning and purification treatment). This would be achieved by collecting funds to present the PE-Drive and to acquire licensees.Why an international Indiegogo campagne?Because Indiegogo provides a suitable, professional platform to generate enthusiasm throughout the world, get in touch with supporters, promote the idea and last but not least, collect funds. Moreover, people can contribute their capabilities to make this campaign a success. Supporters and patrons will be kept informed of the progress via the Indiegogo campaign page.What is the solution?The PE-Drive uses patent-pending mechanics to avoid the loss of a supported load's potential energy while compensating drive resistances, maintaining the state of equilibrium and overcome solely frictional resistance. This way you could use existing infrastructure without making a detour through generating steam to drive turbines. Besides, this technology is available at any time and anywhere.What makes the PE-Drive unique?It is a reversible, self-sufficient, safe and clean technology providing an adjusted energy balance, a coefficient of performance (COP) > 9, hence exceeding the state of the art techniques.PleaDear reader, become a team member or patron and support our initiative to use a clean technology to protect the environment! Everybody is welcome to participate. Start now, become an environmental envoy and talk about this campaign with people you know and promote our cause.Passion: Promote the use of clean technology and non-polluting energy resources to protect our environment.Location: Moenchengladbach, Germany.Category: Establish contacts to business partners and licensees.Flexible funding: Every contribution to protect the environment counts.Dateline: February 25 to April 4, 2013 (40 days)Profile: Since the 60s, I have worked as a designer among other things in structural engineering, especially in the field of safety relevant pipe and components construction for nuclear power plants with emphasis on earthquake-proof support systems. 2005-2010 I did research on the increase of drive system efficiency. In the wake of Fukushima, I took up again development of the PE-Drive. Currently, I am working on the promotion of this new technology.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------D E U T S C H E  VERSION  (Text in German Language following)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------GO GREEN, GO CLEAN !Mit diesem Motto möchten mein kleines Team und ich, Erich Goergens, die Bedeutung der Nutzung umweltfreundlicher Technologien hervorheben, und zwar in allen Bereichen unseres Lebens: in Familien, Firmen, Städten und gleichermassen für Nationen. Nur gemeinsam können wir die Umwelt verbessern!Unterstützer der ersten StundeEingebettet in den Bergen von Songshan in der chinesischen Provinz Henan liegt der Shaolin Tempel. Mit seiner mehr als 1500-jährigen Geschichte steht er auf der UNESCO-Liste des Weltkulturerbes. Schon seit langer Zeit gilt er als Wiege des Kung Fu und Heimstatt des Zen-Buddhismus.DanksagungWir bedanken uns beim ehrwürdigen Grossmeister Shi Yongchuan, Abt des Shaolin Tempels Deutschland, für seine dem Berliner Shaolin Kulturzentrum gegebene Erlaubnis unsere Kampagne zu unterstützen. Besonderer Dank gilt hier dem Generalsekretär des Shaolin Kulturzentrums, Berlin, Herrn Dr. Ding, für seine Bemühungen und seinen Einsatz. Nicht zuletzt gilt unser Dank den Mönchen und der Gemeinschaft des Berliner Shaolin Kulturzentrums für ihre Unterstützung. Mögen unsere gemeinsamen Anstrengungen zum weltweiten Einsatz einer umweltfreundlichen, erneuerbaren und erschwinglichen Technologie führen.ZieleEinsatz des PE-Drive (Potential Energy Drive, d.h. Antriebstechnologie unter Nutzung potentieller Energie) als Schlüsseltechnologie zur Lösung von Umweltproblemen wie beispielsweise der Luftverschmutzung durch CO-Emissionen oder der Trinkwasserverknappung aufgrund energetisch aufwendiger Aufbereitung. All dies wollen wir durch das Sammeln von Spenden zur Vermarktung und Lizenzierung des PE-Drive erreichen.Warum eine internationale Indiegogo Kampagne ?Weil Indiegogo eine geeignete Plattform bietet, um weltweit Menschen zu begeistern, Unterstützer zu finden, die Idee bekannt zu machen und nicht zuletzt Spenden zu sammeln. Ausserdem können bei Indiegogo Menschen nicht nur mit finanziellen Beiträgen, sondern auch durch Einsatz ihrer vielfältigen Fähigheit zum Erfolg einer Kampagne beitragen. Unterstützer und Spender können sich auf dieser Kampagnen-Seite über den Fortgang informieren.Wie sieht die Lösung aus ?Die PE-Drive Technologie kann jeder Zeit, an jedem Ort, völlig umweltfreundlich und ohne äußere Energieressourcen, rein mechanisch potenzielle Energie so stützen, dass zwischen beliebigen treibenden- und getriebenen- Systemen Gleichgewicht eingestellt wird und bleibt. Dann ist nur noch zur Überwindung der Reibung Antriebsenergie erforderlich, um beispielsweise Generatoren in Kraftwerken ohne Verbrennungsprozesse und ohne Turbine anzutreiben.Was sind die Alleinstellungsmerkmale ?Die PE-Drive Technologie ist reversibel, autonom, erreicht positive Energiebilanzen, Leistungszahlen > 9, ihr Neuerungsgrad liegt weit über dem Stand der Technik und sie ist patentrechtlich geschützt.Bitte an die Leser !Liebe Leser, werden Sie Team-Mitglied, Spender oder Unterstützer unserer Initiative zur Nutzung umweltfreundlicher Technologie! Jeder ist willkommen, um im Rahmen seiner Möglichkeiten zum Erfolg beizutragen. Fangen Sie jetzt an, werden Sie Umweltbotschafter und geben Sie diese Information an Menschen weiter, die Sie kennen. Sprechen Sie mit Freunden und Bekannten und helfen damit nicht nur unserer Kampagne, sondern auch der Umwelt.Leidenschaft: Die Anwendung umweltfreundlicher Technologien zur Verbesserung unserer Umgebung.Ort: Mönchengladbach, Deutschland.Kategorie: Technik, Kontakte zu potentiellen Geschäftspartnern und Lizenzgebern.Flexibles Modell: Jeder Beitrag zum Schutz der Umwelt zählt.Zeitraum: 21.

个人简介：自1965年作为机械工程师在欧洲和美国从事核电站建造，设计抗震的支撑系统，通过被动变形控制分析和保障静态和动态行为形态，工作重点扩展到汽车动力、变形技术、桥梁建造和狭长的高层建筑领域。1975年开始探究能量方案的原因和基础，日益成为今天的PE驱动技术。1990年中断了这个发展。2005年至2011年得以在一所工业学校研究任意驱动系统效率提高的解决办法。日本福岛灾难（2011年3月）之后，我相信转机到来，于是重新捡起1990年中断的PE-驱动技术。
 
当前现状：我们现在有个团队，推进这个解决环境和能源问题的技术、从而构建更好的未来，是我们大家的共同机遇。",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

She has an overwhelming and incredible amount of love and support coming from her all of her awesome friends and family, but will need relief financially as great medical care does cost a great deal of money. That’s where you come in. We have set up this Indiegogo account as means to help raise funds for her medical bills.Anything you can donate will be more than appreciated by our family.
 
Also, if you know and love Bailey, share stories and photos here for everyone to reflect on, enjoy, and find comfort in. She needs love, light and positive thoughts sent her way. Here’s to Bailey’s road to recovery!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

These conditions are some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. and I think we all can agree that it’s time to reverse those trends.Be-A GIVER!We ask you to join us in Being The Change by making a contribution today!Like any business, our vision takes time to build and establish and this campaign will help us take the next steps toward self-sustainability and expansion.Funds will be invested in infrastructure, equipment, outreach and development.  Your contributions will help:

   Offset operational costs during our phase of initial growth


   Expand our studio class offerings


   Fund outreach programs to underserved communities


   Purchase new equipment such as yoga mats and bolsters


   Marketing materials (flyers, posters, event fees etc.)        

We value working together and are continuously creating partnerships with other community organizations. Your support will help us persevere as we expand our services beyond our urban walls to schools, low-income communities, shelters, senior centers and other locations where people don’t have access to the tools needed to truly thrive in today’s modern world.We invite you to explore the partners of Be The Change and the collaborations you can help support! Visit www.btcwellness.org/communityBe-UNITED!Can donation-based yoga really work? The answer is YES! and it has been working for years in studios across the country. As long as we act as a collective community and students donate within the suggested guidelines, we can flourish into a self-sustaining organization. We strive to lead by example and encourage others to be the change they wish to see for themselves and in the world.In our first 5 months of growth, we have held over 230 classes, served over 600 students, facilitated an array of wellness workshops and participated in numerous community events.Your contributions will help us amplify these numbers and bring the transformative practice of yoga to more people.Be-RESOURSEFUL!If our story resonates with you, but you are not in a position to contribute financially, don’t fret, you can still help us out!

<h3>Short Summary: a multi-country run</h3>
<p>We're four girls (Kunali, Sapna, Priyanka and Tina) looking to delve into many fundraising projects around the globe in the hopes of raising awareness of different development issues in our bustling cities. We're based in Hong Kong, Singapore, England and Spain. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/554348_10100415027325708_199701729_53611207_1625751051_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The four of us""/></p>
<p>Our first goal is to support the Indian NGO, <a href=""http://tathapi.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Tathapi"">Tathapi</a>,<strong> in raising funds to build a women's health centre by running 10k in our respective countries</strong> on the same day (a multi-country run). </p>
<p><em>“It is our dream at Tathapi to build a health centre of excellence where women can access practices for managing their own health, the health of their families and their communities.</em></p>
<p><em>“This is to ensure that all women, particularly poor, are freed from the financial and social burdens resulting out the current canvas of commercial and irrational health practice.”</em></p>
<p><em>- Tathapi</em></p>
<div>The health centre is named “<strong>Anandi</strong>” (meaning bliss in hindi) and here’s what it aims to do:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>provide different services  related to women’s health, including counseling, preventative, curative, referral, holistic and alternative health services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>provide self-help and rational health skill-building relating to nutrition and wellness, menstruation and contraception, infertility, menopause.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>answer women's queries with technical and scientific information, referral options and peer support</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>build a library for women and women's health</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anandi will also be a place where women can learn, relax and be part of a collective that will reach many more women, through running courses to provide health education to women to create an environment for rational practice. Women will be trained as para-health workers to provide primary health services in the geographical areas in which they live in, and they will be supported by mobile health clinics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please help us to make Anandi possible by sponsoring our 10K run - your contributions will go a long way. </div>

<h3>I'm in horrible pain.  Sharp, stabbing pain.</h3>
<h3>I need some major dental work.</h3>
<p>My molar has been causing me severe pain. The dentist isn't sure if I need a root canal (he put in a medicated temporary filling to see if it stops the pain.)  At the very least, I will need a tooth build up and crown on that tooth.</p>
<p>I also have a tooth that had a root canal in many years ago but never got a crown on it so that tooth is now falling apart.  So they need to build up the core of that tooth and put a crown on it.</p>
<p>I also need 5 fillings (yes, I brush at least twice a day!)  My dentist says that he may encounter other problems that need to be resolved but he won't know until he begins the procedure.  Plus, one other wisdom tooth needs to be pulled.</p>
<p>My insurance doesn't cover this dental work.  I'm a single mom of a son who is on the autism spectrum and has an immune deficiency.  I've put my own health on the back burner while tending to my son's needs. I really need to take care of myself so that I can take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>Update November 19th: I was in the hospital again on Sunday due to a severe allergic reaction to the antiobiotic I was taking for the tooth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update:  I ended up in the ER last night due to the pain intensifying.  They gave me antibiotics and vicodin.  Even the vicodin doesn’t take away the pain entirely.   They said an infection like this needs to be taken care of immediately because it can get life threatening quickly. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note: Indiegogo will take out 9% of the funds I earn for their fee. Please keep that in mind if you make a donation.  Thank you!</strong></p>

<p>Lyme disease is an insidious disease which can invade every system of the body from the blood, to the heart and brain. It can cause long-term health problems if not diagnosed and treated promptly.</p>
<p>Not only Adelle has health problems, her husband and children do too. But despite numerous visits to various NHS doctors, a cause for their children’s multiple health problems has not yet been found. Although a private test has proved positive for Kaitlyn for Lyme disease.</p>
<p>Adelle’s illness took years to diagnose and during that time her three children were born. It is possible for Lyme disease to be passed from a mother to her unborn baby or transmitted through breastmilk and the child can suffer health problems as a result, but in order for Adelle and Rob to find out whether this is why their children have these health problems, they need to see an expert doctor.

Currently I reside in Jamaica Queens NY. I have been living here over 10 ½ years with my mother, younger brother, step-father, grandmother, aunt, and niece.</p>
<p>The purpose of my campaign is to help raise funds for surgery that I need to have on my keloid scars. Unfortunately, my insurance will not be accepted by this specialist due to the cosmetic nature of the surgery. I have lived with these horrible scars since the age of 6, and for the last 20 years of my life I’ve been made fun of, ridiculed, discriminated against, misjudged and misunderstood just because of my looks! That is only half the pain I go through on a daily basis, the other half is from the constant physical pain I’m in living with this ailment! I need to be able to enjoy my life while I’m still young! With your help I can do so by having this surgery!</p>
<p>The surgery will cost a total of $11,000 and I will also have to fly down to Houston TX, to have the surgery because this is the state in which the doctor operates. The surgery will take approximately 10 hours to complete and I will need to remain in the hospital for 5-7 days and remain in Houston TX for approximately 2 weeks according to the details the doctor gave me.</p>
<p>I have my very own t-shirt business that I’ve started last September. ALL contributors will receive FREE t-shirts for helping me with donations in this campaign! Any shirt of your choice!</p>
<p>All funds raised will be put toward surgery costs, even if my goal is not met.</p>

Here is another link with the surgeon who will be performing the surgery. He speaks about a product that he has released that helps keep keloid scars from returning. He also has one of his patients present during the interview:

<h3>What Exactly Are You Funding?</h3>
<p>It's my goal to open my own gym in the very near future. I love fitness and I enjoy lifting and competing in sports but I want to open a gym mainly because I love people. I want to help my friends, my family and my community be healthier, be stronger, be faster and be comfortable in their own skin. </p>
<p>But I'm discovering more and more that the world of fitness and health is broken up into a very distinct gender and sex binary. This breakdown of fitness goals informed by gender norms doesn't serve a lot of my friends, family and community. Not fully. </p>
<p>I want to change that. I want to be a trainer and coach that can speak knowledgeably and respectfully about fitness issues that not only straight cisgender folks have but also issues that are unique to members of the LGBTQ community. </p>
<p>The first step in realizing this goal is getting the proper certification. I already have a wealth of knowledge and experience gained through independent reading, research and my own training. I wouldnt, however, feel comfrotable coaching and training others unless I held a certification from a governing body that I believe in and trust and that others trust as well. </p>
<p>That certification is through the USA Olympic Committee as a USA Weightlifting Sports Performance Coach. There is no higher authority in sports than the Olympics and I'd like to be certified by them. </p>
<p>However, the seminars to get this certification tend to only take place in very large cities several states away from me. The cost of travel plus registration is expensive but it's the time off work that would make it cost prohibitive. I simply need every hour I can get scheduled. </p>
<p>As luck would have it, after two years of waiting, there will be a seminar in my area. It's less than an afternoons drive away and I wouldn't have to miss work to go. I just need your help to meet the registration costs.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $650 in order to register for the course. The cost of the course is $495 plus gas money and one night in a motel close to the seminar. </p>
<p>Thats it. It's super easy but it's much more than a part time barista can save in less than a month. </p>
<p>What do you get? Besides helping to fund a campaign dedicated to doing one small part to make this world a better place, you also get some swag. Personal coaching and consultation from a USA Weightlifting Sports Peformance Coach, a patch, a tshirt, an awesome handwritten note personalized just for you! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's going to start small but this certification and my gym will ultimately begin to break down the barriers that keep people in the LGBTQ spectrum from being as healthy as they can be. Beyond that, we can begin to push past the binary gender barriers in competitive sports, develop contests of strength and endurance that don't just benefit cisgender men, fight for inclusive of all people in their chosen sports while accurately reflecting their gender and sexual identities. </p>
<p>It's my small way of adding to a growing movement of inclusiveness and openness in the sporting world. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If You Can't Help Monetarily</h3>
<p>Please share this. Tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell your softball team. Tell your church. Getting the word out there is just as awesome as any monetary contribution. I will give all I have to this cause but change takes all of us. </p>

</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">COMPANY PROFILE:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Eulysis UK is devoted to optimizing pharmaceutical delivery
and access through novel packaging innovations. Our groundbreaking technology,
the Single Vial System, is the only one capable of delivering lyophilized
pharmaceuticals within a single, easy-to-use container. Applications include
vaccines, cancer treatments, antibiotics and antidotes. Optimizes the entire
supply chain while reducing contamination risks, simplifying administration and
saving more patient lives at point of use. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To date, the company has been endorsed and supported by the:
World Health Organization, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Royal Society
of Edinburgh, Scottish Enterprise and Prince's Trust.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">BACKGROUND:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Life threatening, preventable diseases plague millions of
people globally on a daily basis. Access issues are the primary reason
precluding the vast majority of people around the world from receiving
essential, life saving pharmaceuticals. ""Cold chain"" transportation
is required for a majority of pharmaceuticals and disruptions along the cold
chain can lead to ineffective, damaged or even harmful products being delivered
to the end patient. However, ""cold chain"" transportation is
expensive; in the case of vaccines for example it can comprise between 14-20%
of the total cost. Current primary packaging technologies for lyophilized
pharmaceuticals require a minimum of two containers to be delivered. This
places an excessive burden on limited cold chain storage space, prohibiting
access to developing countries where cold chain space is limited. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">SOLUTION: </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our Single Vial System offers the only
""all-in-one"" solution for lyophilized pharmaceuticals. The first
version we are developing offers injectable (parenteral) drug delivery. By
integrating the two containers currently required into one, critical benefits
are realized. Imagine the potential to use the same truck that can currently
transport and deliver one million vaccines, now being able to transport and deliver
two million vaccines. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That could translate to saving twice as many lives simply by
using the Single Vial System as the primary packaging technology. In addition
through reduced use of raw materials, it is more cost efficient and
environmentally friendly than existing technologies.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">BENEFITS:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The essential benefits derived by the technology do not end
there. Below, segmented by stakeholder, some of the additional benefits are
presented:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Patient- Expanded access to essential pharmaceuticals
regardless of geographic location. Contamination risk is drastically reduced
since entire reconstitution occurs within a single, aseptic container. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Doctors- Simplified and expedited administration process,
particularly critical in emergency situations. Ease of use minimizing potential
for user error. Reduced time consumption per administration.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hospitals- Reduced storage burden in limited cold chain
space- offering the potential to store twice as many pharmaceuticals without
modifying existing infrastructure. Decreased environmental impact through
disposing of a single container as opposed to two per administration delivered.
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">PROJECT GOAL: </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,
we successfully established Proof of Concept with an ETEC Vaccine through
Feasibility and Accelerated Stability Studies. These Studies were conducted in

Terri has been through the ringer already, just trying to find out what was making her feel sick, and then to find out it is a tumor, not a good hand to be dealt.  She has a family and we all know that just being a mom is hard work, but being a sick mom is even harder.
I don't personally know Terri, but I do know that being a lady in the Pinup Community, means that we pay it forward, and we know when to jump in and help.
This campaign is raising funds on behalf of Terri Patton.

What am I doing?
Terri has been diagnosed with a tumor in her pancreas. I really want to donate some money to her, but I frankly am not financially capable of paying for all her bills.
I will be donating all funds raised to Terri to help her will hosptial bills, etc..
What you get:
The satisfaction of knowing you are helping out a truly remarkable lady and her family
Other possible perks to pick from:
A personal thank you note from me, mailed to your address.And they might have cats on them.
A print of a portrait of me, signed by me. I'm not famous, but this could be a neat reminder of what you helped me do. 
A print of the aforementioned portrait, also signed by me in 8x10 size
And, last but not least:
The knowledge that you helped contribute to a great cause!
Please help me if you can!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<span>My name is Jennifer 
Martin, I live in East Stroudsburg and run a small in home daycare. I am
 currently studying to get my associates degree in early childhood 
education. I have two semesters left to earn my degree. I have a passion
 for children and helping them to reach their potential as well as a 
deep understanding of the every day struggles families face in order to 
 afford care and obtain employment.</span><br/><br/><span><p>I have seen 
parents struggle on a daily basis to maintain work while trying to  
afford care for their children. It is a double edge sword, work to pay 
daycare , or stay home and collect assistance. I have seen this so often
 in my line of work, and I would like to be able to make a difference in
 more lives then I have. I have taken families into care free of charge 
so that they can get on their feet, but I do not have the space or the 
means to help more. Yes there are funds like ccis that does help defer 
the cost of daycare, but keep in mind you must meet their guidelines and
 there normally is a long waiting list. In order to receive the help,You
 must already be working at least 20 hours a week and meet the income 
criteria guidelines. My question is, how do you obtain employment if you
 can not obtain daycare ? How do you actively seek work and attend job 
interviews, if you have no where to bring your children?<br/>I would like
 to reach out and help more families live  life. There are a few things I
 need in order  to reach my goal, one is obtaining a larger quanity of 
supplies to meet the needs of the children, having funds that parents 
can use to help cover the cost of daycare, and  finding a bigger place 
to meet the demand.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping me to make a 
difference in the lives of so many people. You will be helping more 
families to remain in the work place,while lessening the need for 
assistance.</p></span><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am starting small with this campaign, I know the amount of funding I will need to make everything possible will not happen overnight.<br/><br/>I plan to use around 2,000.00 to obtain new material to reach the needs of the children currently in my care. I plan to put the rest of the money aside to help offset the cost of care for families that need it. If we do not reach our goal, all funds received will be used to help families cover the cost of care so that they can obtain employment.<br/><br/>For helping us to reach our goals we will be offering perks such as personal thank you letters, artwork made by my students, and your name on our wall of fame.<br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We understand that not everyone can contribute in the form of money, but you can help spread the work. Can you imagine the difference we can make as a community if every daycare center agreed to help just one family? It would make a huge impact on the lives of our children and our families.<br/><p></p></span></div>","Short Summary

She needs our help to heal.</p><p>On April 10, 2013, Ged was working with a group of special needs teenagers in Quezon City.

With crutches and a constantly inflamed knee, she cannot take public transportation or return to her job as a teacher. She's sold personal items, worked from home by computer, begun several small businesses, and borrowed money from friends and relatives for treatment. She's gone through her savings. She's tried to resume her normal physical activities. But the cost of treatment is outside her reach, and she remains in pain, with her injury worsening each day. Recently, Ged's ENT doctor found three nodules in her neck, but Ged cannot afford further testing to see what the nodules might indicate.</p><p>Despite these health limitations and her severe loss of income, Ged has been a tireless worker for vulnerable populations both within and outside Metro Manila. She borrowed a car to volunteer at Villamor Airbase every night, providing unpaid logistical support to the refugees of Typhoon Haiyan traveling to Manila to restart their lives.

Nelson Romero - Founder at DropMyStuff.com
As software designer for BellSouth and AT&T, I was able to create software that was enjoyed by millions of customers. Products such as:

• AT&T U-Verse 
I was one of the first people in the world to design and develop apps for the iPhone. I designed a highly usable touch-screen interface with a focus on minimalism and stunning visuals for the AT&T U-Verse Digital TV services. I also conceptualized, designed and developed the interface for the set-top box applications.
• AT&T News PortalManaged creative development and production of online content for the BellSouth.net News Portal (websites, video, games, activities, third party advertisements and promotions). Managed an internal team of associate producers, designers, illustrators, animators and web developers in an exciting fast-paced production environment.
• AT&T Media PlayerGUI design work and functional prototypes.
• AT&T Instant MessengerDetermined instructional strategies, design solutions and provided support in development.
• AT&T Video ChatResponsible for a variety of tasks including user experience design, visual design and usability testing.
• AT&T Pay Per ViewerParticipated in the requirements analysis and detail design of object oriented software applications.
• AT&T EmailDeveloped user interfaces, communications and control software for Windows and Apple-based host systems.
• AT&T Voice Over IPDesigned, documented, tested and implemented application features and enhancements.
• AT&T Web BrowserConducted design, job tasks, content and audience analysis.

GoalsI plan on launching the utility in March 2014 but our backers will able to start using the Beta by January 2014. The goals of this project are:
Beta version of the DropMyStuff.com utility site by January 2014.
Performance improvement of the utility - we want it to be snappy and quick because like most people we don't like to wait.
Full coverage testing to reduce future bugs - this is nerds stuff but we have to get it done so that nothing breaks in the future.
Broader support for other platforms for mobile devices. 
UI/UX Design iterations to improve the user experience. Some of the flows require more user testing to get them just right, and here what we really need is more ""real world"" testing. These will be small details but it's what makes the difference.

The ultimate goal is to boost the adoption of DropMyStuff.com as a simpler way to navigate the internet.Timeline
December 2013: Build the software.
January 2014: beta version of the utility ready.
February 2014: Testing and bug fixes.
March 2014: Soft launch of utility to public.
June 2014: Launch of mobile apps.

What we needThe 50.000 USD will be spent for:
Pay full time development for a software developer for 3 months.
Rent for the office and expenses.
Rent for bandwidth and servers.
Manufacturing and Shipping Physical Rewards.
IndieGoGo and Payment Processing Fees
Taxes :-(

What if we don’t reach the goal?Well, plan B is to work on the utility until I run out of money, then try a new fundraising and hope that the work done will convince more people to donate for the development. .........................................................................................................................................

( A safe, effective, clinically proven, ergonomically designed, convenient and affordable one-of-a-kind light therapy visor named after the sunniest place on earth! phew... that about sums it up!)</strong></p>
<p>YumaLite is a head-mounted, medical light therapy visor that helps alleviate the symptoms of low energy and low mood due to a lack of sunlight. YumaLite utilizes patent pending, clinically proven technology that is safe and effective, as well as convenient and affordable (see clinical studies below).  </p>
<p><strong>WHY LIGHT THERAPY?</strong></p>
<p><em>You’re not getting enough light</em></p>
<p>Light, preferably natural light, is important for your health. Sunlight is needed for you to feel normal and healthy. The lack of enough light, what we call light deficiency, can have a negative effect on how you feel. In fact, more than 90% of the population suffer each year. There are many reasons you might not receive adequate light. The winter months, rainy days, working inside at the office, jet lag and shift work can also rob you of light and make you feel these same symptoms. Seniors commonly suffer from not getting the light they need, as do mothers with newborn babies who must be awake at all hours.  </p>
<p><em>How lack of light makes you feel</em></p>
<p>When you’re light deficient, you can experience a wide range of symptoms. You might feel sad or lethargic. You might have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. You might eat more and gain weight. You can also find it difficult to concentrate. You may even withdraw from friends and family and you might find your libido (sex drive) has decreased. These symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some of us feel severe forms of these symptoms and suffer from winter depression, known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD); however, it is a phenomenon that affects people all year long.</p>
<p><strong>When natural light isn’t available, YUMALITE can provide a source of light to help you feel better and give you more energy!</strong></p>

<div><strong>FEATURED ON CITYLINE (ENDORSED BY DR. DAVID GREENBERG)</strong></div>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be featured by Dr. David Greenberg, M.D. on ""CityLine"", the longest running and most successful daytime show for women in Canadian history, when he was discussing light therapy. Please watch the video as I think it sums up YumaLite and its benefits pretty well. </p>

<p><strong>BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES</strong></p>
<p><em>Light therapy—the old way</em></p>
<p>Traditionally, light therapy has meant sitting in front of stationary lamps for up to 90 minutes each day. Although light boxes have been shown to be safe and effective, traditional devices are expensive and inconvenient. Many cost hundreds of dollars and most light boxes are floor or desk-mounted lamps that require you to sit in front of them. Because they generally work best with exposure for up to 90 minutes in the morning and aren’t portable, people usually find it hard to fit light therapy into their morning routines.</p>
<p><em>Light therapy—the new way with YumaLite</em></p>
<p>YumaLite was created to address the shortcomings of traditional stationary light boxes. Not only is YumaLite a head-mounted, light therapy visor that uses clinically proven technology that is effective and safe, it is also ergonomically designed as a lightweight cordless device that rests comfortably on your head. Its portability has revolutionized light therapy devices, allowing you to easily wear it and absorb the power of light while doing any number of things—from having breakfast and reading the paper, to doing housework or exercising. In as few as seven days, users wearing YumaLite for just 30 minutes a day have experienced a significant improvement in their mood and energy. Furthermore, YumaLite is affordable, which means you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get the light you need in your life.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DOES LIGHT THERAPY WORK?</strong></p>
<p>Light affects your mood through its impact on your body clock. Your body clock refers to the internal system inside your body that regulates your physical and mental functions over the course of a day, known as your circadian rhythm. Light establishes your body clock by affecting various hormones in your body, including hormones that tell us when to wake up or go to sleep. Specialized cells in the retina at the back of your eyes, called photosensitive ganglion cells, interpret light/dark and carry this information to the brain signaling the release of various hormones. At night, when no light is detected, the eye sends the signal to the pineal gland in the brain to begin releasing melatonin, which causes you to feel sleepy. Because melatonin is only produced in humans at night, it is known as the ‘hormone of darkness’. In the morning, when light hits your eyes, your brain tells your body to stop making melatonin, and instead to start producing serotonin, another hormone, typically called the happiness hormone because it gives you a ‘lift’ in your day.</p>
<p>Exposure to enough light in the morning and afternoon, and darkness at night, helps your body clock to work properly so you feel normal. But when natural light is not available due to your busy schedule or seasonal changes, your brain doesn't receive the signals it should, when it should. When that’s the case, your body continues to produce too much of the sleep hormone, melatonin, while you’re awake, making you feel lethargic, and too little of the happiness hormone, serotonin, making you feel sad. But melatonin controls more than just sleep. It also regulates reproduction, behaviour, hair growth, hunger, and libido (your sex drive). So when your body clock gets out of whack, these other aspects of your life are impacted. Furthermore, the lack of light affects other hormones, such as insulin and ghrelin, which control your appetite. With your body clock derailed, you may feel, to varying degrees, any of the symptoms of light deficiency—sadness, lethargy, over-sleeping, over-eating, weight gain, difficulty concentrating and diminished libido. </p>
<p>When natural light isn’t available, light from a specially designed light source like YumaLite can play the role the sun normally would. Using YumaLite to replace the lost light in your life can help you keep your body clock working all year long.</p>
<p>You can use white or red LED light with one simple click on the YumaLite visor. Both work as effectively when used for 20-30 minutes a day in the morning. </p>

<p>Laurie Tarkan. <strong>Your eyes may be the windows to a faster aging process.</strong>The New York Times, Herald-Tribune (Tuesday, February 21, 2012)</p>
<p>The New York Times reported on February 21, 2012, that people whose circadian rhythms are out of sync, like shift workers, are at greater risk for a number of ailments, including insomnia, heart disease and cancer, and that researchers have discovered that the body clock relies on light to function properly. According to Dr. David Berson, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the role of synchronizing our circadian rhythms lies with the eye, which detects light through specialized cells and then sends signals to the brain to release the hormones that our body needs to function properly throughout the day.</p>

<p>“Rapid air travel across several time zones exposes the traveller to a shift in his/her internal biological clock. The result is a transient desynchronisation of the circadian rhythm, called jet lag, lasting until the rhythm is rephased to the new environmental conditions. The most commonly experienced symptoms are sleep disorders, difficulties with concentrating, irritability, depression, fatigue, disorientation, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Apart from the decrements in mental and physical performance directly consequent on such symptoms, competitive athletes are also exposed to the additional negative consequences of a shift from the optimal circadian window of performance.”</p>

Although bright light therapy is effective, 69% of SAD patients complain of the inconvenience of finding time to sit in front of the bright light (Oren et al 1991). As many as 19% of SAD patients stop bright light treatment because of inconvenience (Schwartz et al 1996).

Laurie Tarkan. Your eyes may be the windows to a faster aging process.The New York Times, Herald-Tribune (Tuesday, February 21, 2012)
The New York Times reported on February 21, 2012, that people whose circadian rhythms are out of sync, like shift workers, are at greater risk for a number of ailments, including insomnia, heart disease and cancer, and that researchers have discovered that the body clock relies on light to function properly. According to Dr. David Berson, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, the role of synchronizing our circadian rhythms lies with the eye, which detects light through specialized cells and then sends signals to the brain to release the hormones that our body needs to function properly throughout the day.

“Rapid air travel across several time zones exposes the traveller to a shift in his/her internal biological clock. The result is a transient desynchronisation of the circadian rhythm, called jet lag, lasting until the rhythm is rephased to the new environmental conditions. The most commonly experienced symptoms are sleep disorders, difficulties with concentrating, irritability, depression, fatigue, disorientation, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbance. Apart from the decrements in mental and physical performance directly consequent on such symptoms, competitive athletes are also exposed to the additional negative consequences of a shift from the optimal circadian window of performance.”

<b>Summary</b>
</h2>
Our founder is Tristan Lim, an avid inventor and passionate technology and 
design activist. He had spent more than 10 years in technology firms; Microsoft, 
Xerox, Google...  His passion for great ideas often led him to think about 
better ways to get things done and he has now personally taken on the challenge 
of bringing a whole new product to market.<br/><br/>
The inspiration for this particular product came when Tristan's baby girl was  frequently getting sick and the doctor helped to trace the source to the bedroom's humidifier. It was hard to clean properly and its water tank was breeding and spewing fungi and bacteria all over the room! <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=humidifier+dirty+sick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google 
what the health hazards of a dirty humidifier!</a> The baby was also very fascinated by night lights and the humidifier's mist jet. He couldn't find anything satisfactory in the market and decided to create a safer, healthier one for her himself and the race was on!
<br/><br/>
After 1 and a half years of effort to research and redesign an improved 
humidifier <b>from a dad's point of view</b>, we proudly present <a href=""http://www.fountainworks.sg/#!products/c1144"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">myPearl®</a>
    , a powerful, fun, portable, cordless, ultrasonic, air-cleaning, germ-killing, 
easy to clean, easy to use, practical, aromatherapy humidifier!<br/><br/>

<b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b>
</h2>
We have done all of the preproduction and testing work and now we need to your 
help to kickstart our first large scale production run. (We have 
already self-funded a successful preproduction run of 1000 units to shorten and the 
time we need to deliver to you!) We plan to start production on Jun 30 and finish the first run by 15 Jul 2014. Yes, you can look forward to a fixed delivery date from us! <br/><br/>
We have also prepared a series of unique deals to reward your efforts and to 
spread the goodness around. Deals of more than 55% off are in the Perks section! 
So do take a close look and please help out!<br/><br/>
100% of the money we raise here will be used for the production run as we have 
already absorbed the R&amp;D and initial production pilot-run costs. We only need 
your help to make the first large scale production run as efficient as possible; 
bigger orders will help us to negotiate better prices with our suppliers.<br/><br/>
If we exceed our goal, the excess will go towards enlarging our first production 
run and making more units and lowering production costs! We are committed to 
bringing 100% of the value of the campaign back to our supporters.<br/><br/><i>If we don't get the full funding we are asking for, we will still go ahead 
with the production run on our own.</i> Unit costs will go up sharply, so we 
really hope to have your help to make this more economical.<br/><br/><hr/><h2>
    Why do we do this?<br/>
</h2>
Most home humidifiers we see in the market today are boring, bulky, wired and 
hard to clean. In our design, we are addressing these issues by making it a fun, 
funky, compact, cordless and extremely easy to clean (just rinse it with warm 
dishwater).<br/><br/>
This is the first portable, cordless ultrasonic device designed to operate in a 
wet environment. In fact, some of our beta-testers love using it in their 
bathtubs, fish tanks, swimming pools, jacuzzis, home spas, vases, etc. We'd love 
to hear, and see, more creative ways to use our product so do email us @ 
info@fountainworks.sg with a video or a pic and we will pick a winner every 
month (til Dec) 2014 for a limited edition, personalized myPearl® Crystal.<br/><br/>
Also, in this initial run, we are making white and limited edition crystal 
shells. With your help to make this a success, we intend to make a wider range 
of colors including luminous, fluorescent and glow-in-the-dark shells and 
continue to add features to the product such as remote control, customized 
shells, etc.<br/><br/>
Planned add-on accessories include personalized/cartoon/festive snap on shells,

I have been invited (a unique honor) to attend a workshop on Research Methodology in Sexual and
Reproductive Health,  organized by the Geneva Foundation for Medical Education
and Research (GFMER) at the World Health Organization Office in Geneva, Switzerland. This is a one-week course in September, after which I will head to Lagos, Nigeria to begin my nine months to one year immersion in adolescent health work. The GFMER has offered to cover my accommodation costs (hotel and daily allowance) while I attend the workshop, and I need your help to offset my travel costs. <br/></p><p></p><h3>Why This Matters To Me/My Story</h3><p>Born in Nigeria and raised in the United States, I have always had a passion for cross-cultural experiences and giving back. My academic and career path have led me to focus on Global Public Health - working to improve the livelihoods and health outcomes for all persons, with a particular focus on adolescents. 
My experience as an adolescent was relatively
different from many of my childhood peers. Living in the United States, I was able to enjoy the benefits of unlimited
access to health information and services that were, and continue to be
inaccessible to my peers in developing countries like Nigeria. In fact, 
many of the world’s 1.2 billion adolescents
never get to enjoy the benefits of the adolescent period due to factors such
as malnutrition, STDs/HIV/AIDs, and violence. Hence, this cause is important to me because i want to ensure that youth all over the world, particularly those in marginalized communities (especially girls and orphans) are empowered with knowledge and practical skills to live out their fullest potential as citizens of the
world. Through your support, we will transform the current state of poor adolescent health outcomes and empower our most productive citizens to create the better world we all envision.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I kindly ask that you support my passion for youth by helping me offset my travel expenses. Your contribution of any amount will help me pay for fees associated with changing my original flight arrangements for Nigeria in order to accommodate the workshop in Geneva.

I have been invited (a unique honor) to attend a workshop on Research Methodology in Sexual and
Reproductive Health,  organized by the Geneva Foundation for Medical Education
and Research (GFMER) at the World Health Organization Office in Geneva, Switzerland. This is a one-week course in September, after which I will head to Lagos, Nigeria to begin my nine months to one year immersion in adolescent health work. The GFMER has offered to cover my accommodation costs (hotel and daily allowance) while I attend the workshop, and I need your help to offset my travel costs. Why This Matters To Me/My StoryBorn in Nigeria and raised in the United States, I have always had a passion for cross-cultural experiences and giving back. My academic and career path have led me to focus on Global Public Health - working to improve the livelihoods and health outcomes for all persons, with a particular focus on adolescents. 
My experience as an adolescent was relatively
different from many of my childhood peers. Living in the United States, I was able to enjoy the benefits of unlimited
access to health information and services that were, and continue to be
inaccessible to my peers in developing countries like Nigeria. In fact, 
many of the world’s 1.2 billion adolescents
never get to enjoy the benefits of the adolescent period due to factors such
as malnutrition, STDs/HIV/AIDs, and violence. Hence, this cause is important to me because i want to ensure that youth all over the world, particularly those in marginalized communities (especially girls and orphans) are empowered with knowledge and practical skills to live out their fullest potential as citizens of the
world. Through your support, we will transform the current state of poor adolescent health outcomes and empower our most productive citizens to create the better world we all envision.What I Need & What You GetI kindly ask that you support my passion for youth by helping me offset my travel expenses. Your contribution of any amount will help me pay for fees associated with changing my original flight arrangements for Nigeria in order to accommodate the workshop in Geneva. My goal is to raise $600 between now and August 12 when i leave the US. My $600 goal is based on current estimates of my travel adjustment costs. Your support is greatly appreciated, and to show my gratitude, every person who makes a contribution will receive a special token of appreciation from me (e.g. souvenir from Nigeria and/or a thank you note with a picture from Geneva).

<p></p>
<p>FU. The real. The talk. Seinfeld infused with Bill Murray. The Sandlot with a heavy dose of Amen Corner. It's Beethoven's 5th laced with Kate Upton. It's ear milk. A frat movement. A culturematic. But most importantly it's the authentic voice of sports wisdom a tight community like ours has been craving for. So grab some headphones and join the movement. </p>
<p>We go back like rocking chairs. Not just our brotherhood, but the entire Furman community. We often questioned why our story didn't resonate outside of Furman. It is strong inside the campus gates, but beyond Poinsett our voice was faint. We also knew that there are alumni that feel detached from Furman after they leave or feel the desire to get involved with their alma mater but don't know how. In addition we knew that in the South, where college athletics reign over professional sports, Furman has become somewhat of an afterthought in the grand scheme. Time has passed, we have graduated, and found jobs in Southeast. We have seen high school friends, colleagues, and family and heard them describe their college experiences. In conversation we realized that they all were connected with their peers and respective schools, but no one seemed to have the same genuine relationships (with friends and school) as we did. We have created a true, tight knit bond that will continue to endure and that passion for community is what drives us.</p>
<p>That being said, we wanted to create a voice. A common ground for all Furman fans, sports fans, or even just people who like to disagree on topics they know nothing about. Not only to promote Furman athletics, but to expand sports knowledge and push the boundaries of perspective, all while enticing others to join. This is how we do it.</p>
<p>FU Real Talk. A podcast, created to promote Furman athletics through the spoken word. We talk sports on a daily basis, so why not share our conversations, ideas, opinions, and experiences all while being true to who we are. Who we are as former Furman athletes, who we are as sports fans, and who we are as individuals. Yet, this is more than just a podcast. Our mission is to create a community. A community of fans, alumni, friends, and family. A community that proudly represents Furman and the Diamond F. A community that lives and breathes sports. A community that values relationships and the fellowship that endures. Most importantly, a community that enjoys life and loves to have a good time.</p>

<p>We are a group of university
students, Tiam Foo from Malaysia (Studying in UK), Jimmy from China (studying
in Australia), Ajinkya from India, Jhona from Colombia and Caroline,Mavi and Maisa from
Brazil, who spent 6 weeks of our summer volunteering with AIESEC Salvador,
Brazil. AIESEC is a global non-profit organisation that offer local volunteering
works to students. So, our work in Salvador is merely just putting an effort to
make them feel loved and cared again as they have been getting so little
attention from society and even from their own children. </p>
<p>Maria and josé’s house is where we
work. Mr William and other 16 elderly are currently living there. After
spending a couple weeks there, feedbacks from the owner of the house were
fantastic! There are improvements of the atmosphere in the homes. The elderly
are laughing more than they ever have and workers are filled with positive
energy too.</p>
<p>However, we also realise the great need
of improving the condition of the house for the fellow elderly. Some of the equipments for the elderly need to be repaired and Some of the old
people need special attention because Hypernatremia,
Diabetes and handicapped.  We believe we can help them to have a better environment for their retired life.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Inspiration</u></b></p>
<p>Every one of the
elderly here was once a capable parent who raise up their own children.
However, aging is cruel and it takes away their abilities to take care and
nourish their children. Then they are left here alone with disabilities and no
attention is given to them from the society. We are fortunate enough to get
well taken care of by our beloved grandparents/elders when we are young. It’s
time for us to give some love back to the less fortunate ones!</p>
<p><b><u>Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>We
have built a healthy emotional status to them through, dancing, interacting and

<h3>Our Story...</h3>
<p>My name is Ariana Rolon, I am 29 Years old and I am the only biological child to Magaly Lopez &amp; Raul Rolon (Deceased). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On January 1st at around 6am Kuwait Standard Time I received one of the worse calls of my life. I was informed that my mother had just had a motorcycle accident and was in critical condition. Being so far away from my family I felt hopeless. I thank God for the friends and family that have stuck by me since day one. With out their love and support I do not know how I would have endured the pain I felt and went through all in a matter of seconds from a phone call.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the age of 48 my mother has endured more than anyone will ever will in their full life's span. She was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 19 (immediately after I was conceived). Recommended to abort me by doctors she put it in God's hands and here I am. My mother is a daughter, sister, aunt, and friend to many and it is now that she needs the most support, just as she has given many in her life. She will put her needs before others and deteriorate in her own health without even realizing it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mothers current care giver is my Grandmother America Plaza 75 years old it is only so much she can do at her elderly age and fragile state of health. Since her accident my mother has had 3 surgeries, blood transfusions, skin graphs amongst many other procedures. From metal plates, screws, braces inserted to her left leg and left arm etc she still has managed to keep that infectious smile on her face. As of 1 March my mother has been placed in a physical therapy facility located in Puerto Rico (Millennium Institute) until full recovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know that with your help I can have my mother nursed back to full health and walking by the end of the year. I thank you all for your time and attention. Thank you for opening your hearts and minds. For all the prayers for me and my family I also thank you. May God multiply you with endless blessings. </p>

She has had a long road of struggles and accomplishments all of her life. She has had to experience a lot of give and take. Coming from a large working class family, she was the only one to attend and graduate college. However to do so, she had to take out a lot of loans that she is still paying for. In her 30's, she decided to become a single working parent and have me, her daughter and only child. The only draw back to that is that an extra person to support has meant she has had to work 3-5 jobs a month ever since I can remember. Besides being a full time teacher, she would take on teaching night classes at private and city colleges, teaching courses online, tutoring and even working retail. Through out her life she has lost both parents, three of her four siblings, and her husband in 2005.</p><p>Despite facing so much adversity and hardship, my mother has always been such a vibrant person. Those who have met her always comment on how intellectual, funny, open minded, kind, supportive and giving she is. And all of these things are so true. She is a beautiful light in this world.</p><p>After her husband's death, and when taking on a more sedentary job, my mom began to experience major health issues. Not only is she experiencing a variety of genetic health issues, my mom also experienced lifestyle change health issues that are now leading her to need Gastric Bypass surgery. This is NOT a fat shaming campaign, by the way. There is a serious misconception in our society that fat is unhealthy. There are many healthy fat people just like there are many unhealthy thin people. Everyone is different. For my mother though, her frame has always been naturally very small. Due to her current weight, however, my mom is experiencing serious physical problems, including knee and feet issues that make it hard for her to move around in a general manner.</p><p>The surgery is being mainly covered by her health insurance, but there is still an ample copay of $650. That may not seem like a lot, but due to the deep financial hole my mom has recently found herself in, and the reality that her current place of work is being liquified into the school district, and having a hard timing finding jobs she can access online, $650 is a lot of money. At least, to us.</p><p>I have two options: try out Indiegogo or try to take out a loan and pay for it myself. I am very wary about the latter, seeing that I already have personal bills and school I am trying to pay for on a limited salary, and thus I have decided to do the former. Secretly, I might add, for my mom has asked me in the past to not tell anyone about her condition. We sadly did not learn about the copay till maybe a week ago, which is why my time is very limited to get the money in on time for her surgery date at the beginning of the year.</p><p>Whatever it takes, I am going to help my mom get better.

She is a teacher, a mother, a loyal sister, and friend. She has had a long road of struggles and accomplishments all of her life. She has had to experience a lot of give and take. Coming from a large working class family, she was the only one to attend and graduate college. However to do so, she had to take out a lot of loans that she is still paying for. In her 30's, she decided to become a single working parent and have me, her daughter and only child. The only draw back to that is that an extra person to support has meant she has had to work 3-5 jobs a month ever since I can remember. Besides being a full time teacher, she would take on teaching night classes at private and city colleges, teaching courses online, tutoring and even working retail. Through out her life she has lost both parents, three of her four siblings, and her husband in 2005.Despite facing so much adversity and hardship, my mother has always been such a vibrant person. Those who have met her always comment on how intellectual, funny, open minded, kind, supportive and giving she is. And all of these things are so true. She is a beautiful light in this world.After her husband's death, and when taking on a more sedentary job, my mom began to experience major health issues. Not only is she experiencing a variety of genetic health issues, my mom also experienced lifestyle change health issues that are now leading her to need Gastric Bypass surgery. This is NOT a fat shaming campaign, by the way. There is a serious misconception in our society that fat is unhealthy. There are many healthy fat people just like there are many unhealthy thin people. Everyone is different. For my mother though, her frame has always been naturally very small. Due to her current weight, however, my mom is experiencing serious physical problems, including knee and feet issues that make it hard for her to move around in a general manner.The surgery is being mainly covered by her health insurance, but there is still an ample copay of $650. That may not seem like a lot, but due to the deep financial hole my mom has recently found herself in, and the reality that her current place of work is being liquified into the school district, and having a hard timing finding jobs she can access online, $650 is a lot of money. At least, to us.I have two options: try out Indiegogo or try to take out a loan and pay for it myself. I am very wary about the latter, seeing that I already have personal bills and school I am trying to pay for on a limited salary, and thus I have decided to do the former. Secretly, I might add, for my mom has asked me in the past to not tell anyone about her condition. We sadly did not learn about the copay till maybe a week ago, which is why my time is very limited to get the money in on time for her surgery date at the beginning of the year.Whatever it takes, I am going to help my mom get better. She has always been there for me, even though I haven't always been able to be there for her. She has always been so giving, and she really deserves to finally be the one receiving some positivity and kindness.Thank you for your consideration and happy holidays.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I’m Lithuanian and I grew up in Australia. I finished year
12 at Melbourne Girls’ College in November of last year (2014) with an awesome
score of 91.4. Now I’m 18 and exploring the world during my “Gap Year”. I plan

I have been interested in environmental issues as well as animal rights from a

15 and I am currently Vegan. Veganism is something which motivates me to help
the world as much as I can by implementing positive change as well as taking
action. </p>
<p>On the 3rd of October this year I am going to Tanzania,
Africa for 2 weeks. While I’m there, I will hands-on volunteer with an
organization called E.P.I.C which stands for Everyday People Initiating Change.
I will be building a well with a small group of volunteers. The well will bring
Clean Fresh drinking water to a community which doesn’t currently have access to this
resource which many of us take for granted. I can feel a strong of
community about this project, and I can tell that working with the whole Team there,
Including the local Tanzanians and the other fellow volunteers, will be an
unbelievable learning experience and a major opportunity for Growth.  I can’t wait to become a stronger, kinder,

j'ai commencé à préparer les repas familiaux dès l'âge de 10-11 ans, recettes
écrites par ma Maman sur un morceau de papier que je suivais à la lettre. Comme
les « mères lyonnaises » j’ai mes cahiers où j’ai noté mes recettes,
celles de tous les jours et les autres.
Un Frichti à savourer !
J'ai bénéficié d'un stage de création d'entreprise auprès de la Chambre de
Commerce et d'Industrie de LYON.
Aujourd'hui je veux travailler en accord avec mon éthique, faire correspondre
mon travail à mes valeurs et à mon choix de vie, ces valeurs étant : le
partage, la création, la découverte.
Le site évoluera pour vous donner des informations et des actualités sur
la planète, bien sûr d’autres recettes et d’autres surprises sur le savoir
faire et le savoir vivre français,  et
mon vœu le plus cher est qu’il aide à vous préserver en bonne santé et de
bonne humeur!
J’espère vous accompagner bientôt !
Merci par avance,
Marie-Pierre BOSLE

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am a volunteer for The Fresh Air Fund (<a href=""http://www.freshair.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><font color=""#0000ff""></font></u></a><u><font color=""#0000ff""><a href=""http://www.freshair.org"" target=""_blank"">http://www.freshair.org</a></font></u>), which is a not-for-profit organization that provides FREE summer vacations to NY City children (ages 6-18) from low income neighborhoods. The Fresh Air Fund has been around since 1877. My area has been participating as a Friendly Town since 1998. Volunteer host families open their doors and hearts to these children every summer. </p>
<p>Last year I started an annual fund raising event locally to help cover the cost of activities that we do with the children while they are in town. The cost of the event took a large chunk away from the funds we raised. I am hoping to off set that this year by getting contributions toward the event itself. This way any money raised can go directly to our Lynchburg Friendly Town, and directly benefit the children that come visit us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our fundraiser this year is a Luau theme, and will be Saturday June 25th at DeVault Famly  Vineyards in Concord VA:  <a href=""http://www.devaultvineyards.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.devaultvineyards.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.devaultvineyards.com/</a>. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Friendly Town program allows children to experience the joys of summer outside of the city, and share the beauty of our local community. The simple, summertime traditions of bare feet, swimming, campfires and star-gazing are important to every child. We are fortunate enough to have this in our backyard, and with your help many more city youngsters will be able to enjoy it as well. </p>
<p>Without extra funding, the volunteer host families are limited in activities. The Fresh Air Fund has a saying - ""Share a little fresh air, Change a child's life."" By contributing to this campaign, you are touching a child's life. Every experience a child has, whether good or bad, is a building block toward their future. Please help us give them more positive experiences.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is our second annual fundraiser. We have to cover the costs of the facility, the food and beverages, the decorations, the flyers, tickets and any special permits required. </p>
<p>All funds received will go directly toward the fundraiser cost. If we do not meet the goal, we will still have the fundraiser. The remainder of the cost will just come out of the funds raised from ticket sales. If we receive more money than needed, the extra money will be donated directly to The Fresh Air Fund's Lynchburg Friendly Town.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any amount, small or large will be helpful. Please consider helping us today. </p>

<p>Our Story began with a Father of four daughters and Grandfather of three. They inspired him to research healthier snack alternatives.</p>
<p><img alt=""RD Box"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1349.photobucket.com/albums/p741/RiceDelites/78ee975f-4586-4911-a999-7c708ea9e8ef_zpsd1b03947.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Taking a look at the junk food that had spread to epidemic levels throughout the schools, it was alarming to find the number of ingredients in processed food that is nowhere near being healthy. Ingredients such as sugar, glucose, fructose, gelatin, artificial flavour and colour.  </p>
<p>One of the largest culprits found was refined sugar. </p>
<p><em>Over the last 5 years many studies have proven a distinct link between sugar consumption and obesity, type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancers. In September 2011, the Province of Ontario implemented new nutritional guidelines that were to be introduced in the school systems that encouraged healthier eating. This soon expanded across many other provinces in Canada as well into the United States.</em></p>

<p>So we began researching ingredients that would replace the unhealthy ones in traditional snacks. This became quite the challenge as albeit the product maybe healthier, it still has to taste good!</p>
<p> </p>

These treats were sold everywhere and a favourite for many children (and adults!) through the last several decades, but they were unhealthy and therefore no longer allowed in schools. The quest was not to re-invent marshmallow squares, but to make them healthier. </p>
<p>We found Xylitol, a natural sweetener, to replace sugar. Brown rice to replace the traditional white rice. We were able to make them gluten free, peanut free, low in sodium and safe for diabetics. The end product is something that we certainly love to eat, and are proud to call it the healthiest marshmallow square. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our next step is to make Rice Delites available to everyone as a healthier snack option. This is where you come in!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is the money for?</h3>
<p>The money we are raising will allow Rice Delites to begin our first production run, including ingredients, packaging, shipping costs, and other related fees. The purchase of inventory will ensure prompt delivery to our customers.</p>
<p>The money will also fund the marketing and promotional campaign.For Rice Delites to be able to become a household name, it will require a fair amount of marketing and consumer education about the benefits of Rice Delites and its ingredients.  We want people to know that this product is available in stores, how good it tastes, and how much better it is than the traditional sugar-loaded marshmallow squares. We also want to be transparent about the ingredients that go into our product, so consumers can make an informed decision regarding the purchase of a healthier snack food.</p>

Our next step is to make Rice Delites available to everyone as a healthier snack option. This is where you come in!


What is the money for?
The money we are raising will allow Rice Delites to begin our first production run, including ingredients, packaging, shipping costs, and other related fees. The purchase of inventory will ensure prompt delivery to our customers.
The money will also fund the marketing and promotional campaign.For Rice Delites to be able to become a household name, it will require a fair amount of marketing and consumer education about the benefits of Rice Delites and its ingredients.  We want people to know that this product is available in stores, how good it tastes, and how much better it is than the traditional sugar-loaded marshmallow squares. We also want to be transparent about the ingredients that go into our product, so consumers can make an informed decision regarding the purchase of a healthier snack food.


What's In It?
  Ingredients:

  Brown Rice
  Polyglycitol
  Xylitol
  Isomalt
  Water
  Coconut Oil
  Glycerin
  Agar
  Egg White Powder (dried egg, albumen, yeast, citric acid)

<h1><b>Why Snorelax?</b></h1>
<p><b>Did you know you’re not alone? </b>64% of people say that their partner snores. Like many snoring sufferers, you and your partner may have tried some crazy gadgets, chin straps, nose plugs, and mouth-guards.</p>
<p>Snorelax is different. They’re non-invasive, comfortable and effective from the moment you apply them. You can move your mouth freely, but when you relax they hold your jaw in place. You can sleep in any position you like, and Snorelax stays on all-night long.</p>

<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p><b>Snorelax </b>fulfills the personal quest of our founding team of Medical Doctors to end snoring.</p>
<p>Unhappy with existing treatments and products, they decided to create their own solution for snoring.</p>
<p>It had to be comfortable, easy to use and produce fast results. All at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Along the way, they gave prototypes and samples to their friends to test. <b>People kept asking for more, saying it was saving their marriages and improving their quality of life.</b></p>
<p>Years of innovation and testing later, Snorelax was perfected.</p>
<div data-id=""20080798""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1521656747/k8l1yq1wnlqm8qyobolk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Our founders refined their prototypes to the Snorelax you see today: soft yet strong; slim yet stable; comfortable yet effective in eliminating snoring.</p>

<br/>FAQ</h1>
</div>
<p>We're standing by to answer your questions, but here are some of the most common inquiries we receive:</p>
<p><b>I have facial hair.  Will Snorelax still work?</b></p>
<ul><li>Yes!  Snorelax works on all faces, with or without facial hair.  We do not recommend using Snorelax if your facial hair is longer than 1 inch, but rest assured that our R&amp;D is aggressively working on creating a version intended for long facial hair.</li></ul>
<p><b>Does it pull on the skin...is that what it's doing?</b></p>
<ul><li>Definitely NOT.  Snorelax adhesive is created with sensitive skin in mind, as not made with natural rubber latex.  Snorelax adheres to the skin, comfortably, and keeps your jaw from dropping when your muscles relax.  Your skin will not feel a pull or tightening when wearing Snorelax.  Our adhesive is intended for long-term wear.</li></ul>
<p><b>Do you have other colors?</b></p>
<ul><li>We sure do.  Snorelax comes in Midnight Black and Tan.  Who knows, we might even be able to offer Snorelax in clear!</li></ul>
<p><b>Does it work for both men and women?</b></p>
<ul><li>Absolutely!  Snorelax works for anyone.</li></ul>
<p><b>Will Snorelax work if I have been diagnosed with Sleep Apnea?</b></p>
<ul><li>Snorelax does not cure or treat Sleep Apnea.  Snorelax improves breathing by preventing obstruction from your jaw dropping.  Please consult your physician for Sleep Apnea treatments.</li></ul>

Our Story
Snorelax fulfills the personal quest of our founding team of Medical Doctors to end snoring.
Unhappy with existing treatments and products, they decided to create their own solution for snoring.
It had to be comfortable, easy to use and produce fast results. All at an affordable price.
Along the way, they gave prototypes and samples to their friends to test. People kept asking for more, saying it was saving their marriages and improving their quality of life.
Years of innovation and testing later, Snorelax was perfected.

Our founders refined their prototypes to the Snorelax you see today: soft yet strong; slim yet stable; comfortable yet effective in eliminating snoring.

Kickstarter will enable us to reach the minimum order quantity required and produce the first commercial run of Snorelax. We need your help. 
TimelineWe’ve self-funded the technology, design, development, and testing for Snorelax. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, and packaging. 
 
 


FAQ

We're standing by to answer your questions, but here are some of the most common inquiries we receive:
I have facial hair.  Will Snorelax still work?
Yes!  Snorelax works on all faces, with or without facial hair.  We do not recommend using Snorelax if your facial hair is longer than 1 inch, but rest assured that our R&D is aggressively working on creating a version intended for long facial hair.
Does it pull on the skin...is that what it's doing?
Definitely NOT.  Snorelax adhesive is created with sensitive skin in mind, as not made with natural rubber latex.  Snorelax adheres to the skin, comfortably, and keeps your jaw from dropping when your muscles relax.  Your skin will not feel a pull or tightening when wearing Snorelax.  Our adhesive is intended for long-term wear.
Do you have other colors?
We sure do.  Snorelax comes in Midnight Black and Tan.  Who knows, we might even be able to offer Snorelax in clear!
Does it work for both men and women?
Absolutely!  Snorelax works for anyone.
Will Snorelax work if I have been diagnosed with Sleep Apnea?
Snorelax does not cure or treat Sleep Apnea.  Snorelax improves breathing by preventing obstruction from your jaw dropping.  Please consult your physician for Sleep Apnea treatments.

When will the planters ship?<br/><br/>A.
 The plant pots are already manufactured but need post processing work 
will be ready to ship Jan/Feb in plenty of time for new growing season.<br/><br/><p>Q. Do you ship to the [insert country here]?</p><p>A. P&amp;P is done at cost +20% (original receipts for delivery will be forwarded as proof)  you are welcome to organise your own delivery but a packaging fee will apply.</p><p></p><p>Q. Are these planters hydroponic recirculation compatible? </p><p>A.
 They do not come with a recirculation tray we recommend DTW (Drain to waste) but it is 
possible to rig up a recirculation system by raising the floor and using
 trays. With your support we hope to offer a simplified value for money solution! <br/></p><b>Indoors only</b><br/><br/>Q. How many plants should I use for my growing area?<br/><br/>A. This depends 
largely on the type of plants you want to grow, the amount of time you want to 
veg them for, how large you would like you plants to finish. When 
growing larger plants like tomatoes, or certain strains of chillies it 
often best to use an empty pot as a spacer to grow 1/2 the plants when 
growing indoors. When the plant grows too big for the available space unstack the pot and add an empty pot between the 2 pots then restack.<br/><br/>Q. What lighting is suitable for the planters?<br/>A. HPS, MH, Varying wattages from 150w through to 1kw.<br/>Fluorescent and LED's can be useful for leafy crops or vegetative growth or for hobbyist growing.<br/><br/>Q. Do I need a cool tube for HPS/MH lamps?<br/>A. This is personal preference, cool tubes help with temperature and create a safe zone around the lamp but you do lose ~8% of the light. A bare lamp is more efficient and sometimes the heat can be beneficial but more care must be used.<br/>WE DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING INSIDE THE GROW AREA WITH THE LIGHTS ON!<br/><br/>Q. What size grow tent do I need to buy?<br/>A. Depends on how you use it if using a 1.2M2 or smaller grow tent we recommend making a single wall 4 pots high. For 1.5M2 or larger grow tents we recommend 4 sides in a 360° arrangement which will also give highest yields.<br/><br/>Q, Will I need increased ventilation?<br/>A. Yes since you will be growing 2-4 times more plants than traditional methods we recommend changing the air a minimum of 40 times per hour for maximum results.<br/><br/><br/></div>","****Thank you to all those who checked out our campaign due to lack on supporters we have decided to no longer offer planters on Indiegogo whilst we decide the right fit for our product.

feature.Long  term goalsThe eventual goal is to unite the veg and flower pot into a single piece without compromising form or function.To open up exciting new possibilities in home food production indoor and outdoors.To continue innovation both vertically and in other new surprising and exciting areas.To continue development of a secret project!What we would do with your money£1000 build a co2 enhanced, aircon grow room for testing.£5000 development and further testing of recirculation.£10000 Also manufacture and delivery of recirculation accessory to market.£15000 development of aquaponics add on we have tested already but need funds to manufacture and for CE certification.£20000 Plant pot spacers so you grow much larger plants in the planter.£30000 Plant pot stands so the can free stand at moment we recommend using a wall bracket for outdoors and supporting pots with chains when used indoors. The pots free stand fine already but become front heavy in flower.£35000 Manufacture flat packs 1200l fish tank to go with the planters.FAQGeneralQ. Are the planters compatible with hydroponics?A. Yes the planters love coco, perlite/vermiculite mix, fytocell and other hydroponic mediums.Q, What is the volume of the planterA. 4l to brim, 3.5l to top of plant hole, 3l to bottom all sizes are approximate.Q. How do I support the plants?A. You can use a net or cane to support plants.Q. How big a plant can I grow?A. We grew medium sized tomato plants with little issues in 1 pot organically watering every other day.Q. When will the planters ship?A.
 The plant pots are already manufactured but need post processing work 
will be ready to ship Jan/Feb in plenty of time for new growing season.Q. Do you ship to the [insert country here]?A. P&P is done at cost +20% (original receipts for delivery will be forwarded as proof)  you are welcome to organise your own delivery but a packaging fee will apply.Q. Are these planters hydroponic recirculation compatible? A.
 They do not come with a recirculation tray we recommend DTW (Drain to waste) but it is 
possible to rig up a recirculation system by raising the floor and using
 trays. With your support we hope to offer a simplified value for money solution! Indoors onlyQ. How many plants should I use for my growing area?A. This depends 
largely on the type of plants you want to grow, the amount of time you want to 
veg them for, how large you would like you plants to finish. When 
growing larger plants like tomatoes, or certain strains of chillies it 
often best to use an empty pot as a spacer to grow 1/2 the plants when 
growing indoors. When the plant grows too big for the available space unstack the pot and add an empty pot between the 2 pots then restack.Q. What lighting is suitable for the planters?A. HPS, MH, Varying wattages from 150w through to 1kw.Fluorescent and LED's can be useful for leafy crops or vegetative growth or for hobbyist growing.Q. Do I need a cool tube for HPS/MH lamps?A. This is personal preference, cool tubes help with temperature and create a safe zone around the lamp but you do lose ~8% of the light. A bare lamp is more efficient and sometimes the heat can be beneficial but more care must be used.WE DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING INSIDE THE GROW AREA WITH THE LIGHTS ON!Q. What size grow tent do I need to buy?A. Depends on how you use it if using a 1.2M2 or smaller grow tent we recommend making a single wall 4 pots high. For 1.5M2 or larger grow tents we recommend 4 sides in a 360° arrangement which will also give highest yields.Q, Will I need increased ventilation?A. Yes since you will be growing 2-4 times more plants than traditional methods we recommend changing the air a minimum of 40 times per hour for maximum results.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Here is Suzanne's story, in her words: </h3>
<p>""Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Suzanne.</p>
<p>I am embarrassed to be asking for your help, but I have a <strong><em>VERY URGENT NEED!</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong><em>My rotting teeth are literally killing me!  </em></strong></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>I have always been a strong independent person, but my pride and strength have gone away along with my teeth.<br/><br/>I am living with a rare spinal cord disorder called <em>Syringomyelia</em>, which is a large cavity inside my spinal cord that is slowly destroying my central nervous system.  I also have fibromyalgia and neuropathy. There is no cure for my disorder.</p>
<p>I live alone with no friends or family to help. Both of my parents are deceased. My Mom died of Cancer when I was 25 &amp; my dad passed in 2001. I live on SSI which is $639 per month and Medicaid. Medicaid does not pay for any adult dental in Arizona, not even emergency extractions and all of my molars will have to be extracted by an Oral Surgeon so it wouldn't have helped me anyway.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to afford any dental care for well over 5 years. I went for a dental consultation in July, 2011 and the estimate was over $5500 to save 4 teeth. Unfortunately, because I could not afford this treatment due to lack of funds or credit, my dental condition has now deteriorated to an emergency situation. </p>
<p><strong>All of my back molars are rotted out with deep decay all the way to the jawbone and infection on both upper sides. I've had an exposed nerve root for 2 years and old root canals that are leaking poison into my mouth all day every day.</strong></p>
<p>( Just imagine having an infected gaping wound for years &amp; not being able to get medical attention for it, Then imagine it's in your mouth. This is the most painful thing I have ever dealt with &amp; I have a cyst in my spinal cord, Fibromyalgia and Neuropathy. I also had a perotid tumor removed from my head &amp; my tonsils taken out while awake &amp; strapped to a chair.)</p>
<p><strong><em>I am in unbearable pain and unable to eat most food!</em></strong></p>
<p>I am increasingly bedridden due to the spinal cord disorder, severe muscle spasms &amp; wasting and the dental decay &amp; infection. The pain never eases; the continued antibiotics courses from my rotting teeth are destroying my stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can barely sit up in bed most days from my chronic illnesses and I have found a caring dentist Dr Betz and oral surgeon Dr Douglas Beals who will extract my back upper molars for $1,712.00 and I will need $1,963.00 for a partial denture. The exact cost of the treatment plan is $3,675.00. This amount will take care of the immediate emergency needs and get me out of excrutiating pain. Every penny raised will go for dental care. Any funds raised above that amount will got to restoring what is left of my teeth, since I still need fillings, cleaning &amp; crowns to keep me from losing all of the rest of my teeth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em> Please help me smile again, the only hope I have is for your help and caring generosity!<br/></em></strong><br/>All I can offer in the way of thanks is my heartfelt gratitude and my faith in God that people do care. Please give anything you can spare - <strong>even $10 can make a big difference in meeting my goal</strong>. Indiegogo takes 9% and Paypal takes 3% from each contribution, so please tag contributions as “Gift” on Paypal, which reduces fees taken. </p>
<p><br/>Lastly, time and energy are very valuable contributions and can't be underestimated, so if giving money is not an option for you then spreading the word about this campaign can help me <strong><em>so much</em></strong>. Please share my campaign with as many people as possible. You just never know who may be led to help ease my suffering.</p>
<p><br/>Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to read my story &amp; I hope that whatever you give brings you good karma &amp; comes back to you in beautiful unexpected ways.</p>

<h2 style=""font-weight: normal;text-align: left;"">A GORGEOUS SMART WATCH FOR YOU</h2>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">Embrace is a medical quality device to monitor and better understand your behavior. Embrace is designed to be a gorgeous watch: the band is lush Italian leather and the case is strong, polished metal.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">Embrace is the thinnest smart watch of this kind ever made. It snaps on, then tightens with a magnet for perfect fit.</p>
<div style=""font-weight: lighter;text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1056476/files/20141129165743-E_cross_02_LR.png?1417309063"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">You can choose to use it simply as a watch to tell time, in which case your battery should last 6 months.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">Embrace makes it very easy to monitor physiological stress, arousal, sleep and physical activity.</p>
<div style=""font-weight: lighter;text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1132516/files/20150105081827-mate_device.gif?1420474707"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">You can check your entire day in a glance in a way that is easy to understand. Not only during exercise, but also at work, during your commute, during the night. If you push yourself too much, the Embrace will gently remind you with a vibration, that you need some time to recover. You can customize it to suit your needs and behavior.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">This is what wearables were supposed to be: quiet, small, useful.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">When people that have Epilepsy wear Embrace, they will get an alert when an unusual event happens, like a convulsive seizure. It will go via their smartphone to parents, roommates or caregivers, so somebody can check on them. Additionally, one of these caregivers can wear a 'companion' Embrace too. When the two Embraces are within range (e.g. in nearby rooms), the 'companion' Embrace worn by the caregivers will vibrate to alert them.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">We are partnering with the Epilepsy foundation and private donors.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: lighter;"">Due to the generosity of a group of donors that know Empatica and its mission, the first 4000 Embrace watches purchased by this campaign <strike>before Dec 24, 2014</strike> </span>BEFORE JANUARY 21st<span style=""font-weight: lighter;""> will be matched 1:1, loaded with the seizure detector app, and <a href=""http://www.epilepsy.com/article/2015/2/applications-now-being-accepted-embrace-watch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #BC204B;text-decoration: underline;"" target=""_blank"">donated to the Epilepsy Foundation for distribution to families in need</a>.</span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">1 of every 26 people in the USA will suffer from Epilepsy at some point in their lifetime (Institute of Medicine, 2012). Today, approximately 65 million people suffer from Epilepsy worldwide.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">More people die of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) than of house fires every year. But every home has a smoke detector. Everybody with epilepsy should have a device that alerts people in their vicinity so that they can promptly provide assistance when needed. Your purchase here can contribute to build a better world for these people!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">We have gained a lot of experience in wearable technology and have successfully delivered products. Our first model, E3, is the most comfortable and accurate wristband to monitor physiological signals in real time. It is used today by many of the world's most famous hospitals, universities, and companies to study human behavior in real life. We recently introduced the new version, the E4 wristband. (You can learn more <a href=""https://www.empatica.com/product-e4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #BC204B;text-decoration: underline;"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">We are completing the process for the E4 wristband to receive clearance as a Medical device in Europe, and we are planning to do the same with FDA in the US. We also are preparing this for Embrace. We are very researcher-friendly and also provide open APIs, so that you can build whatever app you want, while we take care of the difficult parts.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">In 2007, Prof. Picard's team at the MIT Media Lab developed a wearable that measured changes on the surface of the skin communicating the main component of stress. For the first time in daily life, you could easily see when stress started to grow, even before you might notice it.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">While trying to help people with autism to be better understood, Picard found an unusually huge response from one participant. It turned out to be a seizure! This led to new investigations with Boston Children's hospital in Boston. With data from over 90 patients, the team learned they had built a more accurate method for seizure detection. Their research became published in top peer-reviewed medical and engineering journals, patents were issued, and a version of their sensor is now in use in hundreds of top labs, universities, and hospitals.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">While research continues for epilepsy and other medical conditions, many families have asked us for a personal version of the device to give alerts when a seizure might be happening. Experts tell us that these alerts could save lives. Also, many friends keep asking us for a low-cost version “to see when stress is escalating” in themselves or a spouse or child. Our wearable can help with all of these needs!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">At Empatica, we marry the best science with the best of design and customer experience. We're proud to finally be launching Embrace, addressing the needs of all – whether you live with stress, seizures, or simply want a gorgeous way to tell the time!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">At launch, Embrace will come with two apps:</p>

<p style=""font-weight: lighter;"">This app will provide you with customized insights on your behavior. You can set up Embrace to vibrate when you reach a certain level that you want to monitor.

EMBRACE EXPERIENCE
A GORGEOUS SMART WATCH FOR YOU
Embrace is a medical quality device to monitor and better understand your behavior. Embrace is designed to be a gorgeous watch: the band is lush Italian leather and the case is strong, polished metal.
Embrace is the thinnest smart watch of this kind ever made. It snaps on, then tightens with a magnet for perfect fit.

You can choose to use it simply as a watch to tell time, in which case your battery should last 6 months.
Embrace makes it very easy to monitor physiological stress, arousal, sleep and physical activity.

You can check your entire day in a glance in a way that is easy to understand. Not only during exercise, but also at work, during your commute, during the night. If you push yourself too much, the Embrace will gently remind you with a vibration, that you need some time to recover. You can customize it to suit your needs and behavior.
This is what wearables were supposed to be: quiet, small, useful.


DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES

When people that have Epilepsy wear Embrace, they will get an alert when an unusual event happens, like a convulsive seizure. It will go via their smartphone to parents, roommates or caregivers, so somebody can check on them. Additionally, one of these caregivers can wear a 'companion' Embrace too. When the two Embraces are within range (e.g. in nearby rooms), the 'companion' Embrace worn by the caregivers will vibrate to alert them.

Electrodermal activity, or EDA, is autonomic data that is activated by regions deep in the brain involved in emotions such as fear, anxiety, and positive excitement. It is strongly activated during the kinds of seizures that involve a region of the brain that has been shown to shut down breathing. If you are interested in the scientific literature, you can check it here.
You can see the powerful medical findings that can be obtained from our work in journals such as Epilepsia, Neurology, Nature - and we are planning to go for FDA clearance.

IF YOU GET AN EMBRACE, A CHILD WITH EPILEPSY WILL GET ONE TOO
Your Embrace will help someone to have a better life.

We are partnering with the Epilepsy foundation and private donors.
Due to the generosity of a group of donors that know Empatica and its mission, the first 4000 Embrace watches purchased by this campaign before Dec 24, 2014 BEFORE JANUARY 21st will be matched 1:1, loaded with the seizure detector app, and donated to the Epilepsy Foundation for distribution to families in need.
1 of every 26 people in the USA will suffer from Epilepsy at some point in their lifetime (Institute of Medicine, 2012). Today, approximately 65 million people suffer from Epilepsy worldwide.
More people die of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) than of house fires every year. But every home has a smoke detector. Everybody with epilepsy should have a device that alerts people in their vicinity so that they can promptly provide assistance when needed. Your purchase here can contribute to build a better world for these people!

MEDICAL GRADE TECHNOLOGY

Some of our clients are listed above. You can find many more at www.empatica.com.
We have gained a lot of experience in wearable technology and have successfully delivered products. Our first model, E3, is the most comfortable and accurate wristband to monitor physiological signals in real time. It is used today by many of the world's most famous hospitals, universities, and companies to study human behavior in real life. We recently introduced the new version, the E4 wristband. (You can learn more here).
We are completing the process for the E4 wristband to receive clearance as a Medical device in Europe, and we are planning to do the same with FDA in the US. We also are preparing this for Embrace. We are very researcher-friendly and also provide open APIs, so that you can build whatever app you want, while we take care of the difficult parts.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY


OUR STORY

In 2007, Prof. Picard's team at the MIT Media Lab developed a wearable that measured changes on the surface of the skin communicating the main component of stress. For the first time in daily life, you could easily see when stress started to grow, even before you might notice it.
While trying to help people with autism to be better understood, Picard found an unusually huge response from one participant. It turned out to be a seizure! This led to new investigations with Boston Children's hospital in Boston. With data from over 90 patients, the team learned they had built a more accurate method for seizure detection. Their research became published in top peer-reviewed medical and engineering journals, patents were issued, and a version of their sensor is now in use in hundreds of top labs, universities, and hospitals.
While research continues for epilepsy and other medical conditions, many families have asked us for a personal version of the device to give alerts when a seizure might be happening. Experts tell us that these alerts could save lives. Also, many friends keep asking us for a low-cost version “to see when stress is escalating” in themselves or a spouse or child. Our wearable can help with all of these needs!
At Empatica, we marry the best science with the best of design and customer experience. We're proud to finally be launching Embrace, addressing the needs of all – whether you live with stress, seizures, or simply want a gorgeous way to tell the time!

EMBRACE APPS
Embrace can run multiple apps in real time, sending data wirelessly to your phone.
Discover more: Which phones and tablets work with the Embrace?

At launch, Embrace will come with two apps:
(1) Empatica Mate, personal stress, sleep, and activity feedback for everybody. Empatica Mate also comes with a diary for understanding better your daily life.
(2) Empatica Alert, an event detector for people with Epilepsy.
Empatica Mate
This app will provide you with customized insights on your behavior. You can set up Embrace to vibrate when you reach a certain level that you want to monitor. For example, you can set it to vibrate gently when your body's stress level is climbing, before it gets too high, while you can still have a positive response.

Empatica Mate makes it easy for you to see how your body's stress levels changed with your daily activities.

Empatica Mate can also show detail how your body's stress level changed during each of your daily activities, like commuting by car vs. bike, meeting with your boss vs. a friend, and physical activity.
Monitoring System

Empatica Alert
In addition to the capabilities above, you will be able to monitor events that might be a convulsive seizure, and get an alert that will go both to the wearer (where it can be silenced if needed) and to selected family members or friends who can bring help.
Discover more: How quickly can the caregiver be notified?
This app will have a premium service with more features. All those who buy an Embrace during Indiegogo will have 6 months of access to the Premium version.

Alert System

APIs
Like we did with our research device, we plan to open our APIs, so that many other medical conditions can benefit from the same data.

TEAM
We are an ultra passionate team, based in Milan (Italy) and Cambridge (USA).



DATA + SERVICE
We take a great deal of care into protecting your personal information. The data are ultra secure and private, with state of the art encryption.
We think data about yourself should be owned by you. We might ask you to allow your data to be used to improve research and benefit science, but every system will be opt-in and you can choose freely to participate or not.

USE OF FUNDS
Your money is in experienced and trustworthy hands, because we already have a reputable name and have delivered successful products to top researchers and hospitals. Also we are working on Embrace with top industrial designers (Pearl Studios) and with one of the best manufacturers of well-known successful consumer devices. We already have prototypes in hand being tested and iterated on. Your funds will be used to expedite making this product a reality, as tooling and production are very expensive to do with the highest quality, and we set a high bar.
Your contribution will make this fine product a reality AND will help people living with Epilepsy!

I got behind on bills pretty fast, since I moved out with no money (having spent my last bit of money on groceries for my ex boyfriend's house).  I have jaw surgery at the end of October, and I was hoping to be ahead on bills, because recovery takes between 6-8 weeks minimum, and I'm sure I won't be feeling up to working with a swollen jaw and my mouth wired shut, so I'm asking YOUR help, whether it be you sharing this link, or donating what you can (EVEN 1$ HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY), so that I can get back on track with bills, pay for the 500$ deductible required for my surgery, afford food, gas, and get ahead so I can get my surgery over with and not have the worry or stress of wondering how I'll get groceries or pay for my car. <br/>I found roommates, I just need to be able to afford a few months rent to ensure I have a stable home to recover from surgery in.

I've been growing my hair for a whole year now, and am going to shave it on the 1st of November, 2014. In the month and a bit leading up to that date (and starting from now), I'm going to be raising as much money as I can for <a href=""http://omf.org/australia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OMF Australia</a>. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My hope is to raise at least $1000 to put towards their work in East Asia.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Some Information about OMF Australia</h3> <p>OMF Australia is a Christian organisation that seeks to bring the gospel to all the peoples of East Asia. Founded by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Taylor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">James Hudson Taylor</a> in 1865, they aim to place Christians throughout East Asia, and share the love of Christ with East Asians worldwide. You can find out more information about OMF Australia by going to their <a href=""http://omf.org/australia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</p>
<p>As a Christian, I'm passionate about seeing the Good News of Jesus Christ spread all over the world, and I want to support the amazing work that OMF do. So, ALL the money that you donate for this campaign will be given directly to OMF Australia, either to generally fund their work, or to fund a more specific mission. More information about exactly where the money is going will be provided closer to November.</p>

</div><div> <p>Now if you're thinking that me having a shiny, bald head isn't incentive enough to give generously to this fundraising campaign, that's ok, because I agree.

</div></div>","The Aim A year ago, I decided I wanted to raise money for a charity or organisation that was involved in sharing the Gospel of Jesus with people around the world. In thinking about how I might go about achieving that dream, I realised I had lots of hair, and didn't need it... So, the rest just sort of followed from there. I've been growing my hair for a whole year now, and am going to shave it on the 1st of November, 2014. In the month and a bit leading up to that date (and starting from now), I'm going to be raising as much money as I can for OMF Australia. My hope is to raise at least $1000 to put towards their work in East Asia.   Some Information about OMF Australia OMF Australia is a Christian organisation that seeks to bring the gospel to all the peoples of East Asia. Founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865, they aim to place Christians throughout East Asia, and share the love of Christ with East Asians worldwide. You can find out more information about OMF Australia by going to their website.
As a Christian, I'm passionate about seeing the Good News of Jesus Christ spread all over the world, and I want to support the amazing work that OMF do. So, ALL the money that you donate for this campaign will be given directly to OMF Australia, either to generally fund their work, or to fund a more specific mission. More information about exactly where the money is going will be provided closer to November.
Some Incentive to Give
 Now if you're thinking that me having a shiny, bald head isn't incentive enough to give generously to this fundraising campaign, that's ok, because I agree. So, whoever gives the largest amount of money towards my fundraising for OMF Australia will be given the power to choose a colour for me to dye my hair to for the final week of fundraising before I shave my head. Will it be pink? or fluro green? or intense, bleached white? It's up to you!

<br/><p><strong>To illustrate the
fantastic potential of the DCarbon product</strong> to reduce the emissions of toxic and mortal Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions,
we will use as an example a <b>City where 1 million gas engine vehicles</b> are

</p>
<p>Based on EPA (Environmental

Know what you breathe. PiCO Home is an elegant, personal smart air quality monitor that can tell what's in the air you breathe. It measures dangerous particulates in the air in real-time. Our high-quality sensors provide critical, real-time information about the air quality around you instantly, at a glance and give you recommendations on what you can do to improve the air you breathe.Unlike traditional air monitors, PiCO Home provides you peace of mind with a combination of high-reliable data, portability, and a low price. 

 
As demonstrated here, you can see how a change in the environment affects the mobile app, illustrating the performance and integration of PiCO Home's hardware and software. What is seen here are some of the key features and functionality of PiCO Home.

As you can see here, this shows our new molds and injection in our factory. We are excited to bring this to you soon!  4.3 million people die annually from exposure to household air pollutants. Most perish from stroke (34%), heart disease (26%) and chronic pulmonary disease (22%). Pneumonia and lung cancer account for 12% and 6% of deaths, respectively.Women and young children, who spend the most time near the domestic hearth, are particularly vulnerable. More than 50% of pneumonia deaths among children under 5 are linked to household air pollution.  We expect PiCO Home to be used mainly at home (power plug with USB Cables).Every PiCO Home comes with dedicated USB cables. We provide one USB-C to A to connect to a power plug, USB hub, or a power bank for indoor use such as at home or in the office. We also provide one USB-C to Micro-B, USB-C to C, and USB-C to Lightning each that connect to a smartphone OTG for outdoor use.Please note that iPhone series DO NOT provide OTG (on-the-go) functions, so we've developed a very special cable for iPhone series, which is USB Type to Lightning that can supply power to PiCO Home.   Step 1: Connect to USB-C cable power supply (to an external battery, plug, or smartphone).Step 2: Push the power “ON” and launch the mobile app (iOS/Android).Step 3: PiCO Home will give you an immediate visual reading of your air quality with multi-color LED indicators.Step 4: Browse further to get more helpful recommendations and tips.  We’ve listened.Since launching the 1st generation PiCO, we’ve learned so much. And very humbled by the experience it has taught us. Since then, we have continuously sought ways to make our service and our product better for our backers. Now, it’s time to deliver. In this 2nd generation update, reborn as PiCO Home, we’ve made the following improvements:
Added Wi-Fi communication

Enhanced accuracy of the temperature, relative humidity, and VOCs
Added flash memory for storing air quality data without a network connection
Interworks with Amazon’s Alexa

Mobile application updates with better UI & UX ( Coming in October )
A complete, new, and beautiful redesign of PiCO Home
  1. MEMS Metal-oxide Gas Sensor: MEMS is the industry standard for detecting potentially harmful gases in the air. PiCO senses Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released by cleaning agents, paints, and carpets, flooring, and even your family! The MEMS sensor picks up any trace of Acetone, methanol, ethanol, and other harmful compounds in the air.High levels of VOCs in the air can have an impact on general comfort and well-being, as well as taking a toll on cognitive abilities.The MEMS Metal-oxide Gas sensing element is first class when it comes to real-world application. It has long-term stability and a low drift (meaning 1 will always be 1). It’s also protected against dust and water making it extremely robust and durable.2. CMOSens® Sensor: When professionals need to measure temperature and humidity, they trust CMOSens®. So do we.3. Laser Particle Sensor: PiCO's laser-based particle sensor is far more accurate than cheap, dull LED sensors, ensuring accurate measurement of fine dust (PM2.5 and PM10) in the air. These small particles are among the most dangerous and difficult forms of air pollution to protect yourself against. PM2.5 particles (just 0.0025mm in size) are so small they get through most masks and window seals right into your lungs and blood.       100% Delivery Guarantee and EU-Friendly DeliveryThere’s no secret about the challenges involved in delivering bits and atoms, but we know what we are doing.

It is an innovative gadget that incorporated the health and productivity benefits of an under-desk exerciser and an ergonomic footrest. And it is also the world's first fitness device that implemented ankle rolling function (patent-pending) which most naturally mimics the walking motion. Officiser is fun and easy to use, and the movements feel as natural as fidgeting. And you can use it at home and in the office, and anywhere you want to.</p><p><i>Officiser is co-designed by SAIDII, Red Dot Design Award Winner, CTL(Changing The Lifestyle) Ltd. and Ryan Cho, Ergonomic Expert.

That is distinctly different from typical exercisers which you use during the short workout sessions. </p><p>To realise those requirements, Officiser is full of unique technical innovations, including the world’s first zero-gravity glide system and ankle-rolling function. And you will be amazed by how much more physical activity you can gain from using Officiser during the 8 hour work time<i> - the effect is similar to walking 15 to 25 miles a day!

And it also needs to give you a stable upper body so that your normal work productivity won’t be affected by using Officiser. We are inspired by the leg swaying and foot pedaling kids naturally do while they sit by the pool. And we have tested hundreds of rail systems and tension combinations to find the motion that we wanted. Officiser's easy glide feels exactly like pedalling in water or as some testers said, walking on the cloud. It is an enjoyable movement that you don’t want to stop.</p><p><strong>Why ankle-rolling? </strong></p><p>The ankle rolling feature not only has its unique physical benefits like stimulating diverse muscle groups and increase joints flexibility, but it also substantially intensified the gliding movements without affecting your upper body posture. Our muscles strain easily from small and repetitive actions. But with ankle-rolling and zero-gravity glide, Officiser offers dynamic movements at a larger range that not only avoid the muscle strains and fatigue, but effectively stretches and strengthens the muscles. </p><p> </p><h3>Why Do You Need An Officiser?</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476284997/btqqdn8wfoaxb8pk9fcd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Officiser is created to address the problem of insufficient physical activity as a result of prolonged sitting, which is detrimental to our health, regardless of regular exercise ( i.e. moderate to intensive workout for  30-60 minutes a day). In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified physical inactivity as an independent risk factor for chronic disease development, and it is now the<a href=""http://www.who.int/topics/physical_activity/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> fourth leading cause of death worldwide</a>.

In the test, we tracked two office workers for two weeks during the 8-hour work hours (One week not using Officiser, the other week using Officiser), monitoring their heart rates, oxygen saturation, VCO2, and respiration rate.

It is an innovative gadget that incorporated the health and productivity benefits of an under-desk exerciser and an ergonomic footrest. And it is also the world's first fitness device that implemented ankle rolling function (patent-pending) which most naturally mimics the walking motion. Officiser is fun and easy to use, and the movements feel as natural as fidgeting. And you can use it at home and in the office, and anywhere you want to.Officiser is co-designed by SAIDII, Red Dot Design Award Winner, CTL(Changing The Lifestyle) Ltd. and Ryan Cho, Ergonomic Expert. And It Is Vetted By Danahan Clinic.   Product Concept and EngineeringOfficiser is designed to be used throughout the day whenever you sit to increase physical activity (Some call it NEAT/NEPA, Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis/Non-exercise Physical Activity ) and reduce the potential physical inactivity time. That is distinctly different from typical exercisers which you use during the short workout sessions. To realise those requirements, Officiser is full of unique technical innovations, including the world’s first zero-gravity glide system and ankle-rolling function. And you will be amazed by how much more physical activity you can gain from using Officiser during the 8 hour work time - the effect is similar to walking 15 to 25 miles a day! And the extra calorie burn is similar to 60+ minutes of intensive gym workout! Why ""zero-gravity"" glide? We believe the device that can be used all day have to be intuitive and fun to use. And it also needs to give you a stable upper body so that your normal work productivity won’t be affected by using Officiser. We are inspired by the leg swaying and foot pedaling kids naturally do while they sit by the pool. And we have tested hundreds of rail systems and tension combinations to find the motion that we wanted. Officiser's easy glide feels exactly like pedalling in water or as some testers said, walking on the cloud. It is an enjoyable movement that you don’t want to stop.Why ankle-rolling? The ankle rolling feature not only has its unique physical benefits like stimulating diverse muscle groups and increase joints flexibility, but it also substantially intensified the gliding movements without affecting your upper body posture. Our muscles strain easily from small and repetitive actions. But with ankle-rolling and zero-gravity glide, Officiser offers dynamic movements at a larger range that not only avoid the muscle strains and fatigue, but effectively stretches and strengthens the muscles.  Why Do You Need An Officiser?Officiser is created to address the problem of insufficient physical activity as a result of prolonged sitting, which is detrimental to our health, regardless of regular exercise ( i.e. moderate to intensive workout for  30-60 minutes a day). In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified physical inactivity as an independent risk factor for chronic disease development, and it is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. (Watch a TED-ed video on the negative effects of sitting)Physical activity reduces body fat and blood pressure, increases muscle strength and endurance and improves flexibility and posture. And it is not only good for your body, but also helps your brain to stay sharp and energized, it has been scientifically proven to increase focus and memory, improve creativity and decision making, reduce stress and anxiety, and prevent cognitive decline. Officiser can help you to stay active while you sit at your desk or sofa, which will:
Boost your calorie burn;
Improve focus and energy levels;
Develop good posture - less strains on neck/back;
Strengthen diverse muscle groups and joints;
Improve blood circulation;
Lessen leg swelling ;
Reduce muscle cramps/numbness;
Prevent cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and organ damage by reducing time of physical inactivity.
More details in the Features & Benefits section below.If you are a fidgeter, Officiser will provide you an elegant way to 'fidget' at the office and in the classroom. We made Officiser because we found the existing sedentary lifestyle (prolonged sitting) solutions in the market cannot satisfy our needs. Listed below is the comparison between Officiser and some popular workplace solutions (Click here if you cannot see the image clearly).  REWARD OPTIONSAll price listed below is in US Dollars. 1. Officiser helps you to keep a good posture. Officiser helps you to naturally develop better posture while you sit. (Watch a video)  It will prevent you from unhealthy habits like crossing your legs, hunching your back, leaning on one side. And you will unconsciously get into the habit of sitting in the right posture.  2. Officiser boosts your calorie burn by increasing your NEAT (Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis). (What is NEAT?)As its name suggest, NEAT is the energy you burn through physical activities other than sport like exercises. And it can account for as little as 15% of energy expenditure in the very sedentary and up to 50% in very active individuals. And it is a critical factor in human obesity and overall health. Our test has shown that Officiser can significantly boost your NEAT while you sit. In the test, we tracked two office workers for two weeks during the 8-hour work hours (One week not using Officiser, the other week using Officiser), monitoring their heart rates, oxygen saturation, VCO2, and respiration rate. And we calculated the calorie burn based on the results. The graph above shows us the comparison of the average calorie burn in an hour without or with officising. We can see significant increase in calories burnt per hour when officising compared to just sitting. For those two workers we tested, the extra calorie burn per 8 hour work day is equivalent to an hour of intense exercise in the gym (or 1+ hour of jogging). Or, to put it into context, using Officiser is similar to walking 3-5 miles per hour depending on your movement types.  3. Officiser can help you to increase blood circulation, increase focus & energy,  and reduce stress. (We used thermocam to track the temperature in different part of the body. The more the dot aligned, the better: it means the body temperature is more evenly distributed and the blood circulation is better.)Blood circulation is an essential to your health. Better blood circulation means more oxygen and energy to different part of your body, including brain, organs, and extremities. It improves brain performance which helps keep your mind sharp and focused. And it also leads to healthier skin and lower blood pressure. In addition, better blood circulation reduces/prevents numbness in your legs and feet. Learn more about our test and the benefits of good blood circulation, check out this video we made.  4. Officiser can help you stretch, stimulate and relax your muscles.You can use Officiser to make dynamic moves, which can stimulate muscles on your abs, glutes, legs and lower back. A. Gliding Push/Pull Effect: improves knee stability and flexibility. B. Ankle Stretches and Heel PullEffect: strengthen muscles around ankles, increase flexibility of anklesUsing Officiser is as natural as fidgeting.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Phyte Club's mission is to make the best clean cosmetics for sweat + skin featuring pure sandalwood. While sandalwood is well-known in the West for its fragrance, it is known for its skin benefits in India. We used sandalwood masks even as children to make our skin glow. Now you can share this indulgent beauty ritual easily as you sweat in style.</p>
<p>My discovery of pure sandalwood's naturally anti-microbial nature was accidental. A flood in December 2015 took out my friend's entire factory - and the only things to emerge unscathed were the sandalwood logs.

<h3><strong>_______________________________________________________</strong></h3>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p class=""Textbody"">Hello Everyone!</p>
<p class=""Textbody"">My name is Jonathan and I am a student. My sister Faith and I are using this forum to tell you about our mother, Shelly Ann, a very hardworking, kind and caring parent. Although a single parent for many years, we have never been placed at a disadvantage, as our mom has continually provided and supported us to the best of her ability. Our Mother’s illness has taught us very a very important and valuable lesson, and that is we must never take anything for granted, count our blessings each day, and to be more mindful and supportive of people going through difficult times and situations.</p>
<h2>What Is The Purpose Of Raising Funds?</h2>
<p class=""Textbody"">Our mom sustained an injury to her back (job related) in the month of June, 2008, and continues to suffer to this day. My mother has always been passionate about helping people and misses that the most as she has been away from her job since January 2012.  Her job requires extended periods of standing, sitting and travelling long distances at times.  The rigors of the job have caused her back to further deteriorate, and she would at times live on painkillers to see her through her many pain filled days.</p>
<p class=""Textbody"">In 2010 after experiencing months of excruciating pain she again visited her Doctor who advised that she have a MRI done. After viewing the MRI the doctor recommended six months of Physiotherapy and Aqua therapy.  However, these types of therapy did not work. Her situation worsened considerably and she was referred to a neurosurgeon.</p>
<p class=""Textbody"">This injury has been progressive in nature, and our mother has been unable to stand or sit down for any extended period, even when lying down she is still in a lot of pain. This has negatively impacted her ability to perform simple household chores, as well as work and also provide adequate support for her children as well as herself.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p class=""Textbody"">As a result of the condition she constantly has excruciating neck and back pains with paresthesia to the right C 5 DERMATOME and also left and right leg radiation. Her doctor informed her that she is a candidate for L4-L5 and L5-S1 discectomy, laminectomy and interbody cages with pedicle screw fixation.</p>
<p><strong>The MRI scans were done of her Lumbar and Cervical spine shows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C 3-4 level posterior central/left paracentral and left foraminal disc bulge causing mild narrowing of spinal canal and left neural foramen</li>
<li>C 4-5 level posterior central disc herniation and left facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal</li>
<li>C 5-6 level mild disc bulge and left facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal</li>
<li>C 6-7 level diffuse disc bulge and mild narrowing of the spinal canal and bilateral neural foramina (left&gt;right)</li>
<li>L1 -2 and L2-3 mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal</li>
<li>L3 -4 level mild diffuse disc bulge with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal and bilateral neural foramina</li>
<li>L4-5 level diffuse disc bulge with propensity to the left and ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy causing moderate narrowing of spinal canal and left neural foramen and mild narrowing of right neural foramen</li>
<li>L5-S1 level diffuse disc bulge with posterior broad based disc herniation(17mm TS x 5mm AP) and ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy causing severe narrowing of spinal canal with impingement of bilateral S1 traversing nerve roots and moderate narrowing of bilateral neural foramina.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>What would your contributions used for?</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the fact that many patients continually suffer, or can sometimes and end up in a worse situation than they were in before after undergoing even what is considered at times to be minor surgeries, my mother is fearful to have this intricate and delicate surgery performed on her back in our country, (especially with the complexities now associated with her back) and would prefer to have this operation performed by Medical Experts with proven track records in this field in the USA. To be followed by whatever recommendations made to assist in her recovery and healing process.</p>
<p>My Mom does not have insurance or any personal savings to afford this type of major operation, research has shown that estimated cost of surgery and other miscellaneous expenses would cost $250,000 and more, plus already the lost of wages is a major cost to the family. Whatever small contributions you can make would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>The breakdown for the estimated expenses is as follows:</strong></p>
<p>Titanium Implants: $130,000 </p>
<p>Surgeons Fee: $35,000</p>
<p>Hospital Stay: $25,000</p>
<p>Rehabilitation: $20,000</p>
<p>US Travel &amp; Accomodation: $20,000</p>
<p>Medications and possible post-surgery complications ($Unknown)</p>
<p class=""Textbody""> </p>
<p class=""Textbody"">This surgery and recovery period will definitely be physically taxing and extremely expensive to our family. My mother experiences excruciating pain twenty four hours daily, and has severe nerve damage to both her hands and her feet. The longer our mother remains in this condition the greater the risk her being unable to continue to support her family. This has become very heart wrenching and distressing to my sister and I, as we go through the trauma of seeing her endure this pain on a daily basis. We just want to have our mom back to good health, and not see her suffer so much anymore.</p>

_______________________________________________________
Who Are We?
Hello Everyone!
My name is Jonathan and I am a student. My sister Faith and I are using this forum to tell you about our mother, Shelly Ann, a very hardworking, kind and caring parent. Although a single parent for many years, we have never been placed at a disadvantage, as our mom has continually provided and supported us to the best of her ability. Our Mother’s illness has taught us very a very important and valuable lesson, and that is we must never take anything for granted, count our blessings each day, and to be more mindful and supportive of people going through difficult times and situations.
What Is The Purpose Of Raising Funds?
Our mom sustained an injury to her back (job related) in the month of June, 2008, and continues to suffer to this day. My mother has always been passionate about helping people and misses that the most as she has been away from her job since January 2012.  Her job requires extended periods of standing, sitting and travelling long distances at times.  The rigors of the job have caused her back to further deteriorate, and she would at times live on painkillers to see her through her many pain filled days.
In 2010 after experiencing months of excruciating pain she again visited her Doctor who advised that she have a MRI done. After viewing the MRI the doctor recommended six months of Physiotherapy and Aqua therapy.  However, these types of therapy did not work. Her situation worsened considerably and she was referred to a neurosurgeon.
This injury has been progressive in nature, and our mother has been unable to stand or sit down for any extended period, even when lying down she is still in a lot of pain. This has negatively impacted her ability to perform simple household chores, as well as work and also provide adequate support for her children as well as herself.
Diagnosis
As a result of the condition she constantly has excruciating neck and back pains with paresthesia to the right C 5 DERMATOME and also left and right leg radiation. Her doctor informed her that she is a candidate for L4-L5 and L5-S1 discectomy, laminectomy and interbody cages with pedicle screw fixation.
The MRI scans were done of her Lumbar and Cervical spine shows:

C 3-4 level posterior central/left paracentral and left foraminal disc bulge causing mild narrowing of spinal canal and left neural foramen
C 4-5 level posterior central disc herniation and left facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal
C 5-6 level mild disc bulge and left facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal
C 6-7 level diffuse disc bulge and mild narrowing of the spinal canal and bilateral neural foramina (left>right)
L1 -2 and L2-3 mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal
L3 -4 level mild diffuse disc bulge with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and facet arthropathy causing mild narrowing of the spinal canal and bilateral neural foramina
L4-5 level diffuse disc bulge with propensity to the left and ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy causing moderate narrowing of spinal canal and left neural foramen and mild narrowing of right neural foramen
L5-S1 level diffuse disc bulge with posterior broad based disc herniation(17mm TS x 5mm AP) and ligamentum flavum and facet hypertrophy causing severe narrowing of spinal canal with impingement of bilateral S1 traversing nerve roots and moderate narrowing of bilateral neural foramina.
What would your contributions used for?
Due to the fact that many patients continually suffer, or can sometimes and end up in a worse situation than they were in before after undergoing even what is considered at times to be minor surgeries, my mother is fearful to have this intricate and delicate surgery performed on her back in our country, (especially with the complexities now associated with her back) and would prefer to have this operation performed by Medical Experts with proven track records in this field in the USA. To be followed by whatever recommendations made to assist in her recovery and healing process.
My Mom does not have insurance or any personal savings to afford this type of major operation, research has shown that estimated cost of surgery and other miscellaneous expenses would cost $250,000 and more, plus already the lost of wages is a major cost to the family. Whatever small contributions you can make would be greatly appreciated.
The breakdown for the estimated expenses is as follows:
Titanium Implants: $130,000 
Surgeons Fee: $35,000
Hospital Stay: $25,000
Rehabilitation: $20,000
US Travel & Accomodation: $20,000
Medications and possible post-surgery complications ($Unknown)
 
This surgery and recovery period will definitely be physically taxing and extremely expensive to our family. My mother experiences excruciating pain twenty four hours daily, and has severe nerve damage to both her hands and her feet. The longer our mother remains in this condition the greater the risk her being unable to continue to support her family. This has become very heart wrenching and distressing to my sister and I, as we go through the trauma of seeing her endure this pain on a daily basis. We just want to have our mom back to good health, and not see her suffer so much anymore.
We are seeking all the assistance that we can get and will accept any small contribution or donation, this will be very much appreciated by our family, and we thank you in advance for your financial assistance and heartfelt generosities. We are also very grateful to Indiegogo for affording us this opportunity, to use this forum for our fund raising venture. We sincerely thank all for taking the time to read of our plight, for your support and contributions.
Other Ways You Can Assist...
We are aware that all around the world people are facing tough economic times, and it’s understandable that everyone won’t be able to contribute to our cause. If you are unable to contribute we would appreciate it very much if you can spread our campaign via facebook, twitter and any other social media site that you may be a member of. Your efforts will be greatly appreciated.

<p>It was remarkable to see how his health rebounded.  His blood work and counts were rising back to normal. The medical profession was astounded.</p>
<p>We are seeking $7,000 in funding for the purpose of obtaining two machines and the mineral solutions and supplements needed to continue his healing.  This treatment needs to be performed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>One of the machines is a detoxification, used to draw all toxins and impurities from the body.  The other is a beam ray machine, that utilizes light, vibration and energy at differrent degrees to target a wide range of illnesses.  The estimated cost of the machinary is $5,000 - $6,000.  The minerals and suppliments required reach a total of roughly a thousand dollars for whats needed for a year.</p>

<h3>Dalu's Eyesight - Blindness can be prevented</h3>
<p>Dalu has keratoconous, an eye condition that leads to blindness. Surgery for this rare condition is not yet covered by provincial health care. This means that Dalu needs to raise the $7000 for the operation and vision care before the end of November 2012 to save his eyesight.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Dalu</h3>
<p>Dalu is a young social justice advocate who arrived in Canada in 2010, escpaping persecution in Zimbabwe. Since his arrival, he has supported organizations like the University of Toronto, Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, and the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto in various social justice initiatives. He aspires to become a human rights lawyer when he finishes his university career, which he just started this fall.</p>
<p>Dalu did not know anyone in Canada when he first arrived. He currently lives in a shelter for homeless youth, and works part-time to cover his basic needs, while going to school full-time.</p>
<p>He was recently diagnosed with an advanced case of keratoconous which, if untreated, would lead him to lose his sight. He is scheduled to have the cross-linking surgery that would save his vision in December 2012.</p>
<p>Total costs to save his eyesight amount to $7000. The surgery and special eye glasses and contacts that he will need are not covered by provincial health care. This means that Dalu is responsible for raising the $7000 to cover the costs for surgery and vision care.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why your support is needed</h3>
<p>This is the breakdown of the costs for Dalu to keep his eye-sight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-linking eye surgery in both eyes at Bochner Eye Institute - $5400</li>
<li>Fitting for hard contact lenses - $300</li>
<li>Hard contact lenses - $800. Dalu will need to use hard contact lenses after surgery as the hard contacts help to maintain the cornea in the correct shape, and to prevent potential undesired re-shaping after surgery.</li>
<li>Eye-glasses with new prescripion - $500</li>
<li>
<strong>Total: $7000</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>It's not only for Dalu</h3>
<p>Dalu has done so much work for his various communities in Toronto since his arrival less than two years ago. As an eloquent, driven, and committed individual, there is no stopping him once his mind is made. A little support to get him eye surgery will allow him to continue his studies, and to continue doing the community work with so many different organizations that he began shortly after arriving to Canada.</p>
<p>Helping Dalu pay for eye surgery is an investment in youth, in refugees, and in humanity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>

Dalu has keratoconous, an eye condition that leads to blindness. Surgery for this rare condition is not yet covered by provincial health care. This means that Dalu needs to raise the $7000 for the operation and vision care before the end of November 2012 to save his eyesight.
 
About Dalu
Dalu is a young social justice advocate who arrived in Canada in 2010, escpaping persecution in Zimbabwe. Since his arrival, he has supported organizations like the University of Toronto, Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, and the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto in various social justice initiatives. He aspires to become a human rights lawyer when he finishes his university career, which he just started this fall.
Dalu did not know anyone in Canada when he first arrived. He currently lives in a shelter for homeless youth, and works part-time to cover his basic needs, while going to school full-time.
He was recently diagnosed with an advanced case of keratoconous which, if untreated, would lead him to lose his sight. He is scheduled to have the cross-linking surgery that would save his vision in December 2012.
Total costs to save his eyesight amount to $7000. The surgery and special eye glasses and contacts that he will need are not covered by provincial health care. This means that Dalu is responsible for raising the $7000 to cover the costs for surgery and vision care.
 


Why your support is needed
This is the breakdown of the costs for Dalu to keep his eye-sight:

Cross-linking eye surgery in both eyes at Bochner Eye Institute - $5400
Fitting for hard contact lenses - $300
Hard contact lenses - $800. Dalu will need to use hard contact lenses after surgery as the hard contacts help to maintain the cornea in the correct shape, and to prevent potential undesired re-shaping after surgery.
Eye-glasses with new prescripion - $500

Total: $7000




 
It's not only for Dalu
Dalu has done so much work for his various communities in Toronto since his arrival less than two years ago. As an eloquent, driven, and committed individual, there is no stopping him once his mind is made. A little support to get him eye surgery will allow him to continue his studies, and to continue doing the community work with so many different organizations that he began shortly after arriving to Canada.
Helping Dalu pay for eye surgery is an investment in youth, in refugees, and in humanity.

<h2>Paul needs Club Foot Surgery</h2>
<h3>This is Paul, an 8yr old Peruvian Quechua indian with a club foot. </h3>
<p>He needs surgery to correct the deformity.  A clinic in Ecuador has donated the surgery that will change his life.<br/>Now I am raising funds for the 1000 mile trip from his Peruvian village to Ecuador &amp; for his stay during the 6 week recovery.<br/>Be part of changing a boys life &amp; helping a family who sees this as a hopeless condition.</p>
<p>Paul lives with his mother, father and 2 yr old sister in a small village almost 2 miles high in the Peruvian Andes.  They live in a mud home and live on the crops they grow.</p>
<p>Paul's family is very thankful for the offer of free surgery from the clinic, <strong><em>now we must get him there!!</em></strong></p>
<h3>How I met Paul</h3>
<p>We first met Paul when his mother Marina brought him to a basic medical clinic near his village.  A friend met him, but could offer no help at this basic clinic.  Now 3 years later, our friend showed me pictures of him and I knew an orthopedic clinic in Ecuador that can correct this type of problem.  The clinic, Bayside Medical Mission, has reviewed his condition and agreed to do the surgery in October 2012 for free.</p>
<h3>Why are we helping Paul</h3>
<p>Our family is preparing to do full time mission work in Peru with the Quechua Indians.  My wife is a nurse trained in 3rd world medical care.</p>
<p>Club foot is caused by malnutrition during pregnancy and can be corrected by basic vitamin supplement during pregnancy.  Unfortuantely, many Indian mothers are malnourished and lack access to health care.</p>

Just across that same street from the vendor with the Coke, you will see a fully vaccinated, healthy, American who has health insurance and can seek pretty much any healthcare she wants when she gets back home after her 12 day volunteer trip.
Community health assessments are based on what the WHO has labeled 'determinants of health'. We know that the poor do not live as long as the wealthy and that those who are educated will be healthier and live longer than those without access to an education...so poverty and education are 2 of the factors that determine health...this is what a CHA assesses: What are the determinants affecting this rural community of 8000? By asking these questions we can help Haitians to learn and create better plans to improve the quality of their lives.

<h3>""A SMALL CLINIC WITH A FEW PEOPLE, A BIG HEART, AND A MISSION""</h3>
<p>Hello, We are a small clinic with a few people but a huge heart and an even larger mission!  We are planning and fundraising for a medical mission trip to Honduras in March of 2013.  We are going, no matter the funds we raise, but we need your help.  With your funding of this project we will be able to buy medicines, supplies, and provide care for some of the most disadvantaged children and adults in the world.  </p>
<p>We are planning on a mission into the difficult to reach areas of the mountains in Honduras to bring medical care and also the word of God for all those that seek help.  We are going to open a makeshift clinic in this area and provide completely free medical care and medicine with our hard work and support from others like you.  </p>
<p>This campaign is important to us as we have seen how so many men, women, and children in underdeveloped parts of the world incapable of attaining even the most basic healthcare.  We have a mission to offer love and hope to all that we come across while demonstrating a true christian spirit and medical care.  </p>
<p>We need each and every contribution to our cause to expand the scope of the care and love we can offer.  With your help we have faith and believe we can obtain this.  Each dollar you offer will be well spent and is guaranteed to go to some of the neediest in the world.  Even if you can't offer financial backing, please offer your prayers for our successful and safe trip.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do we need and Why should you donate?</h3>
<p>Our Funding from this campaign will provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare and transportation for doctors, nurses, and ancillary staff including clergy</li>
<li>Tenting material for a makeshift Clinic</li>
<li>Medicines including antibiotics, blood pressure medicines, diabetes medicines, vitamin supplements and nutrients, and many more based on funds raised</li>
<li>Supplies including but not limited to splinting, casting, suture,  laceration, and small surgical supplies</li>
<li>Bibles and other informational information on Jesus and his word</li>
<li>Toys and gifts for the Children and Families we serve</li>
</ul>
<p>We have calculated our estimated costs to obtain the supplies listed above at approximately $50,000 for a very successful trip that is caring for 500-600 per day for 1 week.  We would like to make this trip an annual endeavor and your proceeds can aid that as every dollar will go directly to this mission.  We also would like to offer other medical and spiritual missions to different parts of the world including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guatemala</li>
<li>Haiti</li>
<li>Ghana</li>
<li>Uganda</li>
<li>USA, including children of the Appalachian mountains and our own poor and underserved</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel we have a special ability to provide for these underpriveleged as our medical clinic is in a very rural and underserved part of Tennessee offering care for our underpriveleged and underserved.  We offer a sliding fee as well as free care to residents that meet federal poverty levels caring for thousands since we have been in practice and we feel like we can offer the same level of love, respect, and care in other deserving areas of the world starting with the Honduras.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Impact will your donation have?</h3>
<p>This project is important to all Christians and Americans as it demonstrates the American and Christian spirit of giving and love is not lost.  I have always felt that the best way to demonstrate what it is to truly be American is to show Christ's Love and Giving.  We can offer this love and Christ's spirit through medical care for the truly underpriveleged and his word and your contribution can aid this.  You will surely be blessed.  </p>
<p>For Institutions or individuals that donate, your contribution is tax deductible and can go a long way to demonstrating your true care for others.  </p>
