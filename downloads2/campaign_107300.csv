<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>First, I would like to thank you for visiting this site and for considering making a donation.</p>
<p>The Age of Maturity is a web series that was written to shed light on some of the issues that young adults face as we go out into the world and try to make it on our own. I feel that it is important to share these types of stories to let this group of people know that they are not alone. We all have issues dealing with family, relationships, education and finding the right career. I believe this series can be both inspirational and entertaining.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to have quite a few aspiring filmmakers come on board to help bring this vision to life. Now I ask that you help continue the process. A donation of any size would be helpful and all the proceeds would go into the production. The money would be used to post-production (video editing, color correction, sound design, graphic design, etc.) of the first season and pre-production (location scouting, makeup and wardrobe, etc.) for the second season.</p>
<p>If do not have the means to donate, you can also help us out by promoting our campaign to friends and family. We would greatly appreciate anything you can do for us.</p>

<p><strong>Would you like to help people get jobs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ann Thomas founded Transgender Talent</strong> two years ago with a goal to provide jobs for transgender and gender non-conforming people.   This community has an excessively high unemployment rate, on average twice that of the population as a whole, and 4 times that for transgender people of color.  However, this community has an amazing amount of talent that flourishes when we live our genuine lives, they  also have stories of strength and resilience to tell. Actors, comedians, artists, singers and more, the Transgender community is just as diverse as their cisgender counterparts, and it was time for them to be represented. Ann saw that they weren't and started working to change that.</p>
<p>Transgender Talent provides a central point for people in the entertainment industry to find transgender people for acting (both in TV/films and on stage), singing, and other roles as needed.  As we are reached out to by writers, producers, directors, casting directors and other Hollywood entities, we educate them not only on what they should be looking for in regards to hiring transgender people, but how to respect this community's true identities when going on the search for them.</p>
<p>Currently, Transgender talent is engaged in booking actors, models, stand-up comedians, crew, composers, musicians, and more.  We help network people together who can help with writing, consulting and support regarding film, television and theater production.  For some trans people, just the opportunity to audition at a major studio fulfills a lifelong dream.  For others, they are looking to make a career in Hollywood, and the representation and networking that Transgender Talent gives them is invaluable.</p>
<p>Despite being almost entirely volunteer, this is what Transgender Talent does for its clients every day:</p>
<p><strong>Actors:</strong></p>
<p>Transgender Talent is frequently approached by production companies, as well as getting requests from the major studios and networks, as well as theater groups, for transgender actors to cast.  At this time, we are submitting actors only when specifically asked for transgender people to fill roles.  There have been unfortunately few of these compared with how many actors there are looking for work.  However, there has been an increased number of requests for transgender people to fill roles that do not specify gender identity.</p>
<p>For smaller trans roles, we request the sides (small section of the script that covers the lines for the role being cast.)  For larger roles, we request the entire script.  Our volunteer staff reads the script to make sure trans people are being respected and that the character is not the typical cliché that has been in film and TV for half a century (ie. prostitute with no depth, mass murderer, dead body, etc.)  If the script looks good, which they do in most cases, we submit people that fit the breakdown.  If the script is bad, or the production in general appears suspicious, we do not submit anyone.  That has happened on occasion since we started, and Ann--as well as the rest of the staff--fiercely advocates for Transgender Talent's clients. Cisgender agents will not provide that level of protection for the transgender community.</p>
<p><strong>Comedians:</strong></p>
<p>We have begun doing comedy shows on an ongoing basis. These shows are made up almost entirely of transgender comedians, though we have featured a duo of a transgender woman and her wife as well.</p>
<p> -----------</p>
<p><strong>Here is what we could do with proper funding:</strong></p>
<p>Transgender Talent does what we can, but as of January 2017, it has been funded mostly out of our own meager personal day job earnings. The time spent submitting, reading, and advocating for our clients has been outside of and in addition to our full time day jobs.  With funding, we can hire the volunteer staff full-time.</p>
<p>The plans to get the company set up and running are not complicated, but costly. Transgender Talent is currently set up as a sole proprietorship LLC. In order to expand the company, Transgender Talent needs to be converted to a corporation sub S or sub Cinh, to either find investors or do an equity crowd funding campaign. In order to do this correctly, an attorney and/or accountant has to be retained, which incurs heavy fees. </p>
<p>The $30,000 we are looking to raise should cover three months of salaries for Ann and at least one assistant, plus cover legal, accounting, and government filing fees for the incorporation process(es).</p>
<p> These are our goals in the immediate future with proper funding:</p>
<p><strong>Staff: </strong></p>
<p>Ann Thomas, the current owner, cannot devote her full attention to this as she has to work another day job to pay the bills. With funding, she can give all of her attention to Transgender Talent, and do so full time.  She needs at least one assistant who can take some of the load off of her shoulders and help work on the day-to-day details of casting. One of her current volunteers, who has talent agency training and has one an internship in a major agency, would step into this role and be able to turn it into his full time job as well. </p>
<p><strong>Actors: </strong></p>
<p>Not only would we continue to submit transgender actors for trans roles, but with the funding, we would be able to begin submitting actors for non-transgender roles.  This requires getting a Breakdown Express subscription, which is costly(at least $268 per month, plus other fees). Breakdown Express is the platform most Hollywood casting agencies and talent agencies use to find and connect projects with actors.  Instead of having to wait to be contacted, Ann needs to be available to attend industry networking meetings and events, which occur daily throughout the city.  She and/or Transgender Talent as a company need to join various industry organizations as well, many of which require funds for membership.</p>
<p><strong>Web site updates: </strong></p>
<p>Our current web site is at <a href=""http://transgendertalent.agency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">transgendertalent.agency </a></p>
<p>With proper funding, we would be able to have the site professionally updated and maintained, giving us an online presence, and making it easy for both transgender/gender non-conforming people and for casting directors etc to find and contact us. <br/> </p>
<p> -----------</p>
<p><strong>Our goal:</strong></p>
<p>In all of this, Transgender Talent is working to promote a more informed view of the transgender community through entertainment, comedy, and personal appearances at schools.  With that groundswell of information to the mainstream population, we can finally live our lives in peace with the productivity and creativity we want to show the world.</p>

<h3>About Us and Our Goals</h3>
<p>     Hi, we are Everyone Smile Studio. We are a small art studio made up of five very talented artists, designers, and coders. We are starting our first big project ""Francis"" and need your help to make the first season. </p>
<p>     What we love about <i><strong>Francis</strong></i> is that it's everything that we would want in a show that's different from what's already out there. It's funny, edgy, and over-the-top. The show is built on a story that provides several different platforms in which our creative directions can run, so the adventures and character-building aspects are essentially endless. Our biggest hope for this show is that it will inspire others to pursue their creative side and talents. </p>
<p>     <strong>With you donations, </strong>we will be able to create the very many sets that are required for the show, the lighting and equipment needed to film, and to ensure that we can get the best quality of film for your enjoyment. Many different aspects go into a show such as this one, especially working with stop motion. There is a lot of storyboarding, voiceover work, set design, and time-consuming filming and editing. Your generous donations will go a long way in ensuring that things run smooth. Frequent updates on all the work and progress will be posted so you can be sure that your donations are being used wisely. </p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>     We have several perk options available as of right now. We have our <strong><i>Francis</i></strong> logo T-Shirt for a backing of $25. For a backing of $50 you will additionally receive a <strong><i>Francis </i></strong>poster and stickers along with the shirt. </p>
<h2>Note</h2>
</div><div>
<p>     If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still all go to the show, we will just be tighter on funding and it will take more time than we wish. </p>
<p>     Everyone Smile Studio would be greatly impacted and greatly appreciative of your donation because you are helping to ensure the success of the show, and build our reputation and audience so that we can continue projects like this, to entertain you and to do what we love. So thank you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>     With a show like this, there will obviously be some risks and challenges but we can assure that our team will be working day and night to overcome these challenges and provide the best product we can produce. Any challenges we come across will be included in our updates. We will let you know when we come across them and also when we solve them. We have the drive and the passion to do everything that we do so we are always up for a good challenge and we never shy away from obstacles; they will only sharpen our skills further</p>

<div><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Perhaps the most important documentary ever produced?</strong></i></p></div>
<p><i>Imagine</i>...you have just found a treasure unlike any ever found before.  </p>
<p>This treasure is not gold, rare jewels or incredible riches.  It is no more than an obscure book published in 1955.  But it is a book containing no less than...the very <i>meaning of life <i>and </i>the history of the cosmos</i>.  </p>
<p>Once you've read this amazing book, you find that it has answered every <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">question you can possibly imagine to ask about who and what you are, why you even exist, and if there really is life after death.  And so very much more!</span></p>
<p>For it also answers your questions about <i>angels </i>and <i>demons</i>, <i>aliens </i>and <i>other worlds</i>, and even of...<i>God</i>. And it delivers a history of the universe and of our own earth, that only now, some 60+ years later, is science finally able and beginning to prove true.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">The name of this amazing treasure is...the Urantia Book<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.</span></span> </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Could it possibly be true? We...intend to find out.  Do you?</span></p>

<h3><b>Why is this documentary so important to us all?</b></h3>
<p>From who and WHAT we are, to our planetary history, our purpose in this lifetime and so very much more, the Urantia Book explains it all.  And if the Urantia Book is true, then our documentary can well have a major impact by helping us all better understand it.</p>
<p>It's a bold claim that demands a clear and concise explanation and this is it: </p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><ul>
<li>If the Urantia Book is even half true, it could have a profoundly beneficial effect on the entire world.  </li>
<li>If it is mostly true, then our world and our viewers directly, will be the beneficiaries of the most important knowledge the world has ever seen.  </li>
<li>If it is all true, then the benefits of this knowledge begin as soon as you fully comprehend the information the book itself contains and our program aims to illuminate...for the entire world.  </li>
<li>And while pondering those points, be advised that our (still incomplete) investigation to date, indicates that the Urantia Book is not just partially true, but probably all true.</li>

Imagine...you have just found a treasure unlike any ever found before.  
This treasure is not gold, rare jewels or incredible riches.  It is no more than an obscure book published in 1955.  But it is a book containing no less than...the very meaning of life and the history of the cosmos.  
Once you've read this amazing book, you find that it has answered every question you can possibly imagine to ask about who and what you are, why you even exist, and if there really is life after death.  And so very much more!
For it also answers your questions about angels and demons, aliens and other worlds, and even of...God. And it delivers a history of the universe and of our own earth, that only now, some 60+ years later, is science finally able and beginning to prove true. 
The name of this amazing treasure is...the Urantia Book. 
Could it possibly be true? We...intend to find out.  Do you?

 
For the past five years, we've been investigating the amazing origin, assertions and historic claims made in the Urantia Book, in as an objective or fair a manner as possible. And we are now producing this documentary series to present our amazing findings to the world, free of charge.  And YOU can help! 
Why is this documentary so important to us all?
From who and WHAT we are, to our planetary history, our purpose in this lifetime and so very much more, the Urantia Book explains it all.  And if the Urantia Book is true, then our documentary can well have a major impact by helping us all better understand it.
It's a bold claim that demands a clear and concise explanation and this is it: 

If the Urantia Book is even half true, it could have a profoundly beneficial effect on the entire world.  
If it is mostly true, then our world and our viewers directly, will be the beneficiaries of the most important knowledge the world has ever seen.  
If it is all true, then the benefits of this knowledge begin as soon as you fully comprehend the information the book itself contains and our program aims to illuminate...for the entire world.  
And while pondering those points, be advised that our (still incomplete) investigation to date, indicates that the Urantia Book is not just partially true, but probably all true.
Nevertheless, to articulate just our findings to date on the information contained in the Urantia Book, will take many, many episodes.
To continue our investigations and articulate those findings will entail at least a few more years to produce, simply because the details to examine are so numerous. 
Indeed, that is likely the single biggest reason (after science needing to catch up) that no other documentary about the Urantia Book has even been attempted before.  
It is simply too vast and too detailed to be properly articulated with a small budget or in just a few short episodes. 
And in an age of desired return-on-investment that investors rightfully seek, producing a huge project like this—for FREE, makes no economic sense to traditional film and documentary investors.  And we understand that. 
Therefore, grants and crowd-funding are the only possible way a potentially vital program like this will ever get started, let alone produced and freely distributed worldwide. And if that occurs, its impact may well be world-changing.
And YOU...can help make that happen.


 
What We Hope to Achieve & What You Get 

To produce the first season of nine 1-hour episodes, we've assembled a great team of Stage32.com professionals spanning every continent and some 60-plus countries.  
From professional crews and actors, to animators and narrators, we have budgeted $375,000 CAD. 
The vast majority of the funded monies will be going into production and post-production, with limited marketing and distribution costs representing much smaller percentages of the budget.
All excess or remaining funding, as well as any potential future revenues, will be going straight back into the production of future seasons until it is finished and translations of the program into some 100+ major languages have been completed.  
And by setting up a trust account. we further intend to ensure that with whatever funds remain or in the future may be generated, our program will be forever available to watch on-line by anyone, for free.
However, to get started we need your help, so we've assembled some awesome perks for you.  
Indeed...as you can see, there's something kewl or wonderful for all funding levels!

 
Risks & Challenges
Are there risks? Yes. But not for you.  
The biggest risks are to some of our production people who will be attempting to film in areas that are currently in or on the edge of a war-zone.  These are all key Urantia Book related locations like the Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, and Libya. 
To minimize this risk, we intend to:

use stock video/film/image sources wherever possible. 
pay licencing fees for needed existing video/film or images
only use local cinematographers/actors that know the area well and can thereby eliminate the majority of the safety risks to themselves and others.

As for challenges, the main one is to reach our funding goal.  To eliminate the risk of loss to you, we have chosen the ""fixed funding"" method for this project. This means that if we don't raise all of the money we are aiming for, then your contribution is returned to you in full. We are also choosing this method to ensure that we have all of the funds necessary to do it right...the first time.  And to also ensure that it's made available to the entire world, free of any charge, whatsoever.  
What you may also not know is that our program is not meant to be a financial success, but an educational tool.  So its success ought not be measured by its return on investment, but its investment in our collective futures. 
Under our ""fixed funding"" campaign, your risk is eliminated if we don't succeed in reaching our funding goal.  If we do, then you can be assured of an awesome program that YOU will have helped co-produce.  And your support will also result in some great perks coming your way. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We're discovering that many of you wish to help ensure the production of this amazing new program any and every way you can.  That is wonderful—thank you so very much!  And the fact is that you can be of immense help by also:

However, we guarantee that you will get the reward as soon as possible without any avoidable delays.</p><p>I have chosen swag as my reward, how do you know my size?</p><p>Easy, we will ask! After the campaign closes, each tier will be contacted to gather all the information needed to deliver that particular reward; in the case of swag, we will get your size, color choice (where applicable) and delivery address.</p><p><strong>How do set visits work?</strong></p><p>So you have donated and want to know the logistics behind visiting the set.

When you get on set, you will be assigned a wrangler (or in fancier terms, concierge) who will guide you through the maze that is film sets; they will also give you a rundown of set etiquette and be there for anything you may want to see or do.</p></div>","PRESS

This means both leads and backgrounds, so unless you are part of the union, there isn’t much we can do due to union regulations.I Purchased a perk to be in the film but I'm not ACTRA!There is a lot of logistics involved in working with ACTRA, and we are able to offer this perk under special circumstances (which is also why it is limited in number). If you have purchased this perk, you will be required to attend a day of filming (which as yet to be determined) and sign applicable releases; but don't worry too much, we will walk you through everything.Why ACTRA?A lot of people have asked why we are going union, since it is generally more expensive. However, the cost difference is only a single factor.Generally speaking, the talent pool under the union is accomplished, marketable and professional. It is essential to not only have a talented and experienced crew to make your project look good, but also have skilled actors to ensure the story plays the way you intended as well.When will the project be done?We will finish filming by November and after a quick break for the holidays will go into editing. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should be done the final cut in March 2020.What happens after it's finished?We take the project to distribution companies that have already shown interest in the project. Our goal give an amazing Season 1 with the goal of being picked up and developed for more seasons to come!When will I receive my reward?Once our campaign closes and the final dollars have been accounted for we will be reaching out to the recipients of each tier to gather all the pertinent information.Some tiers will be easy to organize and deliver (ie: Swag) and some will take a bit of co-ordination (ie: set visits). However, we guarantee that you will get the reward as soon as possible without any avoidable delays.I have chosen swag as my reward, how do you know my size?Easy, we will ask! After the campaign closes, each tier will be contacted to gather all the information needed to deliver that particular reward; in the case of swag, we will get your size, color choice (where applicable) and delivery address.How do set visits work?So you have donated and want to know the logistics behind visiting the set. It’s not super complicated; once the final filming schedule has been locked, we will pick a couple of days that will be open for set visits (understandably there may be some hectic days which we won’t be able to accommodate).Once these days have been selected, you will be contacted to choose a time for your visit. When you get on set, you will be assigned a wrangler (or in fancier terms, concierge) who will guide you through the maze that is film sets; they will also give you a rundown of set etiquette and be there for anything you may want to see or do.",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Hello! Thanks for Visiting!</h3>
<p><i>Severance </i>stemmed from a fever dream about getting fired from my job. What resulted is (I hope) a fun and real look at being an artist in LA. Is it a brand new idea? You bet your ass it's not! But Anthony and I are very proud of it and hope you'll watch as we parse out our depression and anxieties on screen.</p>
<p>I won't spoil any season 1 stuff, but season 2 is going to focus much more heavily on the female lead, Nikki. I wrote season 1 for myself, but I think there've been enough dude storylines in <i>Severance</i> for the next century. We'd love it if you would help us tell Nikki's story next season.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we want from you?</h3>
<p>Anthony and I funded the first season of <i>Severance </i>out of pocket, and we were very happy and fortunate to be able to make that happen! BUT, unfortunately, we are not yet made of money. All told the project cost around $7500 to put together, and that is with asking for a ton of freebies. Please help us pay our freakin' excellent artists for the work you've enjoyed watching them do! Here's where your money is going...</p>
<h3>The Actors</h3>
<p>There's this old saying in Hollywood. Not ""there's no business like show business."" Not ""Lights! Camera! Action!"" The one I'm thinking of is, ""actors get paid last."" Okay maybe it's not an official saying, but it's the crappy and unfortunate truth at an indie level. We're not doing a second season if we can't pay our actors. Period. So if you want to see more of their excellent performances, give us a hand!</p>
<p>My goal is to be able to pay every actor the SAG New Media daily rate ($125 daily).</p>
<h3>Female Writers</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, season 2 will be focusing on Nikki. I wrote the first season alone, which was a great exercise for me, but I'm obviously writing from a male perspective. I'm hoping to hire two female writers so that you're not watching a woman written by a dude in season 2.</p>
<h3>Continued High Production Value</h3>
<p>One of the things that sets <i>Severance </i>apart in the web series space is that Anthony has an insane skill set that allows for an extremely high overall production value. But it comes at a high cost to us. A good chunk of this money will go towards continuing to pay our awesome DPs, sound engineers, camera ops, and post production team.</p>
<h3>Other Smaller but Necessary Stuff</h3>
<p>In addition to all of these things we've got to feed everybody, pay for locations, hopefully distribute it at some point. Every lil dollar helps! So if you've got a few to spare, please help us tell this story that we've been enjoying so far.</p>
<h3>If you can't give...</h3>
<p>Please share! Share this Indie Go Go campaign, share the web series, share it all! We mostly just want people to watch. Getting the money to make a second season is just icing on top.</p>

<h2><u><strong>What are we?</strong></u></h2>
<p>This is a labor of love. Love of country. Love of adventure. Love of people. Love of food, fashion, culture and history.  This is a love affair with Israel!<br/>I want to share this affair with everybody and anybody who has ever wondered what it would be like to visit or live in Israel. Or with somebody who has never given Israel a second thought. Or with people who have visited here or who live here and want to know more about this amazing country.<br/>Are you curious about this little strip of land in the Middle East? Then come join me on this adventure. See the country, feel the country, smell and taste it. Love it and live it with me. Come with me on my journey and let me share Israel with you through my eyes: her magnificence, her complexity, her stubbornness, her perfectness and imperfectness.</p>

<p><br/>I moved to Israel in 2008 with my two young children (10 and 13 at the time) and my former spouse.  I was born in Canada, raised on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts and lived most of my adult life, 25 years, in New York City.  I was born a Christian but converted to Judaism before my marriage in 1991 and lived a very happy life in New York City. We had a full Jewish life, my children attended an egalitarian Jewish Day School and we attended synagogue regularly.  But there came a point where I understood that I wanted to live in another place, outside of New York City. A place that was new, exciting, challenging and more meaningful. And a place that Jews could live freely, however they chose. So of course Israel was the perfect choice. But…there was one problem!<br/><br/>I had never been to Israel!  I was raised with no connection to Israel and even though I had grown to appreciate Israel from afar it was quite a leap to think about moving there!  I had never traveled to any parts of the the Middle East so I really had no idea what to expect. There were so many different stories about Israel. I heard that it was a dangerous place.  That it was an amazing place. That it was a scary place. That it was a technological marvel. It was unsophisticated and provincial. The food was bad. The food was incredible. That it was like heaven on earth.  But all of those perceptions were made from the shores of the USA, having never stepped a foot there and formed from what I read in the paper, saw in the news or heard second-hand.</p>
<p>But once I was in the country, I knew that so much of what I had heard, good and bad, was wrong. I realized that it was just not possible to understand just how amazing this country was without experiencing it.  And I also realized that people would never understand that it was not as bad as they were told it was, without experiencing it. So I created this website to share Israel through my eyes. I wanted to share the Israel I know.  The Israel I have fallen in love with, flaws and all. I hope you enjoy watching these videos and that they have helped to show you and the world that ThisisIsrael.Today! And with your help we can keep these amazing adventures going for another year and even bigger and better!!!   </p>

<h3>MALKY WANDEL</h3>
<p>​FILMMAKER &amp; DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL MEDIA</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543150702/pyaf2vnolnrajurcpiqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Malky Wandel, 28. Moved to Israel at age 12 from NY.</span><br/>I have been an independent filmmaker since 2005. Years before graduating with a degree in Film from Ma'aleh School of Television, Film &amp; the Arts, Jerusalem.<br/>Over the last 4 years of this project, I have been exposed to stories, food and places that in the 16 years living in Israel I never thought I would experience.<br/>I keep doing this project because I find it important to expose Israel to the world in ways that people don’t usually see or hear about.<br/>With all my years of filming and editing, I love having the oppertunity to show the real Israel through the most powerful thing, the camera!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><u>WHAT WE NEED</u></h2>
<p>Over the last three years I have spent approximately $70,000 from my own pocket to create this amazing content. We have made over 100 videos and that means hundreds of hours of filming, editing and lots of other production costs.  But now I have run out of money and have to ask the community for help. I would like to raise $20,000 to keep ThisisIsrael.Today going for as long as possible.  Additionally, 10% of any proceeds I raise will be donated to my sister project, Play Matkot in Schools and Camps, a great new initiative to bring physical fitness back into<strong> <a href=""http://www.thisisisrael.today/play-matkot-boston"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">schools</a></strong> and also <strong><a href=""http://www.thisisisrael.today/play-matkot-ny"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">camps</a>.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>NEW FUNDING</u></h2>
<p><b><u>TEAM</u></b><br/>Malky (the genius behind the camera, in the editing room and basically everywhere but in front of the camera! and other minor staff I have had ) have worked at very low wages. Far below what they are worth because they believe in the project.  I have worked hundreds of hours with no pay at all. I would like to pay the staff a decent, living wage. Living in Israel is expensive and it would be nice for the people who work on this project to be able to make a fair wage for creating this amazing content.  I would like to take a nominal salary so that I can give more focus to this project instead of trying earn money in other ways (as an interior designer, which is my actual profession!). I need to hire a part-time producer/social media manager and also translators in order to bring this project to the next level and get it the widest exposure as possible   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543150715/zhgjz54xyo7phlzo1bbr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><u>FILMING</u></strong><br/>We would  film approximately 6 days a month and therefore create at a minimum 6 new videos a month with a guarantee to film 9 months a year  thus creating a minimum of 54 videos for the year. It would most likely be more videos than that due to the way we film. Often we get 3-4 films from just one day of filming.  </p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543150749/zsacr37lamvsrj5vdov7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><strong><u>PRODUCTION</u></strong><br/>Travel expenses, daily productions costs, post-productions costs (editing, sound etc).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543152099/mx6ihfzfmnbwejhstyhl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><u>EQUIPMENT</u></strong><br/>We need some basic upgrades to our equipment inventory so that the quality of our videos can get just that much better...I would really like some more microphones for different conditions, we need some proper lighting and also some image stabilization equipment. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543150722/occ937gar5tsvzi3cbel.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><u>TRANSLATION</u></strong><br/>Continue to translate our current collection of over 100 videos into French, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, Chinese and begin our Arabic translations so that we can reach the largest audience possible.</p>
<p><strong><u>MARKETING</u></strong><br/>We would use some of the funds raised for marketing on social media and other ways in order to create exposure to the content and bring it to the as many people as possible.  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543149800/ps5koltyvybppcifqmbf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal we will just keep the project going on a minimal level until the money runs out and we will close up shop and walk away knowing we did a job well done!  <br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">BUT....I don’t think that will happen because being a great project for so many reasons and one well worth funding...the PERKS are great too!!

<h3>WHY ISRAEL?</h3>
<p>Israel is probably one of the most written about, fought over, discussed, loved, hated and misunderstood places in the world.  This video journeys allow people to experience Israel as never before.

</div></div>","What are we?
This is a labor of love. Love of country. Love of adventure. Love of people. Love of food, fashion, culture and history.  This is a love affair with Israel!I want to share this affair with everybody and anybody who has ever wondered what it would be like to visit or live in Israel. Or with somebody who has never given Israel a second thought. Or with people who have visited here or who live here and want to know more about this amazing country.Are you curious about this little strip of land in the Middle East? Then come join me on this adventure. See the country, feel the country, smell and taste it. Love it and live it with me. Come with me on my journey and let me share Israel with you through my eyes: her magnificence, her complexity, her stubbornness, her perfectness and imperfectness.

​

MEET US 
MONA HENOCH
DIRECTOR/CREATOR

I moved to Israel in 2008 with my two young children (10 and 13 at the time) and my former spouse.  I was born in Canada, raised on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts and lived most of my adult life, 25 years, in New York City.  I was born a Christian but converted to Judaism before my marriage in 1991 and lived a very happy life in New York City. We had a full Jewish life, my children attended an egalitarian Jewish Day School and we attended synagogue regularly.  But there came a point where I understood that I wanted to live in another place, outside of New York City. A place that was new, exciting, challenging and more meaningful. And a place that Jews could live freely, however they chose. So of course Israel was the perfect choice. But…there was one problem!I had never been to Israel!  I was raised with no connection to Israel and even though I had grown to appreciate Israel from afar it was quite a leap to think about moving there!  I had never traveled to any parts of the the Middle East so I really had no idea what to expect. There were so many different stories about Israel. I heard that it was a dangerous place.  That it was an amazing place. That it was a scary place. That it was a technological marvel. It was unsophisticated and provincial. The food was bad. The food was incredible. That it was like heaven on earth.  But all of those perceptions were made from the shores of the USA, having never stepped a foot there and formed from what I read in the paper, saw in the news or heard second-hand.
But once I was in the country, I knew that so much of what I had heard, good and bad, was wrong. I realized that it was just not possible to understand just how amazing this country was without experiencing it.  And I also realized that people would never understand that it was not as bad as they were told it was, without experiencing it. So I created this website to share Israel through my eyes. I wanted to share the Israel I know.  The Israel I have fallen in love with, flaws and all. I hope you enjoy watching these videos and that they have helped to show you and the world that ThisisIsrael.Today! And with your help we can keep these amazing adventures going for another year and even bigger and better!!!   
 
MALKY WANDEL
​FILMMAKER & DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL MEDIA

Malky Wandel, 28. Moved to Israel at age 12 from NY.I have been an independent filmmaker since 2005. Years before graduating with a degree in Film from Ma'aleh School of Television, Film & the Arts, Jerusalem.Over the last 4 years of this project, I have been exposed to stories, food and places that in the 16 years living in Israel I never thought I would experience.I keep doing this project because I find it important to expose Israel to the world in ways that people don’t usually see or hear about.With all my years of filming and editing, I love having the oppertunity to show the real Israel through the most powerful thing, the camera!

 
WHAT WE NEED
Over the last three years I have spent approximately $70,000 from my own pocket to create this amazing content. We have made over 100 videos and that means hundreds of hours of filming, editing and lots of other production costs.  But now I have run out of money and have to ask the community for help. I would like to raise $20,000 to keep ThisisIsrael.Today going for as long as possible.  Additionally, 10% of any proceeds I raise will be donated to my sister project, Play Matkot in Schools and Camps, a great new initiative to bring physical fitness back into schools and also camps.
 
NEW FUNDING
TEAMMalky (the genius behind the camera, in the editing room and basically everywhere but in front of the camera! and other minor staff I have had ) have worked at very low wages. Far below what they are worth because they believe in the project.  I have worked hundreds of hours with no pay at all. I would like to pay the staff a decent, living wage. Living in Israel is expensive and it would be nice for the people who work on this project to be able to make a fair wage for creating this amazing content.  I would like to take a nominal salary so that I can give more focus to this project instead of trying earn money in other ways (as an interior designer, which is my actual profession!). I need to hire a part-time producer/social media manager and also translators in order to bring this project to the next level and get it the widest exposure as possible   

FILMINGWe would  film approximately 6 days a month and therefore create at a minimum 6 new videos a month with a guarantee to film 9 months a year  thus creating a minimum of 54 videos for the year. It would most likely be more videos than that due to the way we film. Often we get 3-4 films from just one day of filming.  
 
PRODUCTIONTravel expenses, daily productions costs, post-productions costs (editing, sound etc).

EQUIPMENTWe need some basic upgrades to our equipment inventory so that the quality of our videos can get just that much better...I would really like some more microphones for different conditions, we need some proper lighting and also some image stabilization equipment. 

TRANSLATIONContinue to translate our current collection of over 100 videos into French, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, Chinese and begin our Arabic translations so that we can reach the largest audience possible.
MARKETINGWe would use some of the funds raised for marketing on social media and other ways in order to create exposure to the content and bring it to the as many people as possible.  
If we don’t reach our goal we will just keep the project going on a minimal level until the money runs out and we will close up shop and walk away knowing we did a job well done!  BUT....I don’t think that will happen because being a great project for so many reasons and one well worth funding...the PERKS are great too!! Check them out!!

 
WHY ISRAEL?
Israel is probably one of the most written about, fought over, discussed, loved, hated and misunderstood places in the world.  This video journeys allow people to experience Israel as never before. First hand. In English. From the point of view of the who has lived in and explored the country for the last 10 years.


 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
The  risk we face is not raising enough money to keep filming these fun, informative and we believe, important adventures for the next year,  but instead for only for 6 months or 3 months or 1 month. I will continue to take these trips and experience this amazing country, I just won’t film it and get it out the the world.  As I said above, I have self-funded this project for over 3 years and I just can't do it anymore.So we will take whatever money we raise here and keep this project going for was long as we can.  Then, if we haven’t gained more funding or more exposure (and I am ALWAYS actively seeking funding and trying to meet anyone I can to help get exposure) we will use whatever funding we have raised and do the best job we can do until the funding runs out.

<p>Hello, Humans is a TV show pilot that will give kids and their trusted adults practical tools and language they can use to introduce mindfulness and meditation into their everyday lives, in quiet moments or busy moments, in moments of anxiety, happiness, fear or excitement. We've received lots of early support suggesting a need for a show like this, and we're eager to get started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every episode will feature:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>An exploration of complex themes like anger, loss, bullying, fear and many more</li>
<li>Original music and live performances</li>
<li>Original stories</li>
<li>A dive into the magical Mindful Toolbox, where abstract tools take shape in claymation</li>
<li>Visits with real kids to talk about what matters to them</li>
<li>Short, easy-to-follow meditation practices</li>
<li>Visits with neighborhood friends to bridge the generational gap between being a kid, and becoming an adult</li>
<li>Time in nature, exploring and caring for our world</li>

<p> Mindfulness is a framework and a practice that can benefit everyone, in any setting. Studies show that mindfulness can:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Boost mood and self-esteem</li>
<li>Encourage positive behavior</li>
<li>Reduce anxiety and improves overall mental health</li>
<li>Encourage healthy conflict resolution</li>
<li>Improve attention and focus</li>
<li>Facilitate better cognitive development</li>
<li>Create changes in the brain that allow for better emotional regulation</li>
<li>Increase compassion for self and others</li>

<p>Our children are growing up in a highly digital age with endless opportunities to consume content. This overload of stimuli has been proven to affect everything from social and emotional health, to a child’s patterns of movement, nourishment and sleep.</p> <p>We’ve organized an impressive team of experts to produce a show for children that teaches practical ways of incorporating mindfulness and meditation into everything that they do, to demystify these practices and make them playful and engaging, to unlock their benefits to better position our children to thrive socially, emotionally, physically and academically.</p> <p>We're setting out to make content that is simpler and deeply intentional, rooted in relationships and built on practices of self-awareness, compassion and mindfulness to better serve our children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together we can actively create a kinder and more connected world for us all.</p>

<li>Paying a professional team of producers, writers, camera operators, set designers, musicians, gaffers, grips, audio technicians and guests to pull off an A+ pilot.</li>
<li>Consulting with experts in childhood development and mindfulness to create truly transformative, trauma informed content that speaks to children and their trusted adults, too.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here's a look at the core team behind the project:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mark Williams - Creator, Executive Producer</strong></p>
<p> A gifted teacher, storyteller and songwriter, Mark has spent the majority of his career striving to make more space at the table of education for each student to be seen and valued and to be given the tools that they each need to live into their fullest potential. From his own childhood experiences of wrestling with his multiracial identity, coping with his parents’ divorce, navigating school and life with the gifts and struggles of ADHD, and walking through bouts of depression, he discovered that music and mindfulness were instrumental in paving his pathway to healing and wholeness. </p> <p>These life experiences have shaped him as a teacher to understand that the skills of Social Emotional Learning are foundational for further academic, social and professional success in the stories of each of his students. His childlike joy and energy, and his almost instant rapport with children, have led him to invest his life’s work as a classroom teacher, mentor, and teacher trainer where he has committed to gently and mindfully working to tend seeds of kindness, compassion, curiosity, and resilience in the hearts of his students. </p> <p>His playful and accessible mindfulness practices appeal to children and adults alike. His stories and teachings integrate his passion for mindfulness with his commitment for social and environmental justice to help students access practices and paradigms that make space for the fullness of all that mindfulness truly is. He holds a Masters of Education in Mindfulness for Educators from Antioch University.

With three small boys of his own, and a deep love for children’s programming that speaks to the heart, soul and mind, Michael has made a niche for his work as an insightful, observant, human-centered storyteller. His newest film, We Wear the Mask can be found exclusively on Amazon Prime.</p> <p><strong>Anita Harnish - Producer</strong></p>
<p> For over 30 years Anita Harnish has worked as a <a href=""https://vimeo.com/anitaharnish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">producer/director</a> in video and film productions, serving advertising agencies, universities, hospitals, corporations and philanthropic organizations. Anita’s passion for production, organization and quality have taken her to Haiti, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Vietnam. Her work has contributed to national campaigns for GNC, FedEx, Highmark, PNC and many others. We are thrilled to have her on this project to create an efficient, well-connected production process.</p> <p><strong>Walter H. Smith, Jr., PhD - Childhood Trauma Expert</strong></p>
<p>A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Smith has a primary interest in applying Bowen theory to family violence, child abuse and organizational functioning. He is a licensed psychologist and a graduate of the Georgetown Family Center’s Post Graduate Program in Family Theory and Family Psychotherapy. Dr. Smith is a founder of <a href=""http://wpfc.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Western PA Family Center</a>. He maintains a small private practice. He is former executive director of Family Resources, a child abuse treatment and prevention organization in Pittsburgh, and is a frequent national and international lecturer.</p> <p><strong>Stephanie Romero - Childhood Mindfulness Expert</strong></p>
<p>As executive director of <a href=""https://awakenpittsburgh.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Awaken Pittsburgh</a>, Stephanie oversees the mission to promote personal and community well-being through mindfulness programs and compassionate actions. To this end: Awaken Pittsburgh offers mindfulness-based curricula to help youth develop social and emotional skills and increase attention. Awaken provides educators, guidance counselors, social workers, and other service providers with mindfulness-based courses to reduce stress, increase contentment and build resilience.</p> <p><strong>Michelle King - Learning Instigator, Love Activist, Beloved Community-Architect</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Michelle King is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG9AJTsxq4A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learning Instigator and Love Activist</a>. Her origin story is rooted in being an Army Brat, child of an Ethiopian immigrant, and teaching middle school for over 22 years in public schools in Southwestern PA. She learned and honed her craft in Mt. Lebanon for over 16 years plus five years at The Environmental Charter School. Her current interests are in game-based-learning, design, justice, equity, the environment and teacher empowerment. Currently through her varied partnerships, she is seeking to co-create dynamic learning experiences and opportunities that inspire wonder, discovery, contradictions, frustrations, and joy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Current Conundrums:  What do humans need to learn now? How might we create empathetic institutions that remind us of our humanity?  How might we re-design for equity and social justice in and out of school learning? How might we design learning institutions to build connections? How might we allow those connections to help us re-see the worlds we inhabit?  How might we embrace silence in our lives? How might we integrate our inner and outer environments as humans? How might we co-create the Beloved Community in this lifetime?</p>

Our children are growing up in a highly digital age with endless opportunities to consume content. This overload of stimuli has been proven to affect everything from social and emotional health, to a child’s patterns of movement, nourishment and sleep. We’ve organized an impressive team of experts to produce a show for children that teaches practical ways of incorporating mindfulness and meditation into everything that they do, to demystify these practices and make them playful and engaging, to unlock their benefits to better position our children to thrive socially, emotionally, physically and academically. We're setting out to make content that is simpler and deeply intentional, rooted in relationships and built on practices of self-awareness, compassion and mindfulness to better serve our children.
 
Together we can actively create a kinder and more connected world for us all.
 


Here's what we're doing with the funds we raise:

Paying a professional team of producers, writers, camera operators, set designers, musicians, gaffers, grips, audio technicians and guests to pull off an A+ pilot.
Consulting with experts in childhood development and mindfulness to create truly transformative, trauma informed content that speaks to children and their trusted adults, too.
If we don't raise our goal, our team is willing to complete the pilot on a tighter budget. But we're hopeful that we will be able to offer an equitable experience for everyone.


 

 
Here's a look at the core team behind the project:
 
Mark Williams - Creator, Executive Producer
 A gifted teacher, storyteller and songwriter, Mark has spent the majority of his career striving to make more space at the table of education for each student to be seen and valued and to be given the tools that they each need to live into their fullest potential. From his own childhood experiences of wrestling with his multiracial identity, coping with his parents’ divorce, navigating school and life with the gifts and struggles of ADHD, and walking through bouts of depression, he discovered that music and mindfulness were instrumental in paving his pathway to healing and wholeness.  These life experiences have shaped him as a teacher to understand that the skills of Social Emotional Learning are foundational for further academic, social and professional success in the stories of each of his students. His childlike joy and energy, and his almost instant rapport with children, have led him to invest his life’s work as a classroom teacher, mentor, and teacher trainer where he has committed to gently and mindfully working to tend seeds of kindness, compassion, curiosity, and resilience in the hearts of his students.  His playful and accessible mindfulness practices appeal to children and adults alike. His stories and teachings integrate his passion for mindfulness with his commitment for social and environmental justice to help students access practices and paradigms that make space for the fullness of all that mindfulness truly is. He holds a Masters of Education in Mindfulness for Educators from Antioch University. Find out more at Kinder Neighborhood. Michael Savisky - Showrunner, Executive Producer, Director
Michael has spent 18 years in the film industry. As founder of Make Roots, he has produced hundreds of projects ranging from indie features, to documentaries to commercials for some of the world’s largest brands. With three small boys of his own, and a deep love for children’s programming that speaks to the heart, soul and mind, Michael has made a niche for his work as an insightful, observant, human-centered storyteller. His newest film, We Wear the Mask can be found exclusively on Amazon Prime. Anita Harnish - Producer
 For over 30 years Anita Harnish has worked as a producer/director in video and film productions, serving advertising agencies, universities, hospitals, corporations and philanthropic organizations. Anita’s passion for production, organization and quality have taken her to Haiti, Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Vietnam. Her work has contributed to national campaigns for GNC, FedEx, Highmark, PNC and many others. We are thrilled to have her on this project to create an efficient, well-connected production process. Walter H. Smith, Jr., PhD - Childhood Trauma Expert
A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Smith has a primary interest in applying Bowen theory to family violence, child abuse and organizational functioning. He is a licensed psychologist and a graduate of the Georgetown Family Center’s Post Graduate Program in Family Theory and Family Psychotherapy. Dr. Smith is a founder of Western PA Family Center. He maintains a small private practice. He is former executive director of Family Resources, a child abuse treatment and prevention organization in Pittsburgh, and is a frequent national and international lecturer. Stephanie Romero - Childhood Mindfulness Expert
As executive director of Awaken Pittsburgh, Stephanie oversees the mission to promote personal and community well-being through mindfulness programs and compassionate actions. To this end: Awaken Pittsburgh offers mindfulness-based curricula to help youth develop social and emotional skills and increase attention. Awaken provides educators, guidance counselors, social workers, and other service providers with mindfulness-based courses to reduce stress, increase contentment and build resilience. Michelle King - Learning Instigator, Love Activist, Beloved Community-Architect
 
Michelle King is a Learning Instigator and Love Activist. Her origin story is rooted in being an Army Brat, child of an Ethiopian immigrant, and teaching middle school for over 22 years in public schools in Southwestern PA. She learned and honed her craft in Mt. Lebanon for over 16 years plus five years at The Environmental Charter School. Her current interests are in game-based-learning, design, justice, equity, the environment and teacher empowerment. Currently through her varied partnerships, she is seeking to co-create dynamic learning experiences and opportunities that inspire wonder, discovery, contradictions, frustrations, and joy.
 
Current Conundrums:  What do humans need to learn now? How might we create empathetic institutions that remind us of our humanity?  How might we re-design for equity and social justice in and out of school learning? How might we design learning institutions to build connections? How might we allow those connections to help us re-see the worlds we inhabit?  How might we embrace silence in our lives? How might we integrate our inner and outer environments as humans? How might we co-create the Beloved Community in this lifetime?

<p>Sky is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) player that dreams about being the best of the best, competing on the biggest stages and winning The World Championship in a big e-sport game. Her reality on the other hand is far from that. She lives in a shitty apartment, with an empty fridge and almost no income. Godlike Gaming is the name of her team and they can be annoying, frustrating and not focused enough on practice, but hey. It still beats solo que am I right?</p>
<p>The team are living their normal lives when they suddenly get into a local tournament, Battle of Legends. This would have been amazing if it wasn’t for the fact that one of their members dropped out. Not only will they have to find a new member, they also need to come together as a team and work with each other like never before if they are going to have a chance in their biggest shot of fame so far.</p>

<p>Sky is the main character of the show and is going to be played by Nicole Murray. The most important thing to Sky is the game and she is really good at it, but even though she is good her attitude is holding her back. Her sleeping schedule is not existing and she takes losses too hard. She also forgets to take the rest of the team into consideration and sometimes forgets that she needs to be a friend as well, not just a teammate. </p>
<p>Sky wants to be able to influence everyone in the team since she has a hard time trusting them to make the right decisions and want to be able to do all the work if necessary. She’s also the one dreaming about the spotlight. These real life traits come out in the game in her role as the teams mid laner.</p>

<p>Will Maizel is playing Fruit Cake, the best friend of Sky. They have been friends since childhood. Sky can be a real mess and sometimes even unthoughtful, but Fruit Cake is always there for her. The team is her dream and Fruit Cake will be on her side doing what he can to support her. He is also the brother of the team's damage carrier, Pinkybr3ak, who can often get on everyone's nerves, especially Bash’s. Fruit Cake is doing what he can to try to keep them calm.</p>
<p>The best way to describe Fruit Cake is probably by his role in the team. He plays the support. He wants everyone to be seen and heard, don’t mind taking a step back to leave room for others, but will always step up to protect and support his friends.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Pinkbr3ak</h3>

<p>The little brother of Fruit Cake will be brought to life by Omari Williams. The whole team might be nerds, but Pinkybr3ak is on another level.

You have to agree with him on things like who’s the best actor to play Batman or you are wrong and he will let you know how wrong you are.</p>

<p>Bash, played by Jamie Bautch, is the Tyler1 of the team. He is loud, cocky and gets easily angry. Because of his short temper Bash is constantly clashing with the “know it all” in the team, Pinkybr3ak. Bash’s heart is on the right side, but his competitive side hides it most of the time.</p>
<p>Bash is the top laner of the team. His attitude is “win lane, win game”. Simple as that. Don’t play around anyone else and trust no one.

<p>Last up we have Maddy Murphy as Boxxxy. Boxxxy is the new teammate of Godlike Gaming. She is very outgoing, sees the best in people and is usually very happy. Unfortunately what she has in empathy she lacks in brainpower. She speaks before she thinks and is always two steps behind everyone else in what is happening. To put it simple, she is rather stupid, but with a big heart.</p>

<p>Robin Landal here! I'm a musician, filmmaker, propmaker, larper, but not least- a gamer from Sweden! I've been working with Eli on their last films, mainly as sound designer and composer, but also as director of photography. When Eli told me about Godlike Gaming we were still shooting our first movie together, so now when the time has come to realize it I couldn't be more excited to join the production as the main composer!</p>
<p>I'm a child of the gaming era, just as so many others, and I know there are stories out there that has to be told. Just like sports, music, dancing, art or reading books, gaming can be both social and a way to find and get to know yourself. This is true for me, and I am still, at age 31, spending at average 2-3 hours a day gaming with my best friends as a way to relax and socialize.</p>

<p>Making a series is not cheap. Everything from location, crew, cast to permits, insurance and marketing cost money. Fortunately the first episode will be made as a thesis project and therefore comes with a lot of student discounts and already paid for equipment. Also a lot of free crew. That’s why making the first episode will be a lot cheaper than the rest. </p>
<p>We ask for $6,000 for the first episode and for every $10,000 after that we will make one more episode. The hope is to make a six episode season (10-15 minutes per episode) to start with.</p>
<p>Eli has had big ambitions with previous projects, but low-budget and have therefore had to learn how to make professional movies with a minimal budget. With that said, a bigger budget can make the team go bigger with the show.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective: the first season of VGHS cost over $600,000 and Scott Pilgrim vs the World cost $60,000,000.</p>

</div></div>","Godlike Gaming is a comedy webseries about gaming, friendship and dreams. The show centers around a competitive 5 vs 5 game that requires tactics, teamwork and high mechanical skills. It is inspired by shows like Video Game High School, The Guild and Spaced as well as Edgar Wright’s other projects.
Sky is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) player that dreams about being the best of the best, competing on the biggest stages and winning The World Championship in a big e-sport game. Her reality on the other hand is far from that. She lives in a shitty apartment, with an empty fridge and almost no income. Godlike Gaming is the name of her team and they can be annoying, frustrating and not focused enough on practice, but hey. It still beats solo que am I right?
The team are living their normal lives when they suddenly get into a local tournament, Battle of Legends. This would have been amazing if it wasn’t for the fact that one of their members dropped out. Not only will they have to find a new member, they also need to come together as a team and work with each other like never before if they are going to have a chance in their biggest shot of fame so far.


Sky

Sky is the main character of the show and is going to be played by Nicole Murray. The most important thing to Sky is the game and she is really good at it, but even though she is good her attitude is holding her back. Her sleeping schedule is not existing and she takes losses too hard. She also forgets to take the rest of the team into consideration and sometimes forgets that she needs to be a friend as well, not just a teammate. 
Sky wants to be able to influence everyone in the team since she has a hard time trusting them to make the right decisions and want to be able to do all the work if necessary. She’s also the one dreaming about the spotlight. These real life traits come out in the game in her role as the teams mid laner.
Fruit Cake

Will Maizel is playing Fruit Cake, the best friend of Sky. They have been friends since childhood. Sky can be a real mess and sometimes even unthoughtful, but Fruit Cake is always there for her. The team is her dream and Fruit Cake will be on her side doing what he can to support her. He is also the brother of the team's damage carrier, Pinkybr3ak, who can often get on everyone's nerves, especially Bash’s. Fruit Cake is doing what he can to try to keep them calm.
The best way to describe Fruit Cake is probably by his role in the team. He plays the support. He wants everyone to be seen and heard, don’t mind taking a step back to leave room for others, but will always step up to protect and support his friends.
Pinkbr3ak

The little brother of Fruit Cake will be brought to life by Omari Williams. The whole team might be nerds, but Pinkybr3ak is on another level. He reads every comic book, plays every game and knows all of the Star Wars lore. Pinkybreak easily clashes with people because he refuses to admit that he is wrong. You have to agree with him on things like who’s the best actor to play Batman or you are wrong and he will let you know how wrong you are.
Pinkybr3ak is the damage carrier of the team and he lives up to the stereotype. He thinks that everything revolves around him and if something goes wrong it’s never his fault.
Bash

Bash, played by Jamie Bautch, is the Tyler1 of the team. He is loud, cocky and gets easily angry. Because of his short temper Bash is constantly clashing with the “know it all” in the team, Pinkybr3ak. Bash’s heart is on the right side, but his competitive side hides it most of the time.
Bash is the top laner of the team. His attitude is “win lane, win game”. Simple as that. Don’t play around anyone else and trust no one. Bash is a very good mechanical player and he knows it, but he is a terrible team player. He doesn’t take orders well and thinks he can outplay more or less any one. 
Boxxxy

Last up we have Maddy Murphy as Boxxxy. Boxxxy is the new teammate of Godlike Gaming. She is very outgoing, sees the best in people and is usually very happy. Unfortunately what she has in empathy she lacks in brainpower. She speaks before she thinks and is always two steps behind everyone else in what is happening. To put it simple, she is rather stupid, but with a big heart.
Just like how Boxxxy wants to be there for everyone, but is stuck in her own world in real life, she also has the same role in the team as their jungler. 

Godlike Gaming is created by Eli Sundler. After rewatching VGHS and The Guild Eli wanted more scripted gaming series or movies, especially about e-sports, but couldn’t find anything.

<p><strong>Logline: </strong>Carlo &amp; Tia explore independent restaurants in a city showcasing the connection between the food, the culture, and the community. Each ten-minute episode will focus on an individual restaurant and neighborhood, and each season will take place in a specific city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Eats is food docu-web series that combines the fast-paced elements of a short form YouTube food vlog and the quality of a long form traditional food television show. The series follows two Chicago-based foodies Carlo and Tia. Carlo is personal trainer and Yelp Elite food reviewer. Tia is social media and branding specialist. Oh, and they are one of the cutest couples you’ll ever see!</p>
<p>In each season of The Eats Carlo and Tia will explore different restaurants in and around a particular city—with the first two seasons starting off in Chicago. They will not only highlight the food, but the restaurant and the community. The Eats focuses on the stories of the restaurants and how those stories impact the menu and the community.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong>Aaron Potts first came up with the idea for The Eats in the summer of 2018. Aaron was working in a restaurant in Chicago as food runner and became intrigued by the detail and care the restaurant’s leadership paid to the menu and how the connection the local community had to the restaurant. He realized the community felt connected to the restaurant not only because of the quality of the food, but because of the restaurant’s story and its relationship with the neighborhood; he discovered that the ethos of the restaurant and the quality of the food were inextricably connected.</p>
<p><strong>Social Impact:</strong> The Eats works to raise the awareness and prestige of local restaurants and business, and to draw attention to the communities they serve. The hope is that through highlighting these local businesses that individuals and organizations will be encouraged to invest more in these neighborhoods.</p>

He realized the community felt connected to the restaurant not only because of the quality of the food, but because of the restaurant’s story and its relationship with the neighborhood; he discovered that the ethos of the restaurant and the quality of the food were inextricably connected.
Social Impact: The Eats works to raise the awareness and prestige of local restaurants and business, and to draw attention to the communities they serve. The hope is that through highlighting these local businesses that individuals and organizations will be encouraged to invest more in these neighborhoods.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Homegrown teaches self love through mindful movement and play.      Our creative team has 30 years collective experience as professional arts educators, producers, and performing artists.
After providing 250 live, virtual, dance a long adventures over zoom this past year, Homegrown was able to connect kids across the United States and Canada. Our goal is to to give our friends around the world a space to move, play, and create while developing self love and self trust. 
Your contribution will not only fund the production of Homegrown Season One; bringing mindful movement, imagination, and play into homes around the world, your contribution will also propel the message of healthy mind+body connection for our future leaders.

 
""Where is the money going?""
We need $20,000 to produce our pilot season, and that's being extremely frugal and resourceful. Fortunately, we have an amazing team who understands that limitation is an opportunity for innovation. 
Here's the breakdown of our budget and how we plan to use your contribution:

""Let's talk PERKS!""
Even though we're making a kids show, the PERKS are for everyone!      We are a group of amazing arts educators and entertainers, and our perks showcase our collective expertise.
Discounted virtual vocal lessons to unleash your inner Karaoke Queen, 30 day Sweat Challenge to amp up your fitness goals, even a bonified STONKEY DONKEY shout out to your favorite friend, there are PERKS for everyone who would love to support.
Keeping with our mission of mindful movement and play, our group PERKS are a great way to connect to yourself, and others. Homegrown Virtual Birthday Adventure, Moms Night In (BYO) Dance Party, or a Homegrown for Grown Ups master class are all lead by Rebekah, and are all amazing options.
 

Homegrown; Stories that MOVE you.
“I love myself. I trust myself. I love being me!”
We begin and end every Homegrown mindful movement class with these simple, but profound, words. Forward thinking parents around the globe now understand the power of play as an indisputable tool for their child's growth. 
Art is no longer an extracurricular, but an integral part of childhood development. 
Homegrown encourages a healthy friendship between the mind and the body through dynamic movement training, imaginative play and captivating storytelling. Our virtual adventures include Ballet, Musical Theatre, Comedy Improv, Capoeira, and Yoga techniques. 
Join the MOVEMENT! 
Homegrown isn’t about learning and repeating dance steps, it’s about discovering what moves us in the first place. We create a safe space to embody your childs inner Hero, Warrior, Clown, or Rain Cloud. We celebrate all expressions of self, because the human experience is vast.
Our live, virtual classes will continue Fall 2021.
Homegrown Reach! 
In only 7 months, Homegrown reached young learners across VA, WV, PA, NY, GA, TX, CO, CA, Alaska, and Canada. Homegrown has a 98% retention rate; almost 100% of friends who try a Homegrown class, continue to learn with us. It's that effective! It's that fun!

<p>Tangible Hope Project is an award-winning 10-part documentary web series that travels across the country to cast a spotlight on people who are making our nation a better place, community by community. The series explores organizations and individuals that are affecting positive, tangible change in both small towns and big cities through teamwork, ingenuity, and a passion for bringing people together.</p>

<p>Do you ever scroll through your Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook feed, or turn on the news, hoping to read something uplifting?</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Jonathan was living in Washington D.C. where the national news was also the local news. Conflict, crisis, and criticism filled the daily headlines. It got us thinking that there had to be other stories — untold stories that weren't making the headlines — of people coming together to help one another, and make their neighborhoods better places to live.</p>
<p><strong>There had to be hope in our country. We decided to go look for it.</strong></p>
<p>We mapped out a 5,000-mile route across 11 states from Washington, D.C., to California, and hopped in the car. From flea markets to gas stations to government buildings, in towns as big as 1,000,000 and as small as 1,000, we interviewed dozens of people. What we found were ordinary people doing extraordinary things to build up and bring together their communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school students building homes in New Orleans</li>
<li>A chef in Santa Fe reintroducing indigenous foods to the community</li>
<li>An LGBTQ support group providing a safe space for youth in a small North Carolina town</li>
<li>Nature preservationists in Alabama partnering with a big gas company to keep their river clean </li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the inspiring stories from our journey,<strong> and there are many more to tell.</strong></p>
</div><div>

<p>To date, we have released 5 of our 10 episodes, and we are extremely grateful for everyone who has followed us and supported us this far!</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to complete our series, and you can make that possible. </strong>From Austin to Santa Fe to Denver and beyond, there are more stories of heroes helping to shape their neighborhoods for the better — and we need your help to share this POSITIVE news with the world. <strong><u>Your contribution will help us fund the post-production and release of the next 5 episodes</u></strong>.

We did it! Thanks to your support we will be able to finish our first season of Tangible Hope Project and start planning for Season 2!
If you missed out on being part of our People Powered Campaign here on Indiegogo you can become a supporter of Tangible Hope Project by making a tax-deductible donation through our website: www.tangiblehopeproject.org.  
Please *subscribe* to our YouTube channel to see all the latest episodes and follow along as Hope continues to spread across America.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
 

Because of the AMAZING support of our community, in just 10 days, we were able to reach our initial goal of $10,000 to finish Season 1! NOW we are s t r e t c h i n g the goal of our Indiegogo campaign to $15,000 ... all additional funds raised will go to pre-production costs  for SEASON 2!!  
 

Tangible Hope Project is an award-winning 10-part documentary web series that travels across the country to cast a spotlight on people who are making our nation a better place, community by community. The series explores organizations and individuals that are affecting positive, tangible change in both small towns and big cities through teamwork, ingenuity, and a passion for bringing people together.


Do you ever scroll through your Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook feed, or turn on the news, hoping to read something uplifting?
A couple of years ago, Jonathan was living in Washington D.C. where the national news was also the local news. Conflict, crisis, and criticism filled the daily headlines. It got us thinking that there had to be other stories — untold stories that weren't making the headlines — of people coming together to help one another, and make their neighborhoods better places to live.
There had to be hope in our country. We decided to go look for it.
We mapped out a 5,000-mile route across 11 states from Washington, D.C., to California, and hopped in the car. From flea markets to gas stations to government buildings, in towns as big as 1,000,000 and as small as 1,000, we interviewed dozens of people. What we found were ordinary people doing extraordinary things to build up and bring together their communities:

High school students building homes in New Orleans
A chef in Santa Fe reintroducing indigenous foods to the community
An LGBTQ support group providing a safe space for youth in a small North Carolina town
Nature preservationists in Alabama partnering with a big gas company to keep their river clean 

These are just a few of the inspiring stories from our journey, and there are many more to tell.


To date, we have released 5 of our 10 episodes, and we are extremely grateful for everyone who has followed us and supported us this far!
Our goal is to complete our series, and you can make that possible. From Austin to Santa Fe to Denver and beyond, there are more stories of heroes helping to shape their neighborhoods for the better — and we need your help to share this POSITIVE news with the world. Your contribution will help us fund the post-production and release of the next 5 episodes. Our starting goal will cover our basic fees to finish these episodes (all the sexy stuff like editing, color correction, sound mixing, and licensing fees!).
Any stretch goals will help us start pre-production for Season 2, so we can continue to showcase more great people and organizations in more cities across the country. 

Money is great, but it's not the only way you can help.
Please share this campaign with your friends and family who may be interested in supporting our series.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are four female filmmakers who, while isolating in Brooklyn during COVID, came together over Zoom to create a comedy in the midst of our collective depression. ""Ghost Town"" is a comedy about dead people pursuing their dreams.  </p>
<p>“Ghost Town” follows small-town dead girl Jane Clay whose death hasn’t derailed her ambitions of Broadway stardom. When Trump declares New York City a ""ghost town,"" Jane takes her death into her own hands and heads to the city where she meets a rag-tag group of ghosts who, in return for helping them with their “unfinished business” agree to act in her ghostly production of “Our Town.”</p>
<p>“Ghost Town” reminds us that even in our isolation, we are never truly alone.</p>
<p>We have seven HILARIOUS episodes, seven INCREDIBLY talented actors, and four gals who are DYING to make you laugh. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’re shooting the first three episodes in September, and your contribution will make this initial shoot possible and pave the way for subsequent shoots:</p>
<p>Equipment rental (it’s gonna look good!)</p>
<p>Audio recording and mixing (it’s gonna sound good!)</p>
<p>Locations, food, wardrobe and props (it ain’t cheap!)</p>
<p>Our creative team has cooked up some super spooky prizes for everyone who helps fund our campaign. We thank you from the bottoms of our dead little hearts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are four women in a field dominated by men. Our project is proof that by supporting each other we can make a positive impact on the industry and create a strong artistic community. ""Ghost Town"" is a celebration of New York City and after a particularly devastating year, we want to remind the world that NYC is still a cultural epicenter and inspiration to artists. Even in the most difficult circumstances, it's never too late to band together and create something beautiful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is expensive, but we're resourceful producers.  We are lucky to be part of a vibrant artistic community who are passionate about ""Ghost Town"" and dedicated to making it happen.  We're calling in ALL the favors for this one. </p>
<p>After writing a first season of an entirely new web series over Zoom, the shoot should be the easy part!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Send this to your friends! Your moms! Your freaky second-cousins!The patrons of the arts! Get Jeff Bezos on the line!</p>
<p>We are so grateful for the help we've already received. For this project to succeed we're relying on a team of graphic designers, writers, actors, and filmmakers.

<h3>Why I'm creating ""The HOU Life"" </h3>
<p>Houston, we DON'T have a problem. </p>
<p>What we have is an ultra diverse, prosperous, and yet eccentric city and it is now time to showcase H-town's richness to the world!</p>
<p>We all love Houston and know it has a ton to offer, yet we often get overlooked in the national discussion about America's greatest cities. For starters, there is no media source, prominent vlog, or TV show to see the stories and the people who make Houston the 'city with no limits.'</p>
<p>I want to change that starting this summer.</p>
<p>I need your help in breathing life into this project.  Let me tell you a bit about myself and why you should contribute.</p>
<p><strong>A little bit about Adeel </strong></p>
<p>I am a native New Yorker who moved to Houston in 2007 with no real plan on staying here long term.  I didn't know much about life in Texas and my friends and family up north thought I was crazy for moving to the area.</p>
<p>Well, I settled in with my wife, and soon we built our first home in the suburbs.  We started to meet some very friendly and helpful people and soon enough, we started to take in all the great culture that is uniquely Houston.</p>
<p>3 years later, we had our first child, who is a proud native Texan (and my part-time cameraman).  3 years after that our second was born here as well.  Needless to say, the Houston area is HOME and my pride for it shines through to all who know me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A Quick Summary of My Professional Qualifications </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional background is 20 years in sales, PR, and marketing.  I've worked for small and large corporations and owned my own business.  I achieved national sales awards 3 times and had a great run.  But my dream is to build this brand and this show as my full-time gig. </li>
<li>I am a board member of the Fort Bend County Citizens Engagement Group.  </li>
<li>Member of Greater Houston Partnership</li>
<li>Well connected with area leaders, business groups (TRA, Houston Lawyers Groups, Social and Activist groups).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why am I raising funds?</strong></p>
<p>To get the first season (10 episodes) off the ground, I need your help!  I have already put over $6000 of my own funds into the project; however, to produce a professional series, I need a small army of friends and well-wishers to back this project!</p>
<p>By contributing, you become a founding supporter and/or member of ""The Hou Life.""  Together we can help build up Houston and promote what is important to us all.  </p>
<p>To raise the remaining $10,000, I decided to turn to my community as a way for like-minded individuals to become a part of this initiative.  Your contribution - whether $3 or $500 - will help make this dream a reality.  Simply put... I can't do this without you!</p>
<p>With ""The HOU Life,"" we will have a show and series that is absolutely our own.  We can highlight Houston's best businesses, sights and sounds, cultural diversity, and much more with the exposure.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong><u>Funding Breakdown</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The funding ask is $10,000.  (Roughly $7800 after perks and platform fees).</li>
<li>Breakdown of how the $7,800 will be invested:<ul>
<li>$ 3,500 in labor costs ($350 per episode).  This is primarily to bring on a professional videographer and editor.</li>
<li>$2,400 in promotions ($240 in digital ad spend per episode to promote it on YouTube and Facebook).</li>
<li>$1,900 in equipment costs (Additional lighting, 1 additional camera plus lens, higher-end audio).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Perks For You</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All $50 or more contributions will get an official ""Hou Life Supporter"" T-Shirt plus a charging station with our logo!</li>
<li>Contributions over $100 will be part of the direction of the show and will be part of a closed Facebook group.</li>
<li>Contributions over $250 will be part of the Director's Circle and will have input into the direction of the series!</li>

<p><strong>So What Exactly will ""The Hou Life"" Look Like as a Show?</strong></p>
<p><strong>""The Hou Life</strong>"" will be a web series with primary broadcasts on a dedicated YouTube Channel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrS7cbcf6txr_b6cyqPAidg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrS7cbcf6txr_b...</a>) as well as a Facebook Page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheHouLifewithAdeelAkhtar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/TheHouLifewithAdeelAkhtar</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Each episode will be 15 to 22 minutes (ideal length in today's world of shorter attention spans).</li>
<li>Each episode will focus on either<ul>
<li>1 - An interesting or prominent person with a unique story worth telling. </li>
<li>2 - A unique culture or Houston subculture. </li>
<li>3 - A unique business / food / restaurant.</li>
<li>4 - The story of something unique to Houston (The 'Be Someone' bridge, The Astrodome, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge to this project is competing in a space where there is already a lot of noise (Youtube / social media shows).  As barriers to entry become lower, a show like ""The  HOU Life"" will find itself in the middle of a endless array of choices people have to spend watching.</p>
<p>So what is my plan to overcome this potential hurdle?</p>
<ul>
<li>Each person, business, or sight will be covered in person and on location.  People are tired of the ""talking heads"" split screens that have become the norm during quarantine.</li>
<li>The primary focus of the show is to elicit emotion.  I can get amazing stories told by the people who have lived them.  My strength is that I can direct the show in a way to make the audience laugh and possibly cry all within 20 minutes.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Marching Order is a Montana-based web series produced and filmed by Montanans and featuring Montana gamers. We have a six-episode first season planned with each episode to run approximately 2 hours.</p>

While spending a career in public history with the National Park Service, US Forest Service, and Montana State Parks, he's also been a freelance roleplaying game writer, a co-owner of a small RPG publishing company, and an extra in a handful of small films.</li>
<li>This campaign will help us cover any final costs encountered as we film the episodes, the first two of which film on August 9, 2021. We have had a lot of in-kind donations for gaming products and other items to be used during the filming but could use an increased cash flow.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are fundraising for $2500.00. This  helps us cover filming costs ranging from locations, craft services, travel, props, costuming, and other general expenses.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges in a project like this. Cast/crew illnesses, travel difficulties, equipment failure, and much more can always happen. This is Montana, and trying to travel in the fall can sometimes be just as hazardous as traveling in the depths of winter.</p>

Our goal is to have our documentary streamed on Amazon Originals or Tubi TV. As well, we want to provide DVD copies to libraries and schools in the Chicago and surrounding cities. The pride of Chicago is what's missing with the youths/teens. If you don't know your history you are lost. The young people need positive role models and education on how to succeed in life. Although many of our guests, artist come from the ghetto, urban communities of Chicago, they succeeded and want to share their stories.
Not Chiraq but Chitown!! From the Chicago Blues to Soul, Chicago has brought forth many artists that have traveled the world, sharing our culture, food and entertainment with the world. Putting smiles on faces all while we faced oppressive challenges. The opportunities, the challenges, the pitfalls all must be shared with our viewers so they may know from where they come, the strength needed to succeed and the greatness that lies within them. We would like to be able to provide the educational, and entertainment vehicle to other urban communities outside of Chicago in our cities.

<i>Demi &amp; Ace</i> - aromantic comedy</h2><p>Demi &amp; Ace is an upcoming webseries that focuses on two friends going through the mishaps of the rom-coms you know and love, with one twist: they are both on the asexual spectrum. The show breaks stereotypes assigned to asexuality and offers much needed representation of the asexual-aromantic spectrum.</p><p>The rare cases of asexual representation in entertainment often portray it as a whimsical character quirk or even as a trait signaling coldness and emotional unavailability. As a response to these harmful misrepresentations, our team is creating a show in which its main characters are on the asexuality spectrum AND are fully characterised, realistic people outside of their sexual identities.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623050407/zqonmucw299qq38lddsi.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>The vision</h3><p>Did you grow up loving shows like <i>H2O: Just Add Water</i> or <i>W.i.t.c.h.</i>? Are you a fan of the colourful and stylised heightened reality of many Korean dramas?</p><p>If so, you will most surely enjoy the captivating and immersive world of <i>Demi &amp; Ace</i>. Our show will stylistically and aesthetically emulate your nostalgic favourites, while updating the content and message to be more inclusive and diverse.</p><p><i>Demi &amp; Ace</i> will make you giggle regardless of your identity, but also aims to empower our target audience, the community of wonderful people on the ace-spectrum. Through the show, we want to create a platform for horizontal communication to truly connect with our viewers. In doing so, we wish to enable all the ace and aro people to find a safe space and open community within the Demi &amp; Ace social platforms.</p><h3>About the production</h3><p>The series is an original idea by our brilliant screenwriter and showrunner Laura Eklund Nhaga, who has previously written and starred in the literature inspired web-series Project Green Gables.</p><p>The show will be produced and filmed in Finland, primarily in Helsinki, during Autumn 2021, covid-19 restrictions considered, and the post-production and editing will continue until the release in February 2022. While the production team and parts of the cast are Finnish, the show itself will be entirely in English. We will also provide subtitles in at least 3 languages (Finnish, English and Swedish) to make the show as accessible as possible.</p><h3>Why we need your help</h3><p>Our full aim is to make Demi &amp; Ace a valuable addition in representation of asexual identities, as well as a fun, enjoyable show. In order to fully realise our vision, we are crowdfunding to cater the minimum budget we need to make the series into reality.

As a team, we firmly believe in transparency and accountability, and thus will announce the results of the grant application when we have them.</p><p>If we are unable to meet our goal within the established time frame, all your donations will be refunded by Indiegogo within 5-7 business days. We started the campaign because we wanted to have a realistic and achievable goal in order to be able to pay our cast and crew at least a little for their valuable time. However, both of our avenues in funding are targeted at the lower end for media productions. Our highest priority is to make the series happen.</p><p>With our prior experience with web-series, we will in all likelihood be able to complete this project regardless of extensive funding.

The purpose of a presentation reel (or sizzle reel) is to show potential producers, production companies, sales agents, distributors and streaming services what your series is about and its marketable potential.

Producers and Executive Producers will have access to ALL of the sizzle reel scenes that we film, sent as a private link.
Original Promo Art by David Fergusson To help us really sell the series and the story, we'd like to include a scene including one of our creatures from Scottish mythology - the Bean-Nighe aka The Scottish Banshee. Gibbet FX, an Edinburgh-based special effects company, can create this creature for us, with Scare Scotland providing us with one of their performers to embody the role. Gibbet FX have offered us this creature for £1500. We are offering 10 places on our SPONSOR A MONSTER perk, at £150 each, you will be an official sponsor of our Bean-Nighe, with the chance to come to location (when it is safe to do so) as we film the scene in which our creature will appear. You can watch filming take place and get your photo with the monster! Strike Fight Company have also offered to be involved in our production; providing us with rehearsals and their skills to create TWO fights in our presentation reel. These will be a mixture of hand-to-hand combat and a sword fight. You can visit their website to get a feel of the level of work they can offer our presentation reel. The cost to bring the Strike Fight Company on board is £1000.Strike Fight Company are also offering a limited amount of places to train YOU and your friend either hand-to-hand combat or weapon combat. These are available as perks on our campaign. These classes will take place when it is safe to do so.And finally we'll need costumes. Our presentation reel is likely to feature 8 characters. Two of which are from 16th century Scotland and so it's important that we hire the best person for the job, who can use their skills and experiences to bring our characters to life through costume and design. Most contemporary costumes are easier to source and put together, but our historical costumes will obviously cost us more and take more time to put together. The quotes we have been receiving, including the designer's time, is roughly £1000. We could technically find some cheap costumes and hire them, and ask our actors to bring their own clothing to create the costumes, but as we will be pitching this sizzle reel to producers from around the world and production companies, we want to put our best foot forward and make this series a hot commodity. We don't want to give them any reasons to say no to us.Progressive Broadcast Scotland are sponsoring our sizzle reel and providing us with an Arri Alexa package to shoot our taster on.Hair and Makeup mood board for Alia by Nefi Noufal.Some of our potential locations for filming our sizzle reel.

There's something magical about the music that transports you from reality to being in the world of the film itself.That magic, the kind that lurks around unseen in our everyday lives, has always inspired me and is one of the many reasons why I'm so excited to be a part of Origins.""Ewan Stewart joins our sizzle reel as our director of photography. Ewan is a Lighting Camera Operator based in Central Scotland. He has over 15 years experience across documentary, drama, lifestyle, corporate productions, and commercials. Ewan has a passion and enthusiasm for creating beautiful impactful films.For the last 10 years the creative team has been creating exciting and original films and web series in Scotland and the UK. As fans of ""Doctor Who"", ""Star Wars"", ""Torchwood"", and ""Being Human"", we feel there's plenty of room for a splash of colour, monsters and action in the TV and film market. Leila Dean is our visual effects animator and is currently working on our 60 second trailer. Leila graduated from the University of South Wales, Atrium in Cardiff in 2016 where she obtained my BA (Hons) degree in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics, prior to this she studied Diploma in Creative Media Production, with a Subsidiary in Art and Design, Interactive Media. Leila is passionate about creativity and realism in art, she love the satisfaction of creating something that looks good and knowing that she did that herself.

This series not only has real potential as superb entertainment for audiences worldwide; it could also serve as a fantastic portal for young Scots keen to find out more about the language, culture and mythology of the land they call home.”Meghan Grieve joins the team in the art department. Meghan is a graduate from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she obtained a BA in Production Arts and Design specialising in Set and Costume Design in 2018.

<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>The GLORY HOLE</strong> is a gleefully twisted, often raunchy and completely irreverent experimental late night cable access ""comedy"" television series from the mind of controversial and award-winning San Francisco independent filmmaker, artist and author <strong>Dave O'Shea</strong>, best known for his disturbing and acclaimed 2012 cult-horror feature <strong>DAY JOB</strong>.  And while <strong>The GLORY HOLE</strong> is technically a comedy program, there are plenty of horrific themes and imagery throughout--and for those paying close attention, you'll find timely (and timeless..?) social commentary sprinkled in throughout the madness. . . but we try our best not to get too heavy-handed with it.</span></h3>

<h3>WHO is The GLORY HOLE?</h3>
<p>Led from behind and sometimes in front of the camera by the aforementioned <strong>O'Shea</strong>-who writes, produces, directs, animates and edits the series, <strong>The GLORY HOLE</strong> stars the hilariously deadpan <strong>Philip Richardson</strong> (a favorite of <strong>DAY JOB</strong> fans) as a cynical but lovable talk show host and his substance-abusing, telepathic &amp; occasionally homicidal mannequin cohost <strong>Ruttegar</strong>.  And once in a while the show's ever-aggravated director <strong>Tim TruGee</strong> and Ruttegar's ex <strong>Rebecca</strong> show up, when they're not too tired or hungover. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571184308/oloa5ugqmqgweczhwjlx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Ruttegar, Phil and Rebecca give each other some encouragement on set while the crew sets up the next shot</i></p>
<p>Each episode is Enthusiastically introduced by another key player, our voluptuous and versatile Announcer <strong>Ed Gory</strong> as <strong>Wink Woolery</strong>--a down on his luck former 1980s game show host trying desperately to claw his way back from of obscurity.  Some notable guest stars from Season One include genuine '90s Scream Queen <strong>Debra Lamb</strong>(!!), future superstar <strong>Jazmine Carter</strong>, Daniel<strong> ""DJ Danny Delorean"" </strong>Imani, fellow San Francisco independent filmmaker <strong>Cassandra Sechler</strong> and some old friends from local campy horror show <i>Creepy Kofy Movietime</i>, <strong>Balrok Del Cavo</strong>, <strong>Victoria Privates</strong> and <strong>Melissa LaRoue </strong>among many others!</p>
<p>There are a handful of lovable and unlovable recurring characters who pop up every now and then to keep viewers on their toes, too, like the show-within-the-show's sexy and incredibly unstable (to put it politely) producer <strong>Monkey Girl</strong>, then there's washed up/fed up wrestling superstar <strong>Dick Biter </strong>and a mysterious <strong>Superhero</strong> character known only as the <strong>Running Man</strong> who embarks on a 12-episode long adventure running full speed All across the globe.. <i>but WHY</i>?  You'll have to keep your eyes on the clues all the way through until the Explosive Season Finale!  Talk about a <i>climax</i>!!</p>

<h2>And Now Some ""FUN"" FACTS!</h2>
<h3>What The GLORY HOLE is:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Satirical and unapologetically subversive (look it up) sketch-comedy mixed with subtle to not-so-subtle social commentary and unforgettably bizarre regulars and guests, plus inappropriate Adults-Only animated segments, low-rent superheroes and a heavy dose of gleeful chaos sprinkled in for good measure </li>
<li>Unpredictable, constantly evolving episode to episode and Always Uncensored</li>
<li>Low, and we mean LOW Budget, so don't expect blockbuster production values. But we'd like to think we make up for it with originality, wit, beauty and charm</li>
<li>Similar in tone to what you might stumble across at 4am on <strong>ADULT SWIM </strong>with the spirit of early <strong>SNL</strong> or <strong>MR. SHOW w/ Bob and David</strong>, just with none of the TV network budget. And with more monkeys in bikinis and mannequin sex.</li>
<li>A surprisingly intelligent and thought-provoking comedy program disguised as an incredibly stupid comedy program.  And sometimes it can feel like a fever-dream </li>
</ul>
<h3>What THE GLORY HOLE is NOT:</h3>
<ul>
<li>An actual glory hole</li>
<li>For the closed-minded, the pretentious or the hypersensitive</li>
<li>Recommended for children under 17 years of age due to the sometimes naughty subject matter, nudity and occasional foul language/violence</li>

<h3>Why We Need YOUR Help</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, we're not exactly what you'd call independently wealthy (we know, we know.. <strong><i>Shocking</i>!</strong>).  Miraculously, we were able to pull off a pretty impressive first season using only the pocket change we dug out from between O'Shea's couch cushions, but in order to produce the DVDs and get back into production, we do need an actual budget. </p>
<p>Not to pull the curtain back too far, but as all truly independent filmmakers know, this style of self-funded guerrilla filmmaking, even with some of the amazing performers and resources we have had access to, does quickly become financially crippling.  So rather than pull the plug on it all, we're hoping YOU'll help us afford to get on life support long enough to crank out some more of the unique Glory Hole magic you've come to expect! </p>
<h3><strong>How Will the Funds be Used?</strong></h3>
<p>To be clear, EVERY DOLLAR raised will go directly into the show.  We're not trying to get you to pay our rent or anything, we have actual day jobs for that, don't worry.</p>
<p>After the DVDs are manufactured, funds will go towards paying the actors and crew who have had to work for less than peanuts in the past (bless their hearts) but that cannot go on; some of our equipment is on the brink of death and will need to be repaired and/or replaced before we can properly return to full-on production; equipment rentals are needed on occasion as well, plus costumes/wardrobe, art supplies, paying 'professionals' to assist from time to time, renting locations when necessary, all these things require money, so the reality is . . .</p>

<p><i>As always, host Phil  hits us with the wisdom</i></p>
<h3>What If the Goal isn't Met?</h3>
<p>This is always the risk in crowdfunding, but we will definitely make it worth EVERY contributor's while.  If you order the DVDs, you're going to get DVDs.  Worst case, they may not end up having as fancy a packaging as we'd hoped, but you will get them. Order a T-Shirt or coloring books or anything else on our perks list, you'll get them as well. </p>
<p>The reality is we are going to make the best of whatever fate has in store for us, if that means all we get to do is produce the Season 1 DVDs, that's okay!  If we raise an amount that surpasses the DVD production costs but doesn't necessarily warrant us shooting a full 2nd season of the show, then we'll take whatever we raise and use it all on the upcoming <strong>Bonus Episode</strong>. </p>
<p>We're the eternal optimists over here and just want to create the best possible product for you fans and supporters (and for US), so we assure you every dollar raised will go directly into making sure that happens!!  All that said, we truly WOULD like to meet at least our minimum goal so everyone can get the most bang for their BUCK! </p>

</div></div>","What is The GLORY HOLE? 
The GLORY HOLE is a gleefully twisted, often raunchy and completely irreverent experimental late night cable access ""comedy"" television series from the mind of controversial and award-winning San Francisco independent filmmaker, artist and author Dave O'Shea, best known for his disturbing and acclaimed 2012 cult-horror feature DAY JOB.  And while The GLORY HOLE is technically a comedy program, there are plenty of horrific themes and imagery throughout--and for those paying close attention, you'll find timely (and timeless..?) social commentary sprinkled in throughout the madness. . . but we try our best not to get too heavy-handed with it.

In The Beginning . . .

The GLORY HOLE began in the Spring of 2017 as a create a 20 minute talk show project for a college television production course that creator O'Shea was enrolled in.  After taking some creative liberties with the format, said assignment became the Pilot Episode for the series and eventually led to the gang producing 12 additional and increasingly adventurous episodes, and it has now been on the air for over 2 years in the San Francisco Bay Area (and counting!)

PS-When you have some time to burn, you can watch the Pilot Episode below.  The DVD will feature the Uncensored  version for your perving, I mean, VIEWING Pleasure.  Enjoy!

WHO is The GLORY HOLE?
Led from behind and sometimes in front of the camera by the aforementioned O'Shea-who writes, produces, directs, animates and edits the series, The GLORY HOLE stars the hilariously deadpan Philip Richardson (a favorite of DAY JOB fans) as a cynical but lovable talk show host and his substance-abusing, telepathic & occasionally homicidal mannequin cohost Ruttegar.  And once in a while the show's ever-aggravated director Tim TruGee and Ruttegar's ex Rebecca show up, when they're not too tired or hungover. 

Ruttegar, Phil and Rebecca give each other some encouragement on set while the crew sets up the next shot
Each episode is Enthusiastically introduced by another key player, our voluptuous and versatile Announcer Ed Gory as Wink Woolery--a down on his luck former 1980s game show host trying desperately to claw his way back from of obscurity.  Some notable guest stars from Season One include genuine '90s Scream Queen Debra Lamb(!!), future superstar Jazmine Carter, Daniel ""DJ Danny Delorean"" Imani, fellow San Francisco independent filmmaker Cassandra Sechler and some old friends from local campy horror show Creepy Kofy Movietime, Balrok Del Cavo, Victoria Privates and Melissa LaRoue among many others!
There are a handful of lovable and unlovable recurring characters who pop up every now and then to keep viewers on their toes, too, like the show-within-the-show's sexy and incredibly unstable (to put it politely) producer Monkey Girl, then there's washed up/fed up wrestling superstar Dick Biter and a mysterious Superhero character known only as the Running Man who embarks on a 12-episode long adventure running full speed All across the globe.. but WHY?  You'll have to keep your eyes on the clues all the way through until the Explosive Season Finale!  Talk about a climax!!

Monkey Girl keeps an eye on things from The GLORY HOLE control room in Episode 2
Bringing the show to life on the production side has involved a revolving door of underpaid but over-loved college students, friends and production assistants, most consistently in ever-loyal DAY JOB alumni Dell Manantan and resident technical wizard Daniel Sannebeck. 
It's a small but dedicated group who together have put in countless hours, days, weeks and months into helping bring the series to life!  And with YOUR HELP, all involved who haven't moved away or been murdered yet, will return for a bigger and BETTER Season 2 with LOTS of returning AND New guest stars, plus some Crazy next-level storylines!

And Now Some ""FUN"" FACTS!
What The GLORY HOLE is:

Satirical and unapologetically subversive (look it up) sketch-comedy mixed with subtle to not-so-subtle social commentary and unforgettably bizarre regulars and guests, plus inappropriate Adults-Only animated segments, low-rent superheroes and a heavy dose of gleeful chaos sprinkled in for good measure 
Unpredictable, constantly evolving episode to episode and Always Uncensored
Low, and we mean LOW Budget, so don't expect blockbuster production values. But we'd like to think we make up for it with originality, wit, beauty and charm
Similar in tone to what you might stumble across at 4am on ADULT SWIM with the spirit of early SNL or MR. SHOW w/ Bob and David, just with none of the TV network budget. And with more monkeys in bikinis and mannequin sex.
A surprisingly intelligent and thought-provoking comedy program disguised as an incredibly stupid comedy program.  And sometimes it can feel like a fever-dream 

What THE GLORY HOLE is NOT:

An actual glory hole
For the closed-minded, the pretentious or the hypersensitive
Recommended for children under 17 years of age due to the sometimes naughty subject matter, nudity and occasional foul language/violence
Meant to be taken seriously or personally (the title or the show) 


Creator Dave O'Shea calls The GLORY HOLE ""the most creatively satisfying project I've worked on thus far,"" adding, ""I wasn't really looking to make a television series, but once I knew I had the freedom to make it whatever I wanted with no censorship and no rules, no one to impress or need approval from, it just clicked and I ran with it.  Luckily, I have some amazing friends and performer acquaintances who've been brave enough to help bring it all to life with me.  Hopefully we'll get to make another season because it's a hell of a lot of fun.""

The PLAN(s)

Shocking!).  Miraculously, we were able to pull off a pretty impressive first season using only the pocket change we dug out from between O'Shea's couch cushions, but in order to produce the DVDs and get back into production, we do need an actual budget.

How Will the Funds be Used?
To be clear, EVERY DOLLAR raised will go directly into the show.  We're not trying to get you to pay our rent or anything, we have actual day jobs for that, don't worry.
After the DVDs are manufactured, funds will go towards paying the actors and crew who have had to work for less than peanuts in the past (bless their hearts) but that cannot go on; some of our equipment is on the brink of death and will need to be repaired and/or replaced before we can properly return to full-on production; equipment rentals are needed on occasion as well, plus costumes/wardrobe, art supplies, paying 'professionals' to assist from time to time, renting locations when necessary, all these things require money, so the reality is . . .

Тодоров пише: „Всички промени в природата са такива, че колкото е взето от едно тяло, толкова е добавено към друго. Така, ако количеството смисъл намалява в един скеч, то се увеличава в друг."" Според Тодоров, нищо не ни вдъхва увереност, че утре наистина ще имаме време да направим онова, което можем да направим днес и поради това трябва да играем сега и то по такъв начин, сякаш изразяваме целия смисъл на живота си.

Завършил е факултета по военна медицина към НАТФИЗ през 1959 г. В писмо до Ойлер от 1962 г. Тодоров пише: „Всички промени в природата са такива, че колкото е взето от едно тяло, толкова е добавено към друго. Така, ако количеството смисъл намалява в един скеч, то се увеличава в друг."" Според Тодоров, нищо не ни вдъхва увереност, че утре наистина ще имаме време да направим онова, което можем да направим днес и поради това трябва да играем сега и то по такъв начин, сякаш изразяваме целия смисъл на живота си. За голямото кино го открива Дучо Мундров. Същинският му пробив обаче идва с филма ""Птици и хрътки"", където Тодоров изиграва всички птици и четири от хрътките. От тогава Китодар е безусловен любимец на вече седмо поколение българи.  ЛЪЧЕЗАР АВРАМОВЗа лицето има толкова много информация, че няма технологично място да бъде публикувана. ДОСЕГАШНИ СЕЗОНИ:Сезон 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnpXNUpciE&list=PLmE2SNxaZi-XPUu5bw_crgw7mqkFtyC48Сезон 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQmsokgYc2A&list=PLmE2SNxaZi-VONFa1i8vKXViZLFL4FQ53Приятно гледане! PREVIOUS SEASONS:Season 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfnpXNUpciE&list=PLmE2SNxaZi-XPUu5bw_crgw7mqkFtyC48Season 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQmsokgYc2A&list=PLmE2SNxaZi-VONFa1i8vKXViZLFL4FQ53Enjoy watching!Продължителност:Кампанията за набиране на средства за 3-ти сезона на Петък точно в пет с Китодар Тодоров ще продължи 60 дни.

Trying out some emotions designed by Sandra Ghosn: Et en françaisQui est Rawi ?Rawi, un petit garçon vivant dans cette société à Beyrouth, a un quotidien plein d’aventures. Avec sa meilleure amie Dounia, ils explorent le monde qui les entoure, apprenant et faisant des découvertes chaque jour. Votre enfant va vivre avec eux dans cet environnement libano-arabe. Rawi, le héros de la série, est basé sur le fils de Nancy (que vous avez rencontré dans la vidéo ci-dessus !). Voici un échantillon des débuts... Essai de quelques émotions réalisé par Sandra Ghosn:What we need the money for?Since we want the creative and content freedom, we decided to come to You, OUR AUDIENCE, to help us raise enough funds to create a mini series, as a first step! As you already know, creating animations take a lot of effort and work... and a big team: writers, illustrators, colorists, animators, editors, voice talents (actors), sound engineers, music composers, etc... and remember: ALL the episodes will be online for FREE  for everyone to access... So yalla what are you waiting for?You need more convincing? :)Tayib, most importantly, we want YOU to contribute in what you would like to show your children.

Comme vous le savez déjà, la création d'animations demande beaucoup d'efforts et de travail... et une grande équipe : écrivains, illustrateurs, coloristes, animateurs, monteurs, doubleurs (acteurs), ingénieurs du son, compositeurs de musique, etc... et n'oubliez pas : TOUS les épisodes seront en ligne GRATUITEMENT et accessibles à tous...

Choisissez un montant et vous recevrez un avantage très cool ! Why now?We've started working on this project a couple of years ago. Then very quickly, Lebanon went into all sorts of crises, and shortly after that... the pandemic hit the whole globe! So we waited, we had to. Now we cannot wait anymore because sadly, the crises in Lebanon are even deeper and we figured the longer we wait, the more we lose our motivation and excitement in producing this and we are sooo excited to get going with it... You can join us, but first meet the team:Et en françaisPourquoi maintenant ?Nous avons commencé à travailler sur ce projet il y a quelques années. Puis, très rapidement, le Liban a connu toutes sortes de crises, et peu après... la pandémie a frappé le monde entier ! Nous avons donc attendu, il le fallait. Maintenant, nous ne pouvons plus attendre car malheureusement, les crises au Liban sont encore plus profondes et nous nous sommes dit que plus nous attendons, plus nous perdons notre motivation et notre enthousiasme à produire ce projet alors que  nous sommes super méga excités de nous lancer... Vous pouvez nous rejoindre, mais rencontrez d'abord l'équipe :What's in it For You? The series aim to create a connection to your child’s ancestral culture, language and heritage in our modern world. Such an initiative will incite children of Arab parents to have the desire to speak this language, to learn it, or simply to enlarge their vocabulary. It will give them the chance to learn the Lebanese dialect without having to learn the literary Arabic.Et en françaisQuel est l'intérêt pour vous ? Cette série vise à créer un lien avec la culture, la langue et le patrimoine ancestraux de votre enfant dans notre monde moderne. Une telle initiative incitera les enfants de parents arabes à avoir le désir de parler cette langue, de l'apprendre, ou simplement d'élargir leur vocabulaire. Elle leur donnera la chance d'apprendre le dialecte libanais sans avoir à apprendre l’arabe littéraire.Who Are We? We, the creators of Rawi Cartoon, have extensive and proven record of working on and producing children content. Nancy Naous:  Graduated from the Institute of Fine Arts in Beirut and then pursued her graduate studies at the Sorbonne in Paris.

It was all for either basic necessities or reconstruction. We want to help our communities, and specifically we want children to access Art.

<p>Greetings!</p> <p>My name is Zackary Forsythe, also known as Chef Zack. I have been working as a chef for 10+ years. I am a Chef Educator by trade, but my passion truly resides in entertaining. I have been cooking all over New England working with various cuisines including Italian, French, New American, Middle Eastern, and Portuguese. Most recently, I worked as the head breakfast chef at the Inn at Shelburne Farms and Common Roots as their head culinary educator in Vermont. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has devastated restaurants, and because of this, it's time for me to make a career change and open up a new chapter of my life. In the next few months, I plan to return to school to obtain a degree in UX/UI web development at the Burlington Coding Academy. I want to have a family someday and working in restaurants made that seem impossible. I decided to take this path because I have a knack for design, and this career will allow me to have a work-life balance.</p> <p>As we all know, higher education requires money.

</div></div>","Greetings! My name is Zackary Forsythe, also known as Chef Zack. I have been working as a chef for 10+ years. I am a Chef Educator by trade, but my passion truly resides in entertaining. I have been cooking all over New England working with various cuisines including Italian, French, New American, Middle Eastern, and Portuguese. Most recently, I worked as the head breakfast chef at the Inn at Shelburne Farms and Common Roots as their head culinary educator in Vermont. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has devastated restaurants, and because of this, it's time for me to make a career change and open up a new chapter of my life. In the next few months, I plan to return to school to obtain a degree in UX/UI web development at the Burlington Coding Academy. I want to have a family someday and working in restaurants made that seem impossible. I decided to take this path because I have a knack for design, and this career will allow me to have a work-life balance. As we all know, higher education requires money. I began searching for loans and grants, but with the pandemic, many traditional funding options have changed or become unavailable. Unfortunately, my program does not qualify for federal student loans. Through my savings and state grants, I’ve funded part of my education.

<h3>Pourquoi cette campagne ?</h3>
<p>Afin de produire une histoire enlevante qui n'en peu plus d'attendre après le financement des institutions :) Après plusieurs années en développement, j'ai besoin de tourner cette série qui touchera assurément des centaines et j'espère des milliers de personnes ! Mon objectif est d'attirer l'attention d'un producteur et éventuellement d'un distributeur comme Netflix en créant une série qui n'a pas froid aux yeux. Je suis vraiment enthousiaste à l'idée de pouvoir donner vie aux personnages attachants et déjantés de la série et j'ai définitivement besoin de votre aide pour y parvenir ! Vos contributions serviront d'abord à payer les talents qui vont travailler avec moi à rendre ce projet drôle, touchant et visuellement inspirant.  Plus j'amasserai d'argent, plus je pourrai obtenir la contribution de talents importants, c'est pourquoi votre contribution fera toute la différence du monde sur la qualité de la série ! Soyez généreux et vous en serez récompensés !</p>
<p>Dans un deuxième temps, je veux aussi obtenir la contribution de nombreux commanditaires qui me fourniront les outils nécessaires à la production et qui me permettront de traiter tous ses participants aux petits soins. Traiteurs, techniciens, artisans, n'hésitez pas à m'offrir votre aide ! De mon côté, je vais m'occuper gracieusement de faire la réalisation et le montage de la série. Finalement, je vais vous présenter la série lors d'un MÉGA PARTY DE LANCEMENT pour remercier tout ceux et celles qui auront rendu ce projet possible ! Ça va être malade !</p>

<h3><strong>STATEMENT OF INTENT</strong></h3>
<p>ENG | With The Prescription, my intention is to explore the concept of consent in a post-#metoo era. Can a woman be sexually liberated without suffering any consequences? In Jean-Claude Lauzon’s film Léolo (<a href=""https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ</a>), the main character is beaten by a vagabond despite being physically stronger than his assailant. This is an example of how, in the face of trauma, the body’s condition is less important than the strength of the spirit. I will also explore the taboos surrounding mental health, which can exacerbate the problems sufferers experience. I will immerse these themes, and others, in a unique and impactful cinematographic universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>NOTE D'INTENTION</strong></h3>
<p>FR | Avec La prescription, je veux explorer le concept de consentement dans une ère post #metoo. Les femmes peuvent-elles aujourd'hui avoir une sexualité libérée sans en subir les conséquences ? Sinon, quelle est la limite qui sépare une relation sexuelle saine de l’abus ? Deuxièmement, je veux confronter les diverses réactions que la cyberintimidation peut générer chez ses victimes. La résilience est-elle une option valable pour s'en sortir ? La vengeance est-elle une option efficace ? Tout comme dans la scène du film ""Léolo"" de Jean-Claude Lauzon <a href=""https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ</a>, où le personnage principal est battu par un voyou malgré sa supériorité physique, je veux démontrer que face à un traumatisme, ce n'est pas le corps qui doit être entraîné à se défendre, mais l'esprit. Je veux également aborder les tabous entourant les problèmes de santé mentale qui peuvent générer de la détresse chez ceux qui en souffrent. Enfin, je veux plonger cette histoire dans une esthétique cinématographique unique et percutante.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>DESCRIPTION DES PERSONNAGES</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRA MARTEL</strong></p>
<p><i>Qu’on l’aime ou on la déteste, Alexandra ne laisse personne indifférent.</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alexandra ne cherche pas l'attention, mais l'attire grâce à son charisme qu'elle ne contrôle pas. Elle cherche le consensus puis s'adapte à la majorité. Le jugement des autres et le conflit sont les choses qui la terrorisent le plus. Elle aimerait parfois disparaître, mais la flamboyance de sa personnalité l'en empêche. Après son agression, Alexandra se met des brassières de sport, porte des jeans coupe homme ou des shorts de basket et des hoodies qui couvrent ses formes. Lorsqu'elle s'entraîne avec Gugu ou qu'elle fait face à Sam, Alexandra est forte, confiante dans son regard comme dans sa démarche. Elle parle peu, mais lorsqu'elle le fait, c'est pour affirmer ses opinions ou se faire comprendre clairement.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DEREK PAIEMENT</strong></p>
<p><i>Le loup sous des airs de biche</i></p>
<p>Derek est très intelligent. C’est un fils à maman, il a toujours obtenu ce qu’il voulait en usant de ses charmes. C’est pourquoi il trouve particulièrement difficile qu’Alexandra lui résiste. Il accorde beaucoup d’attention à ce que pensent les autres de lui et s’inquiète de sa réputation sur les réseaux sociaux. Il poursuit ses études en biologie médicale pour obtenir l’approbation et l’amour de son père médecin, mais ses attitudes de playboy à tatoo l’empêchent d’arriver à ses fins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SAM McARTHUR</strong></p>
<p><i>C'est un rock, une force tranquille</i></p>
<p>Sam Sugiyama est d'origine japonaise, il n'a que quelques amis, tous triés sur le volet. Il est la stabilité même. Il aime que les choses soient bien faites et dans l'ordre. Il est économe et peut sembler rigide, mais, en réalité, tous ses actes sont réfléchis. C'est un homme doux et patient qui aime son prochain. Il est d'une grande force morale et un grand sensible. Sa relation avec Alexandra est très compliquée étant donné qu'il est policier et que malgré tout l'amour qu'il porte à sa colocataire, elle ne cesse de défier la loi pour laquelle il a beaucoup de respect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GABRIELLA PELLETIER</strong></p>
<p><i>Un cliché à réinventer</i></p>
<p>Gabriella est une vlogueuse très populaire pour ses tutos de maquillage. Elle est excellente dans ses études, en PR et dans tout ce qu'elle entreprend. Elle a une apparence soignée et passe beaucoup de temps à parfaire son image sur les réseaux sociaux. Malgré tout, son estime d'elle reste fragile et elle n'est jamais à l'abris de décevoir son entourage qui est particulièrement exigeant envers elle. Elle n'aime pas le côté désinvolte et libéré d'Alexandra et devient particulièrement compétitive lorsque son amoureux Derek démontre de l'intérêt envers elle. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GUSTAVE LAROUCHE-DUBOIS (Gugu)</strong></p>
<p><i>Une main de velour dans un gant de fer</i></p>
<p>On appelle Gustave Larouche-Dubois « Gugu », mais il déteste ça. Il est propriétaire du gymnase « Le Ring des Géants » depuis que son père, boxeur de profession, lui ait laissé la business après sa mort. Ouvertement homosexuel, il a souvent été victime d'intimidation. Il en porte encore les traces. Il n'a pas d'amoureux mais fait beaucoup de rencontres à caractère uniquement sexuel. Il a une tendance à la mélancolie et emprunte des véhicules de fuite (alcool, drogues, sexe, etc.) pour faire taire ses angoisses. Il tente de convaincre Alexandra de cesser de se battre ou de vouloir se venger... mais il a lui aussi un secret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LE TRAITEMENT CINÉMATOGRAPHIQUE</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LA PHOTOGRAPHIE</strong></p>
<p>Je veux illustrer l'univers des démons qui hantent le coeur d'Alexandra par des scènes aux couleurs chaudes, avec des néons, des closes up et une caméra majoritairement à l'épaule. Je veux ensuite opposer cet univers sombre avec ses scènes calmes aux couleurs neutres et aux plans fixes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575671234/qfh73qoitvtsrbyeiyyg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>L’UNIVERS DES 4 F | Fear | Fight | Flight | Fuck</strong></p>
<p>Pour se débarrasser de ses angoisses en suivant la prescription des 4F, Alexandra fréquentera plusieurs lieux et personnes louches, dont le « Ring des Géants », un centre d'entraînement de boxe dans un sous-sol sombre dont les murs sont éclairés par des néons de couleurs chaudes. La bâtisse historique est située près de l'université d'Alexandra. Sa clientèle est composée majoritairement de réfugiés de différents pays et de membres de groupes aux activités illégales.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575651409/moykpp0zlczncofoisis.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>L'APPARTEMENT D'ALEXANDRA</strong></p>
<p>C'est un coquet petit 4 1/2 sur le plateau Mont-Royal où Alexandra habite avec Gilles depuis le CEGEP. La chambre d'Alexandra est toujours en bordel tandis que le reste de l'appartement est rangé et gardé d'une propreté impeccable par son colocataire. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575651426/y1uvtivpkksozfpmyrgd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>L'UNIVERSITÉ</strong></p>
<p>Comme c'est le cas à l'université de Montréal, l'environnement extérieur vert et luxuriant fait contraste avec le beige triste des salles de classe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575652631/dhmvpg89d1bwfwvv8nzk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LES EFFETS VISUELS</strong></p>
<p>Pour se rapprocher du personnage d'Alexandra particulièrement lors de ses moments d'angoisses, je veux, par moment, accrocher une caméra sur elle comme dans le vidéoclip de To Lo - Habits (Stay High) : <a href=""https://youtu.be/oh2LWWORoiM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/oh2LWWORoiM</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575652666/cbeq2rimxjwmdfqsupvu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COSTUMES AND ACCESSORIES </strong></p>
<p>Grâce au département artistique, je veux créer des archétypes. Des personnages à la fois crédibles, mais fascinants par leur côté légèrement décalé ou excentrique.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575651464/zmu7c7w4ofczpmidco0c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>LE RYTHME ET LE MONTAGE</strong></p>
<p>Pour mieux confronter les univers du film et pour créer autant de surprises que d'émotions vives, je veux alterner entre le rythme rapide (jump cut) de la comédie et des moments poignants au ralenti.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575671291/eh9hx028g1a6ydybpahs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

LOGLINE
ENG | After surviving a rape attempt in her first week at university, Alexandra must eliminate her adrenaline-junkie behaviours dubbed The 4 Fs: Fear, Fight, Flight, F***. FR | Afin de reprendre le contrôle de sa vie après avoir subi une tentative de viol à l’université, Alexandra décide de suivre une prescription lui interdisant d’utiliser 4F (Fear, Fight, Flight, Fuck) pour se donner des poussées d’adrénaline.
 
Why this campaign?
To produce a riveting story that can’t wait any longer after the funding of institutions :) After several years in development, I need to shoot this series which will undoubtedly touch hundreds and I hope thousands of people! My goal is to attract the attention of a producer and possibly a distributor like Netflix by creating a series that defies the standards. I'm really excited to be able to bring to life the engaging and crazy characters from the series, and I definitely need your help to get there! Your contributions will first be used to pay the talents who will work with me to make this project funny, touching and visually inspiring. The more money I raise, the more I can get the contribution of important talents. That’s why your contribution can significantly increase the quality of the series! Be generous and you will be rewarded!
Thank you in advance and I look forward to presenting the project to you at the MEGA LAUNCH PARTY! I’ll keep you posted on this event and a lot more on the series Facebook page ! Like it here -» https://www.facebook.com/4Fprescription
 
Pourquoi cette campagne ?
Afin de produire une histoire enlevante qui n'en peu plus d'attendre après le financement des institutions :) Après plusieurs années en développement, j'ai besoin de tourner cette série qui touchera assurément des centaines et j'espère des milliers de personnes ! Mon objectif est d'attirer l'attention d'un producteur et éventuellement d'un distributeur comme Netflix en créant une série qui n'a pas froid aux yeux. Je suis vraiment enthousiaste à l'idée de pouvoir donner vie aux personnages attachants et déjantés de la série et j'ai définitivement besoin de votre aide pour y parvenir ! Vos contributions serviront d'abord à payer les talents qui vont travailler avec moi à rendre ce projet drôle, touchant et visuellement inspirant.  Plus j'amasserai d'argent, plus je pourrai obtenir la contribution de talents importants, c'est pourquoi votre contribution fera toute la différence du monde sur la qualité de la série ! Soyez généreux et vous en serez récompensés !
Dans un deuxième temps, je veux aussi obtenir la contribution de nombreux commanditaires qui me fourniront les outils nécessaires à la production et qui me permettront de traiter tous ses participants aux petits soins. Traiteurs, techniciens, artisans, n'hésitez pas à m'offrir votre aide ! De mon côté, je vais m'occuper gracieusement de faire la réalisation et le montage de la série. Finalement, je vais vous présenter la série lors d'un MÉGA PARTY DE LANCEMENT pour remercier tout ceux et celles qui auront rendu ce projet possible ! Ça va être malade !

STATEMENT OF INTENT
ENG | With The Prescription, my intention is to explore the concept of consent in a post-#metoo era. Can a woman be sexually liberated without suffering any consequences? In Jean-Claude Lauzon’s film Léolo (https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ), the main character is beaten by a vagabond despite being physically stronger than his assailant. This is an example of how, in the face of trauma, the body’s condition is less important than the strength of the spirit. I will also explore the taboos surrounding mental health, which can exacerbate the problems sufferers experience. I will immerse these themes, and others, in a unique and impactful cinematographic universe.
 
NOTE D'INTENTION
FR | Avec La prescription, je veux explorer le concept de consentement dans une ère post #metoo. Les femmes peuvent-elles aujourd'hui avoir une sexualité libérée sans en subir les conséquences ? Sinon, quelle est la limite qui sépare une relation sexuelle saine de l’abus ? Deuxièmement, je veux confronter les diverses réactions que la cyberintimidation peut générer chez ses victimes. La résilience est-elle une option valable pour s'en sortir ? La vengeance est-elle une option efficace ? Tout comme dans la scène du film ""Léolo"" de Jean-Claude Lauzon https://youtu.be/KOh3E0gA-TQ, où le personnage principal est battu par un voyou malgré sa supériorité physique, je veux démontrer que face à un traumatisme, ce n'est pas le corps qui doit être entraîné à se défendre, mais l'esprit. Je veux également aborder les tabous entourant les problèmes de santé mentale qui peuvent générer de la détresse chez ceux qui en souffrent. Enfin, je veux plonger cette histoire dans une esthétique cinématographique unique et percutante.

Wow ! Tu trouves que la série a l'air géniale ? T'as envie de m'encourager ? Le problème c'est que t'as pas d'argent à donner ? Je te comprends donc ! Ma devise : c'est avec des PARTAGE qu'on aide à financer une série web. Je le prendrais comme une chaleureuse et très encourageante tape dans le dos ! Merci à toi !
Au plaisir !

LE PROJET

DESCRIPTION DES PERSONNAGES
 
ALEXANDRA MARTEL
Qu’on l’aime ou on la déteste, Alexandra ne laisse personne indifférent.
Alexandra ne cherche pas l'attention, mais l'attire grâce à son charisme qu'elle ne contrôle pas. Elle cherche le consensus puis s'adapte à la majorité. Le jugement des autres et le conflit sont les choses qui la terrorisent le plus. Elle aimerait parfois disparaître, mais la flamboyance de sa personnalité l'en empêche. Après son agression, Alexandra se met des brassières de sport, porte des jeans coupe homme ou des shorts de basket et des hoodies qui couvrent ses formes. Lorsqu'elle s'entraîne avec Gugu ou qu'elle fait face à Sam, Alexandra est forte, confiante dans son regard comme dans sa démarche. Elle parle peu, mais lorsqu'elle le fait, c'est pour affirmer ses opinions ou se faire comprendre clairement.
 
DEREK PAIEMENT
Le loup sous des airs de biche
Derek est très intelligent. C’est un fils à maman, il a toujours obtenu ce qu’il voulait en usant de ses charmes. C’est pourquoi il trouve particulièrement difficile qu’Alexandra lui résiste. Il accorde beaucoup d’attention à ce que pensent les autres de lui et s’inquiète de sa réputation sur les réseaux sociaux. Il poursuit ses études en biologie médicale pour obtenir l’approbation et l’amour de son père médecin, mais ses attitudes de playboy à tatoo l’empêchent d’arriver à ses fins.
 
SAM McARTHUR
C'est un rock, une force tranquille
Sam Sugiyama est d'origine japonaise, il n'a que quelques amis, tous triés sur le volet. Il est la stabilité même. Il aime que les choses soient bien faites et dans l'ordre. Il est économe et peut sembler rigide, mais, en réalité, tous ses actes sont réfléchis. C'est un homme doux et patient qui aime son prochain. Il est d'une grande force morale et un grand sensible. Sa relation avec Alexandra est très compliquée étant donné qu'il est policier et que malgré tout l'amour qu'il porte à sa colocataire, elle ne cesse de défier la loi pour laquelle il a beaucoup de respect.
 
GABRIELLA PELLETIER
Un cliché à réinventer
Gabriella est une vlogueuse très populaire pour ses tutos de maquillage. Elle est excellente dans ses études, en PR et dans tout ce qu'elle entreprend. Elle a une apparence soignée et passe beaucoup de temps à parfaire son image sur les réseaux sociaux. Malgré tout, son estime d'elle reste fragile et elle n'est jamais à l'abris de décevoir son entourage qui est particulièrement exigeant envers elle. Elle n'aime pas le côté désinvolte et libéré d'Alexandra et devient particulièrement compétitive lorsque son amoureux Derek démontre de l'intérêt envers elle. 
 
GUSTAVE LAROUCHE-DUBOIS (Gugu)
Une main de velour dans un gant de fer
On appelle Gustave Larouche-Dubois « Gugu », mais il déteste ça. Il est propriétaire du gymnase « Le Ring des Géants » depuis que son père, boxeur de profession, lui ait laissé la business après sa mort. Ouvertement homosexuel, il a souvent été victime d'intimidation. Il en porte encore les traces. Il n'a pas d'amoureux mais fait beaucoup de rencontres à caractère uniquement sexuel. Il a une tendance à la mélancolie et emprunte des véhicules de fuite (alcool, drogues, sexe, etc.) pour faire taire ses angoisses. Il tente de convaincre Alexandra de cesser de se battre ou de vouloir se venger... mais il a lui aussi un secret.
 
LE TRAITEMENT CINÉMATOGRAPHIQUE
 
LA PHOTOGRAPHIE
Je veux illustrer l'univers des démons qui hantent le coeur d'Alexandra par des scènes aux couleurs chaudes, avec des néons, des closes up et une caméra majoritairement à l'épaule. Je veux ensuite opposer cet univers sombre avec ses scènes calmes aux couleurs neutres et aux plans fixes. 

Credit photo : https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/129900770488662392
 
L’UNIVERS DES 4 F | Fear | Fight | Flight | Fuck
Pour se débarrasser de ses angoisses en suivant la prescription des 4F, Alexandra fréquentera plusieurs lieux et personnes louches, dont le « Ring des Géants », un centre d'entraînement de boxe dans un sous-sol sombre dont les murs sont éclairés par des néons de couleurs chaudes. La bâtisse historique est située près de l'université d'Alexandra. Sa clientèle est composée majoritairement de réfugiés de différents pays et de membres de groupes aux activités illégales.

Credit photo : https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/129900770488662432/
 
L'APPARTEMENT D'ALEXANDRA
C'est un coquet petit 4 1/2 sur le plateau Mont-Royal où Alexandra habite avec Gilles depuis le CEGEP. La chambre d'Alexandra est toujours en bordel tandis que le reste de l'appartement est rangé et gardé d'une propreté impeccable par son colocataire. 

 
L'UNIVERSITÉ
Comme c'est le cas à l'université de Montréal, l'environnement extérieur vert et luxuriant fait contraste avec le beige triste des salles de classe.

 
LES EFFETS VISUELS
Pour se rapprocher du personnage d'Alexandra particulièrement lors de ses moments d'angoisses, je veux, par moment, accrocher une caméra sur elle comme dans le vidéoclip de To Lo - Habits (Stay High) : https://youtu.be/oh2LWWORoiM

 
COSTUMES AND ACCESSORIES 
Grâce au département artistique, je veux créer des archétypes. Des personnages à la fois crédibles, mais fascinants par leur côté légèrement décalé ou excentrique.

Credit photo : https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/129900770488685552
 
LE RYTHME ET LE MONTAGE
Pour mieux confronter les univers du film et pour créer autant de surprises que d'émotions vives, je veux alterner entre le rythme rapide (jump cut) de la comédie et des moments poignants au ralenti.

Credit photo https://blogsofalek.wordpress.com/2014/09/27/fe...
 
LE TRAITEMENT SONORE
Tout en laissant des moments de calme, parfois habillés seulement de drones d'ambiance, je veux suivre les différents « moods » d'Alexandra avec des chansons aux mélodies parfois techno, parfois mélodramatique, calquées sur celles qu'elle pourrait écouter presqu'en permanence dans ses écouteurs lorsqu'elle s'entraîne, se déplace ou plane sur une substance.

As he gets deeper into the world of politics, he realizes he has the support of the elite, who can almost guarantee a victory; but that comes with some strings attached. He finds that the ills devastating urban communities are seeded from the top, a world where you must PREY or be PREYED upon. He’s awakened to this new world where even his wife and close associates may not be who he thought they were in the name of greed. He falls prey to a few unsuspecting events, affording him a ticket to his new reality of deception, corruption, polluted water, organ trafficking, murder, and more. His goal to clean up the city may be immeasurable, especially since he's become a part of the problem.</p><h2><strong>TIMELINE:</strong></h2><p>Prey's 4 episodes for the season crowdfunding campaign will run for 60 days. During this time we'll be in pre-production. We're looking to roll out the newest episodes in the fall/winter of 2017. The first four episodes can be seen on Anthony Cuffie's youtube channel, and or visit <a href=""http://www.anthonycuffie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.anthonycuffie.com</a>.</p><h2><strong>Where does the money go!</strong></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495643703/p4csf7kpzwznbdi4stfl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're competing against a saturated market of shows, some with big budgets (the machine)</li>
<li>Independent companies/projects have to take on the the arduous chores that big production houses  are able to budget accordingly</li>
</ul>
<p>We're entering the first phase of crowdfunding to complete season one, but we intend to initiate a second phase ($50,000), which would incorporate a stronger marketing campaign, and be able to hire in more experienced personnel to assist in combating all risk and hazards. Our immediate plan is to continue to send out press releases for more press, utilizing social media, and to submit the web series to various film festivals to promote the series.  </p>
<h2><strong>Updates for Contributers:</strong></h2>
<p>We will periodically post pre and post production updates. If it's possible, we'd like you to send us a picture of you with one of the perks, so we can highlight and brag on our contributors. Our entire camp would like to thank you in advance.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get </strong></h2>
</div><p>We need a minimum of $25,000 to ensure season one is productive. The primary objective is to be syndicated by a nationally acclaimed network. If not, the secondary notion will be to establish a major presence on the web, producing commercials, and place client products throughout episodes as a means to establish financial independence to pay all of the personnel involved in the production. </p><p>With your contributions,  you can receive a range of nice gifts and opportunities ranging from an autographed romance novel titled Retraced, written and autographed by Anthony Cuffie to autograph posters. You may also receive t-shirts highlighting the web series' poster, series credit,  plaques, and more.</p><p><strong>Retraced (fiction novel) by Anthony Cuffie</strong></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495687472/ca6ksadhx5hkqfowihgs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><h2><strong>The Creator</strong></h2><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495644014/bfqr6aacwzs2uuie16he.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>Executive Producer/Writer/Director/Editor</strong></p><p><strong>After completing his first novel in 2004, Anthony Cuffie received major acclaim and was featured in the national magazine 'Rolling Out,' along with his music partner, Wilmonie Page. The two produced an accompanying soulful soundtrack. The soundtrack was produced to give readers a movie experience through literature and music, because making movies was always his end goal. His friend, a former member of Puff Daddy's Bad Boy regime, Loon, advised him to forget the traditional means of entering the film industry and to just write and produce his own movie in spite of limited funds. It was this advice that led him to complete feature and short films on micro budgets in 2009 and 2010, which unfortunately fostered many roadblocks. Cuffie is a self taught artist who graduated in Business from Ferris State University, later completed the Dov S-S Simens Film School and Detroit Film Center to polish his filmmaking skills. Since his inception into the world of movies, he's worked on many movie sets, and local productions. Cuffie has recently been interviewed for his first drama series title Prey, which is gaining national attention.

As a producer and songwriter, Marvin collaborated and worked with numerous local rappers, singers, and musicians from Hip-Hop, R&amp; B, Neo-Soul, Jazz and more. Some of his most intriguing song productions were recorded with local Detroit Neo-Soul and R&amp;B artist Wilmonie, Hip-hop duo Ken Lowe “Cardier” and Cassanova and also Hip-Hop solo artist OMB with whom they formed the short lived rap duo “Grumpy Old Men”. In 2010, Marvin left the music scene and entered the film and television field. He then joined forces with the renowned author and director Anthony Cuffie as co-writer of a short film called “Five Loaves of Bread”. After completion of their first film, they both began working on separate projects. In 2016, they rejoined forces again to work on Anthony Cuffie’s web series project that is currently appearing on You-Tube called Prey.

As he gets deeper into the world of politics, he realizes he has the support of the elite, who can almost guarantee a victory; but that comes with some strings attached. He finds that the ills devastating urban communities are seeded from the top, a world where you must PREY or be PREYED upon. He’s awakened to this new world where even his wife and close associates may not be who he thought they were in the name of greed. He falls prey to a few unsuspecting events, affording him a ticket to his new reality of deception, corruption, polluted water, organ trafficking, murder, and more. His goal to clean up the city may be immeasurable, especially since he's become a part of the problem.TIMELINE:Prey's 4 episodes for the season crowdfunding campaign will run for 60 days. During this time we'll be in pre-production. We're looking to roll out the newest episodes in the fall/winter of 2017. The first four episodes can be seen on Anthony Cuffie's youtube channel, and or visit www.anthonycuffie.com.Where does the money go!
Risks & Challenges

We're competing against a saturated market of shows, some with big budgets (the machine)
Independent companies/projects have to take on the the arduous chores that big production houses  are able to budget accordingly

We're entering the first phase of crowdfunding to complete season one, but we intend to initiate a second phase ($50,000), which would incorporate a stronger marketing campaign, and be able to hire in more experienced personnel to assist in combating all risk and hazards. Our immediate plan is to continue to send out press releases for more press, utilizing social media, and to submit the web series to various film festivals to promote the series.  
Updates for Contributers:
We will periodically post pre and post production updates. If it's possible, we'd like you to send us a picture of you with one of the perks, so we can highlight and brag on our contributors. Our entire camp would like to thank you in advance.
What We Need & What You Get 
We need a minimum of $25,000 to ensure season one is productive. The primary objective is to be syndicated by a nationally acclaimed network. If not, the secondary notion will be to establish a major presence on the web, producing commercials, and place client products throughout episodes as a means to establish financial independence to pay all of the personnel involved in the production. With your contributions,  you can receive a range of nice gifts and opportunities ranging from an autographed romance novel titled Retraced, written and autographed by Anthony Cuffie to autograph posters. You may also receive t-shirts highlighting the web series' poster, series credit,  plaques, and more.Retraced (fiction novel) by Anthony CuffieThe CreatorExecutive Producer/Writer/Director/EditorAfter completing his first novel in 2004, Anthony Cuffie received major acclaim and was featured in the national magazine 'Rolling Out,' along with his music partner, Wilmonie Page. The two produced an accompanying soulful soundtrack. The soundtrack was produced to give readers a movie experience through literature and music, because making movies was always his end goal. His friend, a former member of Puff Daddy's Bad Boy regime, Loon, advised him to forget the traditional means of entering the film industry and to just write and produce his own movie in spite of limited funds. It was this advice that led him to complete feature and short films on micro budgets in 2009 and 2010, which unfortunately fostered many roadblocks. Cuffie is a self taught artist who graduated in Business from Ferris State University, later completed the Dov S-S Simens Film School and Detroit Film Center to polish his filmmaking skills. Since his inception into the world of movies, he's worked on many movie sets, and local productions. Cuffie has recently been interviewed for his first drama series title Prey, which is gaining national attention. He currently has several productions in pre-production, preparing for his next move in becoming a nationally acclaimed filmmaker. PRODUCERS:MARVIN MUHAMMAD (Producer and Co-Writer)..began his writing career in 2001 as a songwriter for a local Detroit Music Production team called “The Foes” along with Lorenzo “Lowekey” Woods and Joshua Woods AKA Ashton Woods of Get Right Recording Studio. As a producer and songwriter, Marvin collaborated and worked with numerous local rappers, singers, and musicians from Hip-Hop, R& B, Neo-Soul, Jazz and more. Some of his most intriguing song productions were recorded with local Detroit Neo-Soul and R&B artist Wilmonie, Hip-hop duo Ken Lowe “Cardier” and Cassanova and also Hip-Hop solo artist OMB with whom they formed the short lived rap duo “Grumpy Old Men”. In 2010, Marvin left the music scene and entered the film and television field. He then joined forces with the renowned author and director Anthony Cuffie as co-writer of a short film called “Five Loaves of Bread”. After completion of their first film, they both began working on separate projects. In 2016, they rejoined forces again to work on Anthony Cuffie’s web series project that is currently appearing on You-Tube called Prey. Marvin serves as co-writer and co-producer of Prey.Arthur Cartwright is an actor and producer, known for roles in Gran Torino (2008), Vanishing on 7th Street (2010) and Scars (2015). Darrin Christopher Cuffie, affectionately called ""CC"", was raised in the capital of the ""Motown Sound"" Detroit, MI.  In the early part of January 2002 he embarked on forming his own production company called BeatHouse Music Group. Fate, destiny or whatever you would like to call it came knocking and he began to pursue music as a passion. To date he has toured as one of the lead singers for the national award winning Gospel group Brent Jones & TP Mobb. He has sang and performed on various stages from the BET Live stage with the MObb to the Tonight Show with various national recording acts such as Enrique Iglesias, Coolio and others.With Cuffie's growing desire to learn more about our political system due to systemic issues that are perpetual within urban areas all over America, it prompted him to want to write about the particulars like who benefited? Why? Conspiracy theories were ignited and became the seed for him to write a series concerning those very issues, thus the birth of PREY, this exciting new drama series. Even if you can't squeeze a few pennies for a donation, you can still help us spread the word!

<h3><i>Short Summary</i></h3>
<p><strong>""You're Doing Great!""</strong> is a dramatization of the events surrounding the death of Sharon Spell's parents. It evolved from being a one-person live show to writing a fully realized pilot. Earlier this year, Sharon and her producing team took the next step by filming pages from the pilot to turn into a sizzle reel for pitching to networks and media outlets.</p>
<p><strong>What does ""You're Doing Great!"" mean?</strong></p>
<p>While Sharon and her siblings faced their parents end of life care, they began to use this catch phrase with one another, <strong>""You're doing great!""</strong> In reality, they were not doing so great. Saying this was an ironic way to call out their misery, which made them laugh. It was that humor they shared that gave them all comfort during the most challenging of emotional times.</p>
<p>This is a personal story that a lot of people can relate to: feelings of not fitting in, dreams deferred, personal loss and grief. But no matter what, always know that You're Doing Great!</p>

If we don't reach our entire goal, the funding collected will be put toward the total costs. Every little bit helps.

 

The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:
In early 2019 I began this project- from writing the spec script to sourcing cast and finally through filming and post-production. While I have invested several thousand dollars into this project, your contribution will get us over the finish-line. Film making is a multi-step process and we have completed two thirds of this project in pre-production and filming. What is left is the post-production and launch of the sizzle reel onto the main stage.  This funding will offset the additional out-of-pocket costs and, more importantly, create the ability to fine-tune the details- for example, color correcting, sound mixing, number of edits and the number of festivals we can submit to.  

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk is funding comes short and we are not able to properly execute the finishing of this project.  While we have begun the editing process, we would have to cut out some steps to the reel.

<h3>What is Conrad?</h3>
<p>The judicial system is damaged. The incarceration rate has skyrocketed astronomically in the past four decades, while women still fight for equal pay. The perception of ""fairness"" is skewed and often based on money or political power - many times not based on skill, generally discrediting women based on gender has led to the pay gap and political disadvantage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493176411/y1f3r1nzsjtv0dnvw0li.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Told from a raw standpoint, this is a television pilot is seen from the perspective of Katy Conrad, daughter of late detective Michael Conrad of River Oaks Police Department. </p>
<p>Katy finds herself struggling in a fight with the judicial system to prove her father's case, in a male dominant police department, making waves little by little, becoming a symbol for Women Empowerment. </p>
<p>The reason behind Michael's death becomes the centerfold of an emotional dark journey of whether or not the former Chief was killed or if, in fact, his death was a suicide. However, during her investigation, Katy begins to discover some unknown truths about herself and what really happened in her past.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are almost done with our pilot but there is so much more to do. </p>
<p>Funding is crucial and in the long run can make or break the production which is why we are asking, YOU, the consumer, to help us out on the unique story of Woman empowerment.  With your donations we have some exciting perks that you are able to win.  Some of these perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shirts and hats for the entire family!</li>
<li>Dinner with the Directors</li>
<li>MUCH MUCH MORE!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What makes ""Conrad"" different?</h3>
<p>As opposed to making 'just another crime/drama', the creative team wanted to tell the story through the eyes of our main character, Katy Conrad. During her journey, we see how gender inequalities affect the workplace, especially in a police department, where 'fairness' and 'justice' <strong>SHOULD </strong>prevail. We aim to create awareness for the gender and judicial inequalities that still exist today and are constantly in our news feeds and news papers. </p>

</div></div>","What is Conrad?
The judicial system is damaged. The incarceration rate has skyrocketed astronomically in the past four decades, while women still fight for equal pay. The perception of ""fairness"" is skewed and often based on money or political power - many times not based on skill, generally discrediting women based on gender has led to the pay gap and political disadvantage.

Told from a raw standpoint, this is a television pilot is seen from the perspective of Katy Conrad, daughter of late detective Michael Conrad of River Oaks Police Department. 
Katy finds herself struggling in a fight with the judicial system to prove her father's case, in a male dominant police department, making waves little by little, becoming a symbol for Women Empowerment. 
The reason behind Michael's death becomes the centerfold of an emotional dark journey of whether or not the former Chief was killed or if, in fact, his death was a suicide. However, during her investigation, Katy begins to discover some unknown truths about herself and what really happened in her past.


What We Need & What You Get
We are almost done with our pilot but there is so much more to do. 
Funding is crucial and in the long run can make or break the production which is why we are asking, YOU, the consumer, to help us out on the unique story of Woman empowerment.  With your donations we have some exciting perks that you are able to win.  Some of these perks include:

Shirts and hats for the entire family!
Dinner with the Directors
MUCH MUCH MORE!


What makes ""Conrad"" different?
As opposed to making 'just another crime/drama', the creative team wanted to tell the story through the eyes of our main character, Katy Conrad. During her journey, we see how gender inequalities affect the workplace, especially in a police department, where 'fairness' and 'justice' SHOULD prevail. We aim to create awareness for the gender and judicial inequalities that still exist today and are constantly in our news feeds and news papers. 








However, given the challenges described, we've created a unique story that our audience can relate to. Katy endures some difficult situations, but it pushes her character to be more relatable, and possibly more mysterious.
""Conrad"" was built from the ground up and we wanted to feature a city which is near and dear to our hearts - Chicago, because of it's reputation for being ""the working city"".

<h3>The Primary Goal</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone! My name is Ashley Parchment. I'm from Florida and I moved to Los Angeles four years ago to pursue acting and I'm still trying to get my foot in the door. Not much has happened. This can be really depressing at times.</p>
<p>I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and get proactive. We creatives can not simply wait for someone to call us in hopes of a booking. We must create our own content and practice our craft on a consistent basis. So, 2019 is the right time to start filming these short scenes.</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to invest into these weekly scenes all throughout 2019. Without you, I wouldn't be able to afford to film these scenes and they simply would not be possible to make. I truly need your support and I'm forever grateful for whatever you can donate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why $5K &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $5,000 is for a year of weekly scenes throughout 2019. The money will go towards paying the cinematographers, the editors, renting filming locations, props, etc. With your donation you will see the quality in the filming and the editing.</p>
<p>The cinematographers and editors I will work with all went to college for film. So, not only will you be entertained by the acting scenes every week but the scenes will also look polished because of your donation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The short scenes allow all the creatives on set the chance to consistently practice their craft. This gives us the chance to fine tune our skills and get better! The short scenes will also be used as reel footage for the creatives.</p>
<p>A strong scene in a reel can lead to better representation or lead to one booking a job. Plus, with this going online it may help grow our exposure. Maybe a casting director or agent loves one of the scenes and calls one of the creatives into an audition!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>This was challenging to make happen because in the beginning of 2018 I didn't have a team to make this happen. So, I was just going to do the scenes with one friend every week using my iPhone. It would have gotten boring very fast. Plus, the filming and editing would've been done by me, which I have no experience in those fields, so it would've looked very rough.</p>
<p>It is still a challenge since I have to coordinate everyone's schedules, choose locations, rehearse multiple times before filming, buy everyone lunch, choose wardrobe, create a shot list, etc. With your donation you will allow the planning/filming process to go much smoother and literally make these scenes come to life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate at this time (trust me, I'm a struggling actor) I get it. You can help by subscribing to my YouTube channel. My goal is to have 1,000 subscribers. I currently have 85. Also feel free to share this campaign with your friends and family who can donate.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Peter Navy Tuiasosopo. I am proud to introduce to you a new television series that my team and I working hard to develop and produce called, SOUTH PACIFIC STYLE with (myself) Peter Navy Tuiasosopo as your host.</p>
<p>Our plan is to take you on an adventure through the Pacific Islands which are ripe with history and bold adventure. We’ll take you from island to island, as we explore together all the magical wonders and island attractions that make these special places so pure and untouched. Imagine visiting islands like Tonga, Tahiti, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, American Samoa and New Zealand; not only to experience their gorgeous colorful reefs, turquoise lagoons, and Gin-clear water. But having an opportunity to learn and appreciate their wide range of cultures, heritages, beliefs, customs, histories, traditions, and so much more that have developed their islands into some of the most beautiful exotic places in the world.</p>
<p>So, in the great tradition of popular television series’ like Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, Anthony Bourdain’s: No Reservation, and Expedition Unknown with Josh Gates. We believe that South Pacific Style will bring a fresh added dimension to cultural shows.</p>
<p>That’s why we have come to you for help in raising the appropriate funds to cover the costs of producing the pilot episode As a thank you, we are offering some exciting perks to all our contributors, including a sneak peek at the pilot episode and South Pacific Style branded merchandise.</p>
<p>We don’t take this opportunity lightly at all. Every contribution counts and we are so very humbled and grateful in advance for your participation. So, I hope you will join us in this new adventure throughout the Pacific Islands with me, your host, Peter Navy Tuiasosopo. Thank you all for taking the time to watch our video, and for your participation. God bless.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking 10K to assist in filming Peter interviewing on location and editing the content for the pilot as well as promoting it. The goal of the pilot is to pitch the series to potential producers and sponsors to can make South Pacific Style into a episodic TV or web series.</li>
<li>We're excited to show you the perks that we've created for you if you decide to help us with our goal. Clothing with our series logo as well as producer credits.</li>
<li>If we aren't able to reach our projected goal, the funds collected are to be used to continue our digital marketing campaign through social hubs, website and help our development team build our pilot presentation.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peter has been fortunate to pull together an amazing team that have been dedicated to serving the Pacific communities in worthy causes,  and working with organizations as businesses.</li>
<li>People only see the tourist side of many of the Pacific cultures. The purpose of this series is to provide educational content and to promote the indigenous cultures and people of Oceania.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>A major hurdle for this project is travel. The Pacific is vast and to send a skeleton crew to a remote location for the pilot is not cheap.

<p>Hi! My name is Jaime Luna, and I'm the creator of Music Schitty.<br/>What is Music Schitty?<br/>Well, it's the amazing team of writers, actors, musicians, and people crazy enough to dedicate themselves to working on Nashville's newest sketch comedy group, ""Live from Music Schitty"",<br/> AND a podcast, ""Music Schitty"" <br/><br/><i>The Podcast ""Music Schitty""</i><br/>Our slogan is ""To Normalize the Abnormal"". We want to uncover the overseen parts of the Nashville community. I'm talking from immigration, to music, to film, from old Nashville to new Nashville. There's multiple underground scenes waiting for their story to be told. <br/><br/><br/><i>""Live from Music Schitty""</i><br/>Our goal is to revive the soul of 80's SNL, with re-occurring characters, crazy off the wall antics, and finding new local talent. Take that and mix in some of poignancy and thought-provoking elements to help show what is really going on in our world today. Who knows? Maybe throw in a couple of laughs here or there. <br/><br/><strong>What We Need</strong> <strong>&amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>OUR GOAL:<br/>By early 2020, release weekly content via YouTube and our Patreon for a 14 episode season that leads up to a live sketch comedy event followed by a hand picked music show from Nashville's own talent. <br/><br/>The team has been putting their blood, sweat, tears, and even some of their wallets to help fund what we've got so far, but WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THE REST HAPPEN. There's been tons of people that have helped us out for peanuts and pennies, and we are eternally grateful, but to make an entire season, we've got to feed some people, shake hands, kiss babies, and on top of all that, pay them for the hard work they've been putting in! <br/><br/>Now $10,000 may sound like a lot, but with all the amazing ventures and concepts we'd like to explore, we're still going to have to pinch pennies. A lot of our staff will still have to work for free and even throw in some of their own resources, BUT we can at least pay the people that are helping our dream become a reality. <br/><br/>With $10,000 we can pay for:<br/>-Studio Time to record the Podcast<br/>-Paying Cast and Crew for filming <br/>-Paying the Editing Team for the hours upon hours of content we're going to be throwing at them<br/>-Feeding the Cast and Crew<br/>-Merch</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>The last thing I want anyone to think about our project is that it is a one-time product. Our goal is to use this crowdfunding, to make content, to get the ad revenue, to be able to make more content, and, from there, either go solo and independent or even pitch this to networks. <br/><br/>I don't want to say we're a business, because that makes it sound like we don't care about the jokes we make or the stories we tell. What I do want to say is that when you donate money to this project, it is not money you're just giving to a product. It's not just money ending up in a one time campaign. It's you investing in us. Investing in us to make jobs and careers out of what we love to do. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've been writing stories for about 11 years now, acted for about a year now, directed my first short film earlier this year, lead two writer's room, started recording a podcast, audio production for 3 years, amateur visual artist for 10 years, and I've learned one major thing:<br/><br/><i>The Entertainment business is a risky business.</i><br/><br/>That's why I can't do it alone. That's why I have spent so much time finding the right people to help me develop this concept. I've got an amazing group of friends and family that have, can, and will help me showcase all that we have to offer.  <br/><br/>We've been really under the radar because we don't want to start the hype without having anything to hype it up, but I assure you, we have been heavy underway in pre-production for episodes on the podcasts and scripts for sketches (we're currently at sketch #15!!!).<br/><br/><i>So what's our biggest hurdle?</i><br/><br/>Getting the money to get the production started!<br/><br/>Pssst.<br/><br/>*whispering*<br/>hey. you.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How did “City of Strangers” come to be?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>from Writer &amp; Director Kaitlin Obien</i></p>
<p>Early 2020, COVID-19 hit New York City. The quarantine felt suffocating. It was the first time that I actually sat down with my thoughts. Was I mad? Was I thankful for the time where I could be by myself and actually think? Wasn’t sure about either of these. On Easter Sunday at midnight, I decided to re-watch a showcase that I did at my conservatory. The story was centered around a girl who met a boy on the subway, losing each other, and then finding each other at the end. I always used to go into rehearsal thinking of all the stories of the people on the subway. I sat up in my apartment and thought “What better time to write this, then now?”</p>
<p>That night I had written the first draft of the pilot. By the end of the week, I had finished 5 episodes. The next week, I had the first draft of the entire first season. </p>
<p>During this writing time, I called a bunch of my friends to just read the script outloud, to help with my writing, and it completely changed the game for me- I needed this to come to life.</p>
<p>This story hasn’t just been “something to do” over quarantine, but has been a sense of healing for the actors and my team. To go through quarantine and create art in a different way was a big adjustment for us. </p>
<p>I wrote about underdogs, because that’s who we mostly are. Constantly trying to climb uphill. I want you to watch this and find yourself, root for yourself, feel uncomfortable and have those conversations. This story is about you. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Master Plan</h3>
<p>This is a 30 minute drama made for a streaming platform. The Pilot is the first one that we need to get on it’s feet so we can keep going! We’re roughly looking at a week shoot for the Pilot in New York City early Spring 2021. Post production (music, editing, sound, coloring, etc.) will be done early summer 2021 and premiering Mid-Late Summer 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our “City of Strangers” Vision</h3>
<p>Central park, used books, live jazz music playing so loud that it echoes through the trees, young summer lovers dancing in Bethesda terrace like no one else is there, the golden glow of the lanterns going on one by one as the sun sets… that’s the vision of this story. I want you to feel the nostalgia of young love, the busyness and also the stillness of New York City.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where will your money be going?</h3>
<p>Every dollar will go to the making of the Pilot and will faithfully be used to make this the best Pilot possible.</p>
<p>Talented cast and crew generally come at a price (although, our cast and crew genuinely believe in this and have kindly agreed to work for pennies on the dollar.)  However, even artists still need to eat.  Set design, audio and video equipment, transportation, office supplies, etc. all add up. </p>
<p>Funds raised above and beyond our target will assist in creating more episodes- hopefully to the end of season 1 -- you really don’t want us to end mid season and you never finding out what happens! Gotta give the audience what they want!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When I met Clare Solly on Zoom, I knew we had to collaborate. She said, ""I'm really only interested in making something about body image."" As a newly out non-binary femme tomboy going through menopause, I knew the universe was talking to me through her. ""Great,"" I said. ""Perfect.""</p>
<p>And so <i>Assigned Female at Birth</i> was born. I posted calls on Facebook to get volunteers for interviews. Little did I know how listening to 32 people-black, brown, trans, non-binary, disabled people, cis women, mothers, daughters, siblings-would change my life. I found out how deeply I needed to grow and how much we all have to learn from the communities whose members have been forced by discrimination to unpack their lives and relationships to their bodies in ways the rest of us haven't imagined.</p>
<p>I truly feel that everything I have done as an activist and an artist is being used in the making of this project. My commitment to stories as meaning, my passion for inclusion, my loneliness as a triple minority outsider, my career in devised theater--which has always involved being a conduit for lives I haven't lived as well as those I have--are all crucial to the building of this project.</p>
<p>And it's amazing to come to understand how a self-loving agender trans man can awaken the people around zir to profound discomfort and love. To see a black lesbian who has just lost her mother try to find a way back to the proud black trans man she loves. To hear the story of a mother raising adopted children who struggle.</p>
<p>And because of the pandemic, this project will be done on line, filmed on Zoom and smart phones, edited and then put up on YouTube. It is an international project to be offered free to viewers. If you want to change the world, this is the project to back. We will reach people in every country. We will say what the interviewees taught me--that our bodies are wise and valuable, wounded and healing, and that we must learn to love our own bodies if we are to love each other. We must step outside the accepted cultural tropes and claim every body as worthwhile.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our commitment is to respecting artists, and to this end we offered union contracts to all the actors, which double our budget. What you contribute will go to paying union wages, as well as paying stipends to interviewees, and salaries, to tech experts, directors and crew. We have also bought equipment and sent it to people around the country. Our next biggest expense is marketing of this free series--we want to reach as many people as possible. We recognize that the communities we represent deeply need to be mirrored in order to be welcomed and seen.</p>
<p>The perks we've created are all about involvement. The project is about connection and creativity while we're all more isolated than we've ever been...we don't want gimmicks. We want your heart and we want to include you.</p>
<p>So please do give, do support, do spread the word. We can't do this without you, and we can't make art or change the world without each other.</p>

<h3>WHERE ARE WE? </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532118553/rnzqnu9j6dcyiqdgro0s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE SKINNY</h3>
<p>We are Studio Mudprints, and we're known around the globe for <i>Bullet Heaven</i>, the world's longest-running review show, all about shmups. For almost 10 years, we've been reviewing them with in-depth coverage that has no rival. Shooters for the Sega Dreamcast have always been oft-requested as the platform has quite a decent number of quality - and even legendary - titles. </p>
<p><i>Studio Mudprints' GameQuest: The Sega Dreamquest</i> aims to be the most concise, in-depth and definitive series dedicated to the complete library of Sega Dreamcast shmups. Combined with our lengthy expertise, <i>Bullet Heaven</i> and excellent production values, there will be no better resource for <i>Sega Dreamcast</i> shoot-em-ups, and you can be a part of it! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT'S NEEDED AND WHAT'S UP FOR GRABS</h3>
<p><strong>Here's what the <i>Sega Dreamquest</i> needs: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Funding for better lighting and/or camera equipment (PRIMARY)</li>
<li>Core funding for our remaining Dreamcast library acquisition (SECONDARY)</li>
<li>Funding for high-quality reward production and title variants (STRETCH)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you get in return? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Credit in every produced video the series will ever see. </li>
<li>Tiered rewards. </li>
<li>The satisfaction that you were able to help make this amazing production a reality! </li>
<li>Better perks with full and stretch funding; If 100% of the main goal is met, the digital <i>Dreamquest</i> original soundtrack becomes a physical one and is rewarded to $25+ backers! A physical book can be produced at 200%+ funding. Even DVDs are a possibility... with a high enough stretch! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But what if we don't make it the whole way to our goal? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not to worry; this flexible campaign will see 100% of the contributions received going directly into this project and nowhere else.</li>
<li>Want rewards? You'll still get them! (Keeping in mind that they will be main campaign rewards; no physical upgrades from digital.) </li>
<li>We are ultimately dedicated to producing this series; it may take longer but it <i>will </i>be completed! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE DREAMQUEST IMPACT</h3>
<p>The <i>Sega Dreamquest</i> is more than just a guy showing off a bunch games; we know there are thousands, even millions of people that make videos like that already and we're no exception; our first <i>GameQuest</i> chronicled PSP shooters and while we were successful, it was costlier and less structured than we would have liked.

THE SKINNY
We are Studio Mudprints, and we're known around the globe for Bullet Heaven, the world's longest-running review show, all about shmups. For almost 10 years, we've been reviewing them with in-depth coverage that has no rival. Shooters for the Sega Dreamcast have always been oft-requested as the platform has quite a decent number of quality - and even legendary - titles. 
Studio Mudprints' GameQuest: The Sega Dreamquest aims to be the most concise, in-depth and definitive series dedicated to the complete library of Sega Dreamcast shmups. Combined with our lengthy expertise, Bullet Heaven and excellent production values, there will be no better resource for Sega Dreamcast shoot-em-ups, and you can be a part of it! 

WHAT'S NEEDED AND WHAT'S UP FOR GRABS
Here's what the Sega Dreamquest needs: 

Funding for better lighting and/or camera equipment (PRIMARY)
Core funding for our remaining Dreamcast library acquisition (SECONDARY)
Funding for high-quality reward production and title variants (STRETCH)

What do you get in return? 

Credit in every produced video the series will ever see. 
Tiered rewards. 
The satisfaction that you were able to help make this amazing production a reality! 
Better perks with full and stretch funding; If 100% of the main goal is met, the digital Dreamquest original soundtrack becomes a physical one and is rewarded to $25+ backers! A physical book can be produced at 200%+ funding. Even DVDs are a possibility... with a high enough stretch! 

But what if we don't make it the whole way to our goal? 

Not to worry; this flexible campaign will see 100% of the contributions received going directly into this project and nowhere else.
Want rewards? You'll still get them! (Keeping in mind that they will be main campaign rewards; no physical upgrades from digital.) 
We are ultimately dedicated to producing this series; it may take longer but it will be completed! 


THE DREAMQUEST IMPACT
The Sega Dreamquest is more than just a guy showing off a bunch games; we know there are thousands, even millions of people that make videos like that already and we're no exception; our first GameQuest chronicled PSP shooters and while we were successful, it was costlier and less structured than we would have liked. We have bigger plans for our Dreamcast library though, not to mention the Dreamcast and Shooting Game community at large!
All too often, manuals and cases are overlooked in favor of a quick blurb and a few minutes of gameplay footage.  In our case, this production will become a rare, detailed look into the finer points of physical game acquisition, including case design, manual highlights and disc labels. In the case of the Japanese shooters on Dreamcast, DVD, jewelcase and OBI spinecard translations will bring this in-depth look to fantastic new heights! 

The Sega Dreamquest will be the most in-depth series of its kind. 
Extreme production value with all-new music and visuals made specifically for this series. 
A lasting, complete, high-quality Dreamcast shoot-em-up chronicle that fans old and new can reference forever. 


CHALLENGES/RISKS
Of course, there are always risks and challenges, perceived or otherwise, that might cause concern to a potential backer. Will we go over budget? How long will it take to actually get started? How ""Complete"" are we talking here?  
The challenges: 

Proving that this project is not just padding an expensive collection
Keeping cost within the limits of this funding campaign
Getting the best deal on missing titles and equipment for maximum production value
""Complete"" can mean a lot of things. 

The solutions: 

Primarily, we don't actually ""collect"" games. We have a functional library, that is regularly accessed and exhibited whether through Bullet Heaven, livestreams or events and other productions. Titles provided for review over four years ago are still being used for new productions even today! Additionally, very little of our Dreamcast library is considered ""collector grade"", though they are complete with cases, manuals and, in the case of Japanese titles, are better maintained with plastic sleeves an OBI present for each. 
Keeping the cost confined to this campaign is a non-issue, 
Getting good deals has been an integral part in keeping Bullet Heaven going as long as it has; we have excellent connections that allow us to get substantial discounts through our years of excellent patronage, fantastic contacts and publishing partners!
 We are actually trying to complete the dreamcast pantheon in three ways: Complete Japanese library, which has us feature every Japanese STG release on Dreamcast. Complete title library which could mean that if we have a Japanese version of a game, we may not need to acquire a more expensive north american version. And finally, complete Special Edition library, which has us obtain and feature every official-release Special Edition (which would not include Homebrew). However, with enough funding, we could probably still acquire all versions regardless.

The risks: 
There are no major risks to this project! Whether the whole cost is covered here or not, we are intent on finishing the job!
Overcoming adversity: 
We've already gotten a massive head start on this project and plan to finish it regardless of support. But this campaign will make it happen faster and maybe, just maybe if the funding goes into stretch, we can cover every single variant in the process and even change some digital rewards into physical ones.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>The company producing the project is tello Films and we have been producing and distributing innovative, high-quality web series for 10 years. We love strong women and don’t feel that there are enough stories about us.  It is our mission and passion to produce content the includes the wonderful spectrum of strong women that is lacking in mainstream media. </p>
<p><strong>The story of Riley Parra</strong></p>
<p>Detective Riley Parra grew up in the bad part of town, crime-ridden No Man’s Land.  Now, as a cop in a corrupt department, she strives to make sure the rough streets she left behind aren’t forgotten. She takes the cases that would otherwise be ignored or left unsolved because<br/>no one cared enough to dig deeper.  In season 1, a case leads her to the discovery that No Man’s Land is a battleground between angels and demons, a supernatural war that’s been waged for centuries.  Thrown into a world she never believed could exist, Riley chooses to accept the title of Champion for Good.  Demons are real and Riley Parra plans to give them hell.  In season 2 we continue to look at the relationship between Riley and Gillian and meet Riley's new partner Caitlin Priest. </p>
<p>Season 1 was tello's first foray into producing a sci-fi/fantasy/thriller and this genre is one of Director Christin Baker's favorite, and so we want to do it the right way.  That means that we have to go a little bit out of our budget range.  We actually didn't have quite enough funds to do the special effects.  We feel our story, acting and lighting are AMAZING but we don't have the funds for great special effects.  That's why our goal is higher and we have even more awesome Guest Stars! </p>
<p>Last year we raised $14,000 from generous backers and this year we would like $20,000 (stretch goal is $30,000).  These funds will be used for sets, to hire our awesome stunt coordinator and post-production special effects.</p>
<p>We are so lucky to have the wonderful support of our Riley (Marem Hassler) and other leads including Liz Vassey, Maeve Quinlan, and Karl E. Landler and they have offered to do some really wonderful perks for those supporting this series.   We also have Tony Amendola (Stargate, Once Upon a Time) and Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi from Star Trek: TNG) coming for Season 2! </p>
<p>The producers and director on this project are women and the lead is a woman and we like to add to the great storytelling landscape supporting women filmmakers.  Your contribution will help elevate their work and passion.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here's the deal.  When I was a teenager, I knew EXACTLY what my future work life would be.  I was going to write, direct, and star in movies.  I knew it.  Knew it in the same way that I knew how to breathe.  And by the time I was in my 20s, I was already off the path.  My diversion started with doing theater (which is great and wonderful and all that, but not my fate or my passion).  I wandered aimlessly through this and that--I've had over 50 jobs in my life--until I wound up 35 years later working as an admin at a college.  Which is a long way from being the next Orson Welles.  Or even the next Jules White, the director of most of the Three  Stooges' estimable body of work.</p>
<p>But now I'm over that.  I'm back to the path.  Writing, directing, and starring in cinematic projects.  Okay, web series instead of feature films, but the same skill set.  And the things that we used to quaintly call ""TV shows"" are etched even deeper in my DNA than movies are.  And it is all the same process, the same aesthetic, the same art.</p>
<p>I did make a couple of very brief films six or seven years ago, <a href=""https://youtu.be/Y40-soxEaLc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Afternoon Game</a> and <a href=""https://youtu.be/MzNQmdNf-Oc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wendell, Friday Evening</a>, which are the two most successful independent projects I've done.  (I've also written and published a novel, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Michael-Drayton-Detective-Guy-Cassamas-ebook/dp/B00DZVMCNE/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541170057&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=Cassamas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Drayton, Detective Guy</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Looking-Christmas-Len-Cassamas-ebook/dp/B009OM3UAM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1541170057&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=Cassamas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">book</a> and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/len-cassamas/looking-for-christmas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">audioplay</a> versions of Looking for Christmas.) . Now, the time has come to pursue the real thing.</p>
<p>I am looking to fund two projects.  ""Commercial Films"" is a four part mini web series destined for YouTube.  Each episode will comprise two parody commercials, one featuring a longstanding character of mine, Rudy Value, and a second parody of commercials for things ranging from pharmaceuticals to jewelry stores.  ""Looking for Christmas""  will come out as a five-episode series, also on YouTube.   It is a set of tales concerning three 20-somethings who drive around looking at Christmas displays that also tells stories that occur inside the places they encounter along their journey.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's much easier now than ever before to make something good as an independent, but let me tell you, money helps!</p>
<p>We need props, costumes, locations, and meals for cast and crew.  Being able to buy quality wireless mic packs would be invaluable.  And being able give the participants a stipend for their hard work wouldn't be a bad thing either.  (And let me be clear, when it comes to getting a stipend or salary, I am last on the list.  In fact, I'm so far down the list that I'm not actually on it at all.)  Every cent raised--whether we reach our goal or not--will go to making the production of these two projects a reality and will enable us to create the best shows possible.  We can also, then, afford entry fees for films festivals (many of which now feature web series categories).</p>
<p>Besides the satisfactions and warm feelings that come from being a patron of the arts, we are also offering a slate of premiums.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All contributors, at any amount, will receive a credit at the end of each episode of both series.  You can show it to your friends, pause it on the title card featuring you, and point to it, just like you were one of the Rockefellers or somebody who gets their name on the outside of a hospital.</li>
<li>Contributors of $10 or more will receive a handwritten, individualized thank you note written on official Next in the Series stationery, even if I have to scan it and email it to you.</li>
<li>For $25, contributors will receive the above premiums as well as a still from the production taken by an actual professional photographer.</li>
<li>Those who give at least $50, get the credit, the thank you note, and a production still autographed by me, Len Cassamas, and any other cast members who are shown  in the still.</li>
<li>$75 contributions earn all of the above and will receive a pair of matching Christmas ornaments straight from the sets of both ""Looking for Christmas"" and episode 3 of ""Commercial Films.""</li>
<li>Anyone who contributes at least $100 will get all of the above and the chance to submit a photo of themselves or a loved one (sorry, no photos of famous or controversial figures allowed) to be placed on the set of an episode of ""Looking for Christmas.""</li>
<li>Anyone who gives $500 or more will get a credit on each episode of both productions as a producer, as well as all of the premiums described above.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Now, we may not make our goals, but the show will go on.  We already have a quality SLR camera (Canon EOS 70D) and some lighting equipment, as well as professional quality audio equipment and audio and video editing software.  We have the support of talented actors who have already agreed to participate.  We can do this.  Funding will make it easier for us to produce a quality product, but we will come out with two professional-quality web series regardless.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There's more to life than money, of course, and you can help us by getting the word out, keeping an eye on our progress, and sending us all the best vibes you can, even if you have to look in the back of a closet or in the pantry next to the wax beans in order to find them.  And, frankly, I will take the help of any person with a flair for PR with or without a contribution.  And if you have your own ideas for how you can pitch in, please let me know!  We need you!</p>

<h3>About <i>Soully For You</i>
</h3>

A nearby listener encouraged us to make a film, behold <i>Soully For You</i> was born. This film series has the potential to change the industry of film and art. We haven’t seen many (if any at all) films that encompass authentic conversations, original music, and the lost art of poetry. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I've been a game show nut my whole life. Back in the 80's, the best part of being sick on a school day (other than missing school) was getting to watch ""$25,000 Pyramid,"" ""Scrabble,"" and ""The Price Is Right.""  I dreamed of winning cash, fabulous prizes, and even lovely parting gifts.</p>
<p>When I moved to California in my early 20s, I found my way onto ""The Dating Game."" The young lady wisely chose Bachelor #2 over me, but my life changed that day. I was pretty good at this game show thing, and I would be back on another show. Here we are years and years later, and I've been a game show contestant 16 times! </p>
<p>I won money, I won trips. I shook Chuck Woolery's hand.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I realized that as much as I love being a contestant on game shows, the place where I <i>really </i>belong is behind the podium, asking the questions.</p>
<p>Neither Pat Sajak nor Alex Trebek returned my voicemails asking for their jobs, so I knew I had to create my own show. I combined my love for trivia with my tolerance for pain, and the idea that was born was <strong>Slapca$h</strong> - the only game show where you can slap the host, and take his cash!</p>
<p>Any size contribution you can swing will make a huge difference. You will be helping me achieve my dream, and you will also be spreading laughter. Because while I can't guarantee this show will be intelligent or artistic, I promise you it will be funny.</p>

<p>Last year we raised $600 to produce 2 episodes, Private Dicks Exposed and Private Dicks In Deep. This year, with shorter, more youtube-friendly episode lengths of 10minutes, we aim to bring you an action packed conclusion to the story we began telling now almost 4 years ago.</p>
<p>We have put so much thought and effort into developing a satisfying series finale for our fans, and what we've written is really gonna take the show up a notch. Great pacing, lots of action, emotion, shocks, and twists await as the plot thickens with each episode. It's mob vs mob as Pierce &amp; Pritchett try to expose and bring down Vincent Malikaros, ruthless underworld boss, and chaos erupts all around them.</p>
<p>Our funding challenges this year circle around locations, equipment (props/costumes), and transportation, and that is where we ask you, our fans and supporters, to help us, even just a little bit. We've got some sweet swag and posters up for grabs, and credit options towards the series, for anyone who is interested in helping us bring you our A-game this year and enjoy a series finale that actually delivers (like Breaking Bad. Not like GoT, here's looking at you)</p>
<p>Shooting thru August to November, we aim to release a new episode every 6 weeks beginning in December 2019. You may expect your purchases by December as well. For those living in Calgary and area, personal delivery is available instead of shipping. Otherwise, please contact Justin Hodge at rockymountainmotionpicture@outlook.com for a shipping quote.</p>
<p>Can't wait to bring you our very best out of our last ten episodes! Thanks for reading and for your support! It would be awesome if you'd give us a share, too, of course :)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there, this is Ben and Andrew, best friends of thirteen years, and the creators of ""Who The Eff Are These Guys?""<br/>We met in 7th grade, and became best friends quickly. Then in 9th grade, Ben came out as gay, and Andrew was the first person he told. Years later, Andrew returned the favor and came out as bisexual.</p>
<p>We have always wanted to work together, and love performing - but we felt that queer characters in general tend to fall into cliches and stereotypes. We wanted a show that represented US, and one that could come to represent all of the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>""Who The Eff Are These Guys?"" is just an episode at this point. It features versions of ourselves, dialed up to 11. However, we see so much potential for this show with your help. We want to bring in more characters that represent more people: queer people of color, trans individuals, non-binary people, drag queens/kings, and all the other amazing folk who make up the LGBT+ community. </p>
<p>With your donations, we can reach out to those creators, writers, directors, performers, etc - and get their assistance in telling the stories they deserve to tell. This community deserves better characters that represent all our stories and tell them well.</p>

<p>BLACKWATER BLUES, a Murder/Mystery Series</p>
<p>Corin Nemec is an Emmy nominated actor, writer, producer, and director with more than 100 projects under his belt across his 35 years in the Film and Television business. Corin has teamed up with long time friend and actor Jason London, also with more than 100 Film and Television credits to his name. Together, they have created this wonderful, fictional account of the sordid and criminal underworkings in a Gulf Coast town called Blackwater, not far from Biloxi, Mississippi, a town well known for gambling, big money, and short tempers.</p>
<p>Corin Nemec and Jason London are Pollux and Castor Bennington, two ex-cons who grew up around biker gangs and the notorious Gulf Coast Mafia. They are left with a series of cryptic clues as a final parting gift when their grandfather, Poppy Bennington, dies of old age. Upon finding this map to their mother, they set off on a twisted, and sometimes amusing investigation which opens up old wounds and reveals new mysteries. </p>
<p>In pre-production for the past three months, the team has been perfecting the script, hiring cast and crew, including Trent Dickens, a wonder Director who lives in the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A small, upscale coastal community snuggled between the ocean and the bayous, the real town of Ocean Springs becomes the fictional town of Blackwater, Mississippi, a town with deep secrets that stretch back decades.</p>
<p>Nemec and London are both strongly in support of the independent TV industry. BLACKWATER BLUES has not only received personal financing, but has the full support of the local community. They have successfully brought together an incredible group of talented local Mississippi filmmakers and actors. Full enthusiasm comes from the many local shop owners volunteering their storefronts, the Mayor of Ocean Springs himself, and the incredible support of the Mississippi Film Commission.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a portion of funding fell through just ahead of the scheduled principle photography start date of November 16. Now, with large personal investments already at stake, the Production team consisting of Benjamin Easterday (EV Productions, Los Angeles) as well as local co-producer Brad Jay, must seek rapid solutions. </p>
<p>With numerous funding opportunities waiting in the wings to see this dark thriller come to life, the team will develop a short introductory version consisting of key moments from the Pilot script and future episodes. This will continue the consistent momentum, and push the project over the edge into full production.</p>
<p>Shooting the Pilot Presentation is a proven model for success. Corin Nemec experienced this when he and actor David Faustino, along with Seinfeld writer/producer Sam Kass, put up their own money to shoot a presentation for a comedy series titled ""STAR-VING.” The series successfully and quickly sold to SONY TV which produced 12 episodes right away. </p>
<p>With your help, this can again be the case, delivering a proof-of-concept that is undeniable. With the full first season, as well as a five-season arc laid out, there is stellar crew ready to go, a town in full support, two known actors with decades of experience, and a storyline that will keep your head spinning from beginning to end. </p>
<p>With the incredible combined years of experience among those leveraged deeply in the project, there is a high level of certainty of the outcome of this Pilot Presentation. All that is now lacking is the final funding to provide quality production to move forward independently. It will give you, the audience, a true keyhole view into the deadly, mysterious, and often strange world of BLACKWATER BLUES.</p>
<p>The goal of this fundraiser is to allow the production and success of this short version, offering the introduction of characters, setting, cinematic style, and story in a way that will preview the series as a whole. Taking advantage of all the work that has already gone into the full project, this backing will also ensure production, on a smaller scale, within the original time frame. </p>
<p>When it comes to television and film financing and support, proof of concept is most important. Not being able to show what is hidden in the 2D pages of a screenplay adds a huge level of complexity to bringing a TV show to air. In a few short minutes, you can experience on film what to expect from the entire series; a show that will keep you guessing at every turn and have you certain that you have solved the crime when only the writers and creators know the nearly impossible to guess truth. </p>
<p>The Production Team has worked tirelessly, contributing not only personal finances, but extremely valuable time and energy. This is a chance, with your help, to help push BLACKWATER BLUES over the finish line and to fruition. It is not every day you can  tell a friend or neighbor you were instrumental in getting a television series off the ground!</p>
<p>To finance the introductory segment, with a potential running time of 10 minutes, requirements are firm. In addition to pre- and post-production days, the team anticipates a three-day shoot to include the Director, camera team, and all other filming crew. Considering editing, sound design, and SFX, a goal of $15,000 dollars is set. </p>
<p>With your support, production can continue and remain on track to deliver a condensed, introductory video (sizzle reel) shot as any professional TV show would be, helping realize full production of BLACKWATER BLUES before the end of 2020. </p>
<p>Although it would serve as a setback not taking advantage of the current enthusiasm for the project, the team is fully prepared to shoot a simpler version in the event the projected goal is not met. This shorter, more commercial style teaser will serve to introduce as many of the primary characters and locations as possible. Regardless of fundraising outcome, no amount will go to waste.</p>
<p>There will be perks for investors! These rewards will be scaled according to the level of support to include such experiences as; walk on parts, Producer credits, set visits, and/or social dinner with Jason London &amp; Corin Nemec. Other items such as autographed scripts, headshots, and TV posters will also be set aside as thank you gifts for supporters at various levels.</p>

Share this campaign with those you think would be interested, follow and amplify the official BLACKWATER BLUES social media sites, and be part of the community that will grow out of this! Indiegogo offers convenient sharing tools here to make every click count.</p>
<p>That said, with your support, the team here at BLACKWATER BLUES will help introduce the world to the ever mysterious, endlessly dangerous, and darkly secretive town of Blackwater, Mississippi. A place where two brothers (Jason London, Corin Nemec) will stop at nothing to solve the murder/disappearance of their beloved mother, and in so doing, reveal a web of corruption so deep in could go all the way to Washington, D.C.</p>

</div></div>","BLACKWATER BLUES, a Murder/Mystery Series
Corin Nemec is an Emmy nominated actor, writer, producer, and director with more than 100 projects under his belt across his 35 years in the Film and Television business. Corin has teamed up with long time friend and actor Jason London, also with more than 100 Film and Television credits to his name. Together, they have created this wonderful, fictional account of the sordid and criminal underworkings in a Gulf Coast town called Blackwater, not far from Biloxi, Mississippi, a town well known for gambling, big money, and short tempers.
Corin Nemec and Jason London are Pollux and Castor Bennington, two ex-cons who grew up around biker gangs and the notorious Gulf Coast Mafia. They are left with a series of cryptic clues as a final parting gift when their grandfather, Poppy Bennington, dies of old age. Upon finding this map to their mother, they set off on a twisted, and sometimes amusing investigation which opens up old wounds and reveals new mysteries. 
In pre-production for the past three months, the team has been perfecting the script, hiring cast and crew, including Trent Dickens, a wonder Director who lives in the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A small, upscale coastal community snuggled between the ocean and the bayous, the real town of Ocean Springs becomes the fictional town of Blackwater, Mississippi, a town with deep secrets that stretch back decades.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Rio Helmi and I are passionate visual communicators and passionate about Indonesia. Rio's a well known Indonesian cultural and social photographer, I'm a filmmaker, producer/director, and cameraman and we've come together for a project that we hope will inspire people across Indonesia and around the world. I've provided a bit more about us at the bottom and you can find out more about what we've done at <a href=""http://www.swadayafilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.swadayafilm.com</a>.</p>
<p>And if you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact us at swadayafilm@gmail.com and one of the team will get back to you.</p>
<h3>Swadaya - Our Project and Pitch</h3>
<p><i>Swadaya</i> is a 13 x 30min cultural adventure television series that will give Indonesians, and people around the world, an opportunity to explore and experience the best of Indonesia and her inspiring people, and to remember how culture and society shape the Indonesian experience.</p>
<p><i>Swadaya</i>, in Indonesian, means self-empowered. Indonesia is at a cross-roads culturally and politically and as her people look for ways forward, we hope Swadaya will help light the way...</p>
<p>For decades many outlying areas of Indonesia have been left behind in the development boom. Even on Java, Indonesia's 'central' and most populous island, local communities often struggle to make ends meet. Sometimes government programs falter for a number of reasons then disillusionment takes root, leading to a plethora of social problems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499259546/ekqpmmalzqvqpxi65tdz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Yet there is a special spirit that sometimes shows itself within these underprivileged communities: one of resilience, caring, initiative, creativity, and communal solidarity. A spirit that drives people to create long term programs that benefit their communities in positive ways within the means at their disposal.</p>
<p>And as Indonesians at all levels look towards the future, <i>Swadaya</i> will highlight people and their projects as an inspiration to everyone, at the grass roots level and beyond.</p>
<h3>Reaching the Grass Roots</h3>
<p>There are amazing stories of <i>Swadaya</i> all across Indonesia (check out our recap below) but to be effective, people everywhere have to see them right? Fortunately, Indonesia's media landscape has a secret weapon... Local TV. <i>BumiHijau Media</i> has been working with Indonesian local television stations for years and, having already distributed over 30,000 programs on environment, health, science and wildlife, has already built a massive audience of tens of millions of viewers for <i>Swadaya</i>, allowing us to launch this series to the exact audience that will get the most out of it and to inspire the very people who will make a difference to the nation.</p>
<p>Our first broadcast of <i>Swadaya</i> will take place on no less than 50 local television stations across the Indonesian archipelago from Aceh in the west to Papua in the east. Here's a map of the stations that we work with:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499228073/xhvcoqakyyypkmb6gg1z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us reach that audience, helping to inspire people to have confidence in their own ability to improve their own lot. It will also give Indonesians of all walks of life a better understanding of their hugely diverse country - contributing to greater harmony through greater appreciation of their fellow countrymen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing any television series is a huge endeavour and <i>Swadaya</i> will explore inspirational projects across Indonesia. The entire series will cost $980,000 US dollars for 13 full episodes including all production, post-production and distribution costs. Individual episodes costs vary but the average, all in, is about $76,000. We're looking for these funds in a variety of places but what we hope to do with you is jump start the process and produce the first 3 episodes. So in order to do that, we're hoping to raise $228,000 through this campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499409563/kvjy9odh5poav3bdum3s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We've got some really cool perks to offer you for partnering with us including:</p>
<p>- Signed custom Rio Helmi prints and customised copies of the <i>Swadaya</i> series</p>
<p>- Executive Producer credits and Thank-You credits in the series</p>
<p>- An opportunity to join us during the production</p>
<p>- <i>Swadaya</i> T-Shirts, Custom Engraved Glasses, and Stickers</p>
<p>- VIP screening passes and dinners with the producers</p>
<p>- And the possibility for equity partnerships</p>
<p>We've laid out the incentives on the perks column on the right but, the most important component in all this is you! We want you to be a part of this series and this project. We want you to be part of the inspiration. We want you to help light the way forward bringing <i>Swadaya</i> to Indonesia and the world.</p>
<h3>And if we don't get the funds we need?</h3>
<p>That's an important question. Look, we're super motivated to make this series. As soon as we have the funding to complete the first episode, we'll start working. For those of you who have known us a long time, you know how hard we work. And we wouldn't go down this road and be seeking your support if we weren't 120% motivated to make Swadaya a reality. We've opted to keep this campaign going once we've reached our initial goal so that you can continue be a part of the entire process with us.</p>
<h3>The Stories</h3>
<p>Rio and I are all about story telling. And here's a short list of inspirational <i>Swadaya</i> stories that we want to bring to the screen:</p>
<p><strong>Bamboo Heroes of Bali: </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499261264/piunzcgucoyja9tqbv6w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p><strong>Motorcycle Gangs and Midwives of Flores:</strong></p>
<p>A family crisis in a remote village motivates a motorcycle gang leader to organise transport for midwives and to teach appropriate technology high in the rugged mountains of Flores.</p>

<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499261481/hejmsnclmb7mztmxqsl2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As you look over the stories above, you can imagine how people all across Indonesia, and everywhere, would be touched and inspired by people doing great things under challenging conditions. We, as humans, support each other, inspire each other, and all hope for a better life for our children and their children. And that's what <i>Swadaya</i> is all about. And getting <i>Swadaya</i> out first through Local TV and online, will give the maximum amount of people the opportunity to see it and be inspired themselves.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Rio has been photographing and writing stories across Indonesia for over 30 years. And my company and I have worked on scores of international and domestic documentary film and television projects over the past few decades. Together, our 50+ years of experience in our creative works and in Indonesia are what's going to make <i>Swadaya</i> a series we can all be proud of and rally around.</p>
<p>I'll be in charge of managing the productions and I've got the awesome team at Jungle Run backing me up. I'll also be responsible for getting <i>Swadaya</i> broadcast through BumiHijau Media's Local TV Partner Network and our team in Jakarta. Rio has been following many of these stories for years and, like you'll see in some of the clips below, has an amazing rapport with the people which will bring <i>Swadaya</i> to life.</p>
<h3>Let's Make Noise!!!</h3>
<p>This project could never happen without you. So please help us to get the word out far and wide! Together we have an opportunity to help people across Indonesia while producing a series that people everywhere will enjoy. </p>
<p>Indiegogo can help as well, check out their share tools!</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Rio Helmi and I are passionate visual communicators and passionate about Indonesia. Rio's a well known Indonesian cultural and social photographer, I'm a filmmaker, producer/director, and cameraman and we've come together for a project that we hope will inspire people across Indonesia and around the world. I've provided a bit more about us at the bottom and you can find out more about what we've done at www.swadayafilm.com.
And if you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact us at swadayafilm@gmail.com and one of the team will get back to you.
Swadaya - Our Project and Pitch
Swadaya is a 13 x 30min cultural adventure television series that will give Indonesians, and people around the world, an opportunity to explore and experience the best of Indonesia and her inspiring people, and to remember how culture and society shape the Indonesian experience.
Swadaya, in Indonesian, means self-empowered. Indonesia is at a cross-roads culturally and politically and as her people look for ways forward, we hope Swadaya will help light the way...
For decades many outlying areas of Indonesia have been left behind in the development boom. Even on Java, Indonesia's 'central' and most populous island, local communities often struggle to make ends meet. Sometimes government programs falter for a number of reasons then disillusionment takes root, leading to a plethora of social problems.

Yet there is a special spirit that sometimes shows itself within these underprivileged communities: one of resilience, caring, initiative, creativity, and communal solidarity. A spirit that drives people to create long term programs that benefit their communities in positive ways within the means at their disposal.
And as Indonesians at all levels look towards the future, Swadaya will highlight people and their projects as an inspiration to everyone, at the grass roots level and beyond.
Reaching the Grass Roots
There are amazing stories of Swadaya all across Indonesia (check out our recap below) but to be effective, people everywhere have to see them right? Fortunately, Indonesia's media landscape has a secret weapon... Local TV. BumiHijau Media has been working with Indonesian local television stations for years and, having already distributed over 30,000 programs on environment, health, science and wildlife, has already built a massive audience of tens of millions of viewers for Swadaya, allowing us to launch this series to the exact audience that will get the most out of it and to inspire the very people who will make a difference to the nation.
Our first broadcast of Swadaya will take place on no less than 50 local television stations across the Indonesian archipelago from Aceh in the west to Papua in the east. Here's a map of the stations that we work with:

Your contribution will help us reach that audience, helping to inspire people to have confidence in their own ability to improve their own lot. It will also give Indonesians of all walks of life a better understanding of their hugely diverse country - contributing to greater harmony through greater appreciation of their fellow countrymen.

What We Need & What You Get
Producing any television series is a huge endeavour and Swadaya will explore inspirational projects across Indonesia. The entire series will cost $980,000 US dollars for 13 full episodes including all production, post-production and distribution costs. Individual episodes costs vary but the average, all in, is about $76,000. We're looking for these funds in a variety of places but what we hope to do with you is jump start the process and produce the first 3 episodes. So in order to do that, we're hoping to raise $228,000 through this campaign.

We've got some really cool perks to offer you for partnering with us including:
- Signed custom Rio Helmi prints and customised copies of the Swadaya series
- Executive Producer credits and Thank-You credits in the series
- An opportunity to join us during the production
- Swadaya T-Shirts, Custom Engraved Glasses, and Stickers
- VIP screening passes and dinners with the producers
- And the possibility for equity partnerships
We've laid out the incentives on the perks column on the right but, the most important component in all this is you! We want you to be a part of this series and this project. We want you to be part of the inspiration. We want you to help light the way forward bringing Swadaya to Indonesia and the world.
And if we don't get the funds we need?
That's an important question. Look, we're super motivated to make this series. As soon as we have the funding to complete the first episode, we'll start working. For those of you who have known us a long time, you know how hard we work. And we wouldn't go down this road and be seeking your support if we weren't 120% motivated to make Swadaya a reality. We've opted to keep this campaign going once we've reached our initial goal so that you can continue be a part of the entire process with us.
The Stories
Rio and I are all about story telling. And here's a short list of inspirational Swadaya stories that we want to bring to the screen:
Bamboo Heroes of Bali: 

On the slopes of the Kintamani Volcano, a Balinese entrepreneur inspires villages to plant, harvest and sell bamboo - building their livelihoods and preserving their soil.
Motorcycle Gangs and Midwives of Flores:
A family crisis in a remote village motivates a motorcycle gang leader to organise transport for midwives and to teach appropriate technology high in the rugged mountains of Flores.
The Whale Shark Whisperer of Papua:
On a remote coast in West Papua, the people rally around a whale shark whisperer and build fish and lobster aquaculture farms to support their village.
A School for a Village Time Forgot in Lombok:
In a steep valley in Lombok a woman, for whom education was never possible, pulls her village together to build a school so their brightest girls and boys have a chance to succeed.
Small Scale Palm Oil Champions of Riau:
Surrounded by massive commercial palm oil plantations, a group of farmers come together to train as sustainable small-scale growers benefiting their families are preserving their lands.
An Eco-Education School in West Papua:
Far from any public services the tiny village of Malagufuk rallies together and shifts from hunting to eco-tourism bringing international visitors, health care and education.
The Forest Keepers of West Kalimantan:
In West Kalimantan a group of Dayak hunters serve as the guardians of the forest, preserving their way of life and the plants and animals that make up the landscape.
Goat Milk Entrepreneurs of East Java:

The son of an indentured labourer goes to university but, rather than follow his peers into the city, he returns home and develops a small business that inspires and empowers his village.
The Farmer SMS Network of East Kalimantan:
Lack of communications has led to rampant destruction in East Kalimantan but a new SMS network has led to fair trade, regular flow of news, and protection of traditional lands.
The Fisherman and the Tree Farm in East Java:

An outsider rallies fellow fishermen to plant pine trees along the coast preserving fish hatcheries and preventing erosion with the unplanned benefit of developing local tourism.
Making it Green in Aceh:
A former rebel rises and falls to get back up again and stake his entire career on making one of Indonesia’s most militant provinces an example for green economy.
Local Cocoa Farmers to the World in Sulawesi:
Cocoa farmers who’s crops have been ravaged by disease come together and rehabilitate their farms and build a network of direct links to market at the same time.
An Island of Appropriate Technology
The people of Kai have lived on the edge for centuries. But now a women’s co-op sources appropriate technologies bringing their village to the 20th century and benefiting their lives.
 
The Impact
As you look over the stories above, you can imagine how people all across Indonesia, and everywhere, would be touched and inspired by people doing great things under challenging conditions. We, as humans, support each other, inspire each other, and all hope for a better life for our children and their children. And that's what Swadaya is all about. And getting Swadaya out first through Local TV and online, will give the maximum amount of people the opportunity to see it and be inspired themselves.
Moving Forward
Rio has been photographing and writing stories across Indonesia for over 30 years. And my company and I have worked on scores of international and domestic documentary film and television projects over the past few decades. Together, our 50+ years of experience in our creative works and in Indonesia are what's going to make Swadaya a series we can all be proud of and rally around.
I'll be in charge of managing the productions and I've got the awesome team at Jungle Run backing me up. I'll also be responsible for getting Swadaya broadcast through BumiHijau Media's Local TV Partner Network and our team in Jakarta. Rio has been following many of these stories for years and, like you'll see in some of the clips below, has an amazing rapport with the people which will bring Swadaya to life.
Let's Make Noise!!!
This project could never happen without you. So please help us to get the word out far and wide! Together we have an opportunity to help people across Indonesia while producing a series that people everywhere will enjoy. 
Indiegogo can help as well, check out their share tools!
Thank you thank you!!!

<p><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></p>
<p>“Cyber Cadets” is the passion project of creators Tamera Davis and Tatiana Youpa, who aimed to create a pilot that would push the boundaries of what audiences have come to expect from a children’s show by combining sensitive storytelling with exciting, sci-fi visuals.</p>
<p>Principal photography wrapped in 2018, and now we need your help to finish post-production and get “Cyber Cadets” on screens in front of viewers around the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>“Cyber Cadets” is a pilot for a half-hour sci-fi series aimed at tweens. It tells the story of three 6th graders from unique backgrounds who find themselves stuck together at an after-school computer club. When their instructor, the elusive and scatterbrained campus IT technician, fails to show up, their curiosity gets the best of them and they discover a secret laboratory hidden in an old room at the back of the classroom. One thing leads to another and they suddenly find themselves transported to a virtual world on the verge of a meltdown. With the help of their instructor, they must learn to work together to stop the system from crashing and get back home before they’re stuck in a computer forever. Oh, and there’s a big scary monster that won’t leave them alone.</p>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why This Matters</span></h2>
<p>“As a child, children’s television had a huge impact on how I viewed the world and myself in it. Since late middle school, I struggled opening up to others and finding a place where I belonged. That’s also when my anxiety began. I know I would have loved and appreciated seeing a kid on screen who was going through my struggles and still succeeding, so that I knew everything was going to be okay. The protagonist of Cyber Cadets, Rosa, has anxiety and the two other cadets have their own challenges, which never make them weak, just unique. They see the world differently, which makes them the best superheroes of all. Growing up, kids on children's TV shows were just too perfect. Kids need Cyber Cadets because it will show them that their “imperfections” are not only their strengths, but their superpowers.” - Tamera Davis, writer, executive producer</p> <p>“Cyber Cadets is a project that I’m very proud to have been a part of since its original conception in our Writing for Children’s TV class in the fall of 2017. While the script has evolved in innumerable ways over the course of 6 months, the central theme of our project has remained the same: to tell a story that shows how the things that make us different can also be our strengths. As someone passionate about intelligent and creative children’s media, I am excited to work with a great team of talented men and women to create a television pilot for a show we believe in.” -Tatiana Youpa, writer, executive producer, director</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The thing that’s unique about Cyber Cadets is the kids. In a lot of the children’s TV we see today, the tweens seem to be very ‘cookie-cutter’ we wanted to show kids that face real struggles and react to them in a human way. Whether they’re saving the universe or finding a table at lunch, these kids experience the same emotions as any middle schooler would. Growing up is hard enough and we want our viewers to relate and resonate with what they see on the screen. If we can inspire someone with our work, then we’ve done our job. I want Cyber Cadets to get kids excited while also showing them that each of us has something special to offer.” -Gabriella Salemi, director</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Post-production on “Cyber Cadets” was abruptly put on hold in early 2020 when Tatiana’s father, Daniel Youpa, suffered a sudden and massive ischemic stroke. As one of the most active champions and funders of this project, it was a massive blow not only to the Youpa family but to the “Cyber Cadets” team as well. </p>
<p>Despite this, we have persevered towards our goal of sharing “Cyber Cadets” with the world and making our cheerleaders proud. We've put our heart and soul into this project, and we're so excited to finally have a finished product.</p>

After a chance meeting, the two formed an unlikely friendship and now rely on each other to stay sane as they transition into adulthood. The show revolves around phone calls between the two, as they talk about their lives and misadventures, and are peppered with surreal flashbacks and fantasies. Whether it's finding jobs, dealing with oddball friends, debating horribly obscure pop-culture and bands, or grappling with the impending responsibility that keeps them up at night, Cody and JC will always have something to chat about.We really wanted to make a cartoon that captured the essence of shows we loved growing up, while telling a story that people could relate to. There's always been something magic about chatting on the phone with a friend and using your mind to fill in the blanks as the person on the other end talks about their day. Combining the crushing reality of adulthood with wild imagination has always been the standout quality of this project and we know we've got a great story to tell here.If you're a fan of stuff like Scott Pilgrim, Daria, or cult cartoons like Mission Hill or MTV's Downtown, Failing Upward will be a new favorite!Interested?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Chuck Rayner and I am the producer, writer, and director of my TV show ""The Paramedic Angel"" that I am very excited about.

<h2><i>V for VALHALLA</i></h2>
<p>Rooted in Norse Mythology, <i>V for Valhalla</i> is the story of an Earth-dwelling woman named Ally Thorsdottir (Holly Stanford) who is ripped from her home and brought to Asgard, forced to follow her father's footsteps who happens to be the slain Norse God of Thunder, Thor. She is the rightful heiress to the throne in Asgard, as well as to all the powers (and duties) of Thor! All of the other gods and goddesses are dead, so she's really the only option left.</p>

<h2>Become a Part of Skeleton Crew...</h2>
<p>In December 2014, the first draft of a play called Skeleton Crew was completed. From the first read thru of this piece, it was clear the potential was there for something more. Since that time, thousands of people have tuned in to watch the adventures of Anthony, Hunter, and the rest of the characters in Skeleton Crew. The series has become a platform for people and ideas on the fringes of society, and will continue to do so as long as the series exists. Produced by SideKick Productions, whose mission is promoting size-blind casting whenever appropriate and possible, Skeleton Crew has connected with audiences in ways I never imagined. We have been fortunate enough to work with talent from all levels of the industry, including founder of Troma Studios and father of the Toxic Avenger, Lloyd Kaufman, who makes a cameo in Season One. We focus on LGBTQ themes heavily, in particular the bear community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Season Four</h3>
<p>For Season Four, we are attempting to go bigger in scope than ever before, with longer episodes, a longer filming season, and bigger and wackier storylines. Any donation we receive will go towards making this happen, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental of The WayStation, the fabulous bar which serves as our home away from home, MoneyShot$</li>
<li>Rental of studio spaces</li>
<li>Rental of other specialized locations</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Set pieces </li>
<li>Special FX</li>
<li>New equipment (lights, tripod, sound, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Season Fourof Skeleton Crew has been completely written and is in production. No matter what happens, we will be producing this season of the series. Therefore there are no risks involved, and the only challenges are on the production team figuring out how best to navigate the budget.</p>

<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Tell your friends about the series. This is huge--the more people who watch Skeleton Crew on YouTube, the more potential we have for sharing our wacky, zany, melodramatic-tragicomic view of the world!</li>

<p>Hi! We're Nancy and Jill—and we'd love to invite you to join us in Whiskey Springs! Here is a bit about how this ALL started.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl name Nancy who dreamed of finding her princeSS. She looked and looked and couldn't find herself anywhere—movies, books, television—so, she made up stories about a world where she could exist. Forty-some-odd years later, she started WRITING those stories. After publishing the Alex and Cassidy series, Nancy began writing short-story series as JA Armstrong. The Whiskey Springs Series (or Open Tab as many know it) began in January of 2018. With over 10,000 copies sold or downloaded of the first book, the series quickly became the top-seller in JA Armstrong's catalog. Since 2018, The Whiskey Springs series has continued to gain new readers, and listeners on Audible. Audible is how Nancy and Jill met.</p>
<p>Searching for the PERFECT narrator for a popular series iS no easy task. Finding Jill to bring Whiskey Springs to life for audiobook was a gift beyond measure—it came with more than a few bonuses! Jill is not only a talented voice-over artist and actor, she's also a successful author and writer. As JA Rock, Jill has penned numerous best-selling and a few award-winning novels in Gay Fiction. She brings a unique perspective and voice to Whiskey Springs.</p>
<p>Nancy and Jill both have backgrounds in theater, and love the chance to tell a story through different mediums. As a team, we are committed to telling stories that depict diverse models and explore the range of human emotion, experience, sexuality, and struggle. We need your help to bring Whiskey Springs, Vermont and its colorful cast of characters to LIFE! Whiskey Springs will be shot as a 60-minute pilot that has the ability to be broken into 3/20-minute episodes. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently in PRE-production. What does that mean? It means we've got a pilot going, we've got some cash in the bank, a few people ready to come on board, some concrete PLANS, and some DREAMS about small-town Vermont. Here is what we need: We are asking YOU to help us raise $20,000 to put Whiskey Springs on the map. Here is where it will go:</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY DOES IT MATTER?</span></h3>
<p>Media has made many strides in recent years. There are more models of gay, lesbian, transgender, bi-sexual, queer, and people of color on television and in film. Unfortunately, MORE is not ENOUGH. Many projects seek to market specifically to the community their protagonist represents. Whiskey Springs is different. We have lesbian characters, bi-sexual characters, queer characters, gay characters, straight characters, men, women, black and white, older and children. It's a town—a town full of PEOPLE. Our intention is to appeal to everyone—that anyone can imagine themselves sitting at the bar in Murphy's Law, chewing the fat with Fallon and Andi, Pete, Dale, Riley, and Ida—and Carol shaking her head at all of it. We want to INVITE everyone to town. It does matter. Seeing YOURSELF in media matters. Seeing people who aren't exactly like you matters too. Art is informed by culture but it also plays a role in SHAPING our perceptions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Film is NOT an easy endeavor. We have a bit of money behind us to start. Whiskey Springs WILL happen—the quality of the project we can deliver depends on the amount of money we have to invest. We would LOVE to shoot the ENTIRE pilot on Vermont. There is the possibility that we will shoot on both coasts. Travel for cast can get costly. We have a few cast members that we hope to announce while this campaign runs. Most of our resources are on the West Coast, so we are aware that we may have to pivot and film interior scenes in Los Angeles. The challenge is always finding the BEST people for the budget you have in place. </p>
<p>We have both had success as producers and creators. And, we are fortunate to have EXPERIENCED HUMAN resources to guide us around potholes and over bumps that block our path. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Travel Funds Running Low?</h3>
<p>If you can't donate—we understand! We would love to have you be part of our community. That's what Whiskey Springs is all about—community. It's a place where people help each other out (most of the time.) </p>

<h2>PincheAls Garage V2.0</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My wife and I started on this adventure back in 2007 when we bought our first 2002 Volkswagen GTI. We fell in love with that car and I wanted to learn everything I could about how to fix and maintain our “baby”.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014, I now wanted to help people maintain their Volkwagens from what I learned throughout the years. What first started out as simply DIYs using a cheap cell phone on YouTube as a hobby has turn into a large community of Volkswagen lovers and enthusiasts. As our channel grew, the request to help more people became real. We would do our best to offer car advice to locals and help them do the repairs. When we couldn’t be there in person, we would do a live stream on YouTube to provide guidance for the project. This allowed us to expand our “community” to all over the world.</p>
<p>In this new season of PincheAls Garage, you the subscriber, are going to have 100% control over what we do here on the channel.</p>
<p>How are we going to do that?</p>
<p>We are going to start off by doing an Indiegogo campaign. During this campaign, we are going to try and raise $15,000 to $20,000. With these funds, we are going to offer 2 options on what we will do for the entire season of PincheAls Garage.</p>
<p>Option A, where you the Subscriber, will decide on what car we choose, where we get it from, and how we build it. Plain and simple. We are going to have a poll system to help decide what car we choose to build from anywhere in the United States. Then we will pick up the car and bring it back to California. From there we will decide, base off votes, wheather you want to build it for race, track, stance, or show... it will be 100% Subscriber choice while still keeping it within budget.</p>
<p>Once we are done building the car, we’ll show it off and then give it away to one lucky PincheAls Garage Subscriber. Yes, that’s right guys! One of you will have the ability to win it. We are not going to keep the car or raffel it off. We are just going to pick a random Subscriber from the channel and that’s it. If there is any funds left over, we will provide the winner with oil changes, car maintence or a full tool box, it all depends on what funds are left, so they can go home and enjoy their new car. That is Option A.</p>
<p>Now for Option B where we go out into the community to help 2 to 3 people with their builds. We will divide the funds equally, up to 2 or 3 parts, based on how much funds we have raised. For example, say we raise $15,000. We will divide that by 2 which would put us at $7,500 each. We would have to subtract travel and lodging, but besides that, the rest of the funds would go to help someone get their car back on the road. From covid to other life situations, in these difficult times there are people out there in need of some assistance with their cars. So why not help those in need by traveling to their house and helping them out; giving them one less thing to worry about. Maybe the’re halfway done and need an engine rebuild or suspension, maybe a set of wheels or a paint job... why not have PincheAls Garage show up, take care of them and film the entire process so others can learn from the experience. We would be able to do this for 2 to 3 people per campaign. And, if this is successful, we will do it again and make this apart of the channel. That’s kind of the goal we are working towards for PincheAls Garage Version 2.0</p>
<p>We hope that you will be apart of PincheAls Garage by supporting what we do. Share this with friends and family and follow along with our progress through our Indiegogo campaign and on YouTube at “PincheAls Garage”.</p>
<p>As a “Thank You”, each backer will receive a PincheAls Garage Perk!</p>
<p>            Tier 1   Thank You Card with PincheAls Garage Sticker</p>
<p>            Tier 2   Thank You Card with PincheAls Garage Sticker and Button plus a discount code                          for our online store</p>
<p>            Tier 3   Thank You Card with PincheAls Garage Sticker and Button plus a discount code                          for our online store and a Personal Zoom call with PincheAl                </p>
<p>We would love to make this a regular thing, but, it all depends on the success of this campaign!</p>

From there we will decide, base off votes, wheather you want to build it for race, track, stance, or show... it will be 100% Subscriber choice while still keeping it within budget.
Once we are done building the car, we’ll show it off and then give it away to one lucky PincheAls Garage Subscriber. Yes, that’s right guys! One of you will have the ability to win it. We are not going to keep the car or raffel it off. We are just going to pick a random Subscriber from the channel and that’s it. If there is any funds left over, we will provide the winner with oil changes, car maintence or a full tool box, it all depends on what funds are left, so they can go home and enjoy their new car. That is Option A.
Now for Option B where we go out into the community to help 2 to 3 people with their builds. We will divide the funds equally, up to 2 or 3 parts, based on how much funds we have raised. For example, say we raise $15,000. We will divide that by 2 which would put us at $7,500 each. We would have to subtract travel and lodging, but besides that, the rest of the funds would go to help someone get their car back on the road. From covid to other life situations, in these difficult times there are people out there in need of some assistance with their cars. So why not help those in need by traveling to their house and helping them out; giving them one less thing to worry about. Maybe the’re halfway done and need an engine rebuild or suspension, maybe a set of wheels or a paint job... why not have PincheAls Garage show up, take care of them and film the entire process so others can learn from the experience. We would be able to do this for 2 to 3 people per campaign. And, if this is successful, we will do it again and make this apart of the channel. That’s kind of the goal we are working towards for PincheAls Garage Version 2.0
We hope that you will be apart of PincheAls Garage by supporting what we do. Share this with friends and family and follow along with our progress through our Indiegogo campaign and on YouTube at “PincheAls Garage”.

<p>Yes hello, Steve O'Brien here.  I am the creator/writer/co-producer/star of ""Love Your Life.""  I dreamed of creating and starring in my own series since I was an extremely awkward preteen.  Now that I'm a slightly less awkward ""adult,"" I have a story that could change perspectives and start conversations.  It's a story that's never been told.</p>

<h3>What is Dave &amp; Theo?</h3>
<p><i>Dave &amp; Theo </i>is a comedy web series that revolves around two homeless boys (and their cat), trying to get a better life for themselves. Dave is straight laced, logical and calculated in his approach to everything the pair do. Theo on the other hand is a crazy, energetic and enigmatic individual, seeing only the best in every situation whilst remaining true to his morals. He loves animals, specifically his cat, Jupiter. </p>
<p>Being two polar opposites drawn together by circumstance, unable to get a break in the world both socially and financially - the boys' differences bring them together in an effort to change their luck around by any means necessary. They break the law, fabricate infatuation, steal children's Christmas presents and disregard workplace policies all in an effort to become financially stable. Their wrongdoings along their journey unintentionally catch the attention of an unsuspecting gang leader who has a sinister agenda for the boys that will take their friendship to its limits.</p>
<p><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>The series was made and self-financed by a team of student filmmakers and actors on a budget of $3000. Over a 20 day shooting period, using limited resources and equipment we filmed 6 x 12 minute episodes. </p>
<p><i>Dave &amp; Theo</i> has been a multiple year project in the making from pre to post production. We are now in the final stages of post-production and need your help!</p>
<p>From the inception of our project, it was paramount to us that if we were going to ask our audience for their support, we didn't want to make them wait around for two years to see a final product. This is why we are ""reverse-crowdfunding"" (in a sense).</p>
<p>However, we aren't crowdfunding to simply reimburse ourselves for the money we spent on the series. By self financing the production, we used up every last cent we had (which isn't much as we are students!)  and now have little to no money for our marketing campaigns (to reach a wider audience and increase exposure for the series) and film festivals (fantastic but expensive platforms to get our series screened around the world). Additionally, we are also looking to score an original soundtrack for the series that will enhance the characters and the story.</p>
<p>The success of our series and how people respond to it relies heavily on these post-production expenses that we currently can't afford. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently aiming to get $5000 as a flexible goal from this campaign. Here's where the money will be going:</p>
<p><strong>Marketing ($2000):</strong> We plan on launching various marketing campaigns across social media platforms to create as much exposure for our series as possible. We wish to present advertisements to our target market through predominantly Facebook and Instagram. We experimented with a $50 advertising campaign to make sure we knew what we were doing before requesting money in this department, and astonishingly we amassed over 8,000 page likes, 75 thousand trailer views and reached over 250,000 people in the space of 48 hours. Realising social media as an incredible platform to create audience awareness and engagement for our series, we would love to double down in this department. By putting at least $1000 of our marketing budget into Facebook advertising, we could have a potential reach within the millions. </p>
<p>The rest of the marketing budget will go towards various promoted Instagram posts, improving our SEO with Google Adwords, Youtube advertising and film magazine publications.</p>
<p><strong>Film Festivals ($2000): </strong>Currently, we have around 50 potential film festivals on our slate that accept web series as part of their program. Each averaging entry fees of around $50 to $100. Whilst this is forecasted to be quite an expensive process, we see festivals as a fantastic platform to get our series seen by international audiences as well as opening up possibilities for distribution. Although we eventually intend on releasing the series for free on Youtube, establishing a following around the world would create some much needed momentum and exposure that we don't currently have as student filmmakers.</p>
<p><strong>Original Soundtrack ($1000): </strong>Thankfully much like we did during shooting, we have used our resources to find a group of talented musicians passionate enough about the project to do so free of charge! However, getting in a studio to record is another story. Currently on our soundtrack to-do list are 8 original pieces composed by our fantastic composer Matt Castley. Apart from this, the series will include some already made royalty free tracks that we need to license through payment.</p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo Fees ($250): </strong>Being able to host this campaign does come with a 5% fee from Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>We understand that it's one thing to support our series, but wouldn't it be great to not only get a riveting series - but some fantastic perks in return for your generosity! To the right of the page is a list of some great value perks starting from $10 (where you can already earn early, exclusive access to the series) all the way up to $1500 (where you can be credited as an executive producer). But if you are just here to donate, you can still choose any amount you please in between. As mentioned before - we appreciate every cent.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</strong></p>
<p>As we mentioned before, every cent counts! Whether we get more or less than our initial goal, any donation and support shown helps our series get seen by one more person or one more festival. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Whilst the chronicles of David and Theodor are ridiculous, over-the-top and incredibly entertaining, there is a lot of subtext to be tapped into. At the crux of the comedy is a lot of heart and a moving story about the enduring strength of friendships in the event of oppression and ill-fated circumstances. The series encourages people to lean on their friends for help to get through tough times. This is shown through the unlikely pairing of David and Theodor who have found themselves on the downside of advantage, but confide in each other and support one another to get out of their predicament. Although the characters in the series have heightened personalities and circumstances, they have relatable qualities that can be universally understood and empathised with.</p>
<h3>Our Track Record</h3>
<p>The series was created by student filmmakers, David Hoey and Nicholas Burton, who have already seen success in previous projects. David recently wrote and directed a dark comedy short film titled ""A Year Without Play"" which has won awards and has been screened at festivals from St Kilda to Nepal. Nick has been acting for quite some time now and is coming off playing the lead role in acclaimed feature film ""Damaged"" and is also currently in the process of writing a new TV show titled ""Naked"". Together, David and Nicholas have been developing the series for over 3 years and have had multiple attempts and encountered many hurdles to finally get to this point. Also along for the journey since the very beginning was actor Laurence Boxhall, who plays the character Dave. Laurence is known for his work on Australian television (Worst Year Of My Life Again, Deadline Gallipoli, Ronny Chieng: International Student and Talkin' Bout Your Generation). As a team of young storytellers, we have used what we have learnt collectively over the past couple of years and believe the series we have for you will not fall short of your expectations!</p>

David recently wrote and directed a dark comedy short film titled ""A Year Without Play"" which has won awards and has been screened at festivals from St Kilda to Nepal. Nick has been acting for quite some time now and is coming off playing the lead role in acclaimed feature film ""Damaged"" and is also currently in the process of writing a new TV show titled ""Naked"". Together, David and Nicholas have been developing the series for over 3 years and have had multiple attempts and encountered many hurdles to finally get to this point. Also along for the journey since the very beginning was actor Laurence Boxhall, who plays the character Dave. Laurence is known for his work on Australian television (Worst Year Of My Life Again, Deadline Gallipoli, Ronny Chieng: International Student and Talkin' Bout Your Generation). As a team of young storytellers, we have used what we have learnt collectively over the past couple of years and believe the series we have for you will not fall short of your expectations!

<h3>The Adventures of Snow White and Rose Red is a live action fairy tale show featuring two sisters from humble beginnings who live in a cottage in the woods with their parents.</h3>
<h3>Snow White, a kind girl with a passion for animals and good books, is best friends with her sister, Rose Red, an outgoing girl with a curious spirit. When they’re not helping out with the family chores, they spend their days roaming the forest and playing pretend. But it’s not long before they learn that the woods they have lived in all their lives are nothing short of magical, and they begin to cross paths with the characters they’ve only read about in fairy tales, such as Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and Alice in Wonderland.</h3>
<h3>As they embark on their adventures, the girls learn the importance of sisterhood, friendship, and kindness, and that your life can be far from ordinary, if you just believe in a little magic.​</h3>
<h3>Thank you for helping us share the magic with children, big and small.  As parents, we take the responsibility of creating media for children very seriously, knowing every moment of our show can have an impact on their hearts and minds.</h3>
<h3> Our goal is to bring, heart-centered, education fairy tales to kids that will inspire them to become the kind of warm, responsible adults we hope to see our own children become.  </h3>

Inspired by the fantastical adventures she read as a child, by the likes of Jules Verne, it first introduced the world to the Moomins – a curious, friendly type of troll. Their ancestors supposedly lived behind the round, tall ceramic stoves typical in the Nordic countries. The Moomin family settles in an idyllic valley – a magical and exciting place, it is their whole world. Eight further Moomin novels were to follow, along with four picture books and a long-running comic strip. In the decades since, the growing worldwide popularity of the Moomins has spawned plays, theme parks, merchandise, TV series and films. Today the Moomins are more popular than ever, and their core values of courage, respect for nature, good humour and tolerance have never been more vital. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488476826/fuasnei1dfbncgd4mlte.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488476881/vp0xnuemkkfkm4bmxggi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The main character in the series is <strong>Moomintroll</strong>, who is curious, kind, sensitive and idealistic.

This was the beginning of the legendary Moomin characters that later evolved into dozens of books, toys, tv series, films and even theme parks that have been adored by millions of fans all over the world. Now we are bringing MOOMIN back as an innovative new television animation, which will help bring Moomin to a new generation – and to our screens in a way never seen before. The series will be made using state-of-the-art CGI technology combined with more traditional hand-drawn techniques. Each episode is based on an original storyline or incident from the novels and comic strips. The new series will premiere in 2019, starting with 13 episodes.We want this to be the most faithful version of Tove Jansson’s stories yet committed to screen so for the first time ever, we are inviting YOU, our faithful fans, to become part of the production process and to create the best Moomin series yet! See concept art images below.  See concept art images below.  In 1945 ‘The Moomins and the Great Flood‘ was published in Finland by the Finnish writer and illustrator Tove Jansson. Inspired by the fantastical adventures she read as a child, by the likes of Jules Verne, it first introduced the world to the Moomins – a curious, friendly type of troll. Their ancestors supposedly lived behind the round, tall ceramic stoves typical in the Nordic countries. The Moomin family settles in an idyllic valley – a magical and exciting place, it is their whole world. Eight further Moomin novels were to follow, along with four picture books and a long-running comic strip. In the decades since, the growing worldwide popularity of the Moomins has spawned plays, theme parks, merchandise, TV series and films. Today the Moomins are more popular than ever, and their core values of courage, respect for nature, good humour and tolerance have never been more vital. The main character in the series is Moomintroll, who is curious, kind, sensitive and idealistic. His is a typical coming-of-age story, as he tackles the puzzle of growing up in his own unique way, while remaining a beloved part of the family.     Calm and collected, Moominmamma is the reassuring foundation of the Moomin family. Moominmamma runs her household with unflappable ease, ensuring that her family is happy and that any guest who sets foot over the threshold is made to feel welcome and wanted.  Self-confidence has never been a problem for the charismatic Moominpappa. Childish and anarchic, he does not believe in making plans but lives for the moment and for the thrill of adventure.    Snufkin spends half the year wandering the woods and mountains ‘alone’, as this carefree vagabond usually likes it. Self-sufficient and independent, Snufkin is an expert outdoorsman who is at home in the wilderness and has no need for material things.   Mischievous, blunt and just a bit bossy, Little My is a tiny bundle of energy. Adopted by the Moomin family, she lives in the Moominhouse variously in balls of yarn, kitchen drawers, and even people’s pockets.   Happy and energetic, the Snorkmaiden is Moomintroll's friend, playmate, and companion. She's playful and fun, if rather vain, and more than happy to be swept up in his make-believe world of romantic quests. Next to Snufkin, Sniff is Moomintroll’s best friend and they spend a lot of time together. Sniff is scared of the sea, storms, hard work and much more. The only thing that will encourage him to take risks is the prospect of riches.To learn more about Moomin, visit www.moomin.comWe want to produce MOOMIN with YOUR HELP! We came to Indiegogo to give thousands of Moomin fans across the world the opportunity to become part of the production, get their hands on some exclusive merchandise and once-in- a lifetime experiences. All the money raised through our Indiegogo campaign will go towards our visual development costs that consist of different (but equally important) sections, such as creating a unique 2D/3D-animation technique, character design, and character rigging. With your help, we will be able to develop a new animation technique which combines the best qualities of 2D and 3D. This new technique will ensure that the series stays loyal to the graphic, minimalist world of Tove’s illustrations, whilst bringing the Moominvalley to life with all its wonderful colours and details.We've calculated that we need a minimum of $200,000 for the visual development. If we go over that amount, we will be able to expand into other areas of development at an early stage and be able to release more material for you to see and to release more exclusive perks.  Our core creative team consists of award-winning professionals from both Finland and the UK. All those involved have a strong lifelong connection to the Moomins. The show is directed by Oscar®-winning director Steve Box, who is best known for WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. The series is produced by Gutsy Animations, a production company based in Tove Jansson’s home city of Helsinki, in Finland. The award-winning creative team has experience ranging from animation to feature films, and commercials to television.Marika Makaroff is the executive producer and creative director of the series. She is the creative force behind award-winning drama and entertainment series like The Apprentice and Got Talent. John Woolley is a BAFTA®-winning producer, with great experience in animation from a variety of 2D/3D/Stop frame-productions, including many years at the prestigious Aardman Studio in Bristol. Nick Ostler and Mark Huckerby are Emmy®-winning and BAFTA®-nominated writing partners, who are co-head writing the series together with Steve Box. They are best known for writing animation shows including Peter Rabbit, Danger Mouse, and Shaun the Sheep. Pekka Kuusisto and Samuli Kosminen are the composers responsible for making the valley sound the way it should: filled with adventure and fantasy, through the changing seasons, with Woodies, Niblings and other creatures hiding in its nooks and crannies.Animation studio Piñata is a world-class animation and illustration studio based in Helsinki, Finland. Their exceptional team consists of illustrators, animators, and VFX professionals, that will be the muscle behind the visual development process.We know how much our fans love Moomin so we wanted to create a wide range of amazing perks that we know you will enjoy.

Japanese version: トーベ・ヤンソンはムーミンの第一作を1945年に発表しました。これが、後に世界中の数百万のファンに愛されている数多くの本、おもちゃ、テレビシリーズ、映画そしてテーマパークにまで発展する、ムーミンの伝説的なキャラクターたちの始まりでした。 そしていま、私たちは再びムーミンを革新的な新しいテレビアニメーションの場に登場させ、ムーミンを新しい世代に紹介し、いまだかつて見たことのないスクリーンに連れ出すサポートをします。本シリーズは、最新のCGI技術を、従来の手書き技術と組み合わせて使用し、製作が進められる予定です。各エピソードはオリジナルストーリーか、小説やコミックシリーズからのエピソードをベースにします。新シリーズは2019年にプレミア予定で、13エピソードで開始されます。私たちとしては本シリーズを最もトーベ・ヤンソンの原作に忠実なものにしたいと思っていますが、かつてない新鮮なものをスクリーンに映し出したいとも思っています。そこで大ファンである皆様に本製作プロセスと、史上最高のムーミンシリーズの作成に参加していただきたいと思っています!   1945年に、フィンランドで、フィンランド人の小説家でありイラストレーターでもあるトーベ・ヤンソンが『小さなトロールと大きな洪水』を出版しました。作者が子供のころに読んだジュール・ヴェルヌのようなファンタスティック・アドベンチャーにインスピレーションを受けたこの本は、好奇心旺盛な、フレンドリーなトロール、ムーミンを世界に紹介しました。 ムーミンたちの祖先は、北欧国家でよく見られる、丸くて大きなセラミック製のストーブの裏で生活しているとされていました。ムーミン一家は田園風景の広がる、魔法のようなエキサイティングな場所に住んでいて、そこが彼らの全世界です。第一作以外に次いで小説が八作品出版された後、絵本を四本そして、長いコミックシリーズも出版されました。その時から数十年にわたり、世界中でムーミンの人気は高まり続け、劇、テーマパーク、グッズ、テレビシリーズや映画を生み出しました。現在ムーミンの人気はかつてないほど高まり、勇気、自然への畏敬、優れたユーモアそして包容力といったキャラクターの持つ核心部分は今までになく重要視されています。 シリーズのメインキャラクターはムーミントロールです。彼は好奇心が旺盛で、人当たりが良く、ちょっと神経質で、理想主義的なところがあります。ストーリーは典型的な成長物語で、彼は成長に伴う問題にユニークな方法で挑んで行きますが、同時に彼は愛する家族の一員でもあり続けています。  落ち着いていて、しっかり者のムーミンママはムーミン一家が安心して暮らせるように気を回しています。ムーミンママはいつも冷静に家族を導きます。家族が常に幸せで、ムーミン屋敷がいつも家族や友だち、お客さまにとって、安全で、愛に満ちあふれた場所であるのは、このムーミンママのおかげです。 カリスマ性のあるムーミンパパは、自分自身に誇りを持っています。好奇心旺盛で、冒険を好み、予定を立てることはしません。また一瞬一瞬を楽しみ、冒険のスリルに目がありません。 スナフキンは「一人きり」で森や山で半年ほど過ごします。この気軽な、さすらいの旅人はいつもこんな感じです。ひとりが好きで、独立したスナフキンは野外で過ごすプロであり、荒れ地に家を持っていて、生活に必要なものは最小限です。  バタバタしていて、ちょっと怒りんぼ、でも面倒見のいいちびのミイはエネルギーの塊です。ムーミン一家とともに生活しているミイはムーミン屋敷の毛糸の玉の中、キッチンの戸棚、誰かのポケットの中など様々な場所に隠れることができます。  いつもハッピーで元気なスノークのお嬢さんは、ムーミントロールの友人でもあり、ガールフレンドでもあります。おじょうさんは楽しいキャラクターですが、少々空想家でロマンチックな空想で満ちた妄想の世界を漂うのが大好きです。 スナフキンの次に、スニフはムーミントロールの親友であり、よく一緒に過ごしています。スニフは海、嵐、大変な仕事などが苦手です。宝物を守るときだけは、勇気を出して挑んでいきます。ムーミンに関する詳細は www.moomin.comを参照してください。皆さんのサポートでムーミンを製作したいと思っています。 私たちはIndiegogoを通じて、世界中に何千といるムーミンファンに製作に参加し、限定のグッズを手に入れ、一生に一度きりの経験に参加する機会を提供しています。 本 Indiegogo キャンペーンを通じてファンドライズされた全額は、独自の2D/3Dアニメーション技術の製作、キャラクターデザイン、キャラクターリギングといった様々な（そしてどれも同様に重要な）セクションで構成されるビジュアル開発費用として使用されます。皆さんからのサポートで、最高レベルの2Dと3Dを併せ持つ新しいアニメーション技術の開発が可能になります。 新しい技術により、シリーズはグラフィック、トーベのイラストレーションのミニマルな世界観に対し忠実に製作でき、ムーミン谷を美しい色やデティールで生き生きと描き出すことができます。ビジュアル開発のために最低でも$200,000が必要であると算出しました。目標金額を上回った場合、初期的段階において金額をそのほかの開発分野に発展させることが可能になり、より一層のマテリアルを解放し、皆様に見ていただいたり、より多くの限定特典の提供ができるようになります。私たちのクリエイティブチームには、フィンランドおよびイギリスに拠点を持つ、受賞歴を持つプロがいます。チームメンバーは皆、ムーミンとの一生にわたる長期間の繋がりを持っています。番組はオスカー®受賞歴のある監督 Steve Box（代表作、ウォレスとグルミット: 野菜畑で大ピンチ )により監督されます。本シリーズは、トーベ・ヤンソンの故郷、フィンランド、ヘルシンキに拠点を置くプロダクション会社、Gutsy Animations社により製作されます。受賞歴のある本クリエイティブチームはアニメーションから、長編映画、テレビ向けのコマーシャルまで幅広い経験を持ちます。Marika Makaroffはシリーズのエグゼクティブプロデューサーおよびクリエイティブディレクターです。彼女はThe ApprenticeやGot Talentといった受賞歴のあるドラマやバラエティ番組シリーズを支える、クリエイティブな推進力です。 John Woolleyは BAFTA®受賞プロデューサーで、ブリストルの有名なAardman Studioでの数年間の経験も含む、様々な 2D/3D/ストップモーションのプロダクションといったアニメーションでの経験を有しています。  Nick Ostler と Mark Huckerby はエミー賞®受賞およびBAFTA®にノミネートされた脚本パートナーで、Steve Boxと共にシリーズの脚本も書いています。ピーターラビット、デンジャーマウスおよび羊のショーン などのアニメーションでも知られています。 Pekka KuusistoおよびSamuli Kosminenはムーミン村の音の製作を担当しているコンポーザーです。彼らは、ムーミン村が厳しい季節を通じて冒険やファンタジーに満ち溢れ、ウッディ、ニブリングそして遠くに隠れているその他の生物たちもいるように音を製作します。Animation studio Piñata は、フィンランドのヘルシンキに拠点を置く、ワールドクラスのアニメーションおよびイラストレーションスタジオです。たぐいまれなる才能を持つチームには、イラストレーター、アニメーター、VFXの専門家が在籍していて、ビジュアル開発プロセスの屋台骨となります。私たちはムーミンのファンがどれだけムーミンを愛しているか理解しています。そこで皆様に喜んでいただける、様々な素晴らしい特典を製作したいと思い立ちました。私たちのIndiegogoページで確認できる全特典は、慎重に選ばれ、後援者の方々のためだけにデザインされたものです。グッズは新しいムーミンシリーズのイメージを主に使用してデザインされる予定です。 詳細はFAQセクションにあるムーミンエクスペリエンスを、そのほかの特典はIndiegogoページの右手をご参照ください。その他の特典のイメージは、ビデオプレーヤーの下部にあるイメージギャラリーにて閲覧できます。   皆様からの応援ありがとうございます! 主な課題の一つとして、予測できない状況によるシリーズのリリース期日の遅れが挙げられます。また、よりお伝えしにくいことですが、予算が変更されそうな状態にあります。幸いなことに、新しいムーミンシリーズのビジュアル開発のために、大変正確な予算を立てていたため、初期的段階からの大きな変更を防ぐことができています。計画に大幅な変更がある場合は、皆様にお知らせいたします! キャンペーンに参加する方法の一つとしては、この

<h3><u>#ACTORS TV PILOT</u></h3>
<p>Hello folks! </p>
<p>Firstly, what is it? #ACTORS is a snarky and irreverent mockumentary series (with a pinch of the dark side) that follows a group of out-of-work actors who are trying to make it, NOT fake it.</p>
<p>Secondly, who are we? We are Francesca Kingdon and Luca Moore; two actors who understand only too well the trials and tribulations of being in and out of work.

Hello folks! 
Firstly, what is it? #ACTORS is a snarky and irreverent mockumentary series (with a pinch of the dark side) that follows a group of out-of-work actors who are trying to make it, NOT fake it.
Secondly, who are we? We are Francesca Kingdon and Luca Moore; two actors who understand only too well the trials and tribulations of being in and out of work. The endless anxiety, the relentless self-promotion, the knockbacks- Oh, the knockbacks. It's a jungle out there and we want this to not only show the often bizarre and bonkers side of being an actor but also the more poignant, heartfelt moments too.

Thirdly, what do you want from me? We would love your help in funding this exciting new project which is already attracting some well-known talent like the esteemed director of smash horror feature Matriarch, Scott Vickers. Below is an interview Scott had recently with the CEO of Filmocracy in the USA talking about his experiences as a film-maker and #ACTORS gets a mention at 41 mins 10secs!

Thanks so much for taking the time out to learn more about our new digital series, “HeadSpace”. This show is about two young African American male psychotherapists and their journey through opening a new therapy practice in the heart of a Black neighborhood. These two childhood friends will struggle through the day-to-day challenges of starting a new practice, balance their polar opposite styles, and deal with their own personal demons while working to gain the trust of their community and encourage them to utilize mental health services.</p><h2><strong>A Little Background…</strong></h2><p><strong>Have you ever gone to therapy?</strong>  A recent University of Phoenix study found that nearly one-third (32%) of Americans have sought professional counseling for mental health issues. At the very least, you probably have a friend or family member who has seen a therapist and is open about it.  Seeing a therapist is much less of a taboo than it was decades ago but it remains heavily stigmatized among people of color, including African Americans.  African Americans are 20% more likely to report having serious psychological distress than their white counterparts, but less likely to seek mental health treatment.  We hope to open up a dialogue about mental health issues and the benefits of therapy with this show. And we’re using comedy to explore this subject since humor often helps people open up to challenging subjects. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529958786/n2kxquvx4uq3xfmzqnvn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2><strong>The Impact...</strong></h2><p>The main area where this show makes an impact is through exploring the attitudes and beliefs about therapy.

And there are others who don’t feel that they’d find a therapist they could relate to.  With this show, we will help change the narrative on mental health and therapy in the Black community.  We also plan to shift conventional thinking about therapy by having two young Black men as the experts helping others with their challenges, which is something that is rarely seen onscreen.  Comedy is a great medium to explore tough issues, and this show will have many laughs along with very poignant moments that will all further the discussion of this topic.</p><p>This show also makes an impact through the diversity in front of the camera and behind the scenes.
