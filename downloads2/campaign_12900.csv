<h3><strong>What’s An Informal?</strong></h3>
<p><i>Os Informais, </i>which directly translated from Portuguese as “The Informals”, is the first independently produced Mozambican Superhero comic book based in the nation’s capital of Maputo by local creative studio ANIMA. </p>
<p>Much like great science fiction of the past, <i>The Informals</i><i> </i>takes place in the not so distant future. A future devised of technological advancements, crime-free streets, and the segregation and oppression of working-class citizens: a perfect dystopia. Unbeknownst to the current political establishment, a group of young and resourceful vigilantes band together to ensure the rights the working man, the street vendor and beggar alike will no longer be violated; this is the mission of The Informals.</p>
<p>There are currently three episodes that have been written, drawn, and completely inked. Each building upon the foundation previous installment. Each with its unique sense of social and political urgency.  The nature of this series also serves as a direct contrast to the world of Black Panther, an attempt to deviate from the mainstream narratives about the African experience, culture, and overall trajectory. After all, it's a story about Africa by actual Africans. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><i><strong>Who Are You Guys? </strong></i></p>
<p>ANIMA Studios is a creative studio based in Maputo, Mozambique (Google that last part).  We communicate through integrated mediums such as Graphic Design, Animation (obviously) and Filmmaking.  With a resourceful group of people, we are effectively able to come up with creative solutions that respond to the needs of each given project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hélio​ Pene (Illustrator/Penciller):</strong> Helio wanted to say hi, so we let him because probably the best-Hélio person to describe himself: “My name is Hélio Januário. My best friends call me ""Link"". That's how I like referred to as well as sign my artwork. I'm a fan of pop culture, illustration (which is a necessity), and venturing into the ""fantastic universe"" from which I do not wish to return. Telling stories in an illustrated format has become my way of life and it is even this signature way of being that binds me to “The Informals”. As an illustrator, it is a place more than a habitat where I find ways to express myself. Nough said.”</p>
<p><strong>João ​Roxo  (Creative Director): </strong>): Designer and visual strategist, João is co-founder and creative catalyst at ANIMA. Growing up surrounded by post-independence publications and propaganda, from am early age João developed an interest and focus on editorial design and publishing as an artistic practice. As it is usually said, ""necessity is the mother of invention”, and scarcity of resources leads to new challenges in finding alternative methods of production and dissemination of content. Zine production is one such method that leads to amazing, unexpected outcomes. According to him the idea for Os Informais came to mind from early on. Walking in the city and engaging with its surroundings, crossing paths with informal market workers prompted the perfect metaphor for the graphic novel, where the classic plot of oppressor versus the oppressed gave way to this universe, inspired by our often absurd reality and enticed by the opportunity of tracing new imaginaries.</p>
<p><strong>Olivia Imaginário (Writer): </strong>A writer of mysterious nature and equally mysterious origins, Ms. Imaginario sought to travel the world in search of adventure and just causes.  One night whilst she was flying around the city of Maputo she miraculously met Joao and Helio. After their initial encounter, the pair were blown away by her otherworldly abilities; especially her talent for turning a phrase, the two knew she was the only being capable of helping to bring their colorful vision to life and thus she was recruited to the ANIMA family. Once the scripts for the first three episodes had been completed and the issues were in the process of being inked Olivia felt as though her she had served her purpose. She has now gone under the radar and our attempts to contact her here at ANIMA have been less than successful. She’s more than likely making her way around the globe again, helping those in need in any way she can. We believe when the time is right Olivia Imaginario will resurface, even if it’s just to say hello. </p>

<li>Printing  </li>
<li>Distribution          </li>
<li>Shipping (Domestically and Internationally) </li>

<p>The perks included in this campaign are designed to reward generous donators with the same sense of excitement that we here at ANIMA had when developing our story. We also want to provide with a gaze into the world of The Informals the way that only local independent artists can. Believe me, we're a lot closer than Tatooine!</p>

<h3>The Impact  </h3>
<p><i>The Informals </i>serves the purpose of taking control of your narrative on your terms. It aims to represent people at large in a universe and narrative with which people (particularly from a local standpoint) can identify with. It acts as a vehicle to broadcast societal and political issues that often go unrecognized or are labeled as taboo. Since the inception of the Comic book as a medium, it has served the purpose of being the platform that isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions and opens up the discussions about change.  In an era where it seems as though the truth can easily be distorted or lost in a vacuum, <i>The Informals</i><i> </i>is no exception to that tradition.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Where do we begin? First and foremost, as we mentioned earlier publishing in Mozambique is a pricey affair.  So if we don't get the funds we can't put out the goods. Unless there are any wealthy benefactors out there willing to circumvent the entire process. </p>
<ul><li>We've got seven years of experience in producing documentaries, commercials for large brands, and organizing events for local businesses and we always labor to make sure every product is delivered in the highest quality. Even in the face of limited resources, we make the best out of what is available to us and this project is should be no exception. </li></ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that are some of you who desperately want to help but can't afford to contribute directly to our campaign. But fear not! There are ways you can help us reach our goal without cashing checks. </p>
<p>Spread the word, my dudes! Tell all your friends and family who might be interested. Talk to your buddies at the comic shop about it. </p>
<p>Don't forget that IndieGoGo has some neat tools to help share this with your loved ones. </p>

Hélio​ Pene (Illustrator/Penciller): Helio wanted to say hi, so we let him because probably the best-Hélio person to describe himself: “My name is Hélio Januário. My best friends call me ""Link"". That's how I like referred to as well as sign my artwork. I'm a fan of pop culture, illustration (which is a necessity), and venturing into the ""fantastic universe"" from which I do not wish to return. Telling stories in an illustrated format has become my way of life and it is even this signature way of being that binds me to “The Informals”. As an illustrator, it is a place more than a habitat where I find ways to express myself. Nough said.”
João ​Roxo  (Creative Director): ): Designer and visual strategist, João is co-founder and creative catalyst at ANIMA. Growing up surrounded by post-independence publications and propaganda, from am early age João developed an interest and focus on editorial design and publishing as an artistic practice. As it is usually said, ""necessity is the mother of invention”, and scarcity of resources leads to new challenges in finding alternative methods of production and dissemination of content. Zine production is one such method that leads to amazing, unexpected outcomes. According to him the idea for Os Informais came to mind from early on. Walking in the city and engaging with its surroundings, crossing paths with informal market workers prompted the perfect metaphor for the graphic novel, where the classic plot of oppressor versus the oppressed gave way to this universe, inspired by our often absurd reality and enticed by the opportunity of tracing new imaginaries.
Olivia Imaginário (Writer): A writer of mysterious nature and equally mysterious origins, Ms. Imaginario sought to travel the world in search of adventure and just causes.  One night whilst she was flying around the city of Maputo she miraculously met Joao and Helio. After their initial encounter, the pair were blown away by her otherworldly abilities; especially her talent for turning a phrase, the two knew she was the only being capable of helping to bring their colorful vision to life and thus she was recruited to the ANIMA family. Once the scripts for the first three episodes had been completed and the issues were in the process of being inked Olivia felt as though her she had served her purpose. She has now gone under the radar and our attempts to contact her here at ANIMA have been less than successful. She’s more than likely making her way around the globe again, helping those in need in any way she can. We believe when the time is right Olivia Imaginario will resurface, even if it’s just to say hello. 

 
How Can I Help? 
Unfortunately, because of the geography and the nature of our company we currently don't have the financial resources to release this project ourselves.  That's where you come in!
We intend to use the funds we receive to cover the cost of:

Publishing (Primarily) 
Printing  
Distribution          
Shipping (Domestically and Internationally) 

 
ANIMA wants to maintain the highest standard of transparency, so, we've provided a handy information graphic that exhibits our exact calculations and where your funds will be implemented and directed. 
 

The perks included in this campaign are designed to reward generous donators with the same sense of excitement that we here at ANIMA had when developing our story. We also want to provide with a gaze into the world of The Informals the way that only local independent artists can. Believe me, we're a lot closer than Tatooine!
 

 
DISTRIBUTION
Our goal is to make this project accessible to as many people as possible in the future , so, for now, we've sorted to selling the publication at higher costs with the hopes that later on we would be able to sell the series at much more affordable rates across all available comic book consumption platforms, especially online.  
Ideally, if this campaign is successful, we'd like to inspire both domestic and international readers to think critically about their environments and possibly arouse other creatives who might not have the financial means to release their own material.  DIY to the 1000th power!
On a more personal note, we would like to ensure that everyone who contributes to this phase of post-production feels included in the progression of this universe. In other words: our achievements should feel like your achievements. 

 

The Impact  
The Informals serves the purpose of taking control of your narrative on your terms. It aims to represent people at large in a universe and narrative with which people (particularly from a local standpoint) can identify with. It acts as a vehicle to broadcast societal and political issues that often go unrecognized or are labeled as taboo. Since the inception of the Comic book as a medium, it has served the purpose of being the platform that isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions and opens up the discussions about change.  In an era where it seems as though the truth can easily be distorted or lost in a vacuum, The Informals is no exception to that tradition.  
 

Risks & Challenges
Where do we begin? First and foremost, as we mentioned earlier publishing in Mozambique is a pricey affair.  So if we don't get the funds we can't put out the goods. Unless there are any wealthy benefactors out there willing to circumvent the entire process. 
We've got seven years of experience in producing documentaries, commercials for large brands, and organizing events for local businesses and we always labor to make sure every product is delivered in the highest quality. Even in the face of limited resources, we make the best out of what is available to us and this project is should be no exception. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We know that are some of you who desperately want to help but can't afford to contribute directly to our campaign. But fear not! There are ways you can help us reach our goal without cashing checks. 
Spread the word, my dudes! Tell all your friends and family who might be interested. Talk to your buddies at the comic shop about it. 
Don't forget that IndieGoGo has some neat tools to help share this with your loved ones. 
Remember, every little bit helps. It really does.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p><strong>Hey there! Thanks for reading this page as we try to get funding for our four issue miniseries entitled Alone. Alone is written by the creative team of Tony Deans and Gabriel Rosswell who came together based upon a passionate desire to see a strong, realistic female character in a medium dominated by large-breasted, unrealistically proportioned and downright offensive portrayals of female characters. Indiegogo has begun to be dominated by major league publishers who don't want to have to pay for what they're selling despite having the money to do so. This isn't the case with us, instead we're two independent creators who have no agents, lawyers or publishing contract. Instead we want to cut out the middle man and bring our work straight to you, the reader and create a truly independent miniseries. </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">So What The Hell Do You Want From Me?</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>When it comes to funding we believe that you deserve respect to know where your money will go and thus we provide the following break-down:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>200 Dollars goes to the establishment of a website where we will independently distribute the comic via digital download</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>300 Dollars will go on the costs of a small publishing run of around 150 issues</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>300 Dollars will go onto marketing the comic to get it to reach a wider audience.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>If we manage to break over our budget then all costs will go into marketing and potentially increasing the physical copies. <strong>Once we reach our target we will seek to have the website set up so that Alone will be released digitally in December, just in time for Christmas and in Janurary for a physical release.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we come to the part that you're most interested in, the perks! Well unlike those big companies we don't have thousands of dollars to give you action figures or toys. What we do have however are ways to communicate and interact with you the reader. That's why the initial perks will be as follows:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>$1 - A thank you on the contributor’s page and a digital copy of Swine, our short five page comic story.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>$5 -  A free digital copy of Alone and Swine and a thank you on the contributor’s page.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>$10 - A free physical copy of the comic and a thank you on the contributors page and a free digital copy of our short story Swine.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>$100 - All of the above along with having as having a character named after you in the comic and based on your likeness. (Limited)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>$200 -  All of the above PLUS having Bruce the baby re-named after you AND getting a character re-named to something of your choice! (Limited)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The best thing about all these perks is that P&amp;P is FREE on all of them no matter where you are (limited to Planet Earth of course unless you can arrange transport to the Moon to get the stuff to you). If more and more people become interested in donating then more perks will become available.</strong></p>
<h2>Well That's Great But What's The Story Actually About And What Makes It So Special?</h2>
<p><strong>Well we don't want to give too much away as the story is full of shocks, twists and turns and yes even moments that will make you cry but we can reveal a bit of what happens within Alone as a taster. Alone is a comic that takes place after an airborne virus has wiped out the majority of life on the planet. Jade, our protagonist believes that she is the only survivor but her world is soon turned upside down once she discovers a baby who also possesses immunity to the virus. Things take a turn for the worse as she and the baby are pursued by SIRU a former Government organisation led by Jehovah, a man believing himself to be God and who has nefarious plans to remake the world in his image, plans to which Jade and the baby are key… </strong></p>
<p><strong>So what else makes it special? Well for one Jade is a strong woman with a realistic anatomy who kicks ass and doesn't take prisoners and will do whatever it takes to protect what she loves. How often in comics are Women the victims and displayed in a gratuitous manner? We hate that in comics and Alone is a specific reaction against that. We also want to make a great story full of fun and thrills that gets you involved within the story and doesn't let you go until the stories end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have also provided below six pages of the comic for you to sample as well.</strong></p>

<h3 class=""dotty"">About this project</h3>
<p>""Order
 of Procession"" is the first child of Toronto-based illustrator
 Nathan Robert Enkel and writer Spencer Butt, otherwise known as the 
collaborative duo, ""Digital Warlock Criminalz"". It is the by-product of 
blue/black magic, fast food, digital hand-grenades and insomnia.  The 
final result will be 
an illustrated short story book about a young man who makes a bad 
decision. </p>
<p>The tale begins with the main, unnamed character, thrust into an 
unexpected, hostile situation when he suddenly realizes that he happens 
to have a knife on him. As a knee-jerk reactionary response, he pulls 
the knife out to defend himself and is forced to confront the harsh 
reality that he just made things a lot worse. </p>
<p>The book's contents will be black and white with a full-colour, paper
 back cover with a first run of 333 copies (half of the mark of the 
beast).  Your funding will help us pay for both the production and 
distribution of the product.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is just the start of something big. Our hope is that not only will the book be a success, but that, through that success, it'll enable us to produce more books in the future. Not only will will be able to put out books that we, personally are involved with but also creative projects that our friends create.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our rough estimate for cost or printing the book is $2500. Your support will ensure that it gets made. The actual number is slightly less than that but if we aim high it will also subsidize the not only shipping costs but currency conversion as well. We will also be providing benefactors will certain perks and gifts (such as t-shirts, screen prints, poetry chapbooks, etc) and those cost money to make too. If we don't make our $2500 goal, then we'll still put whatever we did make towards printing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The finished product will be a roughly 32 page, 7.5"" by 7.5"" graphic novel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Think of this as a pre-order with incentives! You're gonna want to buy the book when it's done anyways, so why not buy it now and get bonuses?!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We recently started a blog to keep people informed of our progress and will be updating it on a regular basis so that people know that we're not slacking. Both the illustrator and the writer of the book also have flickr/myspace/youtube pages that will be used to promote the project.<br/></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Jamie (they/them) toils away in obscurity at their day job until the time comes around every couple months to travel to another place where they’re treated like a minor celebrity. No, Jamie’s not a comics creator; they’re a superhero!</p>
<p>Every couple months, Jamie takes time off from their day job to travel to the distant alien world of Lemuria where their inventing prowess and daring-do have turned them into the world's premier superhero. They fight invaders; spend time with their best friend, the princess Jada (she/her); investigate strange phenomena… And then they have to go home a few days later because prolonged exposure to Lemuria’s atmosphere will kill them. Yeah. That part is a bit of a bummer.</p>
<p>Things take a turn when Jamie is presented with an opportunity to do more superhero work back on Earth, putting their time on Lemuria and with Jada into question. And Jada's world begins to change as well as she gains more and more responsibility as an incoming leader, threatening the time she cherished spending together with Jamie. These two friends find themselves at a crossroads as Jamie must make a decision: stay comfortable with their current arrangement or risk it all for a shot at their dream.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518071608/aa4tnnrq22jyyrzus0on.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With funding, contributors will be able to ensure that readers can follow Jamie all the way through on this strange journey about balancing work, life, and long distance relationships.</p>
<h3>Meet the Team!</h3>
<p><strong>Writer - Mark O. Stack</strong> has been writing comics for a few years now, but he got his start by writing comics criticism for websites like Comics Bulletin. He currently works in education where he spends his days teaching college students to find their way around a good research essay. Comics Alliance described his all-ages comic <i>Sail </i>as containing <a href=""http://comicsalliance.com/best-comic-books-ever-this-week-new-releases-for-january-18-2017/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""a skill and economy that knows exactly when to pause and take in a quiet or powerful moment.""</a></p>
<p><strong>Artist - Anne Marcano </strong>is a self-taught artist who first entered the world of being a freelancer four years ago. Comics is a new field for her, but she's ready to take on the challenge. PLUS ULTRA!!!</p>
<p><b>Letterer - Danny Djeljosevic </b>is a comic book writer and occasional letterer based in San Diego, CA, who wrote the comics <i>Final Derby</i>, <i>The Ghost Engine</i>, <i>Kids Rule!!</i>, and <i>Big Fucking Hammer</i>.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>From left to right: Jamie's sister, Alex; Jamie; and Jada.</i></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a no-frills campaign aiming to raise just enough money to fund the completion of the comic. As such, there will be no physical rewards associated with this campaign. Rewards will be strictly digital.</p>
<p>Backers will be able to receive rewards such as advance PDFs of each chapter upon completion, PDFs of Mark's previous comics work, access to a behind the scenes developmental blog, editing on the comics project of their choice, and even the chance to be drawn into the comic!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520352335/wwqgvykliqv8aryey1sg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Pledge $10 and receive a copy of Mark's comic with Jean Pe, </i>Sail.</p>
<p><strong>Our funding goal breaks down as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$4,500 for the creation of 60 pages of fully colored comics art</li>
<li>$900 for professional quality lettering</li>
<li>and $600 for IndieGoGo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark will be generating no income from this project as its writer and manager, and he has already invested as much of his own money as possible into the creation of these preview pages, the logo, and a domain for the comic. For him, this is all about making a project he really believes in into a reality.</p>
<p>If this campaign does not reach its goal, that does not mean the end for this project! The funds raised will be divided up in order to create as many complete pages as possible while the team pursues other means of funding the project. Every dollar you give will be an absolute benefit to this team.</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518071645/yfym3fahraebarieena1.png"" src=""""/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Financing this campaign will allow the creative team to be paid a fair wage for their work on a project that they <i>want </i>to be working on. Mark believes in paying collaborators for their work, but he would never be able to finance a project of this scale without years of penny pinching. Every dollar donated pushes this team closer to a new level of creative work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is the team's first crowdfunding campaign, but the risks are relatively minimal. Due to the lack of physical rewards, production costs and shipping are a non-factor. The team's page rates are what they are. In the event of sickness or some other unforeseen circumstances, production of the comic may be delayed for a period of time, but our backers will be the very first to hear about it. Mark has plenty of experience with guiding comics projects from beginning to end, and the rest of the team has established an absolutely professional level of interpersonal communication regarding work.</p>

<h3>Please share and recommend our campaign to others!</h3>
<p>The only way a campaign like this can succeed is if people talk about it! If you share it on social media, write about it on your blog, or send a link directly to your friends then you will be directly helping this campaign raise awareness and funding.</p>

Jamie (they/them) toils away in obscurity at their day job until the time comes around every couple months to travel to another place where they’re treated like a minor celebrity. No, Jamie’s not a comics creator; they’re a superhero!
Every couple months, Jamie takes time off from their day job to travel to the distant alien world of Lemuria where their inventing prowess and daring-do have turned them into the world's premier superhero. They fight invaders; spend time with their best friend, the princess Jada (she/her); investigate strange phenomena… And then they have to go home a few days later because prolonged exposure to Lemuria’s atmosphere will kill them. Yeah. That part is a bit of a bummer.
Things take a turn when Jamie is presented with an opportunity to do more superhero work back on Earth, putting their time on Lemuria and with Jada into question. And Jada's world begins to change as well as she gains more and more responsibility as an incoming leader, threatening the time she cherished spending together with Jamie. These two friends find themselves at a crossroads as Jamie must make a decision: stay comfortable with their current arrangement or risk it all for a shot at their dream.

With funding, contributors will be able to ensure that readers can follow Jamie all the way through on this strange journey about balancing work, life, and long distance relationships.
Meet the Team!
Writer - Mark O. Stack has been writing comics for a few years now, but he got his start by writing comics criticism for websites like Comics Bulletin. He currently works in education where he spends his days teaching college students to find their way around a good research essay. Comics Alliance described his all-ages comic Sail as containing ""a skill and economy that knows exactly when to pause and take in a quiet or powerful moment.""
Artist - Anne Marcano is a self-taught artist who first entered the world of being a freelancer four years ago. Comics is a new field for her, but she's ready to take on the challenge. PLUS ULTRA!!!
Letterer - Danny Djeljosevic is a comic book writer and occasional letterer based in San Diego, CA, who wrote the comics Final Derby, The Ghost Engine, Kids Rule!!, and Big Fucking Hammer.  

From left to right: Jamie's sister, Alex; Jamie; and Jada.
What We Need & What You Get
This is a no-frills campaign aiming to raise just enough money to fund the completion of the comic. As such, there will be no physical rewards associated with this campaign. Rewards will be strictly digital.
Backers will be able to receive rewards such as advance PDFs of each chapter upon completion, PDFs of Mark's previous comics work, access to a behind the scenes developmental blog, editing on the comics project of their choice, and even the chance to be drawn into the comic!

Pledge $10 and receive a copy of Mark's comic with Jean Pe, Sail.
Our funding goal breaks down as follows:

$4,500 for the creation of 60 pages of fully colored comics art
$900 for professional quality lettering
and $600 for IndieGoGo fees

Mark will be generating no income from this project as its writer and manager, and he has already invested as much of his own money as possible into the creation of these preview pages, the logo, and a domain for the comic. For him, this is all about making a project he really believes in into a reality.
If this campaign does not reach its goal, that does not mean the end for this project! The funds raised will be divided up in order to create as many complete pages as possible while the team pursues other means of funding the project. Every dollar you give will be an absolute benefit to this team.


The Impact
Financing this campaign will allow the creative team to be paid a fair wage for their work on a project that they want to be working on. Mark believes in paying collaborators for their work, but he would never be able to finance a project of this scale without years of penny pinching. Every dollar donated pushes this team closer to a new level of creative work.


Risks & Challenges
This is the team's first crowdfunding campaign, but the risks are relatively minimal. Due to the lack of physical rewards, production costs and shipping are a non-factor. The team's page rates are what they are. In the event of sickness or some other unforeseen circumstances, production of the comic may be delayed for a period of time, but our backers will be the very first to hear about it. Mark has plenty of experience with guiding comics projects from beginning to end, and the rest of the team has established an absolutely professional level of interpersonal communication regarding work.



Please share and recommend our campaign to others!
The only way a campaign like this can succeed is if people talk about it! If you share it on social media, write about it on your blog, or send a link directly to your friends then you will be directly helping this campaign raise awareness and funding.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Hi there!</div>
<div>I am a 42 year old Mom and teacher.  I have a whole lot to say about life, love, and the world we live in.  I have a unique view about things and I will tell it like it is.  I want to call my Blog Marcy's Daily Flavor because I have a good sized following on a trading website called Listia and they love to have me post.  They always say they bid on my auctions just to read my posts and to see what color of Kool-Aid I feel like today.  </div>
<div>I am the mother of 2 children, and I have strong views on parenting and other topics.  Life has not been easy on me.  However, I am still very giving, loving, pure, and have a strong viewpoint on love, and how we should all have an authentic heart  We should be paying it forward and not be screwing each other.  Even though I have very little, I go out of my way to help others and do what I can to make this world a better place. </div>
<div>I tell it like it is.  I want to build a site in which I can share my daily life in a frank, poignant, and humorous way.  I will build a following quickly, honestly, and earnestly.  I have a great work ethic and will dedicate time to this site.</div>
<div>I also want to have a place where people can share their experiences and build friendships on a board.  I want people to learn to pay it forward and work together in this harsh world.  </div>
<div>Unfortunately, this has become a cruel, unforsaken world, We need to get back to a world full of neighbors and helping each other with encouragement and having ""good stuff"" happening to us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What I need:</div>
<div>For this to work:</div>
<div>I need to get a good solid website built with IT help and support.  I need to be able to have helpers and I want this to be something that really takes off and makes a ""MOVEMENT IN OUR WORLD"" ,  FOR that, I need to be able to get started without worry.  I am asking for $15,000 to help start the Marcy's Movement which I think is a hilarious name.  I want to do everything tongue in cheek.  WIth that, as a donator, you will be listed as part of Marcy's Movement on the thank you page!  Also, I am looking at eventually become as part of a site where cetain parts would be a subscription service.  I don't have all of the ins and outs figured out yet. But you would have the 1st year paid for.  This is a dream of mine.  I know I was put on this Earth to make a difference.  Please help!  Become part of Marcy's Movement.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Risk and Challenges:</div>
<div>The Risk is that I won't get funded and that is just a pipe dream.</div>
<div>I was taught by my parents, that anything can be done, we just have to figure it out....I believe it can be done with funding.  On one income, my husband and I probably cannot do this!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Impact!</div>
<div>I believe I can get the word out and with the tough way the world is today.  I believe even if for a while...I can make a small change. I also want to model to my children the difference you can make in the world.  And really to many people $15,000 is a drop in the bucket and this would change my life!!!!! So that I can help others.  If I get funded, I plan to branch out, get more media exposure and roll this into a wild ride to help others get help.....on a whole array of topics..not just one.  Just awareness in general.  I am not looking for my 15 minutes...I want to make a lifetime of impact.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Other ways you can help!</div>
<div>Donate...and live your life in a pure and helpful and kind manner!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! If everyone who reads this simply donates $1 we can make it!  That is a candy bar or a pop!  But you will be making a huge difference in my life and many lives.  PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!! Can you spare that dollar for this cause?  I would be ever so grateful!!!!!</div>
<div>Also, please share, share, share, Pass this link around as much as you can! Get the word out! If you know a newsperson, a media person, someone, please let's get the word out!!!!!!!</div>

Hi there!
I am a 42 year old Mom and teacher.  I have a whole lot to say about life, love, and the world we live in.  I have a unique view about things and I will tell it like it is.  I want to call my Blog Marcy's Daily Flavor because I have a good sized following on a trading website called Listia and they love to have me post.  They always say they bid on my auctions just to read my posts and to see what color of Kool-Aid I feel like today.  
I am the mother of 2 children, and I have strong views on parenting and other topics.  Life has not been easy on me.  However, I am still very giving, loving, pure, and have a strong viewpoint on love, and how we should all have an authentic heart  We should be paying it forward and not be screwing each other.  Even though I have very little, I go out of my way to help others and do what I can to make this world a better place. 
I tell it like it is.  I want to build a site in which I can share my daily life in a frank, poignant, and humorous way.  I will build a following quickly, honestly, and earnestly.  I have a great work ethic and will dedicate time to this site.
I also want to have a place where people can share their experiences and build friendships on a board.  I want people to learn to pay it forward and work together in this harsh world.  
Unfortunately, this has become a cruel, unforsaken world, We need to get back to a world full of neighbors and helping each other with encouragement and having ""good stuff"" happening to us.

What I need:

So that I can help others.  If I get funded, I plan to branch out, get more media exposure and roll this into a wild ride to help others get help.....on a whole array of topics..not just one.  Just awareness in general.  I am not looking for my 15 minutes...I want to make a lifetime of impact.

Other ways you can help!
Donate...and live your life in a pure and helpful and kind manner!!!!!!!

PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! If everyone who reads this simply donates $1 we can make it!  That is a candy bar or a pop!  But you will be making a huge difference in my life and many lives.  PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!! Can you spare that dollar for this cause?  I would be ever so grateful!!!!!
Also, please share, share, share, Pass this link around as much as you can! Get the word out! If you know a newsperson, a media person, someone, please let's get the word out!!!!!!!
Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We've reached our funding goal! The book is definitely happening now! You have until the end of the campaign to secure a copy (by claiming a perk) or regret it for ever ;)
[UPDATE: NEW PERK! Elysium Online iPhone skins and cases! See the ""What do we need & What do you get"" section below, the Perks sidebar or the Updates section]
[UPDATE: Backers can now upgrade their claim to the Original Page Pack for NO extra money!]
[UPDATE: You can now read the first 12 pages of Elysium Online at the Gallery section!]
 
Hello and welcome to our campaign!
 ELYSIUM ONLINE is a full color, 96 page graphic novel by Ilias Kyriazis. 

It’s a sci-fi, horror drama that is as much about the way society deals with mortality as it is about disaster movie type mass destruction.
 It's an ambitious project we've been working on for quite some time. Currently the book is almost halfway finished. We thought that now was the time to present it to the online community, hoping we can get you as excited for the world or ELYSIUM ONLINE as we are!

 
""Just when I thought it was impossible to come up with a fresh, original concept in horror, Ilias Kyriazis has done it. And he drew it beautifully too. Someone needs to tell him there's such a thing as being TOO talented!""
Christos Gage, writer (Avengers Academy, X-men Legacy)
""ELYSIUM is a stunning piece of work.  A fresh concept with wonderfully striking artwork.""Michael Allred, writer/artist (Madman, X-Statix, FF)
 
The story is about Elysium, a revolutionary social network. By logging in you’ll be able to interact with your deceased loved ones who now exist in a digital afterlife. It’s October 2021 and everyone is eagerly anticipating its official release.What no one imagines is that the Elysium dead hate us. Just for being alive. And they’re biding their time until they get online. The moment they do, they’ll take over the internet and use anything with net access, from cars to aircraft carriers to wipe out the living.Paul is an Elysium developer more at ease with the dead than the living. His estranged sister, Anne, is longing to see again her late husband online. Zarya is a goth, teenage beta tester that sees death as an adventure. Together, they’ll have to survive the nightmare that follows the Elysium Release Day.
 
 ""A much scarier and more emotionally hard-hitting version of a Roland Emerich movie!""Mike Carey, writer (X-Men Legacy, Lucifer)""I've worked with some of the greats in the comic book business, so trust me when I say that Ilias is one of them! He writes, he draws, he colors - and he's a master at all of it. No throw some cash in the kitty, because we're all going to benefit from seeing this gorgeous and horrific graphic novel come to life! Or is that come to afterlife?""Scott Lobdell, writer (Superman, Uncanny X-men) 




About the creators
Ilias Kyriazis has been working in comics since 2001. He's had a successful career in Greece, winning a series of awards and creating much-loved books like MANIFESTO, BLOOD OPERA and BLAST Comics.
Lately he's been working mainly for U.S publishers. He's worked together with Scott Lobdell on two mini series, GALAXY QUEST: GLOBAL WARNING and GHOSTBUSTERS: DISPLACED AGGRESSION, and he wrote and drew the graphic novel FALLING FOR LIONHEART (published in Greece as MIA KARDIA GIA TON LEONTOKARDO) for IDW. He also created MELODY for DC/ Zuda (that was nominated for a LULU award for Best Female Character). Recently he drew the 2012 VAMPIRELLA annual for Dynamite. Currently he's doing inks and pencils for an as yet unannounced mini series for the same publisher.
 Joining Ilias is Dimitrios Kasdaglis. He will be drawing a series of “mock Elysium ads” that will be appearing throughout the book in crucial moments.

Dimitrios has been illustrating children's books professionally for more than a decade but always had a sweet tooth for comics.

<h4>We are run this campaign until NOVEBER 28TH!</h4>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are three friends that got together and decided to make a book. Josh created the universe over the last five or so years. He also has some college background from Full Sail University in Computer Animation as well as some fine arts training while growing up. Joshua has been telling stories since he could talk, and good ones too. As for myself, Rebekah, I am currently attending Camden County College for a fine arts degree and have accomplished all of the required art related classes.</p>
<p>The goal is to see our first book in print.

Short Summary
We are three friends that got together and decided to make a book. Josh created the universe over the last five or so years. He also has some college background from Full Sail University in Computer Animation as well as some fine arts training while growing up. Joshua has been telling stories since he could talk, and good ones too. As for myself, Rebekah, I am currently attending Camden County College for a fine arts degree and have accomplished all of the required art related classes.
The goal is to see our first book in print. We have designed a unique world with spirits that live in the clouds of space and speak the language of truth, called, True Tongue, to which Josh constructed. This is just the beginning of what we have created and it would be our pleasure to share it with you.

<p><strong>The project</strong></p>
<p>If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others? —Candide</p>
<p>Everybody wants to rule the world, and they’ll spin the facts as needed. The biggest spin has always been to suggest the world is perfect just the way it is. “Don’t worry, be happy.” But there is no Santa, and you’d better watch out—and take care of what’s near and dear to you. So it goes. That’s the message of the classic novel by Voltaire.</p>
<p>We want to turn that always-relevant book into an awesome graphic novel for a new generation. We’ve got the talent, the passion and the experience to produce a great result if enough people like you think it’s worth doing. In return we’re offering great previews and premiums for every level of contributor.</p>
<p>Candide is a sheltered young man suddenly cast out into a cruel world. The book runs its hero Candide through a gauntlet of woes as he slowly grows disillusioned with his teacher’s sunny philosophy that this is the best of all possible worlds. Voltaire was one of the greatest thinkers of the 18th-century, and Candide became his most well known work despite the uproar after publication. The book was banned and burned across Europe because it took on all the sacred cows—politics, religion, sex and more. It still blazes.</p>
<br/><p><strong>Why We Want To Do This, Why We’re Right For Candide</strong></p>
<p>I’m Jamaal Taylor and I love to read. Candide has been one of my favorite books  and this is a project that I have wanted to do for a while. This is a project that I've commited to seeing through to the end. </p>
<p>I’ve lined up an up-and-coming artist/designer/adapter for this project, Mark Martel. He’s done comics for writers around the world, adapted screenplays to comics and even created comics to promote a New York Times bestseller and a National Geographic documentary. With a background in advertising and marketing, Mark knows all the spin doctor tricks (and how to put some reverse-spin on them for Candide). He’s an unusually versatile stylist who understands the interplay of word and image in the unique medium of comics. He’s already done extensive visual research into a similar historical era. See the Gallery for examples of his work. We’ll be adding sketches for Candide so check back.</p>
<p><strong>Be In On The Creative Process</strong></p>
<p>Together we have adapted the first few pages of Candide. See how the script and original compare with actual comic pages as they’re created. As a contributor you’ll receive updates and previews as the work progresses. Be ready to be hooked.</p>
<p><strong>Why Candide Is Still Necessary</strong></p>
<p>It’s a story that has been around for 200 years, yet still totally relates to today. Candide falls in love, gets tricked into the army, survives wars, a massive earthquake, bounces all over the globe and ends up dodging fanatics in the Middle East. Candide gets starved, beaten, shipwrecked, swindled and nearly flayed alive before he wises up. Despite the massive satire the tale still rings true about human nature. Which is why it’s a classic. </p>
<p><strong>Making The Best Possible Adaptation</strong></p>
<p>For Candide we’re going for a contemporary “Marvel Comics” look and feel to appeal to younger and mainstream comics readers. Don’t worry—Candide isn’t going to become some superhero. But we’ll use the vividness, dynamics, and visual storytelling of top comics to grab the reader and pull them along on this wild tale.</p>
<p>It’s also perfects for a comics adaptation. Many “graphic novels” only run 10 pages. Or they’re a 32-page “adaptation” of a 400-page novel. What’s the point in that? Candide is already a short novel of a mere 100 pages. So we can make a true graphic novel adaptation, staying true to the original while coming in at a length that allows for great art, professional printing and a satisfying reader experience.

<p>Private misfortunes are public benefits; so that the more private misfortunes there are, the greater is the general good. —Dr. Pangloss</p>
</div></div>","The project
If this is the best of all possible worlds, what are the others? —Candide
Everybody wants to rule the world, and they’ll spin the facts as needed. The biggest spin has always been to suggest the world is perfect just the way it is. “Don’t worry, be happy.” But there is no Santa, and you’d better watch out—and take care of what’s near and dear to you. So it goes. That’s the message of the classic novel by Voltaire.
We want to turn that always-relevant book into an awesome graphic novel for a new generation. We’ve got the talent, the passion and the experience to produce a great result if enough people like you think it’s worth doing. In return we’re offering great previews and premiums for every level of contributor.
Candide is a sheltered young man suddenly cast out into a cruel world. The book runs its hero Candide through a gauntlet of woes as he slowly grows disillusioned with his teacher’s sunny philosophy that this is the best of all possible worlds. Voltaire was one of the greatest thinkers of the 18th-century, and Candide became his most well known work despite the uproar after publication. The book was banned and burned across Europe because it took on all the sacred cows—politics, religion, sex and more. It still blazes.
Why We Want To Do This, Why We’re Right For Candide
I’m Jamaal Taylor and I love to read. Candide has been one of my favorite books  and this is a project that I have wanted to do for a while. This is a project that I've commited to seeing through to the end. 
I’ve lined up an up-and-coming artist/designer/adapter for this project, Mark Martel. He’s done comics for writers around the world, adapted screenplays to comics and even created comics to promote a New York Times bestseller and a National Geographic documentary. With a background in advertising and marketing, Mark knows all the spin doctor tricks (and how to put some reverse-spin on them for Candide). He’s an unusually versatile stylist who understands the interplay of word and image in the unique medium of comics. He’s already done extensive visual research into a similar historical era. See the Gallery for examples of his work. We’ll be adding sketches for Candide so check back.
Be In On The Creative Process
Together we have adapted the first few pages of Candide. See how the script and original compare with actual comic pages as they’re created. As a contributor you’ll receive updates and previews as the work progresses. Be ready to be hooked.
Why Candide Is Still Necessary
It’s a story that has been around for 200 years, yet still totally relates to today. Candide falls in love, gets tricked into the army, survives wars, a massive earthquake, bounces all over the globe and ends up dodging fanatics in the Middle East. Candide gets starved, beaten, shipwrecked, swindled and nearly flayed alive before he wises up. Despite the massive satire the tale still rings true about human nature. Which is why it’s a classic. 
Making The Best Possible Adaptation
For Candide we’re going for a contemporary “Marvel Comics” look and feel to appeal to younger and mainstream comics readers. Don’t worry—Candide isn’t going to become some superhero. But we’ll use the vividness, dynamics, and visual storytelling of top comics to grab the reader and pull them along on this wild tale.
It’s also perfects for a comics adaptation. Many “graphic novels” only run 10 pages. Or they’re a 32-page “adaptation” of a 400-page novel. What’s the point in that? Candide is already a short novel of a mere 100 pages. So we can make a true graphic novel adaptation, staying true to the original while coming in at a length that allows for great art, professional printing and a satisfying reader experience. When you’re done reading it you’ll feel you’ve watched a great movie that was just the right length.
What You Get—Perks & Previews!
Money raised will go toward adapting the book to script form and creating all of the artwork. That will take us about 6 months. Funds raised will also go to the first printing of the book for initial orders to comics shops and other outlets. Once on the market, the book can become self-sustaining through print-on-demand. That’s how other independent comics classics like Bone and XYZ made it.
So we need your help to get to that point.

This comic has a nice shiny gloss cover and a nice glossy interior finish.</p><h2>Where did the idea come from?</h2><p>ASININE! has been a work in progress for a couple of years. It started first from a cover originally drawn by Steve Ditko, Space Adventures No. 12, published by Charlton Comics that I (Anthony)  happened upon while researching his work shortly after his passing. Due to my warped sense of humor, I saw it in a different light and had to draw what came to my mind's eye. That being an female astronaut taking a picture of herself with a smart phone thinking she looked cute in her astronaut suit oblivious that her boyfriend was getting attacked by killer robots in the background. My demented and frustrated brain starting thinking of situations that I have witnessed in this modern day, like people keeping their noses stuck to their mobile devices (while walking, driving, sitting in the same room with friends and family), which lead to me internalizing to myself, ""This is funny and yet, ASININE!"" Hence the title came about.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606233505/qmrji7bb0bgrm3p1ciyw.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Being a big fan of Mad Magazine and the horror comics that came out of EC Comics (Tales of the Crypt, Vault of Horror, Impact, ect) &amp; Warren Publishing (Eerie, Creepy, Vampirella, ect), and bronze DC &amp; Marvel horror lines (House of Mystery, Unexpected, Witching Hour, ARRGH!, PLOP!, ect), we felt my short story ideas fit right into an anthology setting like those produced in the past. Most, if not all, had hosts for their stories hence the female astronaut became Candida Vanus. So, if you liked those comics from days long since past, you'll <strong>""moderately like"" </strong>this comic!</p><p>I had already been working on the continuation of Terry Freedom's adventures and the idea for a future Critters adventure.

It was done in a Popeye bigfoot art style similar to Bud Sagendorf. Since, Ink and Feathers Comics has produced several books in it's twenty nine year existence as well contributed some of the proceeds to future artists and writers via Art &amp; Journalism Scholarships through local high schools. We are no strangers to printing and distributing books. Our hope is to continue publishing fun stories for the foreseeable future.</p><p>In continuing this tradition, we have pulled from our vaults the last remaining copies of some of our past publications for rewards to help fund, ASININE! This is your chance to not only catch up on our past OUT OF PRINT works but also contribute to future publications in the works. It is our hope to fund this small comic which will lead to the LAST adventure in the Terry Freedom saga as well and a new extended 40+ paged Critters adventure graphic novel, I'M FAT, and a 300+ paged sequel to The Teddy Bear Conspiracies. We may even reprint certain publications that have not seen print since their first inception (The Mask Conspiracy turns 30 in 2021).</p><h2>Who are we?</h2><p><strong>Anthony Feinman</strong> has briefly studied at School of the Art Institute (SAIC) in Chicago, IL. His first published work can be seen in Myke Feinman's, The Mask Conspiracy. He helped his father with some page breakdowns as well as an illustration or two. His first solo venture, Escape in a Dirigible (2003), was his first graphic novel story that he co-wrote and illustrated. (Some lucky few may get to read this book if they choose the book as a pledge or get a Terry Freedom Package.) He followed that up with web comic Blitz Howser,  jointly produced with A-Z Studios, and the graphic novels, The Magic Press and Tears of the Prophets, the first Critters book and a prequel to the next Terry Freedom adventure. He also produced the anthology publication, Superlative Tales, a pulp era replica from the late 1940's. Anthony also assisted his father with The Teddy Bear Conspiracies novel and it's companion short publication, In Search of the First Teddy Bear. He was also one of the editors for Superlative Tales' followup, Tales of the Outlandish, produced by A-Z Studios. (A few copies of this publication can also belong to a few lucky backers via this campaign.) He spent over half a decade freelancing resulting in his illustrations and designs being seen nationally as well as internationally for limited audiences. He has also been a freelance photographer in his spare time commercially. He's a busy boy on some days...</p><p><strong>Julie Simack</strong> studied and received her BA at Eastern Illinois University (EIU) in Charleston, IL in Art focusing on oil painting. She has done various shows off and on throughout her career throughout the Midwest. Some of her select paintings from over the past 25 years are showcased in this publication throughout the short story, Immortal No More, written by Anthony. She is also the editor, color/content consultant for ASININE and wrote the short story, You're Not Really SIck, Are You?  for this publication. This story will be her debut as a short story author.</p><h3>REWARDS</h3><p>All the book listed below are available for rewards.

Like right now! If you select a reward tier, hit pay, we will be sending you books immediately! Don’t hesitate! Be the first on the block to own history in the making!</p><p>It is always a risk or leap of faith when you putting out work that has not been tested or reviewed. Even more so due to our current medical/political climate and asking folks for funds when it could be better spent on things like FOOD &amp; RENT! (What!? You want to eat AND have a place to live while you read our books? Elitists...) Additionally, international shipping, like the title of this campaign, is ASININE! For that reason, we are limiting this edition to select international regions. (Any international pledgers wishing for phyiscal copies will be receiving some additional comics not available through this campaign.) Once this campaign is over and all pledgers receive their copies, we plan on making a POD version and making it available via Amazon for any foreign fans to order. It will be easier and cheaper to get it to those fans in this fashion as opposed to charging those fans $30-$50 for shipping which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. IF we manage to have a HUGE contribution base, for future projects, we will look into contacting a foreign distributor to send our publications for foreign distribution. We hope that the set rate is enough to cover all costs to get the books to backers safely and in decent condition. The plan is for all products to be protected by the best means necessary to ensure they are received in as pristine condition as possible. Unfortunately, we also can't control the current medical climate which could cause delays in mail being processed in a timely fashion.</p><p>Ink and Feathers Comics is hobby company (independent since 1991). We have mostly only ever done the convention circuit throughout the Midwest. Although all our books have been available through local and chain stores and via Amazon.com plus distribution systems such as Diamond and Ingram, we have never made a push to be seen globally. This campaign will enable fans, old and new from all over, the opportunity to discover or re-discover our past works and well as get on the ground floor of our first new work in half a decade.</p><p>The hope is that this will incite new excitement and potentially set the standard to entice fans wanting to see our additional works in progress such as as sequel to The Critters, Terry Freedom's world, and The Hug characters as well as the re-release of The Mask Conspiracy (it's turning 30 in 2021).</p><p>It's always been hard for independents to find audiences due to comic book fans' reluctance to try new and untested properties. I have been told specifically at conventions by potential fans that they will read MAIN STREAM comics ONLY and they refuse to waste their time on independents. Too bad MAIN STREAM comics are FAILING and have to cut back on publishing content.</p><p>It all comes down to trust. This is your chance to make a leap with us by pledging and letting us know if we should continue on writing and drawing new adventures. We hope you will join us on this new and exciting endeavor!</p></div>","Are you excited! We're excited.... AT LAST! In response to virtually NO requests AT ALL... ASININE is now available for PURCHASE!If you don't like to think for yourself before acting and always wish, ""Can't someone else do it?"", then this comic is not for you! If you are a person who deals with ASININE people on a constant basis and are fed up, READ ON!This limited edition all female cast comic book is 32 pages with experimental colored pages. All line art was rendered via a paint brush and india ink (giving the comic an independent/underground look) and hand lettered with a rusty calligraphy nib. Just like they did it back in the days of Golden Age of Comic Books! The art style is a special blend of some of the great comic book cartoonists. Some examples are: BIll Elder, Wally Wood, Bud Sagendorf, Jack Davis, Sergio Aragones, just to name a few. The work was colored via Photoshop with paintings done by my swell wife, Julie Simack. This comic is now available for immediate purchase! This version will only be available through this campaign. Any future editions (if successfully funded) will be available through Print on Demand and will be available through Amazon.com. What are you waiting for?! Additionally, it should be noted that this comic has a Socio-political/Philosophical theme (look it up but basically commenting about life and social aspects) and some material may not be suitable for an audience younger than high school students. The material is for a mature audience. There is mild cursing and the main characters could be termed as drawn mildly voluptuously for younger readers. This is the first mature publication for Ink and Feathers Comics.We have researched printing companies for quite some time and we found one that will satisfy this book's need. This comic has a nice shiny gloss cover and a nice glossy interior finish.Where did the idea come from?ASININE! has been a work in progress for a couple of years. It started first from a cover originally drawn by Steve Ditko, Space Adventures No. 12, published by Charlton Comics that I (Anthony)  happened upon while researching his work shortly after his passing. Due to my warped sense of humor, I saw it in a different light and had to draw what came to my mind's eye. That being an female astronaut taking a picture of herself with a smart phone thinking she looked cute in her astronaut suit oblivious that her boyfriend was getting attacked by killer robots in the background. My demented and frustrated brain starting thinking of situations that I have witnessed in this modern day, like people keeping their noses stuck to their mobile devices (while walking, driving, sitting in the same room with friends and family), which lead to me internalizing to myself, ""This is funny and yet, ASININE!"" Hence the title came about.Being a big fan of Mad Magazine and the horror comics that came out of EC Comics (Tales of the Crypt, Vault of Horror, Impact, ect) & Warren Publishing (Eerie, Creepy, Vampirella, ect), and bronze DC & Marvel horror lines (House of Mystery, Unexpected, Witching Hour, ARRGH!, PLOP!, ect), we felt my short story ideas fit right into an anthology setting like those produced in the past. Most, if not all, had hosts for their stories hence the female astronaut became Candida Vanus. So, if you liked those comics from days long since past, you'll ""moderately like"" this comic!I had already been working on the continuation of Terry Freedom's adventures and the idea for a future Critters adventure. However, somehow this project started to take over my drawing hand. Before I knew it, I typed up a 12 page short story, titled Immortal No More,  and inked it lickety-split. Immortal No More synopsis: An female artist of retiring age living in a not too distant future becomes a victim of identity fraud.This led to thoughts about my daily drive to work and other encounters with the general public that continually ticked me off. Excursion was whipped out. My wife, Julie, came home one day and vented her frustrations with the current medical system. Poof! You're NOT Really Sick, Are You? was born. Though these stories are a venting of sorts, my hope is that they are also funny as well. The goal is that readers enjoying these stories will experience a plethora of feelings attuned to amusement and bewilderment. The bewilderment coming from that each story that Candida Vanus presents to her audience are loosely based on ACTUAL EVENTS! They are, of course on a small level, exaggerated but none the less true from a myopic point of view of myself and my wife's.  Hopefully, readers will also see a little of themselves in the main characters after the initial read.To see glimpses of other pages, please like and visit our Facebook Page: Ink & Feathers Comics Facebook PageCurious to see previous completed comics in black and white? Click on the link below:ComicFuryNow for something completely different, a small history lesson on Ink and Feathers Comics...In the Beginning...Back in 1991, Myke Feinman produced The Mask Conspiracy, an adventure starring an intrepid reporter, Terry Freedom, set in the 1930's. It was done in a Popeye bigfoot art style similar to Bud Sagendorf. Since, Ink and Feathers Comics has produced several books in it's twenty nine year existence as well contributed some of the proceeds to future artists and writers via Art & Journalism Scholarships through local high schools. We are no strangers to printing and distributing books. Our hope is to continue publishing fun stories for the foreseeable future.In continuing this tradition, we have pulled from our vaults the last remaining copies of some of our past publications for rewards to help fund, ASININE! This is your chance to not only catch up on our past OUT OF PRINT works but also contribute to future publications in the works. It is our hope to fund this small comic which will lead to the LAST adventure in the Terry Freedom saga as well and a new extended 40+ paged Critters adventure graphic novel, I'M FAT, and a 300+ paged sequel to The Teddy Bear Conspiracies. We may even reprint certain publications that have not seen print since their first inception (The Mask Conspiracy turns 30 in 2021).Who are we?Anthony Feinman has briefly studied at School of the Art Institute (SAIC) in Chicago, IL. His first published work can be seen in Myke Feinman's, The Mask Conspiracy. He helped his father with some page breakdowns as well as an illustration or two. His first solo venture, Escape in a Dirigible (2003), was his first graphic novel story that he co-wrote and illustrated. (Some lucky few may get to read this book if they choose the book as a pledge or get a Terry Freedom Package.) He followed that up with web comic Blitz Howser,  jointly produced with A-Z Studios, and the graphic novels, The Magic Press and Tears of the Prophets, the first Critters book and a prequel to the next Terry Freedom adventure. He also produced the anthology publication, Superlative Tales, a pulp era replica from the late 1940's. Anthony also assisted his father with The Teddy Bear Conspiracies novel and it's companion short publication, In Search of the First Teddy Bear. He was also one of the editors for Superlative Tales' followup, Tales of the Outlandish, produced by A-Z Studios. (A few copies of this publication can also belong to a few lucky backers via this campaign.) He spent over half a decade freelancing resulting in his illustrations and designs being seen nationally as well as internationally for limited audiences. He has also been a freelance photographer in his spare time commercially. He's a busy boy on some days...Julie Simack studied and received her BA at Eastern Illinois University (EIU) in Charleston, IL in Art focusing on oil painting. She has done various shows off and on throughout her career throughout the Midwest. Some of her select paintings from over the past 25 years are showcased in this publication throughout the short story, Immortal No More, written by Anthony. She is also the editor, color/content consultant for ASININE and wrote the short story, You're Not Really SIck, Are You?  for this publication. This story will be her debut as a short story author.REWARDSAll the book listed below are available for rewards. It should be noted that a few are only available in limited quantities.

This limited edition was made for a convention we were planning on attending but no one was able to see them due to the current epidemic.Get a limited edition of Tales of the Outlandish by A-Z Studios as a reward. Anthony and Myke Feinman edited this volume for the same authors that worked with them on Superlative Tales. This 66 paged sequel to Superlative Tales has multiple short stories for the seasoned sci-fi reader and is not available for purchase ANYWHERE.Anthony has selected a few 11x17 pieces that he has left from doing comic book conventions from the past two years. These are experimental pieces he created before he started inking ASININE to get the feel of how to use painting brushes. One of them could be yours for only $40 plus a SIGNED copy of ASININE! included! Add OnsAfter you have placed a pledge, how about a nice print to go along with it? Julie has hand picked some of her favorites which she will graciously sign for anyone that would like to include a piece of art to hang on their wall. Get one or get them all! Each piece will be on heavy duty glossy card stock that will look dynamite on a glassed frame! After you add on a print, send us a quick email as to which one(s) you would like us to include.Risks and challengesThis comic is available now. Like right now! If you select a reward tier, hit pay, we will be sending you books immediately! Don’t hesitate! Be the first on the block to own history in the making!It is always a risk or leap of faith when you putting out work that has not been tested or reviewed. Even more so due to our current medical/political climate and asking folks for funds when it could be better spent on things like FOOD & RENT! (What!? You want to eat AND have a place to live while you read our books? Elitists...) Additionally, international shipping, like the title of this campaign, is ASININE! For that reason, we are limiting this edition to select international regions. (Any international pledgers wishing for phyiscal copies will be receiving some additional comics not available through this campaign.) Once this campaign is over and all pledgers receive their copies, we plan on making a POD version and making it available via Amazon for any foreign fans to order. It will be easier and cheaper to get it to those fans in this fashion as opposed to charging those fans $30-$50 for shipping which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. IF we manage to have a HUGE contribution base, for future projects, we will look into contacting a foreign distributor to send our publications for foreign distribution. We hope that the set rate is enough to cover all costs to get the books to backers safely and in decent condition. The plan is for all products to be protected by the best means necessary to ensure they are received in as pristine condition as possible. Unfortunately, we also can't control the current medical climate which could cause delays in mail being processed in a timely fashion.Ink and Feathers Comics is hobby company (independent since 1991). We have mostly only ever done the convention circuit throughout the Midwest. Although all our books have been available through local and chain stores and via Amazon.com plus distribution systems such as Diamond and Ingram, we have never made a push to be seen globally. This campaign will enable fans, old and new from all over, the opportunity to discover or re-discover our past works and well as get on the ground floor of our first new work in half a decade.The hope is that this will incite new excitement and potentially set the standard to entice fans wanting to see our additional works in progress such as as sequel to The Critters, Terry Freedom's world, and The Hug characters as well as the re-release of The Mask Conspiracy (it's turning 30 in 2021).It's always been hard for independents to find audiences due to comic book fans' reluctance to try new and untested properties. I have been told specifically at conventions by potential fans that they will read MAIN STREAM comics ONLY and they refuse to waste their time on independents. Too bad MAIN STREAM comics are FAILING and have to cut back on publishing content.It all comes down to trust. This is your chance to make a leap with us by pledging and letting us know if we should continue on writing and drawing new adventures. We hope you will join us on this new and exciting endeavor!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Come inizia la storia </h3>
<p>I fatti nudi sono pochi: Marco ha ricevuto la sua diagnosi di sclerosi multipla dopo una settimana in ospedale e in questa settimana ha disegnato. Ne è uscito fuori un diario che merita di essere letto, perché è pieno di disegni stupendi, perché parla sommessamente di come la malattia cambi molto ma non tutto, perché fa capire che la diversità, sia essa una malattia, una condizione, uno stile di vita, è solo un punto di vista. </p>

<p>Trigger Men is a dark comedy about two best friends who work as hitmen and their misadventures in the world of contract killing.

<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>
I'm Frank B. Goodin, II - an accomplished independent film-maker with a serious passion for creating good stories.  I've been sitting on this story - LIFE OR DEATH - for some time now, waiting for the right time to make the movie.  It only recently hit me that the story is <strong>PERFECT</strong> for a graphic novel.  When the idea came to me, I literally was like <strong>WOW!</strong>  I couldn't believe I hadn't thought about it before now.  So here we are!</div>
<h3>LIFE OR DEATH - A SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>LIFE OR DEATH is a crime drama that explores how characters reconcile their spirituality when faced with the harsh realities of urban street-life. In essence, the story recreates the gritty existence made popular by mini-series like HBO's 'THE WIRE' and blends a spiritual awareness that is absent from that series.</p>
<p>The story takes place in the urban ghettos of the South – think somewhere in Atlanta or one of several cities in Florida. It opens with an extremely dramatic event in Caleb's life, then proceeds to reveal the events that led to that moment, and the resolution thereafter, in non-linear fashion, similar to films like PULP FICTION, CITY OF GOD and AMORES PERROS.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, LIFE OR DEATH is a powerful narrative of one young man's struggle to do what he thinks is right when faced with tough choices. However, as the story unfolds we discover the rich, interconnected subplots of other characters who are also struggling, in their own ways, with their concepts of spirituality as they do what they feel they must in order to survive and progress in this ruthless underworld - the only world they know.</p>
<h3><strong>I Need Your Help!</strong></h3>
<p>I have worked very hard to craft an intricate story that many readers will not only find entertaining, but insightful.  Within the context of graphic novels, there is nothing currently out like this story.  Even in the world of film-making, this story is a well crafted blend of two seemingly unmatchable genres... which two genres I'll let you discover for yourself.</p>
<p>But I need your contribution to properly produce, publish and distribute this great story.  LIFE OR DEATH and it's audience deserve each other, so please help me if you can!</p>
<h3>How Your Contribution Helps Me</h3>
<p>LIFE OR DEATH will be produced in six separate comic book isues, creating a nice series.  After these are complete, I will then combine all six issues into a single, limited edition Hardcover graphic novel - Volume 1.</p>
<p>The budget to produce and independently distribute each issue the way I'm planning is $2,600 per issue.  After Indiegogo takes a small percentage, that will leave just enough to pay my very talented illustrator Youmin Park (a rising star whose style is perfect for this series), create and maintain the official website, print a small number of comics (mostly for perk rewards and promotional purposes), and organize a targeted advertising campaign for this graphic novel.  Every penny of your contribution will go towards this; if enough people love the story then any profit for me will come much later.</p>
<p>I'm focused on creating the best graphic novel I can for you, the readers, because you deserve it.  But I do need your help to make it happen, and I've set up some very cool perks at different donation levels to say thank you for helping me bring LIFE OR DEATH to the world!  Most of these perks will only be available here for you special contributors who supported this vision before it has manifested, so please take a short moment to browse through them.  If a particular perk jumps out at you, don't hesitate to send me your contribution.  I can't thank you enough for your decsion to support this project, but as you'll see from the perks, I can certainly have a go at it!</p>
<h3>About Fundraising</h3>
<p>I can't know for sure if I'll be able to raise this goal of $2,600.  I've kept the goal as low as I could to properly address the various costs I explained earlier.  It's possible that I might not hit this fundraising goal, but have no worries if this happens - I will complete Issue #1 and send all promised perks to you.  It might simply take a bit longer (I'll be saving a bit of my paycheck from my job for this).</p>
<p>It's also very possible that I not only hit the fundraising goal, but exceed it.  If this happens, all extra funding would go towards Issue #2 of the LIFE OR DEATH saga. Let's say by some amazing stroke of good fortune, I happen to raise enough for the first two issues ($5,200)... then the extra funding will be used for Issue #3, and will continue in this fashion towards all six issues of Volume 1.  When you check out the perks, you'll see that I've set them up in such a way that makes this possible.</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic that once Issue #1 is released to the public, readers will want to know what comes next, so as you can see I'm quite obviously hoping that the popularity of this series will grow over time.  If the series contained within Volume 1 is successful, I've already outlined two more Volumes for LIFE OR DEATH - a sequel and a prequel.  So I'm hoping that I'm at the start of something that has the potential to be quite popular, and I'm extending the opportunity for you to be right here with me at the starting line, so please support me if you can - I certainly need it!</p>
<h3>If You Want To Help, But Don't Have Money...</h3>
<p>There is a another <strong>HUGE</strong> way everyone can help this campaign - make a lot of noise about it!  Tweet about it to your friends - talk about it and share this page on Facebook!  Use the sharing tools right at the top of this Indiegogo page to spread the word that LIFE OR DEATH the graphic novel is coming soon, and that I'm raising funds right now.  If you use the sharing tools located here, I can keep track, and I will give various 'thank you' perks to those who are giving their time to spread the word to show that I appreciate you just as much as those who can help by contributing funding.</p>
<h2><strong>WE'RE EXCITED!</strong></h2>
<p>Youmin and I are so excited about this project that we've already started; we have complete faith that the funding will come.</p>
<p>So I want to share with you a bit of the process and one completed page of the actual story!</p>
<h2>It All Starts With The Script...</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/qejx0fg6l/LIFE_OR_DEATH_GRAPHIC_NOVEL_PG_0_page_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Well, that's how the saying goes anyway.  :-)  It all <strong>really</strong> starts with a good idea that must be carefully crafted into a great script.  Most of the time, this is a very challenging &amp; time-consuming process.  <em>Ah, how great is the pain writers often experience as they work to produce something worth reading!</em>  It can even be a bit lonely at times, but any successful writer will tell you that the reward is worth the challenge, hands down.</p>
<p>From developing the concept, to writing and re-writing the several drafts after reader reviews from screenwriting services &amp; competitions, I have given many months to LIFE OR DEATH.  If I had to estimate, I'd guess it has taken somewhere between 12 - 18 months to develop the story to where it is now.</p>
<p>Once I share the all of the story fundamentals with the great Youmin Park, she does a few quick sketches of the main characters, some locations, etc. for me to approve.  Her work brings the story to life!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/nzs1fzzxp/Characters_new_sketch.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/8437cp9d9/L_O_D_Inspector_character_design.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After we get on the same page about the fundamentals, we get to work on the comic pages.  Here's an example:</p>
<p><strong>I send a page from the script:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/68gf1jkj1/LIFE_OR_DEATH_GRAPHIC_NOVEL_PG_6_page_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Then Youmin will interpret the scene, sketch a quick visual layout, and make changes if necessary:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s20.postimg.org/b24rk56el/PAGE_10_rough_sketch.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><em><strong>I love Youmin's style!!!</strong></em></p>
<h2>
<br/>One Final Note About Story...</h2>
<p>I've mentioned several times how powerful I think this story is... please trust that I'm not saying this as hype.  I hold an MFA in Film-making from FSU's Graduate Film school - one of the top film schools in the country.  I've won an Emmy Award for my first independent documentary (called 'THE 904'), and I've won several film festivals with my first indie feature LOVE TRAP, which is currently on Netflix.  Please trust me when I promise to reward your support with a great graphic novel in LIFE OR DEATH.</p>
<p>But you don't have to take only my word for it... here is some of what a few industry readers had to say about LIFE OR DEATH:</p>
<p><em><strong>""An excellent story! I recognize the effort and dedication put forth by the writer to move the translation process from base idea to solid premise, and finally to an entertaining story. Well done.  As stated, the story itself is not only entertaining – it is compelling. The characters are well thought out and evolve along with the telling of the story. There is an exciting flow and rhythm to this story – with sufficient beats to maintain audience interest.""</strong></em> <strong>- Larry Miles, Red Inkworks</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>""The main characters are strong and much of the dialogue powerful.  In fact the writing here is excellent so I’m giving the script CONSIDER for the writer."" </strong></em><strong>- Reader ""AP"" from Coverage, Ink.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>""LIFE OR DEATH is certainly a very competently written screenplay with a strong moral message, exciting sequences and really sharp dialogue... there is obvious writing talent on display here."" - </strong></em><strong>Reader ""KO"" from Coverage, Ink.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>""Frank—Good job on your script. It was very realistic and gritty and an intriguing read.  I did feel that your story was very realistic and insightful and think that it does </strong><strong>reach out across cultures.  You’ve hit a universal note in that it’s a part of the human condition to struggle between doing what’s right and doing what’s easy and not necessarily good.  Killer job on your dialogue! Your characters all have wonderfully unique voices.  Bravo!  Also, I noticed and appreciated great moments throughout your script but there was no chance to mention all of them in this critique.""</strong></em></p>
<p>- <strong>Cheryl Herring, A Feeding Frenzy Screenplay Competition</strong></p>
<p>Of course, the story wasn't perfect.  All of these readers had various critiques for the story that I haven't listed here, but I have used to make the story even stronger than it was when they read it.  So please support me with the notion that you are supporting something great and deserving, because you are.  :-)</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Nick Davis the Author of A Teddy Bear Tale - Unconditional <br/>and I welcome you to the IndieGoGo Project for A Teddy Bear Tale II - Faithful.</p>
<p>This is the second Teddy Bear Tales book and it is a fully illustrated all ages tale of imagination and wonder that continues the story of our Heroic Teddy Bear Tristan as he protects his child from the Monsters in the night.</p>

<h3>What is A Teddy Bear Tale II - Faithful about?</h3>
<p>In A Teddy Bear Tale II we begin to explore more of Tristan’s unique world. First we meet a new companion a slightly nutty plushy Bunny called Wilma, the once cuddly toy of the Tristan's Boy’s sister. She is introduces a Boggle, a curious creature that repairs broken and discarded toys to pass on to other children who deserve them.</p>

<p>Together they wake up Tristan from his long sleep in the attic asking for his help to ward off a Giant Green Headed Monster that is stealing all the toys and is after the secret Boggle Toy Train.</p>

<p>Of course our heroic Teddy Bear agrees to help and with Wilma they set off in the Golden Goose, a bright yellow cardboard biplane that his boy once built him for a imaginative adventure, to get onboard the Toy Train before the Green Headed Monster and his Monster Minions capture it.</p>

<p>This brand new adventure featuring planes, trains, clockwork riding beasts, new Monsters and dashing deeds. As Tristan defends happiness and the Toy Train from the Green Headed Monster in beautiful full color illustrations...</p>
<p>Please enjoy the follow extract below...</p>
<p><em>All around him Tristan’s world began to shake; the jungle vista gave way to a messy boy’s room, strewn with toys, wooden blocks and a crashed cardboard yellow biplane. Then his world shook again the vision of the room vision melted to be replaced with a bluey inky darkness and the smell of a musty cardboard box.  Tristan could now hear voices. Was his boy finally coming back for him? Excitement grew inside the Teddy Bear very soon he would be reunited with his boy and be able to resume his role as the most faithful of companions. Tristan could feel a warm glow inside him soon he would feel the joy of being played with again. For it had been a long time since Tristan was packed away and left to slumber in the dark, and he was feeling very lonely.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>The tape on the box snapped, the lid opened and a yellow light shone in his face. Blinking Tristan could make out two shadowy figures, one shorter than the other and he raised his paw to shield his eyes from the light. He could see a grubby white furred Bunny, with light blue eyes, lopped ears tied with red ribbon, wearing a tatty pink tutu and holding silver handled flashlight. Almost immediately Tristan was seized up and hugged so tight he thought his eyes were going to pop out. The Bunny was Wilma, the cuddly toy that once belonged to his boy’s sister and she was the sometimes partner on his adventures. Wilma finally released Tristan and starting talking a mile a minute about how she was rescued from a very damp box and how they searched the entire attic for him once the Boggles had learned that Tristan was up here. Wilma’s introduced her companion an old Boggle, a crooked nosed creature that takes discarded and broken toys, fixes them and leaves them in the room of deserving children. Indeed this Boggle was the very same one Tristan had encountered many years ago sorting through his child’s old toys. The Boggle shook Tristan’s paw and to the Teddy Bear’s great surprise asked for his help.</em></p>

</div></div>","Hello, my name is Nick Davis the Author of A Teddy Bear Tale - Unconditional and I welcome you to the IndieGoGo Project for A Teddy Bear Tale II - Faithful.
This is the second Teddy Bear Tales book and it is a fully illustrated all ages tale of imagination and wonder that continues the story of our Heroic Teddy Bear Tristan as he protects his child from the Monsters in the night.



What is A Teddy Bear Tale II - Faithful about?
In A Teddy Bear Tale II we begin to explore more of Tristan’s unique world. First we meet a new companion a slightly nutty plushy Bunny called Wilma, the once cuddly toy of the Tristan's Boy’s sister. She is introduces a Boggle, a curious creature that repairs broken and discarded toys to pass on to other children who deserve them.




Together they wake up Tristan from his long sleep in the attic asking for his help to ward off a Giant Green Headed Monster that is stealing all the toys and is after the secret Boggle Toy Train.

Of course our heroic Teddy Bear agrees to help and with Wilma they set off in the Golden Goose, a bright yellow cardboard biplane that his boy once built him for a imaginative adventure, to get onboard the Toy Train before the Green Headed Monster and his Monster Minions capture it.

This brand new adventure featuring planes, trains, clockwork riding beasts, new Monsters and dashing deeds. As Tristan defends happiness and the Toy Train from the Green Headed Monster in beautiful full color illustrations...
Please enjoy the follow extract below...
All around him Tristan’s world began to shake; the jungle vista gave way to a messy boy’s room, strewn with toys, wooden blocks and a crashed cardboard yellow biplane. Then his world shook again the vision of the room vision melted to be replaced with a bluey inky darkness and the smell of a musty cardboard box.  Tristan could now hear voices. Was his boy finally coming back for him? Excitement grew inside the Teddy Bear very soon he would be reunited with his boy and be able to resume his role as the most faithful of companions. Tristan could feel a warm glow inside him soon he would feel the joy of being played with again. For it had been a long time since Tristan was packed away and left to slumber in the dark, and he was feeling very lonely. 
The tape on the box snapped, the lid opened and a yellow light shone in his face. Blinking Tristan could make out two shadowy figures, one shorter than the other and he raised his paw to shield his eyes from the light. He could see a grubby white furred Bunny, with light blue eyes, lopped ears tied with red ribbon, wearing a tatty pink tutu and holding silver handled flashlight. Almost immediately Tristan was seized up and hugged so tight he thought his eyes were going to pop out. The Bunny was Wilma, the cuddly toy that once belonged to his boy’s sister and she was the sometimes partner on his adventures. Wilma finally released Tristan and starting talking a mile a minute about how she was rescued from a very damp box and how they searched the entire attic for him once the Boggles had learned that Tristan was up here. Wilma’s introduced her companion an old Boggle, a crooked nosed creature that takes discarded and broken toys, fixes them and leaves them in the room of deserving children. Indeed this Boggle was the very same one Tristan had encountered many years ago sorting through his child’s old toys. The Boggle shook Tristan’s paw and to the Teddy Bear’s great surprise asked for his help.

<h2>Making it Count</h2>
<p>GU is a 13 year old webcomic, born of MMO guild chat, that grew into an industry wide love letter. And where viewer numbers are still pretty high, ad revenue is terrible. I'd like to be able to do the comics without focussing on that aspect of the ""business"". </p>
<p><img alt=""GU Header"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fancypeanut.com/gucomics/header.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""GU Header""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Needs and Wants</h3>
<p>I've drilled it down to ask for as little as possible. $13,500 minus the fees and such won't be enough to completely meet the need, it will ease the situation a bit and let me scrap the tower ad from the site. Meeting stretch goals will allow us to peel other ads off the site as well. We'll talk about that later though.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Ads Suck</h3>
<p>Though the total ad value on my site is worth far more than $12,000 per position for an entire year, that's all I need to get buy. And if I can get away from dependence on Ad revenue I can focus more on the comic, commissions, and playing games which is what the site is all about.</p>
<p>So, if we hit the first $13,500, we'll pull the 160x600 tower add off of the site. At the first stretch goal we'll take down the 728x90 leaderboard ad. At the second we'll tear down the last vesitages of the Ad State and proclaim our freedom from it's regime for a full year. </p>
<h3>No Cash? No Problem!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you don't have any cash on hand, don't worry. Trust me; I understand. But please feel free to tell other people about the project. Facebook, Twitter, IndieGoGo's share tools, emails to freinds, family and guild mates, forums posts, whatever you feel comfortable with.</p>

<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above if we hit the $13,500 goal we'll take the primary ad position (160x600) off of the GU site entirely. But there's more work that can be done.</p>
<h3>$27,000 - Remove the Leaderboard Ad</h3>
<p>If I'm honest, I'd like to see this 728x90 ad unit go first. But from the standpoint of redesigning the website (which I'm currently in the process of doing) it's easier to have this location be the second size to come down.</p>
<h3>$40,500 - Remove the Ad Block</h3>
<p>The 300x250 Ad Block is the most innocuous of the bunch. It's a natural fit for removal last because it's so easy to move and code around.</p>
<h3>$45,000 - No Commission Come-Ons</h3>
<p>I know there will be readers that will want commissions no matter what. But I also know that there are some readers who don't like seeing the Artist For Sale! and GU Commissions banners. So if we hit this stretch, I will make every effort to avoid hawking my artistic wares. The only exception would be in the case of an unforseen emergency.</p>
<h3>$60,000 - Bonus Comics!</h3>
<p>If by some miracle we manage to hit $60,000 I will produce -AT LEAST- 2 bonus, non-GU comics per month, for a year, based on my group's table top gaming experiences. These comics will also be provided ad free.</p>
<h3>$75K - ???</h3>
<p>I'll tell you about this exciting stretch goal if we hit $40,500 and strip all ads off the site.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">FAQ</span></h2>
<p><strong>I've got more questions, where can I send them?</strong> indiegogo@gucomics.com</p>
<p><strong>What is the Fancast? </strong>The Fancast is a part of the GU Forums where I post artwork that's not readily available elsewhere on the site. I'm hoping that I willl get to ad even more Fancast Content if the Project funds and I don't have to worry about dealing with ad revenue.</p>
<p><strong>About the Random Panel Reward Perk? </strong>The random selection will be made from the available panels ($25 and up), after the Pick-A-Panel funders make their choices. You can see what's currently available here: <a href=""http://www.gucomics.com/archives/pricelist.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gucomics.com/archives/pricelist.php</a></p>
<p><strong>Quick-Sketch Perk: can I pick the subject matter? </strong>Requests are welcomed, but please keep it to just a few words. Otherwise the quick sketch is not so quick. Please also note: These will not be digitally produced. There aren't many my tangible sketches floating around.<br/><br/><strong>Can fans buy a Corporate Sponsorship for a game they like? </strong>Yes, if a group of players got together to buy a ""corporate sponsor""ship, I would certainly focus on their game of choice for a month. A couple of things to note though: 1) It would still have to be a game that I could personally endorse and play. 2) I would not be able to put that game's ads into my ad inventory without the game developer's permission.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you don't hit $13,500?</strong> Depending on your perk level you will be given access to the Fancast for the listed amount of time. If we manage to bring in $8000 or more I will add a login to the main GU site so that Fancast members still receive an ad free GU.</p>
<p><strong>What if you go over $75K? </strong>Yeah this is highly unlikely. Honestly I'd be surprised is we even hit the goal. But, just in case, I have plans for up to $200K. If we get anywhere near $75, I will dream up more stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>When will the ad free site go live? </strong>Immediately. Because we're using Flex Funding, as soon as I get the email from Indiegogo that says we hit our goal, I'll go in and pull the 160x600 ad from the site's code. Same with each of the other ad removal stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Why are the delivery dates so many months away?</strong> Really it's just giving myself plenty of buffer time JUUUST incase. I expect everything will be finished and out the door much sooner than the ""estimated delivery date"".</p>
<p><strong>Didn't Penny Arcade already do this?</strong> Yup.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The first stories of fantastic creatures and people with god-like abilities first surfaced in Greece in the 8th century BC.  We are all aware of these Greek Gods and their stories.  What if I told you these stories where inspired by some real-life events?  1,500 years prior to the first accounts of the Greek Gods, the book of Genesis records in chapter 6 a peculiar event.  It recounts ""the sons of God"" coming to Earth and looking upon the daughters of men and enjoying what they see.  These angels began to produce offspring with human women and the outcome was an angel/human hybrid called the Nephilim.  These Nephilim have their own stories and lore which is all very similar to the stories of the Greek Gods.  As it turns out, these tales of Zeus and Poseidon have some roots in reality.  Like any good story, there is a bit of truth sprinkled with fiction.  </p>
<p>Now what if the real-life inspiration for the Greek Gods, the Nephilim, left behind a little bit of their DNA and over the years it has been lying dormant in men and women walking the streets today like a recessive trait just waiting to wake up?  Rather than having a recessive trait that makes you a ginger, or have blue eyes, you could have a recessive traits that gives you the ability to lift buildings, or control time itself!</p>
<p>That is exactly what happens in Hybrids (angel/human hybrids) The Sons of Gods (ancestors of the Greek Gods).  Seemingly out of nowhere people begin to develop great abilities like the ancient Greek Gods when all of a sudden, these ""hybrids"" begin to vanish!  Our story follows a small band of heroes desperately trying to stop these traffickers from taking anymore hybrids after their own loved ones have been taken.  They are trying to learn who is taking them, where are they taking them, and possibly most disturbing, WHY ARE THEY TAKING THEM?:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Luke Stone and I am the writer and artist behind this series.  For the past 10 years I have worked to research and develop this story to not only offer an interesting concept, but to build a plot that helps develop these amazing characters. I also attempt to offer a fresh perspective to matters of faith and humanity within the story. </li>
<li>This campaign is designed to help people get up to speed with Hybrids as it nears the end of its first 5 issue arc.  Issue 4 begins to truly form the world around our characters and we begin to see some deeply human traits in these god-like beings.  You even get a chance to see how some of those ""normal"" humans can have a tenacity and passion that surpasses even the strongest Titan!</li>
<li>Your contribution will help me bring the rest of this story to comic fans all over.  The cost of producing a book like this is not cheap and further more, the cost of printing and marketing can overwhelm the indie artist quickly.  With your help, I will be able to take this book to the next level!  We will print enough copies to seek widespread distribution and hopefully have enough left to fully produce issue 5 which concludes the first of 3 planned arcs of Hybrids: The Sons of Gods.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you are still with me, I want to give some more details to what exactly we are trying to do.:</p>
<p>Printing/Sales - Currently, Hybrids is printed in low runs and sold primarily at conventions and through the Star Cross Comics website.  We aim to get a larger print run of all 4 current issues and find a more wide spread distribution of the books to brick and mortar retailers.  We are seeking a few methods right now including direct to store distribution through Star Cross and possibly a submission to DCD.</p>
<p>We are offering to you some very exclusive items that will only be available in the current form for a limited time.  Issues 1-2 will get a complete overhaul of covers and some minor content changes. All 4 issues will receive a new variant. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Additional Insight</h3>
<p>Something you may not know about me is that I am a full-time pastor in Jacksonville.  I have alway loved comics and even submitted my first art samples to Marvel at age 14!  They said no...  </p>
<p>I have also wanted to find a way to allow my faith to influence comics without preaching a message or creating a 20 page run down to what we all already know.  I wanted to present people of faith in a more realistic light.  I wanted to give believers and non - believers alike something that they can connect over and just maybe allow them the chance to spark some real conversation about their own journeys.  I mostly just want people to be inspired to make the world a better place for someone else the best they can.  </p>
<p>That is why this book is not a ""Christian Comic"".  It is, however, a comic written from a  Christian's world view.  It challenges people of faith just as much as it does those without it.  Hopefully, it blurs the lines that society draws to divide us and helps us all see that we have a bit more in common than we realize.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's pretty tough taking the next step no matter what that step is.  For me, it's breaking the barrier of low print runs and subsequently limited sales.  Without some financial freedom to take a calculated risk, I won't be able to do that.  Additionally, rerunning the entire line to distribute to retailers with a more uniform look and feel could leave me with bundles of books in my garage if I don't manage to distribute to local shops.  </p>

<h3>3 Ways to Help if $$ is Tight:</h3>
<p>I know that a financial contribution may not be possible but you may still want to help with the cause.  Here are some ways that you can actively help get this project to the next level.</p>

<p>2. Share the campaign with your friends and family through conversation, email, or social media.  Post it in Facebook groups and even let some of your favorite comics outlets know about the book!</p>
<p>3. Go to your local comic shop and ask if they would be willing to stock a couple copies of each issue for you.  We will do consignment but we are working right now to offer a 40% or greater discount to the retailers who purchase direct!</p>

I only get one shot at this, and to do it right, I'm going to need your help.<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>Shin Nihon Keikaku (The New Plan In Japan) is a book-length (100+ pages) travelogue in comic form. The Kawaiikochans are going to have a big adventure traveling around (mostly) Tokyo, focusing on gaming and arcades, with anime/manga and other geek fascinations sprinkled throughout.</p>(I'm not planning for print, however; at 100+ color pages, the print-on-demand solutions I've used in the past would be prohibitively expensive for a small comic like this one.)<br/><br/>They'll run you through Akiba inside and out. They'll go out of the way to hunt for treasure. They'll fill you in on games from Japan that few outside of the country know about or have even seen, in info-dense ""all about"" segments. They'll have fun in the usual silly Kawaiikochan comics that fans know and love.<br/><br/>The following sample mockup, made with photos from a 2012 Japan trip, 
should give you an idea of what to expect in the finished product. I 
also did a rough, early version of this treatment at <a href=""http://kawaiikochan.tumblr.com/post/111907765341/we-went-there-barcade-game-center-check-hi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barcade</a> in New York City.<br/><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Hi,‭ ‬it's Dave.‭ ‬I'm a freelance writer specializing in geek matters: I've written for Anime News Network, Otaku USA, Japan's own animeanime (in English), Colony Drop, and, one time, the dearly departed Joystiq.I'm also the author of Kawaiikochan‭!! ‬Gaming no Korner,‭ ‬an unusual‭ ‬4-panel webcomic about two girls (Masaka is on the left, Majide is on the right) playing videogames,‭ ‬drinking bubble tea,‭ ‬and having a good time...‭ ‬while at the mercy of a capricious translation.In mid-summer,‭ ‬I am going to be vacationing in Tokyo with friends.‭ ‬Given the nature of Kawaiikochans, a trip to Japan is obviously a huge opportunity for the comic, one I'm unlikely to have again for a long time. That being such, I decided I'd take this chance for everything it's worth and turn my vacation into the biggest Kawaiikochan project ever: a travelogue in Japan with the gamesoft-loving kawaiis. I only get one shot at this, and to do it right, I'm going to need your help.   
 
Shin Nihon Keikaku (The New Plan In Japan) is a book-length (100+ pages) travelogue in comic form. The Kawaiikochans are going to have a big adventure traveling around (mostly) Tokyo, focusing on gaming and arcades, with anime/manga and other geek fascinations sprinkled throughout.(I'm not planning for print, however; at 100+ color pages, the print-on-demand solutions I've used in the past would be prohibitively expensive for a small comic like this one.)They'll run you through Akiba inside and out. They'll go out of the way to hunt for treasure. They'll fill you in on games from Japan that few outside of the country know about or have even seen, in info-dense ""all about"" segments. They'll have fun in the usual silly Kawaiikochan comics that fans know and love.The following sample mockup, made with photos from a 2012 Japan trip, 
should give you an idea of what to expect in the finished product. I 
also did a rough, early version of this treatment at Barcade in New York City.

The goal of the project is to find interesting and unusual stuff-- like an arcade inside of an airport where all the games are about flying commercial airliners-- and present it in a fun way, through the kawaiis.See also the newly finished preview (1) (2), in which the Kawaiikochans see the gaming sights in my native New York City!We'll be staying in Tokyo, a stone's throw from Akihabara, the geek district of the world, where maids hand out flyers on every street corner.Akiba is by no means the only area of Tokyo I wish to explore‭: there's a lot there, but it's pretty small, geographically speaking! ‬However, it is certainly going to be home base for the vacation (our favorite videogame bar is there),‭ ‬and you can expect a full rundown of the area.‭ The plan is to start from Akiba, and work our way out.We'll also be hopping on the Shinkansen all the way to Kyoto, with a detour in Osaka to see some wrestling! (Masaka wasn't kidding about that in the video. NJPW Dominion 2015. I bought the ticket. Get hype.)As for what the kawaiis will be doing, the focus will of course be on their beloved gamesoft. If you're going to Japan and you love videogames, game centers (arcades) are an obvious choice. Unlike in the West, the Japanese arcade is still an active institution, and there are tons of games there that will never leave the arcade; in many cases they won't even leave the nation of Japan.In addition to the traditional shooters and fighting games that gamers around the world know well,‭ ‬the Japanese arcade has been moving more and more to experiences that are impossible to replicate at home. You can expect an arcade game version of beer pong, collectible card games that bring your cards to life on the battlefield, music games with increasingly bonkers controls, an online deathmatch light-gun shooter that requires you to make the poses from Equilibrium, and yes, that game where you flip a table. And that's just scratching the surface! I didn't even tell you about the 18-player horse race betting simulator!There is so much fascinating stuff in Japanese arcades, and usually no way for people outside of Japan to play it but to get on a plane! One of the main goals of this project is to provide much-needed English-language coverage of this neglected corner of the gaming world. Attention will also be given to the locations themselves, from the several world-class arcades within walking distance in Akiba, to the amusement park where the rides are also games, to the holes-in-the-wall where salarymen plug away at online mahjong under ceilings so low they can't stand up.
Though Majide's personal quest for more home gamesoft is so comprehensive it spans the whole universe, she can also show you where to go in the Akiba and Tokyo areas. The thrill of the hunt takes her from game shops so comprehensive they double as museums... to some places you might not think of looking.
Anime culture is in the blood of Kawaiikochans as much as it is in the blood of Akiba. The neighborhood is absolutely littered with anime and hobby shops! We're going to check out the spots and show you where to go for what. Here's another mockup page made from my 2012 visit to the life-size Gundam in Odaiba.
(Though this doesn't strictly fall into the ""anime"" category, I have already solemnly sworn to ""location hunt"" some spots from tokusatsu (live-action Japanese superhero) shows.)Obviously not every single detail of the vacation is going to be about games, or anime, or even nerdy stuff. It would be sort of weird if it was, don't you think?The place we’re staying, the places we visit, the trains and the vending machines and all that: they’ll get kawaiied up just as much as if they were videogames! The game stuff will be framed with these kinds of details.It’s okay that the Kawaiikochans have been established canonically as already existing in Japan. They are still full of wonder, and everything is amazing to them.
I'm not actually going to be putting the comics together in Japan‭; ‬my time there is precious and I'm going to be trying to get as much done for this project as I possibly can in those nine days.‭ ‬Furthermore,‭ ‬this project is going to take a lot longer than nine days to put together.Therefore, while I'm in Japan, armed with camera and notebook, I'm going to be a fairly obnoxious tourist.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Aleksi Siirtola. I am a 24-year-old aspiring cartoonist and graphic novel aficionado, attempting to break into the comic business. In development since 2007, my series ""The Fugitive Below the Surface"" is a dark, mature fantasy graphic novel series centered around the exploits of its protagonist Everett Montano and his quest for vengeance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the series - the first part now finished and the second one in production - was not picked up by any publisher, and thus its existence relies on the sales of self-published copies and much-appreciated donations.</p>
<p>That is where You come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Drawing comics is cheap and very fun - the estimated costs of creating Conviction (the first part of the Fugitive series) were only about 250$. Sadly, self-publishing comics and getting computers strong enough to run software to color your art is not cheap. That is why I'm asking for Your help: any donation will help, and will be rewarded (refer to the perk list on the right for more info on that :)</p>
<p>How will donations aid the comic? They will make the Fugitive Below the Surface possible, and speed up its production - the less worries and trouble with money, the more time to draw! Finding a publisher is also rather costly, and is far easier to do with the aid of donations.</p>

<p>100% of donations will go to further the cause of the Fugitive Below the Surface: printing copies and sending them to publishers, getting better hardware, buying equipment (paper, pens, ink etc.) and so on.</p>
<p>If you're worried that I won't be reaching my full goal, don't worry. Every last cent helps and makes the drawing process easier, not to mention attempts to acquire a publisher.</p>
<p>What will you get for your donation? Intangibly, you get to help a struggling artist along, and know that you helped to realize The Fugitive Below the Surface: The Insurrection. Tangibly, donators are credited, given exclusive digital artbooks (one that isn't for sale, only available to donators) and unique memorabilia with sufficiently high donations.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Impressed with the comic but can't afford to donate? Don't worry - spread the word! No matter how you choose to share The Fugitive Below the Surface - be it facebook, twitter, myspace, podcasts, personal websites or just good ol' word of mouth - it is more than welcome.

<p><b>The Fugitive Below the Surface: Conviction</b></p>
<p>Conviction is the first part of the Fugitive series. Taking place in a fantasy setting in the late industrial age and following the exploits of Everett Montano, a young man who becomes entangled in revenge after his best friend is brutally murdered in front of his eyes, Conviction is at the same time sad, touching, funny and gripping. </p>
<p>Everett's vengeance proves more difficult than expected, however, when he is unable to find the killer. To do so, he enlists the help of a clandestine criminal service, but is forced to work as an assassin in order to pay for the rather expensive services. Will Everett find his friend's killer, and will he be able to not lose himself as his passion for revenge consumes him? <br/></p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">The Fugitive Below the Surface: Insurrection</span></p>
<p>The direct sequel to Conviction, Insurrection deals with the destructive civil war of Everett's adoptive country, the Depthlands.

A dark, powerful tale of political intrigue, betrayal, war, assassination and love, the insurrection will leave no one untouched.

<p>* A new printed edition of the Fugitive Below the Surface: Conviction (estimated: 2000-3000$. You need to make a sufficiently large edition in order to make the copies cheap enough for purchasers.)</p>
<p>* A new computer for colorization, to speed up progress on the Insurrection (estimated: 4000$)</p>
<p>* Promotion costs (i.e. postage costs, free copies etc) for the series to obtain a publisher (estimated 100$+)</p>
<p>* Any other funds that exceed the above will be saved for any instance that requires them (such as my drawing tablet, which is getting on in years, might break down and need replacement), so that Insurrection can have my full attention.

We have some new images of character designs for you all to see!






Update (October 31st, 2011)
And so it begins.
I have just recently finished the scripting of the short prologue for the first of a series of web comics set in the world of Evadire that I have spent so long crafting from the ground up.


This first story follows the life of Faron Vaelen, the young daughter of a blacksmith and former war veteran from a poor fishing village named Port Orastine as she learns from a mysterious old friend of his father's what the goddess of fate has in store for her future.


Faron will learn the many arts of magic and become stronger as she grows older. She will raise up above the call of duty and fight alongside her allies as a new war begins, and a much more sinister threat emerges from its ashes.

I hope this has intrigued you all a little more than this project has been, and I hope that you will join us regularly as this project gets underway!
Our Story
Hey there everyone,

My name is Christopher Porter. I am a 20 year old writer from Newfoundland, Canada looking to start my own online comic book company

Right now I'm just focusing on raising the funds that I require in order to get my business up and running legitimately by getting it incorporated, getting my website designed professionally to suit my needs and to get that small portion of extra cash to fund my projects by paying for the artwork that I require. For this I am asking for $1,820 US dollars.

So far, the work that myself and my artist have been able to achieve has been funded solely by me personally from working over-nights at a local Subway, paying what I can to him when I can afford it after bills. After working so long and hard, it is good to see that my dream of owning my very own online media company has the potential to be waiting right around the corner.


The Impact
It is my firm belief that if I am unable to start my online media business, that the world would be missing out on the great story-lines, and world design that I put so much time and effort to create for our projects. I love writing and always have. I don't want to let what talent I have go to waste.

However, if I don't meet the funding this time around I plan to keep trying until I do reach my goal of business incorporation. I refuse to abandon my dream, and I will not let the above scenario take place, even if I have to scrounge every penny I make myself to get it started.

What We Have Been Working On So Far
There are a handful of projects that we are working on. Some are in the planning stages, some are in the scripting stages, and there is one that is currently in the fleshing stage. These projects range from medium sized workloads to large sized workloads.
Evadire (Huge Project) [Fantasy World + Online Graphic Novel Series]
This project has been my baby for going on three years now. I have spent countless hours working on the back-history of an entire fantasy universe and building every detail piece by piece from the ground up.
My goal is to create a pseudo-realistic fantasy world with a rich history and mythology that would be capable of snatching up the reader's attention. I'm the kind of writer that feels that the history of a fantasy world should be the driving point for your stories, not the other way around. Sometimes it's worth the extra hard work in creating your world as detailed as possible, even if some of the details are never included in an actual story-line. You will always have those types of fans who love to read page after page of rich history before they would ever think about picking up one of your stories.
Blood Moon (Medium Project) [Online Graphic Novel Series]
This project is currently in the scripting stages. It will be an online graphic novel set in the 1950's and will follow the story of Felix Santana - a former cop turned vampire who is searching for answers as to why his wife and young daughter were killed during an attack by vampires and he was turned instead of sharing their fate. Along his journey he becomes tangled in a war between two separate factions of vampire, the Children of Magdalene, and the Crown of the Beast.
Ubiquity Complex (Huge Project) [Sci-Fi World + Online Graphic Novel Series]
This project is currently only in the planning stages. Much like the Evadire project, it will require a great deal of time as it requires the creation of an entire sci-fi universe.
The basic storyline behind the Ubiquity Complex project is based on the creation of a massive underground bunker that houses the world's most elite soldiers, frozen in stasis pods and connected up with a series of computers and the Ubiquity Complex, a series of machines located around the galaxies that can instantly create a replica of the soldiers within the stasis pods in far off war-zones. The recreated human soldier is able to control from the safety of their pod within the bunker.

What We Need & What You Get
Here is the general breakdown of what I need and where it's going in order of importance. If I don't reach the funding, I will be using what I do raise to go towards things listed at the top of the list first, and work my way down.

$20 - NUANS name search (To ensure that the business name is in-fact available. If it is not, this will just be a minor set-back that can be corrected easily enough.)
$200 - Incorporation fees (I want to make sure this business venture is as legit as possible, so this requires incorporation.)
$300-600 - Website design (In order to have an attractive business on the internet you have to have an attractive website that lures in the people who will appreciate it the most.)
$1000 - Paying artists (As my first project once the business is up and running properly, I have planned out an online graphic novel that will require artists matched with my scripts.)

These particular fees that will require payment equal out to the total $1820 that I am seeking.

His personal mission is to rescue his parents from government agents, but that objective is often frustrated with the likes of giant monsters, super-villains, and even the armed forces.</p>

Così, La storia dell’Orso - 430 pagine - ha preso la sua forma nell'estate del 2013, appena un’anno fa

<p><em><strong><br/></strong></em>In David Lloyd's own words: ""Those <em>Vendetta</em> pages are the 32-page sections that were separately printed as part of the printing process of the first edition of the collection - the graphic novel as it is otherwise described - the press check of which I attended at Ronalds in Montreal. Sections like these are collected and bound into the book, trimmed and wrapped around with the cover. These were some that were part of the prep for colour-checking. These things don't mean much to the printers, of course, and I'm sure that the ones I didn't take away with me as souvenirs were obviously trashed, but they mean a lot to me, and may mean something to others as rare items of a great book. I'm almost certain no-one but me has kept any, and no-one else has any but me, and there are just 25 of them left with me, including those 8 you have. So they are, I'd guess, a rare thing.""</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Comics Thing is three different products: a digital comics reader for tablets and phones, a comics creator with its own format, and a backend technology to deliver those comics to readers around the world.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Comics Thing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.comicsthing.com/indiegogoimages/thekids.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Comics Thing""/></p>
<h3><em>The Reader:</em></h3>
<p>Comics Thing will be the first digital comics reader for tablets and phones letting readers combine CBZ and PDF comics with purchased works in a proprietary format. Readers will be able to access their comics across all their devices, and use Comics Things’ store to complete collections, organize libraries, and buy new series.</p>
<p>Indies and makers can set up their own app store, powered by Comics Thing, and selling their own comics, without having to give anyone half their money.</p>
<p>The Reader will work as a web widget and desktop app, as well as on phones and tablets across iOS and Android.</p>
<h3><em><a href=""http://www.eleanormayne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Eleanor Mayne photography""><strong><img alt=""Eleanor Mayne"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.comicsthing.com/indiegogoimages/eleae.jpg"" id=""Eleanor Mayne"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: left;"" title=""Eleanor Mayne""/></strong></a>The Maker:</em></h3>
<p>The Maker for Comics Thing will come in two flavors – as a plug-in for InDesign, and as a standalone app. Both will output a Comics Thing proprietary format comic book or graphic novel in a hybrid of HTML5 and native code.</p>
<p>This unique Comics Thing format will be released Open Source. If Comics Thing were to disappear, or fall into the hands of the man, your comics won’t – not the ones you bought, not the ones you made.</p>
<p>The app and the plug-in itself will function modularly, with other plug-ins and scripts. This way Comics Thing can provide the most popular tools to indies, artist and writers, while reserving some costly-to-produce industrial-scale technologies for big publishers who decide to leave the dark side for the light. (These will be things like serving dynamic ads, chunk-level analytics, automatic content repurposing from XML, downloadable files for 3D printers, etc.)</p>
<p>The standalone app will be as easy to use as PowerPoint or Keynote, but should feel as powerful as Flash (without the complexity of ActionScript) or Hype.</p>
<p>Comics Thing will run a private forums for contributors above $30, where you can input ideas, requests, suggestions, or rip our work apart. Comics Thing is for you.</p>
<p>And remember, The Maker and the Comics Thing format will be released Open Source, so if you want to create a plugin or improvement, Comics Thing will salute you! </p>

<h3><em>The Storm (stretch goal):</em></h3>
<p>The Storm is Comics Things’ cloud engine. Your purchased comics will be stored locally, but also in the cloud, where they can be redownloaded any time, across all the devices.</p>
<p>The Storm is also where Comics Thing’s sustainable financial model lives. I’ve worked on apps brutalized by heavy loads during big events – like the live transmission of <em>X Factor</em>. Comics Thing will build The Storm to scale – cost-efficient for indies and artists, but robust enough to handle the distribution of, say, 7,000 free editions for every reader during a major music and digital event in a large Southern state.<img alt=""Eleae for Comics Thing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://comicsthing.com/indiegogoimages/eleae.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Comics Thing""/> </p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Here’s how it stands for artists and writers now. They make a digital comic book and take it to a publisher, who miraculously agrees to publish it:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple or Google take 30%</li>
<li>The distributor takes 50% of what’s left – 35%</li>
<li>The publisher takes 50% of the remaining 35% – 17.5%</li>
<li>The writer and artist split the remaining 17.5%, receiving 8.75% each.</li>
</ul><p>8.75% of $2.99 is $0.26, and that’s just not enough.</p>
<p>Make no mistake -- this campaign is a direct resopnse to comiXology's growing monopoly.</p>
<p>Comics Thing will make it possible for artists, writers and indies to publish their own comics, and receive enough from the sale price to make it worth making more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How will my money help?</strong></h2>
<p>Your money will help makers produce more and better comics for the whole comics community.</p>

<h2><strong>Isn’t there already an iTunes of comic books and graphic novels?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>No. I know the reader you’re talking about, but it doesn’t let me read my CBZ and PDF comics. And they charge indie publishers and makers 50%. That’s 50% of 70%, after Apple’s take. As a maker, I can’t include videos in my comics, despite the cost. And they have editorial control over what I can publish and how I’ll sell it.</p>
<p>That’s not how I envision an iTunes of comics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Did you say downloadable files for 3D printers?</strong></h2>
<p>Yeah, it’s a cool idea, isn’t it? Lots of print mags and (mostly non-English) comics have cover-mount freebies. I think files for 3D printers are the new swag.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are you?</strong></h2>
<p>Dr Charles Kriel (that’s me – the guy writing this). By day, I help entertainment companies dream up cool new games, programs and toys. By night, I’m a writer, musician, photographer, DJ and game designer. I’ll lead the Comics Thing team.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why do you want to build Comics Thing?</strong></h2>
<p>Comic book and graphic novel publishing should be in the hands of artists, writers, indies and readers. I’ve written a few books, but I want to self-publish my graphic novels. There are tools out there, but I honestly either can’t afford them, or can’t live with splitting the profits 50 / 50 with a software developer.</p>

<h2><strong>Why IndieGoGo?</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve worked with half of the Big Six publishing houses, and a couple of them have asked if I need money to build Comics Thing. I’ve heard the same from a couple independents. In every case, I’ve asked them to wait – let me try to crowdfund this first – I don’t want Comics Thing controlled by a couple of big companies.</p>
<p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, publishing was in the hands of writers, artists, indies and readers. That’s where it belongs in the 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>I hope so. When I’m not writing stories or making games, I travel to emerging democracies consulting free press startup news outfits, helping them keep their doors open, training journalists and photographers. In the last six months, I’ve worked in Tbilisi and Kosovo with journalists from Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Are you qualified to do this?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes. I conceptualize and produce games and apps for a living, and in the last few years, I’ve worked on projects for the BBC, Disney, Aardman (who make <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>), FremantleMedia (<em>The X Factor</em>), ABC (US), UNESCO, Random House, CBC, Tate Britain, the Royal Ontario Museum, Mercedes Benz and lots of others. Many have won awards, including Emmys. I have a PhD from St Martins. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/charleskriel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can check the bona fides on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Are you doing this alone?</strong></h2>
<p>Not at all. I don’t think anyone could. Through my apps and games, I work with some of the best coders and designers in Europe, the US and Canada – most of the money will go to paying them for their hard work.</p>
<p>This campaign has support from indie writers, artists and publishers. We’ve had publicity and swag boosts along the way from indie publisher <a href=""http://www.markosia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Markosia"">Markosia</a>, indie distributor <a href=""http://ukondisplay-com.mybigcommerce.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UK On Display"">UK Comics and UK on Display</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_vendetta"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""V for Vendetta""><em>V for Vendetta</em></a> illustrator <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_(comics)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""David Lloyd"">David Lloyd</a>, Resonance FM’s <a href=""http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/author/alexfitch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Alex Fitch"">Alex Fitch</a> and a lot of folks at comics conventions – not to mention the cosplayers.</p>

<p>Stand back and watch while we bring it.</p>

In David Lloyd's own words: ""Those Vendetta pages are the 32-page sections that were separately printed as part of the printing process of the first edition of the collection - the graphic novel as it is otherwise described - the press check of which I attended at Ronalds in Montreal. Sections like these are collected and bound into the book, trimmed and wrapped around with the cover. These were some that were part of the prep for colour-checking. These things don't mean much to the printers, of course, and I'm sure that the ones I didn't take away with me as souvenirs were obviously trashed, but they mean a lot to me, and may mean something to others as rare items of a great book. I'm almost certain no-one but me has kept any, and no-one else has any but me, and there are just 25 of them left with me, including those 8 you have. So they are, I'd guess, a rare thing.""
David Lloyd is the illustrator of V for Vendetta, and publisher of Aces Weekly, an exclusively digital comic art magazine which features some of the world's finest creators of comic art.
 

Comics Thing thanks David for his support!
 
 
Comics Thing is three different products: a digital comics reader for tablets and phones, a comics creator with its own format, and a backend technology to deliver those comics to readers around the world.

The Reader:
Comics Thing will be the first digital comics reader for tablets and phones letting readers combine CBZ and PDF comics with purchased works in a proprietary format. Readers will be able to access their comics across all their devices, and use Comics Things’ store to complete collections, organize libraries, and buy new series.
Indies and makers can set up their own app store, powered by Comics Thing, and selling their own comics, without having to give anyone half their money.
The Reader will work as a web widget and desktop app, as well as on phones and tablets across iOS and Android.
The Maker:
The Maker for Comics Thing will come in two flavors – as a plug-in for InDesign, and as a standalone app. Both will output a Comics Thing proprietary format comic book or graphic novel in a hybrid of HTML5 and native code.
This unique Comics Thing format will be released Open Source. If Comics Thing were to disappear, or fall into the hands of the man, your comics won’t – not the ones you bought, not the ones you made.
The app and the plug-in itself will function modularly, with other plug-ins and scripts. This way Comics Thing can provide the most popular tools to indies, artist and writers, while reserving some costly-to-produce industrial-scale technologies for big publishers who decide to leave the dark side for the light. (These will be things like serving dynamic ads, chunk-level analytics, automatic content repurposing from XML, downloadable files for 3D printers, etc.)
The standalone app will be as easy to use as PowerPoint or Keynote, but should feel as powerful as Flash (without the complexity of ActionScript) or Hype.
Comics Thing will run a private forums for contributors above $30, where you can input ideas, requests, suggestions, or rip our work apart. Comics Thing is for you.
And remember, The Maker and the Comics Thing format will be released Open Source, so if you want to create a plugin or improvement, Comics Thing will salute you!

The Storm (stretch goal):
The Storm is Comics Things’ cloud engine. Your purchased comics will be stored locally, but also in the cloud, where they can be redownloaded any time, across all the devices.
The Storm is also where Comics Thing’s sustainable financial model lives. I’ve worked on apps brutalized by heavy loads during big events – like the live transmission of X Factor. Comics Thing will build The Storm to scale – cost-efficient for indies and artists, but robust enough to handle the distribution of, say, 7,000 free editions for every reader during a major music and digital event in a large Southern state. 
 

Here’s how it stands for artists and writers now. They make a digital comic book and take it to a publisher, who miraculously agrees to publish it:

Apple or Google take 30%
The distributor takes 50% of what’s left – 35%
The publisher takes 50% of the remaining 35% – 17.5%
The writer and artist split the remaining 17.5%, receiving 8.75% each.
8.75% of $2.99 is $0.26, and that’s just not enough.
Make no mistake -- this campaign is a direct resopnse to comiXology's growing monopoly.
Comics Thing will make it possible for artists, writers and indies to publish their own comics, and receive enough from the sale price to make it worth making more.
 
How will my money help?
Your money will help makers produce more and better comics for the whole comics community.

Isn’t there already an iTunes of comic books and graphic novels?
No. I know the reader you’re talking about, but it doesn’t let me read my CBZ and PDF comics. And they charge indie publishers and makers 50%. That’s 50% of 70%, after Apple’s take. As a maker, I can’t include videos in my comics, despite the cost. And they have editorial control over what I can publish and how I’ll sell it.
That’s not how I envision an iTunes of comics.
 
Did you say downloadable files for 3D printers?
Yeah, it’s a cool idea, isn’t it? Lots of print mags and (mostly non-English) comics have cover-mount freebies. I think files for 3D printers are the new swag.
 
Who are you?
Dr Charles Kriel (that’s me – the guy writing this). By day, I help entertainment companies dream up cool new games, programs and toys. By night, I’m a writer, musician, photographer, DJ and game designer. I’ll lead the Comics Thing team.
 
Why do you want to build Comics Thing?
Comic book and graphic novel publishing should be in the hands of artists, writers, indies and readers. I’ve written a few books, but I want to self-publish my graphic novels. There are tools out there, but I honestly either can’t afford them, or can’t live with splitting the profits 50 / 50 with a software developer.
And I want to include video, audio and live feeds in my books. I want an in-app browser with links. And I want it to be as technically easy to make a comic as using PowerPoint.
So I’m building Comics Thing, and then I’m releasing it open source.

Why IndieGoGo?
I’ve worked with half of the Big Six publishing houses, and a couple of them have asked if I need money to build Comics Thing. I’ve heard the same from a couple independents. In every case, I’ve asked them to wait – let me try to crowdfund this first – I don’t want Comics Thing controlled by a couple of big companies.
In the 19th century, publishing was in the hands of writers, artists, indies and readers. That’s where it belongs in the 21st.
 
Are you the little guy fighting the good fight?
I hope so. When I’m not writing stories or making games, I travel to emerging democracies consulting free press startup news outfits, helping them keep their doors open, training journalists and photographers. In the last six months, I’ve worked in Tbilisi and Kosovo with journalists from Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Serbia and Kosovo.
 
Are you qualified to do this?
Yes. I conceptualize and produce games and apps for a living, and in the last few years, I’ve worked on projects for the BBC, Disney, Aardman (who make Wallace & Gromit), FremantleMedia (The X Factor), ABC (US), UNESCO, Random House, CBC, Tate Britain, the Royal Ontario Museum, Mercedes Benz and lots of others. Many have won awards, including Emmys. I have a PhD from St Martins. You can check the bona fides on LinkedIn.
 
Are you doing this alone?
Not at all. I don’t think anyone could. Through my apps and games, I work with some of the best coders and designers in Europe, the US and Canada – most of the money will go to paying them for their hard work.
This campaign has support from indie writers, artists and publishers. We’ve had publicity and swag boosts along the way from indie publisher Markosia, indie distributor UK Comics and UK on Display, V for Vendetta illustrator David Lloyd, Resonance FM’s Alex Fitch and a lot of folks at comics conventions – not to mention the cosplayers.
We expect to add more bloggers, publishers, writers, artists and supporters – and more rewards! – so keep an eye out here.
 
Is that all the swag you got?
Stand back and watch while we bring it.
The swag has just begun. We'll announce more every week.
Once we reach our funding goal, we'll announce a number of very limited but very special prizes from our favorite artists (whose pictures might be on this page), writers and publishers. Keep an eye out, but please help us hit our goal as well.
 
Can I work on your project?
Yes, in four ways.
First, you can spread the word and help Comics Thing get funded.
Second, by contributing $30 or more, you’ll get access to a private forums where you’ll hear the latest developments, and can input your ideas, criticisms, and compliments.
If you’re a cracking coder or designer, we want to know about your work so we can try to find a way to make you part of the team.
And finally, when we go Open Source, you can work to build on the foundations our team will lay.
 

 
After we send out all the cool swag -- some of which has been donated or seriously discounted by artists, writers and indies -- we'll spend almost all of the money making Comics Thing. Most of that will go to paying the salaries of hard-working coders and designers. We won't pay for bricks and mortar. We won't rake profits. And we will publish updates and post-mortems in the forums, letting you know where the money's gone, and how the rest is going.

</h3> <p>My Name is wOlly McNair. I am a freelance illustrator and graphic designer from Charlotte NC.  I have worked on various projects as a character concept artist, designer, layout artist, story board artist, doing sequential pages, art shows, art books, tutorial art, and more. I am appreciative of even being able to say that I do things that I love for a living, but nothing brings greater joy than working against the odds to bring your own projects to life. I did a project for my book Legend of the Black Pandas last year, it wasn't completely funded, but every penny contributed helped to bring the book to life.  So this year I am back doing a campaign that holds a deeper place for me. This one is for my project Fairy Tale Knights. A story about Malia, the youngest, and most powerful knight in the Order of the Red Hoods, an organization of mostly female knights that protect the main regions of the Land of Imagination. Malia has a best friend, partner, and familiar named Patrick, who is a wolf. He protects her, though she would say she protects him lol, and together they work under the Order of Grannies to protect the Book of Tales which exist to protect the fairy tales and fables most grew up knowing and have possibly shared with their kids. This is a revised take on the classic core of fairy tales, red riding hood, a land of magic, knights, kingdoms, and a Book of Tales. All being illustrated by me with a story written by Jerale Clebourne, based off of my ideas, will come as a 100 page graphic novel in full color telling the tale of Malia and Patrick's adventures in the Land..... <br/></p>
<p>Your support would not only help bring this completed story to life in print form, but it would help bring a super smile to my daughters Malia's face. See, the main character is named after, and modeled after my little girl, so for her seeing this all come to life has meant the world to her for many reasons....  <br/></p>
<p>The main reasons I began work on this book a while back was to create something for my little girl. Something with her namesake at first, then it blossomed into something more. I wanted her to be able to see a strong female character, but she wanted to see one that looked like her. She loves the DC and Marvel super ladies, and enjoys seeing them, but at 4 years old, she asked why most of the characters didn't look like her. The skin, the hair, etc. Same with her Barbies, at least the most shown and spoken of ones. So after a little father daughter chat, I made a decision. Why not rework the character and make it something she could and many other little girls could relate to. So I did, note the pic above. When she saw the designs, she had the hugest smile, making me the ""bestest dad ever"" lol. <br/></p>
<p>Now with that said, I still wanted to make sure this was a good book. I wanted people to be into the story simply because it was a good story. So my goal became to give my daughter and other little girls something new to enjoy and relate to, while still making a book that an adult could pick up and dig for the story and art like many comics and graphic novels of today.  I wanted it to be a book that a parent could share with a young child, but also be a story that they an adult could pick up and enjoy for themselves.  So I partnered with a good friend and great writer Jerale Clebourne, to take my ideas and doodles, and make an epic tale!! <br/></p>

<br/>
<br/>So my set goal is $1200. That's not a ton of money, but it is a ton of money at the same time. Every dime raised will go towards the cost to produce this book in softcover, full color, with a minimum of 100 pages in it. Once the funding is complete I may be able to slide a few more pages in as extras, but currently, at the least, it will be 100 pages of story. No ads, no promo for other books, just story and art.  Of course a percentage of any funds raised with also help cover the cost for some of the perks, but the over all with simply be to make the book happen, male my little girl smile, and show her that dreams and ideas can become reality.  Of course  I want to meet my goal, if not raise more, and do additional things like a hard cover version, but if I don't, the show doesn't stop there. As with my project before this, whatever isn't raised, I will figure out funding, and complete what is needed to make this book happen. I believe in the book, and at the end of the day, it is my job to be the example to my little ones, not anyone elses. So whatever i need to do to make this a reality, i will work to do, your support just makes it a little easier lol.... So on to the perks!!<br/><br/>Perks are wide in price and range. I wanted to include as many options as I could thin of, so I asked people what they would like to see, and added some tried and tested things as well. <br/>First and foremost the book itself.

<br/><br/><b>The Impact</b>
</div><div>So why should you support this project!?!  Well the simple reason is hopefully because you like it!! In honesty, I have my reasons for doing this book, but those reasons may not be why YOU support this project. People support things for different reasons, you may like the story, you may like the art, you may like the characters, or you may just want to support to put a smile on my little girls face from seeing the support. You may support simply relate to the reasons I did this, or whatever many other reasons. Whatever the case, I will appreciate you. I don't take for granted how important support is, and every ounce of support I receive means the world to me.  I thank you for even reading all this, looking at these pictures, or telling anyone else that this is happening. Your time is appreciated. I hope in some form or another you do support this campaign, I mean if you read this far, then you have already giving your attention if nothing. (but feel free to spread the word some more and maybe a little support in the area of selecting a perk if you can lol!!)<br/>

 Real Stories Real HackersFirst ever comic book based on the internet security industry!Hackers Rejoice! You now have a new comic book that depicts your life as you experience it. 100% original, gritty, nail biting, heart racing 200 pages of complete action, hacker style; inspired by real security incidents and research work. If you’re in the Internet security industry, this will be the coolest comic book to own. Chock full of stories gleaned from real life incidents involving real hackers, this comic book approach to presenting case studies makes learning about and sharing major hacking quests more fun than ever before.Why are we creating Hackerstrip Comics?Because we think hackers are hugely misrepresented in popular media. People are often shown the dark side of hacking and think it's something far removed from their lives. But what if we showed real hackers as themselves doing what they do on a daily basis? Just everyday people called upon to do extraordinary things? What if we showed them that real life superheroes don't wear a cape and are just as real as you and me? Written and illustrated by the Hackerstrip team, the Hackerstrip comic book offers a glimpse into the world of Internet security as you've never seen it before. The techniques illustrated involve some of the most cutting-edge recent incidents in the security industry and they closely parallel the real world scenarios they depict. Detailed, practical and up-to-date, we want the Hackerstrip comic book to be the coolest thing you can have on your desk.

I love telling these stories! And your support can allow me to continue doing so. There are plenty more stories to tell. After paying Indiegogo's fee, payment processing fees, and the cost of printing and shipping the books and other perks, anything leftover will go towards supporting the webcomic, including the cost of hosting, registration, supplies and equipment, etc. The more we raise, the more time I'll be able to dedicate to the comic in coming months.</p><p>By supporting <i>Aww, Feathers!</i>, you show your support for entertainment that is fun, family friendly, and that addresses topics in an honest and approachable way, even sometimes sensitive ones like trials, relationships, and religion.</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Printing and shipping rewards from the campaign for Book 1 went quite well, and I've learned a lot since then, so I don't anticipate any major problems. My goal is to have the book finalized and printed by Anthro Weekend Utah, August 10-11, 2018. It's possible I could miss that goal, but if so, I don't see it being delayed by more than a few weeks at most. And again, I can order as many or as few books as I need, so I see no reason why I couldn't fulfill every order.</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Every pledge, big and small, makes a big difference. In addition, there are other ways you can support <i>Aww, Feathers!</i></p><ul>

It features a variety of characters, all based on animals, and follows their life through college and beyond. The tone is meant to be light-hearted and often humorous, but occasionally serious and thought-provoking.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this comic family friendly?</strong><br/>A: Yes! While the intended audience is probably teen and up, my goal is for the entire comic series to be safe for anyone to enjoy. It's rated All Ages or probably about a PG rating.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this an LDS comic?</strong><br/>A: Not exclusively. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka ""Mormon"" or ""LDS""), and occasional mention is made of the Church and Mormon culture. Several characters are members of the Church, and it is a very large part of their lives. However, not every story arc deals with LDS or even religious topics, and overall the comic is intended for a general audience. Mormon or not, religious or not, I think everyone can find something they can relate to.</p><p><strong>Q: Why animal characters instead of humans?</strong><br/>A: There are a few reasons. I like animals and they're fun to draw. And with a nearly endless variety to choose from, coming up with new and unique characters is also easier and lots of fun. But it's also somewhat of an analogy. Many of the characters are so different in species. Sometimes this causes tension or awkwardness, but often they learn to get along. Shouldn't we be the same?</p><p><strong>Q: Are the stories based on real events?</strong><br/>A: Many of them are. In fact, quite a few of the story arcs are based on my own personal experiences. A lot of the details are different however and some of the events are entirely fictional or only loosely based on reality.</p><p><strong>Q: What are the dimensions of the printed version?</strong><br/>A: The book measures 7"" x 10.5"" and is currently 70 pages. Depending on what stretch goals are met however, a few more pages may be added.</p><p><strong>Q: Will any of the bonus material ever be posted online?</strong><br/>A: Maybe someday, but if so it won't be until at least a year or two after the book's release.</p><p><b>Q: Who made the background music for your campaign video?</b><br/>A: Glad you asked! That song is one track from the <i>Aww, Feathers! Chiptune</i> album by Bradley Korth, which is available on <a href=""https://scarbosheep.bandcamp.com/album/aww-feathers-chiptune"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> now!</p></div>","Funding GoalsEDIT: This campaign has now closed. Thank you so much for your support!

The prices above are per character with limited props against a simple or abstract background. More complex pieces may incur an additional cost. I'll discuss the details with you after I receive your pledge (make sure your email address is correct). Also note that all art commissions must be safe for work (SFW) and are subject to the terms on my commissions page.Do You AWU?!Are you going to Anthro Weekend Utah this year? Let me know after making your pledge, and then stop by and see me at table #9 in the Dealer's Den on August 10th or 11th to pick up your book and other perks before anyone else! (If you don't come pick them up, they'll be shipped to you as normal.)The Impact of your PledgeRecently I've had some extra time to work on this book as well as new pages for awwfeathers.com, which has been great! I love telling these stories! And your support can allow me to continue doing so. There are plenty more stories to tell. After paying Indiegogo's fee, payment processing fees, and the cost of printing and shipping the books and other perks, anything leftover will go towards supporting the webcomic, including the cost of hosting, registration, supplies and equipment, etc. The more we raise, the more time I'll be able to dedicate to the comic in coming months.By supporting Aww, Feathers!, you show your support for entertainment that is fun, family friendly, and that addresses topics in an honest and approachable way, even sometimes sensitive ones like trials, relationships, and religion.Risks & ChallengesPrinting and shipping rewards from the campaign for Book 1 went quite well, and I've learned a lot since then, so I don't anticipate any major problems. My goal is to have the book finalized and printed by Anthro Weekend Utah, August 10-11, 2018. It's possible I could miss that goal, but if so, I don't see it being delayed by more than a few weeks at most. And again, I can order as many or as few books as I need, so I see no reason why I couldn't fulfill every order.Other Ways You Can HelpEvery pledge, big and small, makes a big difference. In addition, there are other ways you can support Aww, Feathers!

Q & AQ: What's the premise of the comic?A: Aww, Feathers! is a slice-of-life comic, meaning it shares everyday experiences from the lives of the characters. It features a variety of characters, all based on animals, and follows their life through college and beyond. The tone is meant to be light-hearted and often humorous, but occasionally serious and thought-provoking.Q: Is this comic family friendly?A: Yes! While the intended audience is probably teen and up, my goal is for the entire comic series to be safe for anyone to enjoy. It's rated All Ages or probably about a PG rating.Q: Is this an LDS comic?A: Not exclusively. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka ""Mormon"" or ""LDS""), and occasional mention is made of the Church and Mormon culture. Several characters are members of the Church, and it is a very large part of their lives. However, not every story arc deals with LDS or even religious topics, and overall the comic is intended for a general audience. Mormon or not, religious or not, I think everyone can find something they can relate to.Q: Why animal characters instead of humans?A: There are a few reasons. I like animals and they're fun to draw. And with a nearly endless variety to choose from, coming up with new and unique characters is also easier and lots of fun. But it's also somewhat of an analogy. Many of the characters are so different in species. Sometimes this causes tension or awkwardness, but often they learn to get along. Shouldn't we be the same?Q: Are the stories based on real events?A: Many of them are. In fact, quite a few of the story arcs are based on my own personal experiences. A lot of the details are different however and some of the events are entirely fictional or only loosely based on reality.Q: What are the dimensions of the printed version?A: The book measures 7"" x 10.5"" and is currently 70 pages. Depending on what stretch goals are met however, a few more pages may be added.Q: Will any of the bonus material ever be posted online?A: Maybe someday, but if so it won't be until at least a year or two after the book's release.Q: Who made the background music for your campaign video?A: Glad you asked! That song is one track from the Aww, Feathers! Chiptune album by Bradley Korth, which is available on Bandcamp now!",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/>HAVE YOU SEEN THESE KIDS?</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand Volume 2</strong></i> funded on Kickstarter on day 1 in less than five hours and went on to unlock nine (9) Stretch Goals. This Indiegogo OnDemand campaign is designed to allow new readers a second chance to experience the books and other collectibles!</p>
<p><i><strong>You will find both volumes that make up the full Lost Kids story available here! </strong></i></p>
<p>The hardcover editions were exclusive to Kickstarter backers only and are sold out already. However, every pledge towards a physical book to be sent in the mail will come with the following extra items and upgrades:</p>

<br/>What is the Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand?</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand</strong></i> is a love letter to Goonies, the 80s cartoon Dungeons &amp; Dragons and my all-time favorite game series Final Fantasy!</p>
<p>When a group of five teenagers is mysteriously transported to a world filled with magic and airships their only clue to return home is to find a mythical lost city - the city of Samarkand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555605180/k13dlmkiogazotcmb2e3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Volume 1 took the Kids and their traveling companions - <i>a Thief, a Knight and a young Mage Apprentice</i> - as far as Mitani, City of Mages as they look for the Rogue Princess Evelet. The second volume picks the story right up throwing readers right into one of the most exciting chase sequences you'll ever experience in comics!</p>
<p>Here are the specs of both <i><strong>The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand </strong></i>volumes:</p>

<p>Both books are also available in Digital Format as well.</p>
<p>Every backer on Indiegogo will have their name added to the <strong>Thank You section of Volume 2</strong> and those pledging towards a physical copy of the books will get them signed by author Felipe Cagno (that would be me!)</p>

</div></div>","HAVE YOU SEEN THESE KIDS?
The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand Volume 2 funded on Kickstarter on day 1 in less than five hours and went on to unlock nine (9) Stretch Goals. This Indiegogo OnDemand campaign is designed to allow new readers a second chance to experience the books and other collectibles!
You will find both volumes that make up the full Lost Kids story available here! 
The hardcover editions were exclusive to Kickstarter backers only and are sold out already. However, every pledge towards a physical book to be sent in the mail will come with the following extra items and upgrades:



What is the Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand?
The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand is a love letter to Goonies, the 80s cartoon Dungeons & Dragons and my all-time favorite game series Final Fantasy!
When a group of five teenagers is mysteriously transported to a world filled with magic and airships their only clue to return home is to find a mythical lost city - the city of Samarkand.

Volume 1 took the Kids and their traveling companions - a Thief, a Knight and a young Mage Apprentice - as far as Mitani, City of Mages as they look for the Rogue Princess Evelet. The second volume picks the story right up throwing readers right into one of the most exciting chase sequences you'll ever experience in comics!
Here are the specs of both The Lost Kids: Seeking Samarkand volumes:


Both books are also available in Digital Format as well.
Every backer on Indiegogo will have their name added to the Thank You section of Volume 2 and those pledging towards a physical copy of the books will get them signed by author Felipe Cagno (that would be me!)

<p>Hello and welcome! </p>
<p>Lores of Yria: The Haunter of Dreams is a spinoff comic of my main comic series, „<a href=""http://www.yriachronicles.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Myre: The Chronicles of Yria</a>“. It's a lore that I created alongside the making of the first volume of Myre and has now become a separate adventure on its own. While it plays in the same universe as Myre's story, it is not directly interwoven with the Chronicles of Yria. However, you will discover some connections and hints between the two stories.</p>
<p>The first pages of the story can be read <strong><a href=""https://tapas.io/series/HoD"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Haunter of Dreams leads you into the dreamscapes of a little boy who has to overcome his biggest fears and worries. In the format of a dream tale, this story touches profound and surreal plains which only dreamers might be able to experience.</p>
<p>It sprung up from my last campaign where I had a small side project in mind. However, over the years, the story grew exponentially and challenged me on all levels of creativity. From a mere 35 pages booklet, Haunter of Dreams turned into 80 pages in length and illustrates the immersive dream world of a little boy.</p>

<p><strong>Alongside Haunter of Dreams, I want to re-print the first volume of Myre – Chronicles of Yria.</strong></p>
<p>Because of each book's dimensions and printing technique, the costs are very high. I always strive to bring out the best print quality and colours for my creations and have you enjoy the books the best way possible.</p>

<p>If this campaign reaches its final goal, I will be able to add Myre Vol 1 for its second print run! After receiving many questions to when Myre will be back in my store, I saw the first volume still in demand and decided to add it here instead of making a single run for it. </p>
<p>Myre - Chronicles of Yria I"" is the first book of an ongoing graphic novel fantasy series which delves into the mysteries of a world called ""Yria"". The world of Yria has a mysterious past. Very few Yrians know of it, and still fewer seek it. But there are clues that this harsh desert planet once held a much different past.</p>
<p>As a wanderer, Myre is interested only in her own survival. Together with her lifelong dragon companion, Varug, she seeks merely the next crumb of bread. But her search will unwittingly send her into the deepest mysteries of Yria's history, and the ancient and terrible secrets it conceals.<br/>Embark on a great journey alongside with Myre and discover the secrets of Yria.</p>
<p>In 2014, I had a successful crowdfunding campaign which helped me create the first volume and set the path for the whole series. </p>
<p>After my successful print and release in 2017, Myre got also translated and published in German by <strong><a href=""https://www.splitter-verlag.de/myre-bd-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Splitter-Verlag</a></strong>. Due to my work with Splitter, I remastered some of the pages of Myre and added a few more things for the story, making me learn so much more in regards about print and design.</p>
<p>I would like to do the same for the original re-print of the first volume.</p>

From a mere 35 pages booklet, Haunter of Dreams turned into 80 pages in length and illustrates the immersive dream world of a little boy.




Alongside Haunter of Dreams, I want to re-print the first volume of Myre – Chronicles of Yria.
Because of each book's dimensions and printing technique, the costs are very high. I always strive to bring out the best print quality and colours for my creations and have you enjoy the books the best way possible.
 



 


 
If this campaign reaches its final goal, I will be able to add Myre Vol 1 for its second print run! After receiving many questions to when Myre will be back in my store, I saw the first volume still in demand and decided to add it here instead of making a single run for it. 
Myre - Chronicles of Yria I"" is the first book of an ongoing graphic novel fantasy series which delves into the mysteries of a world called ""Yria"". The world of Yria has a mysterious past. Very few Yrians know of it, and still fewer seek it. But there are clues that this harsh desert planet once held a much different past.
As a wanderer, Myre is interested only in her own survival. Together with her lifelong dragon companion, Varug, she seeks merely the next crumb of bread. But her search will unwittingly send her into the deepest mysteries of Yria's history, and the ancient and terrible secrets it conceals.Embark on a great journey alongside with Myre and discover the secrets of Yria.
In 2014, I had a successful crowdfunding campaign which helped me create the first volume and set the path for the whole series. 
After my successful print and release in 2017, Myre got also translated and published in German by Splitter-Verlag. Due to my work with Splitter, I remastered some of the pages of Myre and added a few more things for the story, making me learn so much more in regards about print and design.
I would like to do the same for the original re-print of the first volume.

Starting it in a converted garage with a brand new original Macintosh, Ben (with the help of friends) published Antarctic's first title,</span><em>Mangazine</em><span>. At that time, to publish a comic here in San Antonio, you had to print the cover at one location, the interior at another, and then get binding from a third. In the early years, as with most businesses, it was a struggle, but Ben managed to hang in there, doing titles like </span><em>Extremely Silly Comics</em><span> and </span><em>Ninja High School</em><span>. Since then, Antarctic Press has expanded. I (Ben’s brother, Joe Dunn) joined the fray in 1989, and we have been publishing continuously since then, coming out with a multitude of titles in a variety of genres which have endeared us to our fans.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Over the years, we have contributed to the industry with our unique brand of business. Being a creator’s rights-associated publisher, we have opened the door for numerous creators, many of whom had some of their first work appear under an Antarctic Press imprint. These include creators and artists like</span><em><strong> Terry Moore, Dave Johnson, Neil Googe, Esad Ribic, Yanick Paquette, Fred Perry, Rod Espinosa, Joe Wight</strong></em><span>, and </span><em><strong>David Hutchison</strong></em><span>, just to name a few. The gallery provides but a small sampling of titles we have published and the artists and creators who did them. We have seen every incarnation the industry has undergone during our existence, enduring its many ups and frequent downs, and through it all, we have persevered over time. We have stayed in business with hard work, dedication, sacrifice, and prayers from the people who have worked for us and have provided their creations for publication.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><strong>What Happened</strong><br/><span>While we have been in business for many years, it has never been a financial windfall; we made comics we wanted to read and share with the world. Over the past year and a half, we took the step of expanding into the mass retailer market—specifically, into retail stores like Wal-Mart. While this distribution channel gave us extensive exposure to a much wider audience, it was also very costly to supply it, mostly owing to necessarily large print runs. Our inexperience in this market resulted in us being ill-prepared for returns. This, in combination with the large printing bills, has placed us in a financial quandary. The bottom line is that all this hard work over so many years is now in jeopardy. Everyone here has sacrificed in their own way to help us stay in business, including taking business and personal loans to help us climb out of the hole we made for ourselves. Unfortunately, we still need help.  This situation could force us to make significant changes in our future publishing operations. This is where we hope you can contribute. Even a few of you could make a huge difference.</span><br/><span> </span><br/><strong id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1369757658101_2652"">Help Us Keep Antarctic Press…Being Antarctic Press</strong><br/><span>So what is the money going for?

Starting it in a converted garage with a brand new original Macintosh, Ben (with the help of friends) published Antarctic's first title,Mangazine. At that time, to publish a comic here in San Antonio, you had to print the cover at one location, the interior at another, and then get binding from a third. In the early years, as with most businesses, it was a struggle, but Ben managed to hang in there, doing titles like Extremely Silly Comics and Ninja High School. Since then, Antarctic Press has expanded. I (Ben’s brother, Joe Dunn) joined the fray in 1989, and we have been publishing continuously since then, coming out with a multitude of titles in a variety of genres which have endeared us to our fans. Over the years, we have contributed to the industry with our unique brand of business. Being a creator’s rights-associated publisher, we have opened the door for numerous creators, many of whom had some of their first work appear under an Antarctic Press imprint. These include creators and artists like Terry Moore, Dave Johnson, Neil Googe, Esad Ribic, Yanick Paquette, Fred Perry, Rod Espinosa, Joe Wight, and David Hutchison, just to name a few. The gallery provides but a small sampling of titles we have published and the artists and creators who did them. We have seen every incarnation the industry has undergone during our existence, enduring its many ups and frequent downs, and through it all, we have persevered over time. We have stayed in business with hard work, dedication, sacrifice, and prayers from the people who have worked for us and have provided their creations for publication. What HappenedWhile we have been in business for many years, it has never been a financial windfall; we made comics we wanted to read and share with the world. Over the past year and a half, we took the step of expanding into the mass retailer market—specifically, into retail stores like Wal-Mart. While this distribution channel gave us extensive exposure to a much wider audience, it was also very costly to supply it, mostly owing to necessarily large print runs. Our inexperience in this market resulted in us being ill-prepared for returns. This, in combination with the large printing bills, has placed us in a financial quandary. The bottom line is that all this hard work over so many years is now in jeopardy. Everyone here has sacrificed in their own way to help us stay in business, including taking business and personal loans to help us climb out of the hole we made for ourselves. Unfortunately, we still need help.  This situation could force us to make significant changes in our future publishing operations. This is where we hope you can contribute. Even a few of you could make a huge difference. Help Us Keep Antarctic Press…Being Antarctic PressSo what is the money going for? The best way to describe it is paying down the debt incurred from the large print runs and heavy returns. It is always difficult to ask for help, but due to current circumstances, we have incurred over $70,000 in debt and costs from returns. We do not ask or want anyone to just pay our debt for us; we believe we have provided some great perks for your support. It is difficult to see things go south at this time; we have an extremely strong schedule coming up and would hate to see these projects not come to fruition.

That is why we are starting this campaign and asking for your support.  Many great titles like Strangers in Paradise, Ninja High School, Gold Digger, and Last Zombie, which are from lots of great creators, might not have been released without Antarctic Press.

Kurt Russel's cult classic forever impressed on us the value of a fun, fast-paced story, with a touch of the supernatural heebie-jeebies.Lastly but not least in our primary list of influences, is Kiara herself. The lead protagonist in Peerless; a lady Kung Fu master, who in the vein of the above mentioned movies, brings serious attitude and style. A fierce heroine in a loud and powerful, in-your-face-raw, adventure on the mean streets of Fear City!In progress penciled page of Peerless Issue #1, original art by Pablo Peppino. We're comic fans too.So when we sat down to assemble an art team for this project, our motto was simple, ""We don't want acceptable art... we want exceptional art."" Our goal is to create a series and support material with art you get lost in. A real visual treat that gives something more every time you revisit.    REWARDS:We're breaking our reward tiers into three levels;DIGITAL ONLY.PRINT ONLY.and COMBO, which includes both digital and print components.---On the print side we've got;MINI-PRINTS5""x7"" Character Cards of the main villain of the series, Hu Lei and his three boss-level Tiger Clan henchmen, illustrated by French artist, Gilbert Han.  Only one villain in all of China is bad-ass enough to take on all the Fists of Fate, single-handedly (see what I did there?)  An occult sorcerer like Lo-Pan (BTLC), except he can actually kick your ass in a fist fight too.Hu Lei's young prodigy. What he lacks in skill and experience he makes up for with relentless energy.Jiao Zhu is as deadly as she is beautiful. If we get the stretch goal, you get to see just how much so in issue 1.""B"" or Black Saber has an Iron Hand technique... Literally. You have to get through him to reach Hu Lei and that's why nobody reaches Hu Lei.We're so happy with the way these came out, we're gonna have a stretch goal for a set by Gilbert illustrating Valentine's crew! (that's the good guys for all you folks in the back.) PIN-UPSNext up, we're offering a choice between 2 dynamite 8""x10"" pinups of Kiara, The first is a Comic Style Pinup reward of Kiara, illustrated by Ariel Medel, colored in  gorgeous water colors of Brett Weldele. ORIf you prefer something a little on the risqué side, we've got this 8""x10"" Sexy Pinup of Kiara, by Finland artist, Teemu Taiga.   VARIANT COVERYonathan Saura killed this variant cover for us. Showcasing Kiara, Hu Lei and Sandy, as well as representing the two key villainous forces of the series; the Dragons street gang, and Hu Lei's Tiger Clan!The variant cover is the cover we're showcasing at the top of this page.This variant is a $4 add on. Just pop your pledge up $4 and select the variant option when you get the email at the end of the campaign.  <Hey, we know it's not a Jim Lee or J. Scott Campbell Variant, but remember, these kind of extra funds are one of the biggest boosts to a campaign.> Our fantastic interior artist, Pablo Peppino, will be doing the core cover. We'll post an update on his version soon. GEARING UPExpect a custom printed bandanna as well as a couple of NYC centric patches to slam onto your gang vest! <Come on, you know you have one in the back of the closet.>Stay tuned. DIGITALFor folks who like their comics digital, for the COMPLETE DIGITAL tier, Incarnate Games was cool with us bundling another project Nick scripted, the Ascended Kings: the Fall of Empyrnea, graphic novel.    This story is about as far from the South Bronx as you can get, but if Fantasy is your jam, you're gonna dig the colorful art from Renae De Liz, illustrator of The Last Unicorn, Peter Pan, and many others. Here's a look;    1969 New York City.KIARA, a teen from the South Bronx gets mixed up with the most notorious street gang in the city, THE DRAGONS.  Not willing to let her only daughter spiral down a life of crime and  hardship, Kiara’s mother reaches for a lifeline and sends Kiara to VALENTINE, a local Vietnam vet/bar owner, who runs a Kung Fu dojo,  teaching and mentoring street kids in self-discipline and self-respect.But things between the Dragons and Kiara only escalate. Framed for a horrible crime she didn’t commit, Kiara escapes to the safety of China, to study under Valentine’s Kung Fu teacher.Years later, the twenty-something street kid from the South Bronx rises to become one of five elite Kung Fu masters, known as the FISTS OF FATE. Legendary warriors of China dedicated to fighting the sinister forces of the far East.When Kiara’s boyfriend, another member of the Fists of Fate,  disappears during a trip to NYC, Kiara reluctantly returns to her old hood, determined to find him.If it's coming into NYC by boat, it's coming through Cast Aways turf!Art Caanan White. Colors Brett Weldele. But NYC circa 1977 hasn’t changed… In fact it’s gotten worse. Much worse.A mortal enemy of the Fists of Fate has taken up with New York’s CHINESE TRIADS, undermining the South Bronx, to make way for a new Triad heroin hub. The old, formidable foe from China’s mainland obsesses over learning the Fists of Fate’s secret Kung Fu technique known as the PEERLESS FIST. And having taken Kiara’s boyfriend he’ll stop at nothing to discover it.With nowhere to turn, Kiara teams up with her old mentor’s current group of teenage Kung Fu students to free her boyfriend. A task far easier said than done, as her arch nemesis has united all the South Bronx’s deadliest street gangs to wipe out Kiara’s old neighborhood and anyone who stands in his way.Set against the historic NYC blackout of 1977; a kick ass Kung Fu master and a bunch of wanna be Kung Fu teens, take on every bad-ass gang in the South Bronx, Chinese Triads, an evil Kung Fu master of the dark supernatural arts, and his three boss-level baddies. A true love letter to New York City before it was gentrified, Peerless is a deeply engaging story, wrapped up in an impossible-to-put down package of fun that will transport you back to couch surfing Kung Fu theater on weekends as a kid.Everybody who knows, knows Hip Hop started in the Boogie Down Town (that's the Bronx to you nerds). Well, just as the Bronx had tremendous significance to music, music has tremendous significance to Peerless. Peerless actually spawned from Kris' love of (and involvement in) music. Willie Hutch, and Ennio Morricone provided the soundtrack for the heroes we made up when playing with kids in the neighborhood. Kris Morron: ""In 2017, I started writing music for what I thought was going to be a new album. As the writing process proceeded, a narrative emerged that I became increasingly excited about. The music was funky and had some Chinese influences. It was sounding a lot like a soundtrack for a 1970s Kung Fu movie. I decided if I was going to write music for a story, I should know what story I was going to tell. A year later I had a script for Peerless.""The original vision for this series included two original soundtrack songs to accompany each issue. Kris wrote the music and brought together an incredible group of musicians. This was going to be a part of the core reward.Then Covid-19 hit.Literally, right when the team was set to record the theme song for the series, ""High Above the Pain"" in March, everything shut down. Skinny's go to studio for performance recording, as of this Kickstarter launch, has not reopened. Leaving us to find a new place to record, in an environment with limited options and jacked up costs due to demand. The musical passion is a big part of this project and we'd love to fight through the pandemic obstacles to get you some sweet tunes to read by. We've gone ahead and added the cost to cover studio time and reassembling the musical team as a stretch goal. This is a tough time for independent musicians.By helping us reach this stretch goal you will not only be helping us fully realize our vision for this project, you will be helping musicians who are out of work and working really hard to get by.In the meantime, Kris has written, performed, and recorded demos (which are kinda like first draft versions for all you writers out there). Check em out on his Soundcloud Page here, and yes, that's them playing in the background of our video.We feel confident these demos will have you looking forward to more!Kris ""skinnyk"" Morron: Kris has been a professional musician for nearly 25 years. His time in bands such as Mifuné and Revolution Brass Band (and many more) provided opportunities to tour the country and make music with a long list of incredibly talented people. While new to writing comics, this story is a direct result of years of working to tell compelling stories through music. For more information about ""skinnyk"" and to hear some of his music please visit www.skinnykmusic.comNick Macari: Nick is a freelance story consultant, developmental editor, narrative designer and writer–working primarily in indie comics and games for over two decades. His wide creative range can be seen in his novel works which include a prequel to King Arthur, Jidaigeki & Manga inspired Samurai fiction, Cyberpunk, and his current WIP, a Noir Horror circa 1940's. More recently noted for the award winning Tower of Time video game, translated into 9 languages. When Nick isn't working scripting and story mechanic'ing, he teaches creative writing craft on his two websites, http://NickMacari.com and http://StoryToScript.comPablo Peppino: Pablo is an artist from Argentina, focused on comic books. His work can be found in many well known publishers including Marvel, Vertigo, BOOM! Studios, Mythopoeia and others. He holds a degree in Fine Arts and enjoys approaching illustration and sequential art in a strong cinematic way.We've successfully completed a Kickstarter campaign that ensures we have the funds to create and a 24-page print version of issue #1. Our initial goal for this campaign is to raise $3,000. When we reach that amount we will have the funds necessary to print the 32-page version of the issue #1. Once we surpass that amount we will start putting funds towards the following:STRETCH GOAL #1 - $4,500:     Gilbert Han's, Valentine's Crew card collection. Digital version going to all backers. Print version available to everyone purchasing a printed copy of the book. STRETCH GOAL #2 - $7,500:     As explained in the MUSIC section above, we were prepared to record original music for the first issue in March. Then Corona Virus hit and closed down production. The studio we originally booked is not open yet. If we reach this stretch goal, not only will we be able to book studio time elsewhere, we will also be able to pay the musicians more. We have assembled an incredible group of professional musicians who are all working hard to get by. By paying them more we will all be helping them make ends meet.STRETCH GOAL #3 - $17,500:    Anything we raise above $7,500 will be put in the bank and used as funds to start production on issue #2. $10,000 would cover most of the production costs and would allow us to set up a production schedule.*** Before we get into it, for quick clarification; our discussion on budget below is not a sob story. We're not complaining how expensive indie comics are. We're not trying to gain sympathy showcasing how much money we've spent on this series.We're sharing this information strictly for the independent comic creators who want more direct insight into the costs of OUR comic publishing journey.There's more than one way to skin a cat. For us two writer creators, this is how we did it. ***All that said, Nick always tells new comic creators, ""makin' top quality indie comics is expensive."" If you're not paying in cash, you're paying in time (but it's usually both).As an active member of the indie comic community, he feels it's particularly important to be transparent and let folks see the money on this project. If you're a comic creator, buckle up, it's not pretty.Here’s a breakdown of our costs:$13,000.   Comic interior production based on full 32p issue. (Does not include a page rate to the writers and we saps have been working on this for over 2 years!)$02,000.   Comic covers and reward art.$02,500.   Printing (projected run of 2,000 books. We don't expect to get 2,000 backers, but printing costs drop significantly the more you print. More importantly, something many first time creators don't realize, overall production cost doubles each time you cut your print run by half. Comics are, and always will be, a numbers game.$02,000.   10% Crowdfund fees (based on a $20k fund)$02,000.   10% ""Shit, we Fucked Up Our Math"" ContingencySub total -   $21,500.$21,500 / 2000 books = $10.75 cost per book  (YES, Indie comics are this expensive.)The big elephant in the room is always shipping. One of the hardest things about crowdfund budgeting is that you don't know at the beginning what the actual units backed will be by the end. We're assessing packing materials and U.S. shipping costs at $4.50 per unit. This brings the total shipped cost per book to $15.25 per book. That's right, we're making .75 cents per print issue sold at the $16 tier. Or if we managed an entire sell through of all books, $1500 total profit. (Though in reality, it's even less, as there are a few ancillary costs unique to this project, we didn't bother to list above.)This is the reality, or at least our reality, in indie comics. So there are really only 2 ways to reach sustainability in indie comics at this production level; 1) get a killer audience and print more books, reducing your cost per book by half each time you double up your print run... or 2) sell through a bunch of higher reward tiers that hopefully have a better profit margin.We humbly request and hope for your support on both these fronts.We've internally assessed the budget of this first issue at $20,000 and we're 100% committed to producing this series. So what we've done as creators, is basically funded the lion's share of the budget upfront. We'll make up the difference through crowdfunding and apply any additional money towards the next $20,000 investment, in order to fund the next issue. Peerless is coming at you as a completely independent venture. Our publisher is YOU, the fans. We are not looking to be picked up by a publisher along the way. Instead we hope the fans drive the series supporting comics as they'd like to see them; fun, exciting and meaningful.",29.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Man, we're super-glad to meet you! <strong>We're Skye, and Jace, characters from an upcoming superhero novel in which Skye wants to kill his author, and I have to choose whether or not to stop him.</strong> To do that, Skye's got to come out of the comic book world. To do that, he has to HAVE a comic book world.</p>
<h3><strong>That's where you come in. </strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>This is a campaign to pay for comics pages inside the 2017 Becoming Hero novel. </strong></i>It's a novel about a comic book, <i>with</i> a comic book in it! We want to pay a pro creator, so we've got to put up some pro money. <i><strong>This also pays for the audio rendition, </strong></i>which has some pretty cool differences from the novel version. It's read by two cool voice actors, one of whom was just nominated for a Canadian acting award!</p>

Can anyone solve Skye's Puzzle? becominghero.ninja/skyes-puzzle/
~*~

   Well hello there!     

Man, we're super-glad to meet you! We're Skye, and Jace, characters from an upcoming superhero novel in which Skye wants to kill his author, and I have to choose whether or not to stop him. To do that, Skye's got to come out of the comic book world. To do that, he has to HAVE a comic book world.
That's where you come in. 
This is a campaign to pay for comics pages inside the 2017 Becoming Hero novel. It's a novel about a comic book, with a comic book in it! We want to pay a pro creator, so we've got to put up some pro money. This also pays for the audio rendition, which has some pretty cool differences from the novel version. It's read by two cool voice actors, one of whom was just nominated for a Canadian acting award!
We're both fictional characters written by professionally published science fiction author Jen Finelli. You can find her writing CV online if you google her, or just go to her site, at byjenfinelli.com. Long story short, she's a Codex member, she's 1/3 of the way to SFWA qualification, she's received honorable mention in Writers of the Future twice, and she's been paid to write over a hundred different fiction and nonfiction works. She wanted to play this novel indie-style so she could do cool stuff, like:

Run a charity contest along with the campaign so we can all be more super (more below!)
Get a cover made by DC and Marvel cover artist Lawrence Reynolds

Work with up-and-coming audio creator John Krissilas, who was just nominated for a Canadian voice award

Create crazy in-world rewards like a recipe book from Skye's superhero team, Valentine's Day ""cards"" starring the pairings of Skye's universe, a book of geeky superhero dates, and more
Offer a cash/jewelry prize to the first person to solve the math puzzle I solve in the book
Run a ""story game"" where different crowdfunders get different pieces of a prequel story--and have to work together to put it together, with prizes for the team that wins!
Run a referral contest, so the Sticker Army Member who brings in the most supporters gets an exclusive, one-of-a-kind pyrography of Skye's team by a skilled wood-burning artist from BurntMyselfOnce (Deets below! Always share this campaign with your unique URL!)
And more!

<h3>What's Needed</h3>
<p>This is an ALL-OR-NOTHING campaign. We either collect the money we need that makes this project possible, or we don't. There is no ""part way"". So if you want to see this comic happen please contribute what you can (even $1 helps) and share this page with anyone who will listen! </p>

<p>There's a lot that goes into making a comic book. <i>CHAOS THEORY</i>'s tremendous art team includes the main artist, the colorist, a letterer, and the cover artist.  All of whom need to get paid to keep the lights on and food on the table just like the rest of us. Then there are the amazing artists that contributed to our other perks, plus the cost of printing the comic, the other spectacular rewards we have to offer, and the service fees that come from any crowdfunding platform. Here's how it all breaks down!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485121717/dqmn1vciem97wbq3ikju.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The writer is not getting paid for this project. This is his labor of love and any funds raised above the goal will go towards extra rewards, a higher quality print run, or (if we go way above our target goals) towards future projects for you to enjoy. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This comic is being brought to you by a dedicated team of creators with years of experience and a proven track record of meeting their deadlines.</p>

</div></div>","(UPDATE: 2/28/17) We've reached our first two STRETCH GOALS! That means a postcard MAP OF THE ISLAND that the comic is set on will be added to every perk tier $25 and up, with secrets to potential sequels and backstory not featured in the comic!

PLUS, an EXCLUSIVE Z-REX LAPEL PIN will be added to to every perk tier $50 and up! Not only that, the physical copy of the Chaos Theory comic will receive a prestige quality print run, which is how the writer always wanted to present the comic!

Now, with only days to go, we've added our FINAL STRETCH GOAL! If the campaign reaches $18k every perk tier $28 and up will receive an digital-exclusive, black and white, EXTRA 4-PAGE COMIC STORY featuring a NEW ZOMBIE DINOSAUR that contributors will get to vote on. That means you get to decide which dinosaur will be the next Z-Rex in this new chapter of the Chaos Theory saga!

To learn more about Chaos Theory and the other amazing perks we're offering just scroll down this page!
What is CHAOS THEORY: ZOMBIES VS. DINOSAURS?

CHAOS THEORY is like the crazy love child between Dawn of the Dead and Jurassic Park shoved into a blender with classic pulp comics like Xenozoic Tales, Tales from the Crypt, and Turok! 

A group of survivors, including mechanical mastermind Max and pregnant super-scientist Persy, try to escape the zombie apocalypse by sailing to an uncharted island. Unfortunately for them their new refuge has been host to mad science gone terribly wrong. Extinct dinosaurs have come back to life, hungry for new prey, and the undead aren't far behind! Max and Persy join forces with island survivor Zora and her Dakotaraptor companion, Goodall, as things go from bad, to worse, to totally badass for our heroes and their fight for survival and humanity's future!

The crazed mind behind this monstrous mash-up is DJ Wooldridge, co-host of the popular Only Stupid Answers podcast with Sam Bashor. Each week they dive into everything comics, movies, and TV with their fans. You may also know him as the resident comic book authority at SourceFedNERD on shows like Superhero Round-up and SuperSmack.

Along side DJ is an incredible team of artists, including up-and-coming talents Pietro Antognioni on interior artwork and M. Woods on colors, with a face melting cover by indie-comics legend Tom Neely (The Humans, Henry & Glenn Forever, The Blot)!

 

DJ and the immensely creative collaborators that have joined him to make this wild ride possible have a deep, undying passion for comic books and the stories that medium can produce. Now it's your chance to join the team and help them bring the craziest comic of 2017 to life!
Exactly how crazy is this comic? Zombie Tyrannosaur crazy! Meet our (very) Big Bad... the Z-REX!


What's Needed
This is an ALL-OR-NOTHING campaign. We either collect the money we need that makes this project possible, or we don't. There is no ""part way"". So if you want to see this comic happen please contribute what you can (even $1 helps) and share this page with anyone who will listen! 

There's a lot that goes into making a comic book. CHAOS THEORY's tremendous art team includes the main artist, the colorist, a letterer, and the cover artist.  All of whom need to get paid to keep the lights on and food on the table just like the rest of us. Then there are the amazing artists that contributed to our other perks, plus the cost of printing the comic, the other spectacular rewards we have to offer, and the service fees that come from any crowdfunding platform. Here's how it all breaks down!

The writer is not getting paid for this project. This is his labor of love and any funds raised above the goal will go towards extra rewards, a higher quality print run, or (if we go way above our target goals) towards future projects for you to enjoy.

<h1><a name=""story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">La storia</a></h1>
<p>In questo primo libro seguiamo la storia di <b>Marco</b>, ragazzo incastrato in un’ossessiva e deprimente routine, che all’improvviso viene catapultato in una realtà alternativa, il <b>Borgo</b>, un luogo fantastico abitato da strane creature magiche dove la realtà è in continua e vorticosa trasformazione.</p>
<p>Anima, una caotica “cacciatrice di demoni”, costringerà il protagonista a confrontarsi con le sue più profonde paure, in un’oscura lotta che lo metterà di fronte ai suoi demoni interiori, con lo scopo di vincerli per diventare una persona nuova.</p>
<p>Tema portante del libro è la presa di coscienza sui propri limiti e il superamento di questi ultimi.</p>
<p>Nella sua completezza, Anima è un lavoro immenso e profondo: nel corso dei diversi volumi, conosceremo diversi protagonisti ognuno con i propri problemi e le proprie divertenti psicopatie. <br/>Un puzzle di personalità, di cui Marco è il primo tassello, che andranno a comporre un quadro sempre più grande e sofisticato.</p>

<p><i><b>MARCO</b></i></p>
<p><i>“...Meh.” -cit.</i></p>
<p>Dopo aver abbandonato l’università, Marco lavora come commesso al Suppa
Market e conduce una vita noiosa e ripetitiva. É goffo ed impacciato e molto
spesso finisce in situazioni imbarazzanti, dalle quali esce sempre con l’amaro
in bocca. Da qualche anno la sua personalità ha preso una brutta piega,
trasformandolo in una persona apatica e cinica. Qualcosa nell’ombra lo sta
lentamente divorando, ma cosa?</p>

<p><i><b>ANIMA</b></i></p>
<p><i>“Voi umani siete tutti uguali, di continuo a lamentarvi senza fare
nulla aspettando un qualcosa che vi salvi e vi sollevi dalle vostre sofferenze.
Quando verrà il giorno in cui vi prenderete le vostre maledette
responsabilità?” -cit.</i></p>
<p>Cacciatrice di Demoni caotica e imprevedibile. Anima porta distruzione,
disinteressandosi delle conseguenze sugli esseri umani che, anzi, disprezza. A
differenza dei suoi colleghi, non mira a distruggere i Demoni, bensì ad
ammansirli e farli passare dalla sua parte, garantendole potere e protezione. È impulsiva ed infantile e sebbene le sue doti siano molte, è assolutamente
negata a relazionarsi con il prossimo.</p>

<p><b><i>HORMON</i></b></p>
<p><i>“Non c’è abbastanza zucchero!” -cit.</i></p>
<p>Dal carattere altezzoso e dispotico, Hormon è una Musa, Demone che vive
a stretto contatto con gli esseri umani e che ha sviluppato una personalità ed
un ego propri. Trae forza dall’energia che scaturisce dalle persone in preda a
forti emozioni e dai quintali di zucchero che ingerisce ogni giorno
(preferibilmente sotto forma di marshmellow); è in grado di intervenire sugli
stati emotivi altrui dando un improvviso senso di benessere seguito da un boost
di energia. Si diverte a giocare con le emozioni delle persone, in particolare
stimolandone la libido, dalle quali trae poi nutrimento. Sebbene il suo aspetto
sia carino e coccoloso e inciti allo spupazzamento, vi conviene non allungare
troppo le mani: morde.</p>

<p><b><i>OBLAK &amp; NEBE</i></b></p>
<p><i>“Se voi seguiste le regole, il nostro intervento non sarebbe
necessario.” -cit. Oblak</i></p>
<p>Gemelle estremamente legate, Oblak e Nebe sono state cresciute ed
istruite per diventare dei sicari di alto livello. Eseguono sempre ogni
missione in modo perfetto, quasi fossero dei robot, e sono estremamente devote
al loro superiore. Seppure agiscano sempre in sincrono, chi ha l’iniziativa tra
le due è Oblak, che dimostra di avere il carattere che invece a Nebe sembra
mancare del tutto. Ultimamente sono sulle tracce di Anima che gli ha procurato
non pochi problemi, macchiando il loro curriculum perfetto.</p>

<p><i><b><i><b></b></i><i><b></b></i>ALASTOR</b></i></p>
<p><i>“L’equilibrio è alla base dell’esistenza, va preservato ad ogni costo e
per questo importanti scelte devono essere fatte. Se non siete in grado di
giudicare, allora io mi farò giudice per voi. Affidate a me le vostre vite.”
-cit.</i></p>
<p>Conosciuta come la “Strega di metallo” Alastor è un eterna guerriera,
reputata da molti una semi divinità. Persegue il concetto di giustizia ed
equità come nessun altro e non ha pietà per chiunque le sia d’intralcio; alcuni
dicono che per il bene di questi ideali abbia gettato via il suo stesso cuore.
Appartiene ad un’organizzazione che preserva e protegge la razza umana, ma,
seppure riceva ordini, il suo giudizio sul campo di battaglia è del tutto
imparziale. Agisce prevalentemente in solitaria, ma da qualche tempo ha un paio
di apprendiste ai suoi comandi, le uniche che sono riuscite a sopravvivere al
suo metodo disumano.</p>

<br/><p><i><b>RAMA</b></i></p>
<p><i>“Dov’è il divertimento se non c’è sfida?” cit.</i></p>
<p>Considerato un genio, Rama è un cacciatore di Demoni dalla bravura
eccezionale, ma dal carattere impossibile. Accetta solo incarichi se
interessanti e/o se pagato profumatamente, non si fa problemi ad abbandonare
una missione se la ritiene sotto ai suoi standard di “sfida” e non ha alcun
rispetto per le persone che non siano per lui fonte di divertimento.  Seppure i suoi fan (e le sue amanti) siano
numerosi, conduce una vita solitaria accompagnato da Hāthī, un pupazzo automa
che lui stesso ha creato e che gli funge da segretaria personale. Questa, oltre
ad organizzare l’agenda e gestire i contatti, tiene conto di tutte le uscite
videoludiche nel periodo lavorativo di Rama, le quali quest’ultimo recupererà
richiudendosi in casa per mesi, giocando fino al completismo più estremo.</p>

<p><i>“Ah. Ho rotto di nuovo Internet.” -cit</i></p>
<p>Individuo molto ambiguo, Tesla è una tra le personalità più di spicco
nella ricerca sul rapporto Demone/uomo e senza dubbio la più controversa. È
stato accusato più volte di tradimento e diffamazione, ma i risultati delle sue
ricerche sono così importanti da renderlo praticamente intoccabile. Protetto da
una famosa organizzazione, conduce esperimenti sugli esseri umani, alla ricerca
della Verità: la chiave che porterà all’evoluzione. Per quanto il suo operato
potrebbe far trasparire l’opposto, Tesla ama incredibilmente gli esseri umani e
passa molto del suo tempo a interagirvi su Internet: se per caso vi imbattete
in grossi dibattiti e fenomeni virali, quasi sicuramente nell’occhio del
ciclone c’è lui.</p>

con i Demoni e uno tra questi è talmente potente da essere la base su cui
poggia l’intero Borgo.</p>

Introduzione

Ciao a tutti, mi chiamo Chiara e sono qui per presentare il mio progetto, Anima.

Ho iniziato a lavorare a questo fumetto alcuni anni fa e quando ho incontrato Emanuele Tenderini e Linda Cavallini, gli autori di Lumina, ho deciso di provare la strada del crowdfunding.Inizialmente avevamo provato a realizzare una campagna su Kickstarter, ma il budget richiesto era troppo alto, però dagli errori si impara, non ci siamo arresi e così abbiamo deciso di riprovarci, ripromettendo la campagna e riducendo il budget al minimo (investendo anche qualche risparmio nella realizzazione).Quindi, aiutata dal Tatai Lab, sono felice di presentarvi...ANIMA è un fumetto di genere fantastico, ricco di personalità, emozione, colori e follia. Libro d’esordio di Chiara Zuliani, giovanissima autrice tout-court che ha curato ogni aspetto della sua idea: dal soggetto, alla sceneggiatura, dal disegno al colore.Stilisticamente riconducibile ai moderni codici orientali, con un segno fresco che strizza l’occhio agli anime e un’impostazione narrativa tanto europea quanto giapponese, Anima è un libro vivace, fresco, pulsante.

La storia
In questo primo libro seguiamo la storia di Marco, ragazzo incastrato in un’ossessiva e deprimente routine, che all’improvviso viene catapultato in una realtà alternativa, il Borgo, un luogo fantastico abitato da strane creature magiche dove la realtà è in continua e vorticosa trasformazione.
Anima, una caotica “cacciatrice di demoni”, costringerà il protagonista a confrontarsi con le sue più profonde paure, in un’oscura lotta che lo metterà di fronte ai suoi demoni interiori, con lo scopo di vincerli per diventare una persona nuova.
Tema portante del libro è la presa di coscienza sui propri limiti e il superamento di questi ultimi.
Nella sua completezza, Anima è un lavoro immenso e profondo: nel corso dei diversi volumi, conosceremo diversi protagonisti ognuno con i propri problemi e le proprie divertenti psicopatie. Un puzzle di personalità, di cui Marco è il primo tassello, che andranno a comporre un quadro sempre più grande e sofisticato.

I personaggi



MARCO
“...Meh.” -cit.
Dopo aver abbandonato l’università, Marco lavora come commesso al Suppa
Market e conduce una vita noiosa e ripetitiva. É goffo ed impacciato e molto
spesso finisce in situazioni imbarazzanti, dalle quali esce sempre con l’amaro
in bocca. Da qualche anno la sua personalità ha preso una brutta piega,
trasformandolo in una persona apatica e cinica. Qualcosa nell’ombra lo sta
lentamente divorando, ma cosa?
***


ANIMA
“Voi umani siete tutti uguali, di continuo a lamentarvi senza fare
nulla aspettando un qualcosa che vi salvi e vi sollevi dalle vostre sofferenze.
Quando verrà il giorno in cui vi prenderete le vostre maledette
responsabilità?” -cit.
Cacciatrice di Demoni caotica e imprevedibile. Anima porta distruzione,
disinteressandosi delle conseguenze sugli esseri umani che, anzi, disprezza. A
differenza dei suoi colleghi, non mira a distruggere i Demoni, bensì ad
ammansirli e farli passare dalla sua parte, garantendole potere e protezione. È impulsiva ed infantile e sebbene le sue doti siano molte, è assolutamente
negata a relazionarsi con il prossimo.
***


HORMON
“Non c’è abbastanza zucchero!” -cit.
Dal carattere altezzoso e dispotico, Hormon è una Musa, Demone che vive
a stretto contatto con gli esseri umani e che ha sviluppato una personalità ed
un ego propri. Trae forza dall’energia che scaturisce dalle persone in preda a
forti emozioni e dai quintali di zucchero che ingerisce ogni giorno
(preferibilmente sotto forma di marshmellow); è in grado di intervenire sugli
stati emotivi altrui dando un improvviso senso di benessere seguito da un boost
di energia. Si diverte a giocare con le emozioni delle persone, in particolare
stimolandone la libido, dalle quali trae poi nutrimento. Sebbene il suo aspetto
sia carino e coccoloso e inciti allo spupazzamento, vi conviene non allungare
troppo le mani: morde.

***

OBLAK & NEBE
“Se voi seguiste le regole, il nostro intervento non sarebbe
necessario.” -cit. Oblak
Gemelle estremamente legate, Oblak e Nebe sono state cresciute ed
istruite per diventare dei sicari di alto livello. Eseguono sempre ogni
missione in modo perfetto, quasi fossero dei robot, e sono estremamente devote
al loro superiore. Seppure agiscano sempre in sincrono, chi ha l’iniziativa tra
le due è Oblak, che dimostra di avere il carattere che invece a Nebe sembra
mancare del tutto. Ultimamente sono sulle tracce di Anima che gli ha procurato
non pochi problemi, macchiando il loro curriculum perfetto.

***

ALASTOR
“L’equilibrio è alla base dell’esistenza, va preservato ad ogni costo e
per questo importanti scelte devono essere fatte. Se non siete in grado di
giudicare, allora io mi farò giudice per voi. Affidate a me le vostre vite.”
-cit.
Conosciuta come la “Strega di metallo” Alastor è un eterna guerriera,
reputata da molti una semi divinità. Persegue il concetto di giustizia ed
equità come nessun altro e non ha pietà per chiunque le sia d’intralcio; alcuni
dicono che per il bene di questi ideali abbia gettato via il suo stesso cuore.
Appartiene ad un’organizzazione che preserva e protegge la razza umana, ma,
seppure riceva ordini, il suo giudizio sul campo di battaglia è del tutto
imparziale. Agisce prevalentemente in solitaria, ma da qualche tempo ha un paio
di apprendiste ai suoi comandi, le uniche che sono riuscite a sopravvivere al
suo metodo disumano.

***

RAMA
“Dov’è il divertimento se non c’è sfida?” cit.
Considerato un genio, Rama è un cacciatore di Demoni dalla bravura
eccezionale, ma dal carattere impossibile. Accetta solo incarichi se
interessanti e/o se pagato profumatamente, non si fa problemi ad abbandonare
una missione se la ritiene sotto ai suoi standard di “sfida” e non ha alcun
rispetto per le persone che non siano per lui fonte di divertimento.  Seppure i suoi fan (e le sue amanti) siano
numerosi, conduce una vita solitaria accompagnato da Hāthī, un pupazzo automa
che lui stesso ha creato e che gli funge da segretaria personale. Questa, oltre
ad organizzare l’agenda e gestire i contatti, tiene conto di tutte le uscite
videoludiche nel periodo lavorativo di Rama, le quali quest’ultimo recupererà
richiudendosi in casa per mesi, giocando fino al completismo più estremo.

***

TESLA
“Ah. Ho rotto di nuovo Internet.” -cit
Individuo molto ambiguo, Tesla è una tra le personalità più di spicco
nella ricerca sul rapporto Demone/uomo e senza dubbio la più controversa. È
stato accusato più volte di tradimento e diffamazione, ma i risultati delle sue
ricerche sono così importanti da renderlo praticamente intoccabile. Protetto da
una famosa organizzazione, conduce esperimenti sugli esseri umani, alla ricerca
della Verità: la chiave che porterà all’evoluzione. Per quanto il suo operato
potrebbe far trasparire l’opposto, Tesla ama incredibilmente gli esseri umani e
passa molto del suo tempo a interagirvi su Internet: se per caso vi imbattete
in grossi dibattiti e fenomeni virali, quasi sicuramente nell’occhio del
ciclone c’è lui.

***

MAMAN
“AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!” -cit
Maman è una guaritrice molto famosa e con una lista d’attesa quasi
interminabile. Con le sue terapie ha salvato non poche vite, tra cui quelle di
personaggi famosi e potenti. Sempre positiva, il suo motto è “la guarigione
inizia sempre con una sana risata” e la sua, in particolare, scalda gli animi
più tristi. La si può considerare il sindaco del Borgo, luogo incantato e in
continua trasformazione, dove vivono molti Demoni e personaggi particolari, tra
cui la stessa Anima. Come quest’ultima, anche Maman ha la capacità di legare
con i Demoni e uno tra questi è talmente potente da essere la base su cui
poggia l’intero Borgo.

***

MOMO & PAPILLON
“Doppio High five dell’amicizia!!!” -cit.
Migliori amiche da sempre, Momo e Papillon appartengono alle due
famiglie rivali del Borgo: quella dei Gatti del porto e quella dei Procioni del
quartiere commerciale. Momo  ha un carattere
dolce e gentile, lavora come cameriera e ragazza delle consegne per il
Ramen-ten della madre e quando ha tempo va ad aiutare lo zio al Sushi-ya.
Papillon  ha un carattere forte e
altruista, lavora al supermercato di famiglia, ma è più il tempo che perde in
giro a divertirsi che quello che impegna effettivamente a lavorare. Nonostante
le continue lamentele da parte dei parenti, ad entrambe piace trasformarsi in
esseri umani perchè lo trovano divertente e comodo. Tutte e due sono le
candidate numero uno per succedere al posto di capofamiglia: riusciranno a
rappacificare le acque tra i clan?

***

SIRIO
“Cacciatori di Demoni, Streghe, Stregoni, Pirati Spaziali, ne ho
abbastanza! Sempre a complicare cose che potrebbero essere semplici! Vivere una
vita normale vi è così difficile?” -cit.
Apparentemente scontroso, ma dal cuore d’oro, Sirio lavora presso il
Sushi-ya di Sakana-san come apprendista. Non sta mai con le mani in mano e
passa il suo tempo libero ad aiutare gli abitanti del Borgo in difficoltà: è
praticamente un tuttofare. Non mostra minimamente interesse per le mirabolanti
avventure di Anima, anzi, il solo sentirne parlare lo irrita profondamente.
Seppure sia abituato a convivere con il surreale, Sirio ama le cose semplici e
trova che la vera felicità sia nell’ordinario, assieme alle persone care. È
strano che una persona del genere si ritrovi al Borgo, non vi pare? Forse in
lui si nasconde molto di più che un semplice apprendista cuoco. 

***

KIM
“Provate anche solo a sfiorare la mia roba e vi troverete rivoltati
dentro per fuori. Io vi ho avvertito.” -cit.
Kim è una programmatrice e si occupa di gestire la struttura del Borgo,
impedendo che il suo continuo mutare lo porti al collasso. È estremamente
schietta e distaccata, ha una pazienza senza pari e riesce a mantenere la calma
anche nelle situazioni più difficili. Possiede un repertorio di imprecazioni
pressoché immenso che usa a pieno regime quando arriva al limite di
sopportazione con determinate persone o quando gioca ai MMORPG. Abita assieme a
Maman, Anima ed Hormon nella Prima Casa. La si può considerare il vice sindaco
del Borgo.

***

L’OMBRA
“Sei una persona mediocre e questo è l’unico modo in cui puoi
sopravvivere. Credi in me ed io non ti lascerò mai solo.”
Il Demone che si nasconde nell’ombra di Marco. Funge da ripostiglio e
trattiene dentro di sé tutte le paure ed il dolore del ragazzo, in cambio della
sua energia. L’Ombra è la materializzazione del fardello del passato che Marco
si trascina appresso impedendogli di vivere serenamente. Riuscirà il ragazzo a

DAWN HUGHES, 17, is an insecure high school senior who is always the stage manager, never the star, although she desperately wants to be noticed. She decides she has been ignored by her crush, ZACH ZELENY, 17, and humiliated by the school’s primadonna, HALEY HAWKINS, 17, for the last time, and in a moment of bravery and glitter, her superhero alter ego EVE FANTASTIC is born. Eve is the polar opposite of Dawn; she’s exciting and forthcoming and refuses to take no for an answer, and most importantly, with her powers of electric eye contact, everyone notices her. But when Eve goes too far, it’s Dawn that has to pick up the pieces of her life. After losing her best friend, LEAH LAZARUS, 17, usurping the lead role in the winter musical, and stealing test answers, Dawn realizes that being noticed isn’t everything. Two personalities become one as Dawn learns to channel the best parts of Eve while remaining true to herself.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477866050/q1vlsqbbyp5xgfmultsu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477780451/lps9csp3q6sarzkdkhpd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Dawn Hughes &amp; the Rise of Eve Fantastic will be the complete multi-media experience.

DAWN HUGHES, 17, is an insecure high school senior who is always the stage manager, never the star, although she desperately wants to be noticed. She decides she has been ignored by her crush, ZACH ZELENY, 17, and humiliated by the school’s primadonna, HALEY HAWKINS, 17, for the last time, and in a moment of bravery and glitter, her superhero alter ego EVE FANTASTIC is born. Eve is the polar opposite of Dawn; she’s exciting and forthcoming and refuses to take no for an answer, and most importantly, with her powers of electric eye contact, everyone notices her. But when Eve goes too far, it’s Dawn that has to pick up the pieces of her life. After losing her best friend, LEAH LAZARUS, 17, usurping the lead role in the winter musical, and stealing test answers, Dawn realizes that being noticed isn’t everything. Two personalities become one as Dawn learns to channel the best parts of Eve while remaining true to herself.Dawn Hughes & the Rise of Eve Fantastic will be the complete multi-media experience. We are going to seamlessly join live-action and comic to tell our story. We will be producing a hybrid webcomic and web-series. In the webcomic, readers will see panels with a PLAY button. These panels will activate short live-action episodes that are cohesive with the comic. Our live action episodes will be shot by the exceptionally talented cinematographer Dakota Wotton and will feature music from Toronto girl power rock band, Pins & Needles.Dawn and Eve’s story will not only exist online, we will be creating a limited edition printed comic. When you read the tangible print comic, you can access the live episodes with our customized QR codes using your smart devices.Our goal is to have Dawn Hughes and her friends exist online, in film and in print!We are Sketchy Content Productions. Our team is extremely passionate and capable of bringing this project to life.Yona StraussCo-Writer and DirectorSuper Hero Alter Ego: Dame DehaanYona has been dreaming up this project for over a year and could not be more excited to see it come alive.

My sister says I'm the Nerd King. I resent that. She says I resemble that. She thinks she's so smart. Wait til I'm famous from inventing a burping machine.<br/><br/>This is my diary, except it's not a diary. It's a journal, or a blog, or a log... just not a diary 'cause diaries are for girls and wimpy kids. There's also a lot of wicked awesome pictures I drew in here too. Don't feel bad if you can't draw as well as I can. Most people can't.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, my best friend Boogie and I are going to make millions with our new YouTube channel, and our plan is in here too. DON'T try and copy us. You'll just get upset when you don't make a million dollars and find out you're not as awesome as us.”<br/><br/>Max and I were really lucky with the release of the original <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Diary-Nerd-King-ebook/dp/B006CUB7MM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diary of a Nerd King</a>.  It climbed the charts quickly on Amazon and hit #1 several times within weeks when we did a FREE e-book promo on Amazon.  <br/><br/>Diary of a Nerd King continued to climb the charts, fighting with the big guys in the graphic novel category like Dork Diaries, Big Nate, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and it managed to hold it's own, getting as high as #3 on the Top 100 Paid Kindle chart.  </p>
<p>Pretty AWESOME for an Indie book to be competing with and beating these other BIG name books from BIG name publishers!!!</p>
<p>Then came the second book, except we decided to shake things up.  We turned Diary of a Nerd King into a serial.  That’s right, just like your favorite tv show, Diary of a Nerd King came out with a new episode every week or so.  </p>
<p><br/>Best of all, each new episode was only 99 cents!  The kids loved it.<br/><br/>Half-way through Season 2, we released Episodes 1-4 as a set, and when Episodes 5-8 were finished, we released them as a set.  </p>
<p>We also released <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Diary-Nerd-King-Complete-ebook/dp/B0076L9RZK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the complete Season 2 Episodes 1 to 8</a> at that time too!</p>

<p> </p></div>","The Nerd King Needs YOUR Help!
Max, or the Nerd King as his annoying sister Tabi calls him, is half-way done Diary of a Nerd King Season 3.  Episodes 1 to 4 are finished and available on Amazon, but Max  needs someone to finish the illustrations for Episodes 5 to 8.  With someone else to do the illustrations, Max will be able to concentrate on writing each of the new episodes and get them finished faster so that thousands of Nerd King fans won’t be kept waiting for the next episodes.  You know what they say... don’t stand in the way of getting the kids reading! :-) What’s that?  You haven’t met Max yet?  Ok Max, better introduce yourself...(here’s Max intro from the first book in the Diary of a Nerd King series)“My name is Max Ridgemont. My sister says I'm the Nerd King. I resent that. She says I resemble that. She thinks she's so smart. Wait til I'm famous from inventing a burping machine.This is my diary, except it's not a diary. It's a journal, or a blog, or a log... just not a diary 'cause diaries are for girls and wimpy kids. There's also a lot of wicked awesome pictures I drew in here too. Don't feel bad if you can't draw as well as I can. Most people can't.Oh yeah, my best friend Boogie and I are going to make millions with our new YouTube channel, and our plan is in here too. DON'T try and copy us. You'll just get upset when you don't make a million dollars and find out you're not as awesome as us.”Max and I were really lucky with the release of the original Diary of a Nerd King.  It climbed the charts quickly on Amazon and hit #1 several times within weeks when we did a FREE e-book promo on Amazon.  Diary of a Nerd King continued to climb the charts, fighting with the big guys in the graphic novel category like Dork Diaries, Big Nate, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and it managed to hold it's own, getting as high as #3 on the Top 100 Paid Kindle chart.  
Pretty AWESOME for an Indie book to be competing with and beating these other BIG name books from BIG name publishers!!!
Then came the second book, except we decided to shake things up.  We turned Diary of a Nerd King into a serial.  That’s right, just like your favorite tv show, Diary of a Nerd King came out with a new episode every week or so.  
Best of all, each new episode was only 99 cents!  The kids loved it.Half-way through Season 2, we released Episodes 1-4 as a set, and when Episodes 5-8 were finished, we released them as a set.  
We also released the complete Season 2 Episodes 1 to 8 at that time too!

And then Max went on vacation with Boogie for March break, and as usual, they had some crazy wicked awesome adventures so of course we couldn’t keep the kids waiting.  We released Diary of a Nerd King 2 ½ The Greatest March Break Ever!And once he was back from vacation, you guessed it!  We started in on Diary of a Nerd King Season 3!
And that brings us to now.  We want to bring a professional illustrator on board to do the illustrations for E5-8.  By doing so, we’ll bring the quality up to a whole new level, and we’ll be able to speed up the release schedule for the final episodes of Season 3.  We’ve been in touch with some top notch illustrators, and we need about $125 to $150 per episode to pay for the illustrations.  Each episode has around 22-26 illustrations, so this is actually really reasonable for professional work! If we pass the goal of $500.00, we’ll use the money to fund the illustrations for additional episodes of Diary of a Nerd King, and everyone who contributed at the $20 and up will get these additional episodes at no charge as part of our thank you for your much appreciated support.Diary of a Nerd King has done really well on Amazon, and we’ve been humbled by it’s success.  It’s great to hear the feedback from all the kids who have loved the series, and it’s even better to think that we’re helping to get kids reading!We really appreciate any contribution you can make, and you can take a double thank you for helping to get kids reading!  If you can’t afford to contribute financially, we would still REALLY appreciate your support by helping spread the word about the Diary of a Nerd King Indiegogo campaign and the Diary of a Nerd King e-book series on Amazon!  You can use the share tools right below the video at the top of this page.  And thank you for your help!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

Having grown up on the new Moon colony as the son of Asher who ensures the Moon's defence, Zed thinks that his only problem in life is to separate himself from the burdensome legacy of his father. </p>
<p>In the spirit of freedom and good will, Zed sets off to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">scavenge for scrap material with fledgling mechanics, fund small business owners, and compete in company technology races without permission, all the while thinking of himself as a small time hero.</span></p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<div>You will notice that unlike other funded comics, I am not only funding to print, but also to create the pages in the first place.

</div></div>","The Plot Electric Pulse Divide is a science fiction comic that follows the story of Zed, a rebellious teen who thinks he has life figured out. Having grown up on the new Moon colony as the son of Asher who ensures the Moon's defence, Zed thinks that his only problem in life is to separate himself from the burdensome legacy of his father. 
In the spirit of freedom and good will, Zed sets off to scavenge for scrap material with fledgling mechanics, fund small business owners, and compete in company technology races without permission, all the while thinking of himself as a small time hero.

He doesn’t realize how wrong he is about his father or his freedom, until the Moon’s protective shield breaks. Crashing down with it comes monsters, betrayal, death, and the legacy of a fifty year war fought between Humans and the Eclet alien race.

The Project
You will notice that unlike other funded comics, I am not only funding to print, but also to create the pages in the first place. This is due to the nature of this project involving a writer and artist collaboration in which I provide the story in script format and pay to have it converted into comic pages. 
I have prepared as much as possible, having already written the first eight chapters of the first story arc and started into the second. I have invested in a cover and the first two pages and will continue to invest my time and money to make this a success, but I can't do it all by myself.
The funding goal covers the creation and printing of 25 pages of the first issue.The overall goal will be to complete the eight chapters/issues of book one. 
The Creators

<h2><em>What's this about then?</em></h2>
<p><em><strong>The Ghost Pirate Skeletons of Three Craters Lake </strong></em>is a giant-sized comic book adventure starring The Inquiring Minds. When I say giant-sized, I'm talking a whopping 33 full-color story pages!</p>
<p><img alt=""Back Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happyglyphs.com/art/indie2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Back Cover""/></p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is John Steventon, and I am the creator of two comic strips Knight and Day and The Inquiring Minds, as well as a few other fun projects.  I am also a freelance illustrator whose work appears worldwide in various print media. (see my bio for more). </p>
<h2>What do I need?</h2>
<p>As HappyGlyphs Comics, I've self published several books and comics before, but not on this scale. This time I'm aiming to get this new adventure into comic book stores across the country. This would require at least 2000 copies being printed and shipped by me, providing I get enough orders for the distributor to accept the project.  Printing full color comics is very expensive, and I will not be able to do this unless I can get at least $1900 to offset some of the printing costs.</p>
<p>What I would like is for you to get as excited as I am about this book, and to help me make this possible. This is more than just a fundraiser... it's a way for us all to come together and make something happen. At the same time, you get some fun rewards for your contribution, so it's win-win all around. :0)</p>
<h2>Why Should You Help Me?</h2>
<p>This is a great book, for people of all ages.  Kids will enjoy it, grownups will enjoy it, and they can even enjoy it together.  And you would be helping a small business to grow.  Check out Update #4 for proof that this is an awesome book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""HappyGlyphs T-shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.happyglyphs.com/art/shirt1md.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""HappyGlyphs T-shirt""/></p>
<h2>What do YOU get?</h2>
<p>Besides the warm fuzzies of helping a small but fun business grow, I've come up with what I think are some cool incentives, as well as some of my favorite pieces of original art! Check the list at the side there, as well as my updates for details.</p>
<p>For starters, everyone who pledges four dollars or more will get a pirate postcard with my personal thanks on the back, a HappyGlyphs refrigerator magnet, and a collectible Trading Card featuring art from the book.  These will ship in January at the end of this campaign.</p>
<p>Any pledge of ten dollars or more will get a signed copy of the comic book when it comes out, plus the starters.  The comic book will come out sometime next spring at the latest.</p>
<p>Please read each of the pledge levels, since some of them build on others.<br/>And please, feel free to offer any suggestions. :0)</p>

<p>Well, I really hope that doesn't happen!  Honestly, the $1900 goal is the minimum I need to make this project viable.

<p>My goal here is to raise enough to offset some of the costs of printing the comic book.  I honeslty need double that to come close to the total printing costs.  Beyond that is advertising costs, shipping costs, and lots of other things that will have to come out of my pocket.<br/><br/>Passing our goal here would be awesome, and would assure that you'd get more books like The Ghost Pirate Skeletons of Three Craters Lake, and at a greater frequency.  I would love to put out a couple of comics a year if all goes well, and I have plans for other projects like a short story collection, a series of Inquiring Minds illustrated novels, and even an Inquiring Minds collectible card game.  And there's  the second Knight and Day comic strip collection in the works.</p>

</div></div>","What's this about then?
The Ghost Pirate Skeletons of Three Craters Lake is a giant-sized comic book adventure starring The Inquiring Minds. When I say giant-sized, I'm talking a whopping 33 full-color story pages!

Who am I?
My name is John Steventon, and I am the creator of two comic strips Knight and Day and The Inquiring Minds, as well as a few other fun projects.  I am also a freelance illustrator whose work appears worldwide in various print media. (see my bio for more). 
What do I need?
As HappyGlyphs Comics, I've self published several books and comics before, but not on this scale. This time I'm aiming to get this new adventure into comic book stores across the country. This would require at least 2000 copies being printed and shipped by me, providing I get enough orders for the distributor to accept the project.  Printing full color comics is very expensive, and I will not be able to do this unless I can get at least $1900 to offset some of the printing costs.
What I would like is for you to get as excited as I am about this book, and to help me make this possible. This is more than just a fundraiser... it's a way for us all to come together and make something happen. At the same time, you get some fun rewards for your contribution, so it's win-win all around. :0)
Why Should You Help Me?
This is a great book, for people of all ages.  Kids will enjoy it, grownups will enjoy it, and they can even enjoy it together.  And you would be helping a small business to grow.  Check out Update #4 for proof that this is an awesome book.
 

What do YOU get?
Besides the warm fuzzies of helping a small but fun business grow, I've come up with what I think are some cool incentives, as well as some of my favorite pieces of original art! Check the list at the side there, as well as my updates for details.
For starters, everyone who pledges four dollars or more will get a pirate postcard with my personal thanks on the back, a HappyGlyphs refrigerator magnet, and a collectible Trading Card featuring art from the book.  These will ship in January at the end of this campaign.
Any pledge of ten dollars or more will get a signed copy of the comic book when it comes out, plus the starters.  The comic book will come out sometime next spring at the latest.
Please read each of the pledge levels, since some of them build on others.And please, feel free to offer any suggestions. :0)
PLEASE:  If you are outside of the United States, please contact me.  Additional funds need to be pledged for shipping costs.  Thank you!
 And I know that not everyone can contribute at this time, and I appreciate that. If you like the project, please share the link to this campaign with others who like fun family-friendly comics, and follow HappyGlyphs Comics on facebook for lots of fun comics and stuff.

What if we Fall Short of the Goal?
Well, I really hope that doesn't happen!  Honestly, the $1900 goal is the minimum I need to make this project viable. The art is done, and the book is coming together, though, so yes, it will be published.  If national distribution is not viable, then I will have a shorter print run made until we can do it right.

<p>For the past eight years I have been working on a project, that I believe has the potential to reshape the way we see the world, and ultimately play a role in increasing Third World Literacy.</p>
<p>I’ve realised of course, that I can’t do it alone anymore, and now need your help.</p>
<p>I have in my possession, one of the most profound and oldest stories known to man. I would go as far as saying that it is the story from which all other stories told since, find root. What the Book of Genesis is to Christians, this story was to the Ancient Africans. Prior to popular belief, these ancient Africans weren't spear-throwing heathens, but were Philosophers, Astronomers, Mathematicians, Artists and Great Leaders of men. Believe it or not, they were also responsible for seeding the many great civilisations that have existed in pre-history. One need only look at pictures of the enigmatic Olmec heads for evidence of these great African men, whose history has been fervently rewritten.</p>
<p>With this story and with others to follow, it is our aim to redefine African identity and popularize long-since forgotten and suppressed African wisdom to the world.</p>
<p>Our first story comes from the acclaimed African book - <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Indaba, My Children. </span>‘Indaba’ simply means – listen. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Indaba, My Children</span> was written in 1964, by the great Zulu Sanusi (Shaman) - Credo Vusamazulu Mutwa. ‘Vusamazulu’ is a title he was given at his initiation, meaning ‘Awakener of the People’. Credo Mutwa, is the High Witchdoctor and Knowledge-Keeper of the Zulus, and belongs to an ancient chain of Sanusis. It is a Sanusi’s duty to pass down orally, to their first-born son, the profound knowledge of their ancestors.</p>
<p>But when his son was murdered, and thus, the link in the chain of knowledge had been broken, he was determined not to let this profound ancient wisdom die with him, and so he wrote <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Indaba, My Children</span>. In so doing, he broke a sacred oath, and betrayed his lineage, becoming an outcast to many of his people. Although he has long since fallen into obscurity,  the book he has left behind, has been hailed as one of the most iconic African works ever written.</p>
<p>When I first read this book eight years ago, something inside me simply ‘clicked’. I felt oddly compelled to firstly, meet this extraordinary man, and secondly, get his permission to bring these ancient stories back to life. Easier said than done… but I did it.</p>
<p>When I began this eight years ago, I could never have predicted how hard it was going to be, and how big it was going to get. I have tried countless times to secure funds from public and private entities, but to no avail. In the end, I have had to borrow money from my family and friends, which for a guy my age, is a tough pill to swallow. I am humbled that they believe in this as much as I do, and I can only hope that you will too.</p>
<p>We are currently half-way through MA, Book One of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Tree Of Life Trilogy.</span> A Graphic Novel Adaptation, of the epic creation myth written in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Indaba, My Children.</span> </p>
<p>I would therefore <strong>truly</strong> appreciate any funds that you can spare, to help me change the altitude and velocity of this project. These funds will firstly, allow us to focus all our time and energy on the timely completion of the first book - MA, and with enough support, toward the printing and distribution of both high and low quality prints to bookstores, rural African schools and to people like yourself. We would then use all profits to fund us into the second and third installments of the trilogy.</p>
<p>You can find the first chapter of our E-Comic, which we have given away for free, in the hope that if you can't contribute financially, you may be able to assist us by spreading the word of this truly profound and ancient story, to someone who perhaps can.</p>

<p>Welcome to the World of Valendor, a bold new world where steam-powered ships sail across the sky and where you’ll find that the standard heroes come in any shape or form—even Pirate!</p>
<div class=""user-content"">
<div>
<div class=""post"">In the <a href=""http://www.skypiratesofvalendor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sky Pirates of Valendor</a> comic book series written by <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/#!/everett.soares"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Everett Soares</a> and illustrated by <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/#!/brian.brinlee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brian Brinlee</a>, the leading airship has been the Rogue's Revenge. Its crew consists of Captain Tobin Manheim, Bryan Springhammer, Gearz and Shyni. Currently we are one issue away from completing our 2nd volume of books. In February 2013, we will release the collected trade paperback at TempleCon in Providence RI, featuring a painted cover by Marvel veteran artist <a href=""http://omegaparadox.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark Sparacio</a>. This debut is signifiicant as it represents our first major release as self publishers. We are very proud of our accomplishments!</div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post"">We are conducting this IndieGoGo campaign to accomplish 3 goals:</div>
<div class=""post"">1.  To start pre-sales for Volume 2 trade.</div>
<div class=""post"">2.  To raise funds to support the release of Volume 2 (i.e. assembly, promotion, printing, distribution).</div>
<div class=""post"">3.  To involve our readers in developing the Volume Three storyline.</div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post"">The theme and storyline for Volume 3 of Sky Pirates of Valendor is Pirate Wars.</div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post""><strong>What is Pirate Wars, you ask?</strong></div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post"">
<span><span>Off the coast of Gray Holt, a hurricane is brewing. In the eye of this hurricane is a stranded Khorii airship called The Hand of Might. You may be asking yourselves why this ship is so important. Well, the scuttlebutt is that it’s the Temple Khorii’s newest warship. That is Khorii’s newest <em>tax </em>ship. It holds the combined taxes and tribute for Terus Major and Terus Minor, and before you ask that is a lot of gold to be had. So much gold you could use it to take control of the Pirate Guild.</span></span>
<p><span><span>The downside of the scuttlebutt is that it makes its way into a lot of ears, the wrong ears. Those ears belong to some of the villainous, deranged and darkest pirates Valendor has ever known. However one set of these ears belongs to the only pirate motivated by revenge as opposed to greed. That is Tobin Manheim of the Rogue’s Revenge.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are many obstacles that Tobin Mannheim must face to achieve his goal. The storm is only the beginning; soon he finds himself in the depths of full out Pirate Wars!</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class=""post"">Our goal is to have the fleet of ships competing in the wars to be named and manned by you, our readers. Based on your level of contribution, you can name a ship all the way up to starring in your own issue!</div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post"">The campaign will run for 90 days and contributors will be contacted in the fall of 2012 for their respective contributions.</div>
<div class=""post""> </div>
<div class=""post"">Pre-sales of Volume 2 trade paperbacks will be fulfilled in January 2013, prior to the official release.</div>

Welcome to the World of Valendor, a bold new world where steam-powered ships sail across the sky and where you’ll find that the standard heroes come in any shape or form—even Pirate!


In the Sky Pirates of Valendor comic book series written by Everett Soares and illustrated by Brian Brinlee, the leading airship has been the Rogue's Revenge. Its crew consists of Captain Tobin Manheim, Bryan Springhammer, Gearz and Shyni. Currently we are one issue away from completing our 2nd volume of books. In February 2013, we will release the collected trade paperback at TempleCon in Providence RI, featuring a painted cover by Marvel veteran artist Mark Sparacio. This debut is signifiicant as it represents our first major release as self publishers. We are very proud of our accomplishments!
 
We are conducting this IndieGoGo campaign to accomplish 3 goals:
1.  To start pre-sales for Volume 2 trade.
2.  To raise funds to support the release of Volume 2 (i.e. assembly, promotion, printing, distribution).
3.  To involve our readers in developing the Volume Three storyline.
 
The theme and storyline for Volume 3 of Sky Pirates of Valendor is Pirate Wars.
 
What is Pirate Wars, you ask?
 

Off the coast of Gray Holt, a hurricane is brewing. In the eye of this hurricane is a stranded Khorii airship called The Hand of Might. You may be asking yourselves why this ship is so important. Well, the scuttlebutt is that it’s the Temple Khorii’s newest warship. That is Khorii’s newest tax ship. It holds the combined taxes and tribute for Terus Major and Terus Minor, and before you ask that is a lot of gold to be had. So much gold you could use it to take control of the Pirate Guild.
The downside of the scuttlebutt is that it makes its way into a lot of ears, the wrong ears. Those ears belong to some of the villainous, deranged and darkest pirates Valendor has ever known. However one set of these ears belongs to the only pirate motivated by revenge as opposed to greed. That is Tobin Manheim of the Rogue’s Revenge.
There are many obstacles that Tobin Mannheim must face to achieve his goal. The storm is only the beginning; soon he finds himself in the depths of full out Pirate Wars!

Our goal is to have the fleet of ships competing in the wars to be named and manned by you, our readers. Based on your level of contribution, you can name a ship all the way up to starring in your own issue!
 
The campaign will run for 90 days and contributors will be contacted in the fall of 2012 for their respective contributions.
 
Pre-sales of Volume 2 trade paperbacks will be fulfilled in January 2013, prior to the official release.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Greetings my name is Martin Brandt and I am here on behalf of Grim Crew. The Grim Crew is a small collection of indie writers and artists looking to promote the their work and the work of the indie community. It has been their goal since inception to help grow and bring together their indie brethren and sisters to show the comic world there is more out there. For the past 3 years Grim Crew has been publishing Graphic Novels and Comics series. One of the more popular series, Dead Future, is now becoming a collected volume for release this fall. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dead Future is a anthology set in a post apocalyptic world over run by the undead. Each story was contributed by teams of artists and writers from local communities and around the globe. All contributors are indie creators looking to promote to work and the work of their peers. As Dead Future's first set of stories comes to a close we look to the future of, Dead Future. For that we envision continuing the popular series, once again calling on our indie peers to contribute and help promote. For all this to happen and continue to grow we're going to need to increase not only our efforts but our operating capital as well.</p>

</h3>
<p>If successful we'll be able to continue to publish the Dead Future series and promote the work of our creators and peers. It has been Grim Crews primary goal to promote the work of the indie community and my own personal efforts to continue that. This will enable us to keep doing it and continue to grow it and make it better for all involved. Of course if we don't succeed it means that the future of Dead Future will become uncertain but it doesn't mean we'll give up the good fight.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $4,500 USD. All money will go into the printing, advertising and web hosting costs associated with the Dead Future. It will also contribute to further marketing and support for the indie comic community. Of course this is just enough to keep things going and we will use other methods to bring in more money to keep the efforts going. Things such as advertising, book sales, and our own pockets.</p>

As a perk we are offering membership into this unit before it is open to the public.</p>

<p>We'd also like to ask you to spread the word. You can use the sharing tools above or word of mouth us to your friends, classmates or local comic shops. Let's get the word out that even though the future may be dead, it doesn't mean we can't survive it together.</p>

<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>Drea Boyd is a nice girl, living in a nice suburb -- and feeling pretty much disconnected from everything.She finds solace in books and escapes into a fantasy world she creates. There, she's Boy -- a tough, smart cowgirl living in 1910 Alberta. </p>
<p>You can follow the stories in the first edition of ""A Cowgirl Named Boy"", a creative collaboration between writers Trent Wilkie and Natasha Deen, and illustrator Dan Schneider. </p>
<p>Just to make it more interesting, this is the first time -- in recorded history -- that a comic book has been set in Strathcona County, a place that's celebrating its 120th anniversary this year. We've even giving the founding father -- Lord Strathcona -- a cameo.</p>
<p>You're supporting the work of independent Alberta artists -- and we're prepared to make it worth your while.</p>
<h3>What Are We Doing With Your Money?</h3>
<p>Your dollars will go to the costs of illustration and printing for this limited-edition project. There will only be 250 copies of ""A Cowgirl Named Boy"" printed, and we plan to release the comic on a high-grade parchment-style paper with a full-color cover.  </p>
<h3>What Do You Get?</h3>
<p>There's some great perks, but we think the best one by far is the opportunity to be drawn into the story. There's only 30 of those up for grabs.</p>
<p>If your pockets aren't that deep, $5 will still get your name in the comic as a sponsor, and we'll send you a digital copy the same day the paper version is released to the world. </p>
<p>$10 will get you a printed copy of the comic that's been signed to YOU by the creators of ""A Cowgirl Named Boy"".</p>
<p>Add another $15 to that ten-spot and you'll score the comic book PLUS two tickets to the invitation-only launch party on November 9!</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you do have deeper pockets, $500 will get your business drawn into the story. (Plus, your accountant will give you an award for this year's most original tax write-off.) There's only 2 of these available.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell your friends! Tell them to tell their friends! Spread the news far and wide on social media (a luxury they didn't have back in the wild west). It all makes a difference and we truly appreciate the support. </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","What's This All About?

<p>Fairweather - the story</p>
<p>Alright Kids, let me break it down for you:</p>
<div id=""_mcePaste"">There is an inter-dimensional tentacle monster called the Great Leviathan. Levi eats zombies and contaminates parallel dimensions with micro-organisms that in life bind the subject’s mind to it’s will and in death, results in zombification.</div>
<div>Given half a chance, Levi will collapse the dimensional divide and an destroy our world.  Usually, it uses a person that exists in both worlds, creating a constant. It infests that person, possessing them in one dimension and then throwing itself forward metaphysically into the uncontaminated host, but this is a messy and unreliable mode of transmigration. So when the Leviathan meets unlikely inter-dimensional traveler Paige Heron, an unfortunate graduate student of Dr. Weyland, it decides to conquer our world with seduction and technology instead. This releases hordes of inter-dimensional zombies on our unsuspecting world, specifically Kansas City.</div>
<div id=""_mcePaste"">Our story follows the Raintree siblings: Mark, Amber, and Susie as their lives tangle with Dr. Weyland and his unfortunate graduate students (Stark, Paige, and Alex), while they unwittingly open a gateway for the Leviathan.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Creepy scarlett is a new and exciting independent project that will start out with a 6 issue run of the comic book. Featuring awesome new characters such as Scarlett, Pumpkinface, Vincent Priest, Trixie Treat, and not forgetting Scarletts companion Mr. Ted!</p>
<p>As the creator/writer of Creepy Scarlett my goal is to create a franchise that is to include an animated series, movies and merchandise. Being able to keep the project independant means it will remain fan friendly and ensure that as the creator I am able to create a fresh and exciting franchise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>In a storyline that weaves from centuries ago to modern times, Creepy Scarlett follows the tale of a simple girl and her teddy bear as she batttles the evil Vincent Priest and the Red Sun Corporation in a quest for the ultimate power. Along the way Scarlett faces pumpkin faced serial killers, zombies, an evil funfair troupe and more... set against the backdrop of the cemetery that is home to Scarlett and the nearby town that she has a personal vendetta against, the series is a fast paced adventure that twists and turns it's way through each chapter unlocking the true mystery and power that make a simple girl named Scarlett the only one who can stop the Red Sun Corporation controlling the fate of humanity! </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the funding goes to hiring the best team possible to create the best possible product. picking a team that shares the same passion and goals for the character is of great importance to me. Artists, colorists, letterers, printing costs are the main sources that need funded.</p>
<p>Perks include special edition comic books, merchandise and more</p>
<p>ALL raised funds go to creating the best possible product.</p>
</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Creepy scarlett is a new and exciting independent project that will start out with a 6 issue run of the comic book. Featuring awesome new characters such as Scarlett, Pumpkinface, Vincent Priest, Trixie Treat, and not forgetting Scarletts companion Mr. Ted!
As the creator/writer of Creepy Scarlett my goal is to create a franchise that is to include an animated series, movies and merchandise. Being able to keep the project independant means it will remain fan friendly and ensure that as the creator I am able to create a fresh and exciting franchise.


Synopsis
In a storyline that weaves from centuries ago to modern times, Creepy Scarlett follows the tale of a simple girl and her teddy bear as she batttles the evil Vincent Priest and the Red Sun Corporation in a quest for the ultimate power. Along the way Scarlett faces pumpkin faced serial killers, zombies, an evil funfair troupe and more... set against the backdrop of the cemetery that is home to Scarlett and the nearby town that she has a personal vendetta against, the series is a fast paced adventure that twists and turns it's way through each chapter unlocking the true mystery and power that make a simple girl named Scarlett the only one who can stop the Red Sun Corporation controlling the fate of humanity!
