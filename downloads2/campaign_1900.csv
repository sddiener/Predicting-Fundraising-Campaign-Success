<h3>Let me share with you my story...</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Roberta, but everyone calls me Bobbie.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to meet you...</p>
<p>Like others, I came from a not so great background. Growing up as a ARMY brat, I lived in 13 states and two countries. It was a bit hard during my childhood because I jumped from school to school, then I lived on the streets as a young skate punk from the age 13.  Barely having any friends, I had been struggling to find myself ever since.</p>
<p>I can say I am a strong woman now because of the hardships and obstacles I had to go through.  But I always had hope in my heart.   </p>
<p>There were times in my life when I made bad decisions due to not having a mentor growing up, to teach me the values of life and my self-worth. What helped me get through everything was making jewelry and my love for music. They're my passions. </p>
<p>I was lucky to find love unconditionally and acceptance at the age of 42.  He gave me the confidence to pursue my dreams.  Yes... I was lost for that long.</p>
<p>He believed in me and my vision and helped me launch my business. Fast forward two years, the only person who really and truly believed in me, is now my husband. I love him so much, he's my best friend.</p>
<p>I am the proud owner of Yoly Jewelry and I want to expand my business to own a boutique truck. </p>
<p>It's time for me to take my business to the next level and to pursue my dream to own a store on wheels. It's so very hard to catch up and save with the price of living in the Bay Area. The reason I am running this campaign is because of limited real-estate, and skyrocketing rental prices. I cannot move out of the area since I am my father-in-law's care taker. </p>
<p>I am looking for good-hearted supporters who have been there before, and had others give them a chance in life; who would understand and pay it forward to another good person. I cannot express the magnitude of the gratitude I feel, if you were to support me with my dream. </p>
<p>I am a trailblazer of a women-owned small business, especially in this field.</p>
<p>Just give me that chance. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let me explain my business for you to understand, and how much I will need and for what. </p>
<p>$10,000 would reach my goal of building and designing my mobile boutique on wheels.</p>
<p> Let me brake it down.</p>
<p>I have saved since last summer $2000 from the online sales and fairs.</p>
<p>~Buying a used trailer long enough to fill my merchandise and stock, will cost me between $7000-$8000</p>
<p>~Construction to gut everything out and fix it with shelves and props and lighting will be around $2000</p>
<p>~to paint and make sure the tires are good and no leaks from the roof will be a extra $2000</p>
<p>~I have a large truck to tow where I would need to set up and I can get insurance for what is needed. </p>
<p>The perks is exciting because I can travel anywhere and everywhere on the weekends and I wont have to leave my little fur baby at home. Fairs, beaches, anywhere that has food courts and set up.</p>
<p>Every person who supports this campaign, and/or orders a perk from my list, will get a year of 10% off of anything in my store online or in person. It will be a ""V.I.P."" card which has a code on it for online shopping or you can bring the card in person and you will automatically get the 10% off. </p>
<p>If for some reason if I do not reach my goal. I can promise you, I will not quit. I will safe-keep that investment and I will work hard at every fair I can get into, and save up and still buy my dream truck, It might take longer... but thats life. At least I tried. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a difference because I am a nonstop worker until I archive my goal, so your investment will not be in vain. </p>
<p>This project is very valuable to me, because I want something that makes me feel important and because I believe in hope and believe that anything is possible and anyone can achieve anything.</p>
<p>I made a pair of skull aviators sunglasses and sold of them for years. I had a picture emailed to me recently showing, Slash, from the band Guns and Roses wearing the pair of aviators I personally made. </p>
<p>It felt good to know that Icons are wearing my art. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only obstacle I may face to achieving my goal is if no one believed in me or my dream. I wrote down a complete business plans for myself and the future, and I know nothing can go wrong if I had the best support. </p>
<p>I'm qualified to overcome any hurdle because I don't believe in quitting. I will also pay it forward. This can help the women in our community in knowing there are good people out there, who can and *will* support women-owned businesses, and I personally love to share my knowledge and experiances with young entrepreneurs as well. </p>

<p>In the Saharawi refugee camps located in the Sahara desert of Algeria
 (Africa) life can be very hard. Uprooted by a war they didn’t begin, 
the displaced people of Western Sahara reside there;  in a country that 
is not their own, in conditions that many would consider to be 
unlivable. Most of these people will never leave the boundaries of the 
camps. Most of them will never get to travel or see the world. They are 
prisoners, yet they have committed no crime.</p>
<p>So we decided we would bring the world to them.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, we formed the Saharawi School of Ceramics for 
women; a non-profit academy dedicated to using the amazing power of art 
to uplift, educate and enlighten. We opened this school within the 
camps, to bring some joy and inspiration to the people that are trapped 
there.  Though the world of art is vast and incredible, you don’t need a
 plane ticket to see it. It is shared person to person. This has been 
the goal of our work at the academy, and the process of sharing the 
wonderful gift of art has changed the lives of our students almost as 
much as it has changed our own.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442196986/pwnpjkiru6nhwz45cbjw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 424.264px; height: 321px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442197140/drsdvkbjz74ldhysls1g.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 424px; height: 318px;""/></p><br/><p>Currently the center is shared with Ceramics Cooperative consisting of 
about 20 women who finished their basic training at the School. Through 
this cooperative they have a job in a place they are practically 
intended to stay home and raise a family. They also learn a proffesion  
that allows them to express their creativity and have a small source of

In the Saharawi refugee camps located in the Sahara desert of Algeria
 (Africa) life can be very hard. Uprooted by a war they didn’t begin, 
the displaced people of Western Sahara reside there;  in a country that 
is not their own, in conditions that many would consider to be 
unlivable. Most of these people will never leave the boundaries of the 
camps. Most of them will never get to travel or see the world. They are 
prisoners, yet they have committed no crime.
So we decided we would bring the world to them.
Nearly a decade ago, we formed the Saharawi School of Ceramics for 
women; a non-profit academy dedicated to using the amazing power of art 
to uplift, educate and enlighten. We opened this school within the 
camps, to bring some joy and inspiration to the people that are trapped 
there.  Though the world of art is vast and incredible, you don’t need a
 plane ticket to see it. It is shared person to person. This has been 
the goal of our work at the academy, and the process of sharing the 
wonderful gift of art has changed the lives of our students almost as 
much as it has changed our own.Currently the center is shared with Ceramics Cooperative consisting of 
about 20 women who finished their basic training at the School. Through 
this cooperative they have a job in a place they are practically 
intended to stay home and raise a family. They also learn a proffesion  
that allows them to express their creativity and have a small source of 
income to help their families.The school consists of one year of basic education in the various 
techniques of ceramics. Every year 10 women are selected by a simple 
test which measures their artistic skills. Once the education year is 
completed these women are given the option to join the cooperative where
 they work producing pottery for sale.Up until now the school was funded by government grants, but due to 
the economic crisis in Spain the funding has stopped and, whith no help 
in sight, the school is in risk of closing it's doors.
So we decided to start this campaign, to reach out to the world for 
help. We want to reach out to those with a passion for art, and who 
understand the power it can have to change lives. We want to reach out 
to the people who care about the struggles of those who live beyond 
their borders.
Will you help us continue our work?WHO ARE WE?
We are Alicia Fernandez Diaz, professor of ceramic, and Pilar Mas-Masia Sierra, coordinator of the project, from Spain.
To this date the project has been coordinated by the Federation of 
Support to the Saharawi People of Valencia (FASPS) and the City Council 
of Puzol (Valencia). After traveling there several times a year and 
working voluntarily at the school during the past 10 years and loosing 
the public funding, we decided to turn to private funding to continue 
the school and allow that more women still benefit from this project in 
which so much time and effort has been invested.WHAT WILL WE SPEND THE MONEY ON?

<p>The answer is simple and obvious:<b> It costs.</b></p>
<p>While we have been able to get some support from private organizations, art lovers, media and volunteers in Sarajevo, however this will only be enough to cover the bare basics of making only a few events in three days. <br/><br/>As the goal of FUU is to involve as many artists as possible and truly make an impact on the city and establish a tradition of hosting FUU each year, we will need additional support. <br/></p>
<p><b>WE need YOU! <br/></b></p>
<p>If we can reach our goal of raising €25000  we can make FUU a complete three day experience and involve as many artists and locations in Sarajevo as possible and set the foundations of creating a festival that will get stronger every year. <br/></p>

These are just a few of our confirmed guests for this years festival. A detailed schedule and list of artists is available on our web site http://www.fuu.ba . 






At this point you may ask yourself, why do we need support if we already have confirmed artists visiting and have developed a festival program. 
The answer is simple and obvious: It costs.
While we have been able to get some support from private organizations, art lovers, media and volunteers in Sarajevo, however this will only be enough to cover the bare basics of making only a few events in three days. As the goal of FUU is to involve as many artists as possible and truly make an impact on the city and establish a tradition of hosting FUU each year, we will need additional support. 
WE need YOU! 
If we can reach our goal of raising €25000  we can make FUU a complete three day experience and involve as many artists and locations in Sarajevo as possible and set the foundations of creating a festival that will get stronger every year. 
Together, we could put art back into the spotlight!
Here is a short breakdown of what additional activities and events we can make (along with covering the costs of our current ones) with amount of money we will raise: 






FUU video log and documentary. We will be able to record the performances and exhibitions and make a short documentary film about the festival, the artists and the people behind them.

Cover the costs for performing the play ""Alice in Wonderland"" created by the students of the three Art Academies in Sarajevo (Performing Arts, Music and Fine Arts), in the botanical gardens of the closed National Museum.  

Create bloc parties in two Sarajevo municipalities (Novi Grad and Novo Sarajevo) featuring graffiti artists, DJ's and the students from the Music Academy of Sarajevo. 


Everything from above + 
Project: Camera Obscura on the streets by artist Dženat Dreković. - Take photos of people passing by the streets of Sarajevo and the participants/artists of the festival and print out these photographs to be put on exhibition on the closing of the festival. 

Creating graffiti murals on three more different locations in Sarajevo by local graffiti artists. 

3D video mapping performance by Miško Nećak on one of the landmark Sarajevo buildings (History Museum or Ars Aevi)
Uncovering the life-sized sculpture of Everyman, by artist Lejla Čehajić, which will permanently stay in Sarajevo.





By reaching our goal of €25000 we could make all of the above happen plus we would have the opportunity to create a contest among among young Architects and Designers to submit projects that would contribute to the partial revival of ruined and neglected locations in Sarajevo. Their creative solutions would make Sarajevo a more beautiful place and at the same time empower and encourage youth to step out with their own ideas and projects and most importantly leave their permanent mark on the city together with FUU.   
Additional funds would go to making the selected project happen and prepare the same process for next year's FUU. All of the funds are going directly to making this festival happen for Sarajevo and its citizens. Funding FUU will get you many different perks. Here are some of them: 
  




We are able to ship the perks (apart from a few available worldwide) to the US, Europe, Canada and Australia. Most of the perks will be shipped after the festival. Click on them for more detail. 
   

FUU is every man and woman who loves art and believes it should be out there for everyone. The idea of the festival first initiated by renowned Sarajevan director Aleš Kurt who is the heart of the FUU. After Aleš presented his idea to us, we started working tirelessly on making FUU happen. We are: 









You can also help us by spreading the word about FUU to your friends and work associates. Everyman would love that everyone knows about FUU!  Every contribution counts. Also, if you are based in Sarajevo you can volunteer  for the festival from September 25th to 27th (see website for more detail).",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Parallel universes have begun to merge, creating wormholes and wreaking havoc.  Two unlikely historical figures fight for survival as they search for the truth behind these mysterious happenings. </p>

<p>Our adventure begins with Ernest Hemingway, who is quietly fishing off the coast of Cuba. Out of the blue, a wormhole opens up; Amelia Earhart and her airplane zip by, crashing into the ocean. Hemingway’s instincts take control; he plunges in to rescue any survivors but resurfaces holding a small girl dressed in pilot’s clothing. Amelia awakens the next day, unable to remember any aspects of her former life, other than her first name. Ernest and Amelia exchange introductions as they try to make sense of recent events. During their discussion, a mysterious creature materializes before them and calls himself Bob the Time Traveling Spirit Fish.</p>
<p>Bob explains that he can create safe time-traveling portals and detect time-related anomalies in their universe. Due to these powers, Bob has an immense knowledge of time-travel and parallel universes. Still unsure, the duo has Bob clarify recent events. They discover Amelia’s wormhole was the catalyst setting in motion the decay and pending destruction of the multiverse.  Bob informs Ernest and Amelia as to how normal objects pass through wormholes and how they’re usually twisted by their turbulent nature. However, Bob’s powers allow them to travel securely and without any negative consequences throughout these time rifts. In doing so, they’ll be able to uncover evidence and track down whomever is responsible for this disaster.</p>
<p>Over the course of six issues, this ragtag trio jumps one time-rift to another, they uncover clues, and meet a wide arrange of past, present, and time-distorted characters. Eventually, Bob’s powers are able to pinpoint the location of Amelia’s plane and uncover her true identity. In a parallel universe, Fred Noonan, co-pilot to Amelia Earhart, survived the horrific plane crash. Noonan had dedicated the rest of his life to save his partner; after years of trial and error, he creates and opens a wormhole that can save Amelia.  <br/> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is for the first two issues of <i>Ernest Hemingway and Amelia Earhart in the Tales of Time</i>.  I need to raise money for a professional 11x17 scanner and printer, book binding supplies, and printing costs.</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to produce the first two issues in this series, with a projected six or more issues to follow.</p>
<p>In order to bring this book to life, I use traditional comic book making tools of the trade, such as ink, watercolor, and brush work. When the art is completed, I will then scan it, and touch up any flaws or mistakes in the art. From there, the files containing the comic pages and covers will be sent to the printer. Finally, the completed comic book will be bound and ready to be shipped out to you, my awesome supporters!</p>
<p>I plan on printing 100 copies of the first book to bring to comic book conventions and art shows. This will be on top of the issues printed especially for backers who want a physical copy or earn one in my perks! I will also be offering the first issue as a digital download.</p>
<p>Once the first issue is made available to the public, I will immediately begin work on the second book and continue the trend!</p>
<p>To show my appreciation to those who fund and help me reach my goal, I have created some amazing perks.  We will be offering 3 unique, high quality art prints, all splash pages made and used in the upcoming series.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476408821/shnmzfmznqrynprhbn7e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Depending on your pledge level, you can chose from one, two, or even all three prints.

We built a stage entirely out of salvaged materials. Artists came together to share their passion and talents. We did something unheard of at a festival before (aside from not selling entry tickets): we turned off the music at dinner time and everyone gathered at a 200 ft. table to share a meal that we all created. It was a powerful, collaborative experience that echoed our ancestral pastimes.</p><h3>More than just a Burning Man Art Vehicle: A Mobile Storytelling Device</h3><p>Ascension continues to branch into different sustainable and creative projects. PAVO is a transformational story telling device that will debut at Burning Man 2016. PAVO the peacock tells the story of Ascension: improving yourself and connecting to the environment around you. The peacock is a symbol that represents the beauty that can be achieved when we endeavor to better ourselves. It’s about showing your true colors, living your life as a work of art by putting LOVE into everything that you do, and creating positive energy around you.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>By contributing to this project, you are investing in the future. Our vision for PAVO is to build a betterment mobile, showing up in times of need to rally the community towards action. For example, a “beach party” becomes a “party with a purpose” instead. PAVO will provide rewarding music as party-goers dance while they clean, leaving the beach more vibrant than before. This is just one example of the betterment PAVO can provide.</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>After much thought, planning, and discussion we respectfully ask you, our friends, our family, our people -- to support us in bringing our vision for PAVO to life. We have been building for months and still need funds in order to reveal PAVO at Burning Man 2016. The bulk of the energy will go toward: building the platform (at the BoxShopSF), repairs to the vehicle, lighting of the feathers (consulting with Symmetry Labs), and the sound system (Tectonic Audio Labs &amp; Know Audio).

<p>The Platform has been in operation since June 2015.  Since then we've had about 3 shows a month featuring performing artists of every type you can imagine. We've had 80 year olds in our audiences as well as 8 year olds, and everywhere in between. We've created countless connections between folks in the community that wouldn't have a place or reason to meet otherwise. The Platform was born out a love for the arts and this community and we couldn’t be more thankful for all of the support we’ve received so far.</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot in the past year. One of the things we’ve learned is that there is not much profit in a performance venue in a town of 5,000 in rural West Central, Minnesota, particularly when you make an effort to pay artists for their time and travels. There are significant costs associated with maintaining the space (rent, promotional costs, insurance, equipment, etc.) All of our revenue is generated by cover fees and previous donations. Your donations will be used to supplement our funds and cover some of the aforementioned costs.</p>
<p>This time around a donation gets you a space on our east wall. We’ve divided the wall into vinyl record cover and CD cover sized spaces. We have options for groups and individuals. We are working with local artists to design and paint the spaces, or if you’d prefer you can come in and paint the space yourself. You can have the space simply say your name or a brief message (because we are all ages, we will be filtering these messages). In our past fundraiser we struggled to keep up with all of the perks we offered. This time around we are keeping things much simpler to be easier to keep up with. You can expect your wall space to be filled with in a month to a month and a half of your donation.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider donating to #fillourwalls. The Platform has been a place of passion and joy for many individuals in the past year. Please contribute to continue our goal of community building and nurturing the arts in West Central Minnesota. Thank you for your time and thanks in advance if you choose to donate!</p>

<p>Each

throughout the City and surrounding area. </p>
<p>Baltimore
Clayworks is committed to making the arts accessible to those who otherwise
would have limited or no access, bringing professional ceramic artists to
Baltimore to work with youth and senior adults at our satellite studios and in
other spaces in their own communities. By partnering with organizations already

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Clayworks has over 300 individuals

level, Clayworks fires our wood kiln up to 2-3 times a month, about 30 times a
year. Similar kilns across the county fire an average of 10-15 times a year.
Our process is community driven as well. During the 24 hour firing process, all
individuals who purchase a share in the kiln are also encouraged to sign up for
a shift throughout the firing. They also assist with the loading and unloading –
really making it a community effort.</p>
<p>Groups from the region, hailing from
all over Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia, take
advantage of the different techniques and effects that come out of the kiln
that are far different than what many get from gas and electric. The kiln is used
as a learning tool for ceramic programs in the area; Clayworks sees groups from
the <b>Maryland Institute College of Art, Coppin State, CCBC Essex, Morgan
University </b>and<b> Towson University</b> to name a few.</p>
<p>There is a great interest and need
in the area to have a kiln and facilities like Clayworks in Baltimore. In the
past, we’ve raised funds through a similar platform to rebuild our other kilns,
had a successful 35<sup>th</sup> anniversary campaign last year through
indiegogo among other targeted project efforts that were successful. Please
consider making a gift through this Indiegogo campaign in order for Clayworks
to reach our goal for the rebuild.</p>
<p><b>Risks

<p>Our biggest challenge during this
time is raising the funds to complete the project. We will not be able to move

<p>We currently have a budget, plans

While gazing at the starry sky, she, too, ponders the blue planet of her own soul. This is the world from which the characters for her unusual works all hail.It is also where her new project comes from, ""The Wonder Maker’s Tale"", an illustrated storybook that lets her reveal to you her talents as a writer and painter.​The book tells ten stories that explore the lives of people who have lived on our planet in various times and cultures.Each story is illustrated with a painting dedicated to its main hero.The stories trace past events as they impact both the present and the future through each successive generation, inviting readers to see how from the very moment of our births, each one of us takes part in the creation not only of our own history, but also that of those who will follow us.These seemingly unrelated events all have a common theme—the soul and its revelation of each person’s life mission.In her artworks Laija layers sheens of luminescent paint, having developed a unique technique of her own. The paintings surprise their audience with their interchanging hidden images and hues; as the lighting of a particular painting shifts, thousands of new shades glimmer, glow and fade, altering the viewers’ perception of the artwork.We invite you to participate in the creation of the English version of ""The Wonder Maker’s Tale"" by contributing towards covering its translation and editing costs from Latvian into English. The funds shall be used according to the plan below:
Translation of nine stories: ~60%
Proofreading, editing and various administrative costs: ~20%
Delivery of perks to our valued supporters: ~20%
The stories are 20 to 40 standard pages in length. Each story has to be carefully edited for accuracy and readability, proofread and spellchecked multiple times. Here’s an advance excerpt from one of the stories, ""Heavenly"": Share “The Wonder Maker’s Tale”If you enjoyed the story excerpt and artwork, please consider helping us complete our project by sharing:In gratitude for your support, we offer you the complete story ""Aziza’s Dream"". We have launched the Laija Art brand to better promote our creative collaborations.""The Wonder Maker’s Tale"" currently is our main project. Laija Laura OzoliņaWriter, painter and designer, co-founder of Laija ArtLaija has been a continuous creative force of our team, and an inspiration to us all.“I have always desired to create something beautiful and unusual, like no one else!

<div>Hi I’m Alyson Baker, Please allow me  to take this opportunity to introduce you to “Urban Success Movement's - Worldhits.org"", an answer to providing  technology, multimedia access and online training in poverty stricken areas. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The objective is to provide online career awareness and eLearning that will help prepare students living in poverty for careers in digital media and work as independent professionals, in an atmosphere of innovation, leadership, teamwork, and creative thinking. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We can no longer sit back and wait for elected officials to enact common sense reforms. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>At a young age I embraced learning and helping others, that's the reason I became a teacher. I want to leave a legacy of helping under-served youth gain skills that will give them a competitive edge in the 21st Century.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As a former teacher that grew up in Sarasota, FL. I know first hand that teaching is not easy. All too often educators are asked to achieve high goals with meager resources and distracted students. Technology alone can not improve learning, but an intimate partnership between educators, creative talent and technology developers can.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span>Worldhits.org, is a Social Network uniquely suited to the needs of creative Urban High School and College students who are accustomed to turning to social media for entertainment, communication, self-expression, gaining and sharing knowledge in addition to building interpersonal networks. Worldhits.org will include an eLearning component, a  social community (similar to other social media applications), and an online annual spoken-word/songwriter </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">competition. Worldhits.Org has recently completed it’s test/proof of concept phase. As of August 1, 2015 we have more than 11,000 active members.</span>

</div>
<div>Over the last three years the number of teenagers using Facebook has declined by 25 percent, while the number of users 55 and older has gone up more than 80 percent. Many high school and college students are tired of using a social network where their parents, grandparents and future employers can see their updates. Enter Worldhits.Org, a social network designed with urban students in mind. The plan is to redesign Worldhits.Org to become more of a Multimedia social community and eLearning network with additional interactive features:  Songwriting, Spoken Word and Story telling competitions, as well as an Online Neighborhood Talk Video (ONTV) series called ""Bridging The Abyss"".<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZ7b_5ATJQY4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ7b_5ATJQY4%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZ7b_5ATJQY4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<br/>Worldhits.org is a membership based social community that is being redesigned to advance teenage digital communications and learning beyond the academic world. ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series is an answer to the need for youth in disadvantaged communities to learn to use the worldwide web and social media to it's full potential, not just for recreation. Students will be encouraged to produce and distribute content on world views, while being mentored by professionals in the field.
<div><br/></div>
<div>Worldhits.org will relaunch with a national talent search and feature open auditions for ""Bridging The Abyss"" - I Can Change the World (#ICCTW) Challenge. #ICCTW CHALLENGE is a competition for voices of change (protest) Songwriters and Spoken Word Poets to promote civic engagement. The desired outcome is to build bridges between races and generations via audio and video communications. Youth will have an opportunity to voice their emotions surrounding the  social injustices and atrocities occurring today.</div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Marvin Gay, John Lennon and Bob Marley were the hip, counter-cultural voices of their generation. Today we are seeing a revival of the protest song in pop and alternative music evolving into an international movement giving voice to the voiceless, focusing specifically on teens.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We can start here, by creating a safe platform for all young poets and protest songwriters to speak their minds, while maintaining responsibility for every syllable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> This is our way of letting teens ""Get it off their Chest."" It’s about engaging a world audience. Through our online social and learning network we can begin to make social change.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The meaning of “Protest Song” is broad – Kanye West rapped about child labor in “Diamonds From Sierra Leon” and Public Enemy performed political music in the late 80’s. The song “Fight The Power” was conceived at the request of film director Spike Lee, who sought a musical theme for his 1989 film “Do the Right Thing.” </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><p> Several groups of poets and musicians arose from the late 1960s African-American civil rights movement.  “Serious spokesmen like Gill Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, who paved the way for the many socially committed Black Emcees a decade later.”</p></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Virtual mentors will encourage young songwriters and poets to write pieces for ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series and even short films that go along with their song or spoken word entries. We believe that the racial and politically-charged tension caused by recent events in this country and around the world have reignited  this genre of music. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I want youth to share their thoughts from a social or personal experience through music and skits. The #ICCTW Challenge is an opportunity for amateur composers to showcase their talent on ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series and to inspire all of us to take an active role in making our community and the world a better place.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Worldhits.org is a social platform that takes community issues, concerns and experiences and makes them a part of teenagers education, social and political life.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think it's a great idea to engage Urban youth in creating social networks, online contests, audio and video content with the intent to educate and entertain.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This platform gives  youth the freedom to speak out, be heard and counted in protests and exercise their voting power through text messaging, podcasting, videos and blogs without the risk associated with mass public demonstrations.</div>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">What I Need</span></p>
<p> It hasn't been easy to get this far during the initial development phase.  Despite the progress made over the past three years, there is still a lot of work to do. With your help, I hope to raise $15,000 for the next phase of development which includes: Involving the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) in the strategic planning, website development and the creation and management of a Charitable fund.  I would also like  to give youth that are learning to code an opportunity to work as virtual volunteers and/or interns under the guidance of Silicon Valley Community Foundation on developing mobile Apps and the redesign and relaunching of Worldhits.org.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>SVCF's customized philanthropy team will be contracted to develop the initial strategic planning around the full scope of what I am trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>The redesigned website will include these additional features and more:</p>
<p>*Donation page for U.S.A. 4 TECH fund (coming soon!)</p>
<p>*eLearning  capacity</p>
<p>*Virtual mentors and tutors</p>
<p>*Artist can get feedback on their original music/spoken word from professionals and other members.</p>
<p>*Multimedia project promotion and distribution services</p>
<p>*Chapter development <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Now, more than ever, major corporations and
foundations are aligning with celebrities, public figures, community leaders
and non-profit organizations for a good cause. However, the dynamic
between nonprofits and private sector organizations has shifted in corporate
philanthropy, from giving programs to strategic investments. This requires a
more innovative business approach like ours for fundability and sustainability.</p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>The US Movement is
designed to significantly broaden collaborations among celebrities, public
figures, corporations, foundations, community based organizations, schools and
colleges. The result will be sponsorship and/or promotion of the #ICCTW Challenge
in support of education reform, Internet access, career awareness,
entrepreneurial literacy, as well as creating a virtual entrepreneurial future workforce.</p>
<br/>
<div>Worldhits.org provides a ""home"" and a family, for young music lovers, songwriters, poets and composers through our programs, resources, community network and support.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>Here is a sneak peek of Authoring Action participants rehearsing at my studio in North Carolina for #ICCTW Challenge. The song is taking shape with its catchy tune and lyrics. Can't wait to hear the finished product. Let the Challenge begin! </div> <p><br/></p>
</div></div>","Hi I’m Alyson Baker, Please allow me  to take this opportunity to introduce you to “Urban Success Movement's - Worldhits.org"", an answer to providing  technology, multimedia access and online training in poverty stricken areas. 

The objective is to provide online career awareness and eLearning that will help prepare students living in poverty for careers in digital media and work as independent professionals, in an atmosphere of innovation, leadership, teamwork, and creative thinking. 

We can no longer sit back and wait for elected officials to enact common sense reforms. 


At a young age I embraced learning and helping others, that's the reason I became a teacher. I want to leave a legacy of helping under-served youth gain skills that will give them a competitive edge in the 21st Century.

As a former teacher that grew up in Sarasota, FL. I know first hand that teaching is not easy. All too often educators are asked to achieve high goals with meager resources and distracted students. Technology alone can not improve learning, but an intimate partnership between educators, creative talent and technology developers can.


Worldhits.org, is a Social Network uniquely suited to the needs of creative Urban High School and College students who are accustomed to turning to social media for entertainment, communication, self-expression, gaining and sharing knowledge in addition to building interpersonal networks. Worldhits.org will include an eLearning component, a  social community (similar to other social media applications), and an online annual spoken-word/songwriter competition. Worldhits.Org has recently completed it’s test/proof of concept phase. As of August 1, 2015 we have more than 11,000 active members.









Over the last three years the number of teenagers using Facebook has declined by 25 percent, while the number of users 55 and older has gone up more than 80 percent. Many high school and college students are tired of using a social network where their parents, grandparents and future employers can see their updates. Enter Worldhits.Org, a social network designed with urban students in mind. The plan is to redesign Worldhits.Org to become more of a Multimedia social community and eLearning network with additional interactive features:  Songwriting, Spoken Word and Story telling competitions, as well as an Online Neighborhood Talk Video (ONTV) series called ""Bridging The Abyss"".






Worldhits.org is a membership based social community that is being redesigned to advance teenage digital communications and learning beyond the academic world. ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series is an answer to the need for youth in disadvantaged communities to learn to use the worldwide web and social media to it's full potential, not just for recreation. Students will be encouraged to produce and distribute content on world views, while being mentored by professionals in the field.

Worldhits.org will relaunch with a national talent search and feature open auditions for ""Bridging The Abyss"" - I Can Change the World (#ICCTW) Challenge. #ICCTW CHALLENGE is a competition for voices of change (protest) Songwriters and Spoken Word Poets to promote civic engagement. The desired outcome is to build bridges between races and generations via audio and video communications. Youth will have an opportunity to voice their emotions surrounding the  social injustices and atrocities occurring today.


Marvin Gay, John Lennon and Bob Marley were the hip, counter-cultural voices of their generation. Today we are seeing a revival of the protest song in pop and alternative music evolving into an international movement giving voice to the voiceless, focusing specifically on teens.

We can start here, by creating a safe platform for all young poets and protest songwriters to speak their minds, while maintaining responsibility for every syllable.

 This is our way of letting teens ""Get it off their Chest."" It’s about engaging a world audience. Through our online social and learning network we can begin to make social change.

The meaning of “Protest Song” is broad – Kanye West rapped about child labor in “Diamonds From Sierra Leon” and Public Enemy performed political music in the late 80’s. The song “Fight The Power” was conceived at the request of film director Spike Lee, who sought a musical theme for his 1989 film “Do the Right Thing.” 

 Several groups of poets and musicians arose from the late 1960s African-American civil rights movement.  “Serious spokesmen like Gill Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, who paved the way for the many socially committed Black Emcees a decade later.”

Virtual mentors will encourage young songwriters and poets to write pieces for ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series and even short films that go along with their song or spoken word entries. We believe that the racial and politically-charged tension caused by recent events in this country and around the world have reignited  this genre of music. 

I want youth to share their thoughts from a social or personal experience through music and skits. The #ICCTW Challenge is an opportunity for amateur composers to showcase their talent on ""Bridging The Abyss"" ONTV series and to inspire all of us to take an active role in making our community and the world a better place.


Worldhits.org is a social platform that takes community issues, concerns and experiences and makes them a part of teenagers education, social and political life.


I think it's a great idea to engage Urban youth in creating social networks, online contests, audio and video content with the intent to educate and entertain.


This platform gives  youth the freedom to speak out, be heard and counted in protests and exercise their voting power through text messaging, podcasting, videos and blogs without the risk associated with mass public demonstrations.



One of the many eLearning classes that Worldhits.org will host, is ""Writing to the Senses,"" a creative writing workshop run by Nathan Ross Freeman, Creative Director of Authoring Action. Nathan has initiated many literary events including open mic and writing retreats; providing opportunities for songwriters to collaborate and network. 



What I Need
 It hasn't been easy to get this far during the initial development phase.  Despite the progress made over the past three years, there is still a lot of work to do. With your help, I hope to raise $15,000 for the next phase of development which includes: Involving the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) in the strategic planning, website development and the creation and management of a Charitable fund.  I would also like  to give youth that are learning to code an opportunity to work as virtual volunteers and/or interns under the guidance of Silicon Valley Community Foundation on developing mobile Apps and the redesign and relaunching of Worldhits.org.

SVCF's customized philanthropy team will be contracted to develop the initial strategic planning around the full scope of what I am trying to accomplish.
The redesigned website will include these additional features and more:
*Donation page for U.S.A. 4 TECH fund (coming soon!)
*eLearning  capacity
*Virtual mentors and tutors
*Artist can get feedback on their original music/spoken word from professionals and other members.
*Multimedia project promotion and distribution services
*Chapter development 
  
The Impact

Now, more than ever, major corporations and
foundations are aligning with celebrities, public figures, community leaders
and non-profit organizations for a good cause. However, the dynamic
between nonprofits and private sector organizations has shifted in corporate
philanthropy, from giving programs to strategic investments. This requires a
more innovative business approach like ours for fundability and sustainability.



The US Movement is
designed to significantly broaden collaborations among celebrities, public
figures, corporations, foundations, community based organizations, schools and
colleges. The result will be sponsorship and/or promotion of the #ICCTW Challenge
in support of education reform, Internet access, career awareness,
entrepreneurial literacy, as well as creating a virtual entrepreneurial future workforce.

Worldhits.org provides a ""home"" and a family, for young music lovers, songwriters, poets and composers through our programs, resources, community network and support.

Youth will have hands on experiences in creative writing, developing websites, graphic design, content management and social media marketing.


Worldhits.org provides artist and music lovers opportunities to collaborate, create awareness about their original music, promote themselves and get training. The plan is to team up with Silicon Valley Foundation, publishing companies, entertainment venues, producers, schools, the wider media and other like-minded individuals to create a chain of support and networking opportunities.



Risks & Challenges

Social Networks are a dime a dozen. There are plenty out there, each with specific roles and high competition. My main obstacle would be getting the word out to the Urban Community that this social platform is filled with not only the familiar components of social media, but also new and unique user experiences made possible by features that we are implementing into the website.
The challenges are real – production and content is one of those challenges. The overall features that I want to present to our users will definitely be time consuming, but I plan to work long hours, even if it means producing most of the core content myself. 

Other Ways You Can Help

The Worldwide web is the new frontier where we can stake a claim to virtual real-estate. By sharing this crowdfunding effort, by joining worldhits.org's membership and creating your profile on the site, as well as encouraging others to do the same, you are helping to support the development of a new student lead online social community. I am especially reaching out to my family, friends, Sororities, Fraternities and Members of the Entertainment Industry;  together we can create, encourage, support, promote and grow innovative projects for social change.


I truly believe in the power of Good Music, the World-Wide web,  social media marketing and above all, collective action. This is your chance to be the Change you want to see in the World!

The Burn Fund Centre Legacy Project
                          Giving Survivors the Best Chance at Recovery



An extraordinary opportunity to build a new & permanent home comes but once in a lifetime for a charity.  This is our time!  The Burn Fund Centre will be a permanent home to meet a critical shortfall in accommodations for burn & trauma patients and their family caregivers. 
WE are the Burn Fund

We are the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund, the registered charity of the BC Professional Fire Fighters' Association. An organization supported by over 3900 Professional Fire Fighters. The Burn Fund is dedicated to promoting burn prevention, providing survivor support and recovery programs in the province of British Columbia and the Yukon.



About the Burn Fund 
We are dedicated and committed to;

Burn Prevention & Education 
Child & Adult Burn Survivor Support & Recovery Programs
Purchase of Burn Treatment Equipment - Provincial Benefit
Supporting Medical Staff Education 
Children's Burn Survivor Camp in BC (Burn Camp)
Burn & Wound Healing Research Lab directed by Dr. Aziz Ghahary
Building a new Burn Fund Centre, our biggest and most ambitious project to date. A true legacy to Burn Survivors and their compassionate future care


WHAT is the Burn Fund Centre Legacy Project?

One of the newest and most exciting projects we have underway is the Burn Fund Centre - our new and permanent  ' home-away-from home' for Burn Survivors and their families.  The Centre's construction is almost complete with a projected grand opening in March 2016. The vision for the Burn Fund Centre started over 10 years ago. Within the last year, it has become a reality because of all the generosity, hard work and dedication of everyone involved. We are so close to completion!

     Dream to Reality; the finish line is within reach!

WHY Build a Burn Fund Centre?



The Burn Fund Centre will address the critical short fall in patient accommodations for Burn Survivors and their families. 

The Burn Fund Centre will ensure families stay together during prolonged treatment.

Uninterrupted treatment in a home-away-form-home atmosphere speeds successful long-term recovery, especially for children. 
The Centre is located on the corner of Main and 23rd Street in between and close to Vancouver General Hospital and Children's Hospital burn units.

WHO Needs the Burn Fund Centre?



Burn and major trauma survivors from across BC and the Yukon, who travel to Vancouver under emergency circumstances for medical treatment
Survivors who need on-going treatment such as burn dressings, skin grafts, pressure garments, plastic and reconstructive surgery, trauma counselling and physiotherapy

The minimum average stay is 10 days but can last many weeks or months, with follow up treatments and outpatient care that could last years.  As child and adult Burn Survivors come back for repeated care, the Burn Fund Centre will become this key missing piece for families needing accommodations during this challenging time. 






We are close to Children's Hospital for Child Burn Survivors and their families.






""I was nine years old... I was a patient for almost two months... my family could not always be there with me, which is why the new Burn Centre that is being planned is so important for families like mine.""                                                                                                     ~ Rhea Dyck, Burn Survivor 



We are close to Vancouver General Hospital for Adult Burn Survivors and their families.





 
 ""I endured more than twenty surgeries that year.                                                                       I spent seven months in the burn unit.""                                                                                     ~ Heidi Cave, Burn Survivor and Author      www.heidicave.com

<p><strong>What is this project about?</strong></p>
<p>I've always wanted to create a publication that is also art, a way to communicate ideas with images and text, and in the form of the thing itself. I imagined subscribers getting a package in the mail every few months, and opening it like a gift. I wanted it to be art that you can hold and touch and move.</p>
<p>So, I am publishing editions of artist's books. I call it The Metamer Quarterly -- I chose the equinoxes and solstices for shipping dates, and started selling subscriptions in 2016. Issue #3, ""The Book of Love,"" will ship this month, around June 20th.</p>
<p>You could describe an artist's book as a book that is an art object. It borrows from the attributes of books – covers, hinges, pages, text – but also expands the idea of what a book can be. Artists' books don't reproduce art or images – they are the art. The subject is often reflected in how an artist's book is made, and what it is made of, as well as in text and image. </p>
<p>This format gives me both license, and some challenging boundaries. Each issue strikes a balance between originality and the need for reproduction. I plan to continue to use manual forms of reproduction as much as possible, like screenprinting and letterpress, and to always include elements that are drawn, collaged, handmade, and unique to each copy in the edition. This project is analog; its design and purpose are about physicality, objects, feel, and weight. It is art you can hold in your hands.</p>
<p>The first issue, “Metamerism”, came out in December of 2016: an accordion book made with heavyweight drawing paper, gel transfers, paint, rubber stamps, and containing a real glass prism. The second issue, “Maps and Diagrams”, shipped in March. It is covered in a durable bookcloth used for library editions. Inside, a folder with a star-shaped opening holds soccer coaching diagrams, an airport map turned poem, the night sky in gold leaf, and maps of childhood. I had five collaborators on this issue, which was a real joy.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do You Need Funding?</strong></p>
<p>My first campaign was aimed at expanding my skills and materials. I raised enough money to take a week-long class at the North Bennet St School in June, and to invest in some additional tools and materials for the next six issues.</p>
<p>(If you would like to learn more, click here:  <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-metamer-quarterly-art-you-can-hold-book#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-metamer-...</a>  )</p>
<p>This new, ""Part Two"" campaign has two main goals - expanding the audience and collectors, and taking the show on the road. As I've spread the word about this project, and some of the art projects that arose out of the perks, interest has grown. IndieGoGo provides a convenient way to meet some of the new demand. Additionally, a little more funding will allow me to visit some book fairs, and some of artist's book collections, particularly in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. I want to see and hold and study what other artists are doing!</p>
<p><strong>What Do I Get In Return?</strong></p>
<p>At every level, you will receive original art related to The Metamer Quarterly. Perks are set up to correspond to a particular donation amount; they include framable versions of art from the first two issues – a star map with gold leaf stars, and a color wheel in the medium of your choice.The higher levels include one or more issues of TMQ.</p>
<p>You will also get public thanks for your support  - everyone who contributes will be listed on a special <a href=""http://themetamerquarterly.blogspot.com/p/thank-you.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Thank You</i>  page</a> on The Metamer Quarterly website/blog. I also plan to include the names of all the IndieGoGo supporters in Issue #3, ""The Book of Love.""</p>
<p><strong>How Else Can I Help?</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word! Please share this campaign with any friend or colleague who might be interested in the project. Feel free to share the link on social media, and please contact me if you'd like some art cards to hand out.</p>
<p>I consider it a help too if you are supporting the arts in any way, in any place. I'm very serious! I am an artist in part because my family had their friends' art on the walls, and took us to museums and live music events and dance performances. We need the arts, and all artists need audiences – go to a show, to a museum, to exhibitions at local galleries or at the library in town. Buy more art if you can!</p>
<p><strong>By The Way, What Is A Metamer?</strong></p>
<p>A metamer is a color that appears, to a particular observer, to be identical to another color in some lighting situations, but not in others. That shift from match to mis-match indicates a difference in chemical make-up and spectral reflectance – the colors' light signatures – and is called metamerism. Metamers only exists in relationship to each other, and depend on who is looking and under what conditions. I like that as a metaphor. You can't be a metamer by yourself.</p>
<p>Metamerism is something we experience visually all the time. It is the reason that a paint chip from the hardware store can match the living room wall at night but is glaringly off in daylight. It is the socks that matched when you put them on this morning, but didn't later at the office. All colors shift depending on light and juxtaposition; metamers perform a little dance with one another, joining and separating, meeting and diverging.</p>
<p><strong>And, Who Are You Again?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Lara Scott, and I am an artist currently living in Central New York -- south of Utica, north of Binghamton. I grew up in Stamford, CT, and got a BA in Art at Yale University, focusing on painting and printmaking. After college, I lived in DC, and drifted in the direction of art history for awhile. Then I drifted out to California. When I realized that no matter where I drifted, I was always making art, I decided to move in a more definite direction. I returned to the east coast, and got my MFA at the University of Pennsylvania. After that, I taught studio art at two small colleges, one near St Louis, MO, and the other in VA, for over seven years. Most recently, I worked in the R&amp;D Lab at Golden Artist Colors, also for about seven years. I am now working primarily as freelance graphic designer and illustrator, something I've done off and on for the last twenty plus years.</p>
<p>I work primarily in collage, oil paint, and <a href=""https://vimeo.com/larascott"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a>. </p>

</div></div>","What is this project about?
I've always wanted to create a publication that is also art, a way to communicate ideas with images and text, and in the form of the thing itself. I imagined subscribers getting a package in the mail every few months, and opening it like a gift. I wanted it to be art that you can hold and touch and move.
So, I am publishing editions of artist's books. I call it The Metamer Quarterly -- I chose the equinoxes and solstices for shipping dates, and started selling subscriptions in 2016. Issue #3, ""The Book of Love,"" will ship this month, around June 20th.
You could describe an artist's book as a book that is an art object. It borrows from the attributes of books – covers, hinges, pages, text – but also expands the idea of what a book can be. Artists' books don't reproduce art or images – they are the art. The subject is often reflected in how an artist's book is made, and what it is made of, as well as in text and image. 
This format gives me both license, and some challenging boundaries. Each issue strikes a balance between originality and the need for reproduction. I plan to continue to use manual forms of reproduction as much as possible, like screenprinting and letterpress, and to always include elements that are drawn, collaged, handmade, and unique to each copy in the edition. This project is analog; its design and purpose are about physicality, objects, feel, and weight. It is art you can hold in your hands.
The first issue, “Metamerism”, came out in December of 2016: an accordion book made with heavyweight drawing paper, gel transfers, paint, rubber stamps, and containing a real glass prism. The second issue, “Maps and Diagrams”, shipped in March. It is covered in a durable bookcloth used for library editions. Inside, a folder with a star-shaped opening holds soccer coaching diagrams, an airport map turned poem, the night sky in gold leaf, and maps of childhood. I had five collaborators on this issue, which was a real joy.
Why Do You Need Funding?
My first campaign was aimed at expanding my skills and materials. I raised enough money to take a week-long class at the North Bennet St School in June, and to invest in some additional tools and materials for the next six issues.
(If you would like to learn more, click here:  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-metamer-...  )
This new, ""Part Two"" campaign has two main goals - expanding the audience and collectors, and taking the show on the road. As I've spread the word about this project, and some of the art projects that arose out of the perks, interest has grown. IndieGoGo provides a convenient way to meet some of the new demand. Additionally, a little more funding will allow me to visit some book fairs, and some of artist's book collections, particularly in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. I want to see and hold and study what other artists are doing!
What Do I Get In Return?
At every level, you will receive original art related to The Metamer Quarterly. Perks are set up to correspond to a particular donation amount; they include framable versions of art from the first two issues – a star map with gold leaf stars, and a color wheel in the medium of your choice.The higher levels include one or more issues of TMQ.
You will also get public thanks for your support  - everyone who contributes will be listed on a special Thank You  page on The Metamer Quarterly website/blog. I also plan to include the names of all the IndieGoGo supporters in Issue #3, ""The Book of Love.""
How Else Can I Help?
Spread the word! Please share this campaign with any friend or colleague who might be interested in the project. Feel free to share the link on social media, and please contact me if you'd like some art cards to hand out.
I consider it a help too if you are supporting the arts in any way, in any place. I'm very serious! I am an artist in part because my family had their friends' art on the walls, and took us to museums and live music events and dance performances. We need the arts, and all artists need audiences – go to a show, to a museum, to exhibitions at local galleries or at the library in town. Buy more art if you can!
By The Way, What Is A Metamer?
A metamer is a color that appears, to a particular observer, to be identical to another color in some lighting situations, but not in others. That shift from match to mis-match indicates a difference in chemical make-up and spectral reflectance – the colors' light signatures – and is called metamerism. Metamers only exists in relationship to each other, and depend on who is looking and under what conditions. I like that as a metaphor. You can't be a metamer by yourself.
Metamerism is something we experience visually all the time. It is the reason that a paint chip from the hardware store can match the living room wall at night but is glaringly off in daylight. It is the socks that matched when you put them on this morning, but didn't later at the office. All colors shift depending on light and juxtaposition; metamers perform a little dance with one another, joining and separating, meeting and diverging.
And, Who Are You Again?
My name is Lara Scott, and I am an artist currently living in Central New York -- south of Utica, north of Binghamton. I grew up in Stamford, CT, and got a BA in Art at Yale University, focusing on painting and printmaking. After college, I lived in DC, and drifted in the direction of art history for awhile. Then I drifted out to California. When I realized that no matter where I drifted, I was always making art, I decided to move in a more definite direction. I returned to the east coast, and got my MFA at the University of Pennsylvania. After that, I taught studio art at two small colleges, one near St Louis, MO, and the other in VA, for over seven years. Most recently, I worked in the R&D Lab at Golden Artist Colors, also for about seven years. I am now working primarily as freelance graphic designer and illustrator, something I've done off and on for the last twenty plus years.
I work primarily in collage, oil paint, and video.

<p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
<p>My name is Adrian DiUbaldo. My relationship with photography is not a very novel one. I didn't grow up with a camera constantly in my hands or by my side.  It started because I had a crush on a girl in the early years of college in Flagstaff, Arizona.  My pursuit, though not fruitful, uncovered an obsession with photography I did not expect to have.</p>
<p>I spent the remaining years of school constantly honing my skills and studying photojournalism as a profession.  I worked as a photojournalist from 2007-2010.  Then I began making imagery as a service for musicians and bands nationally and locally renown to Denver.  My company was called Photo Roadies. This company was successfully run until 2013, when new opportunities arose.</p>
<p>In 2013, I moved to Santa Barbara, California to study photography and art.  My understanding of photography and appreciation for artwork completely changed, as did I and what I create.  After nearly completing my MFA thesis at the Brooks Institute in Ventura California, the school closed its doors forever.  This was a sad occurrence indeed.</p>
<p>I am currently living in Colorado and continually exploring the transformative value of my art.  Most recently, I have been investigating Bipolar Disorder and the effect of mental illness on those closely connected to it.  By imbuing my work with discoveries about my own Bipolar Disorder, my goal is to contribute to the alleviation of any stigma associated with the illness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>Ok guys, here are the nuts and bolts.  Your support will go towards the renovation of my art space including the following:</p>
<p>a new photographic printer</p>
<p>dark room supplies</p>
<p>new brushes</p>
<p>fine art paper</p>
<p>a big batch of t-shirts to print on to support retail orders</p>
<p>a new camera</p>
<p>shelving</p>
<p>chemicals</p>
<p>paints</p>
<p>preferably an intern- to pay</p>
<p>a laptop</p>
<p>framing and packaging materials</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How I Plan to Make a Difference</strong></p>
<p>My art means a lot to me.  That is a cold hard truth for anyone who has found his or her artistry.  I want to press the point that I don’t just make art for myself, or monetary gain.  I have a life beyond my camera.  I am diagnosed Bipolar 1 mentally ill now for over 13 years. Since I picked up the camera my life and art have been twirling around this diagnosis.  In the last few years this twirl is more like a swirl.  They are blending into each other and they feed off of each other.  I get immense joy when I see someone truly connect to my artwork, and it gives me the power to spread that joy and knowledge to the community of mentally ill around me.  There are too many families that have been broken by a lack of affordable care, and there are too many with out homes because they are stuck in a destructive cycle of self-medication and oppression from the ignorant.  I spent years grappling with what it means for me to have this chronic disorder. Now that I know, I want to teach and share.  I just need the money to do it.  This is my dream, and this is where I start. With you.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>You can help donating, duh.</p>
<p>You can help me by going to my website and reading about who I am. If you really like my work, buy some of my more expensive pieces of artwork.  If that is the case, then we get to become real friends.  I don’t let go of those supporters :)</p>
<p>You can help by supporting any family or friend that you know that has a mental illness.  Anything helps immensely.</p>
<p>You can help by spreading the word about my goals and campaign. As an individual, my audience is limited, but I hope to grow my community by tapping into yours with your support.</p>

Where Your Donations Go

This is a subject I feel passionately about, and I am determined to bring the project to fruition.  I have donated all my time and expenses towards fulfilling this goal.  However, I cannot fund the entirety of the project on my own.  These are the minimum funds we need to make this project come to life: 

$1500- Shipping and insuring artwork.  While some artists volunteer to pay for covering costs of shipping their work, others cannot.  This will cover those artists' expenses, in order to make this a truly equitable exhibition with a diverse selection of work.
$3500- Media purchases and loans, plus installation. This show uses  traditional traditional visual media in combination with monitors, projections, audio, and interactive technologies to add up to a timely multimedia event.  Donations will be sought, but this will cover the minimum media equipment needed to pull it off.  
$2500: Speaker and performer fees, plus other event costs. Speakers’ panels and events will be open to the public, and we will seek volunteers, but this will cover those who need reimbursement for transportation or other costs; seating, security, and other event setup and clean-up.
$1500: Documentation and publication. Documenting the exhibition is a key element of the show, through photography and video archives, plus recordings of the audio and visual participation of the community.  Posters and a catalogue will be produced for sale to benefit organizations that fight for criminal justice reform.  
$1000: Educational workshops.  Although I will donate my time and will work with teachers at neighboring schools to create meaningful education workshops alongside the exhibition, we will need costs of materials and transportation to get groups from low-income schools to and from the exhibition, and to provide the necessary materials for these activities.

<li>Our Goal is to make this experience available to every church, school and patriotic event especially targeting Boy Scout and youth camps and programs.  I have experienced 12 year old boys in tears as they feel what being American means.  Last fall I presented to one group of 1200 boy scouts and numerous other groups and gatherings.  The largest groups included over 2500.  This message is a best hope we have of saving our nation, just as the best hope of saving any failing marriage is to put God back into the relationship.  We have created the art and message and need help with the printing and distribution.  Our ultimate goals  require much more than we are seeking here, but this amount gets us started and we can be self-funding in many ways after this initial investment is reached. </li>
<li>Imagine a nation united. The Declaration of Independence originally united us with the great self evident truth that all men are created equal.  We can recognize that the only true minority is the minority of one.  We respect the separate and equal station to which we all are entitled.  We can become a nation ""born again"".  We have to re-learn respect for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness of all of our universally created brothers and sisters. This is the message of Declaration of Independence and something I truly believe in.  I have invested my personal all to take this message to our nation, please help with the little needed to expand so anyone can teach or experience this life changing nation saving presentation.  </li>

Our Goal is to make this experience available to every church, school and patriotic event especially targeting Boy Scout and youth camps and programs.  I have experienced 12 year old boys in tears as they feel what being American means.  Last fall I presented to one group of 1200 boy scouts and numerous other groups and gatherings.  The largest groups included over 2500.  This message is a best hope we have of saving our nation, just as the best hope of saving any failing marriage is to put God back into the relationship.  We have created the art and message and need help with the printing and distribution.  Our ultimate goals  require much more than we are seeking here, but this amount gets us started and we can be self-funding in many ways after this initial investment is reached. 
Imagine a nation united. The Declaration of Independence originally united us with the great self evident truth that all men are created equal.  We can recognize that the only true minority is the minority of one.  We respect the separate and equal station to which we all are entitled.  We can become a nation ""born again"".  We have to re-learn respect for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness of all of our universally created brothers and sisters. This is the message of Declaration of Independence and something I truly believe in.  I have invested my personal all to take this message to our nation, please help with the little needed to expand so anyone can teach or experience this life changing nation saving presentation.

 What We Need & What You Get
 
We are need of $16,500.00 for a print run of all of the individual art pieces and for the duplication of the DVD movie and assembly of the art books.  This allows a launch to share the project and make it so many others can do what I have been successfully doing. Many people tell me  this was the most important presentation ever attended. The creative work is complete, the artwork is painted and the narrative is written.  We are so very close to being able to share this with our nation. Please help.

 Make this the best July 4th ever by doing somthing meaningful for our nation.   Be among the first in the nation to share this experience with those you love.   We are offering this experience for very little cost as our mission is to teach and inspire and you are a big part of this process.  Look over and choose one or more of the perk packages.  The change in America begins with you.  

If we do not reach our entire goal we will still deliver the perks as promised but will be limited in the speed we can deliver. I will keep at this until we raise the necessary money for as long as it takes.   

  Risks & Challenges
We have come so very far using personal resources and loans, investors, and especially the willingness of the artists to contribute their talent with the hope of receiving enumeration at some future unspecified time as their painting sell.   I will personally see that the perks are delivered, but it is possible that the delivery date may be extended.  We have not yet set up the legal work for the non-profit but that will be coming as we secure the funds.     Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>What is this project?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Katrina! My mission as an artist is to <u>promote kindness</u> and <u>activate compassion</u> in order to help create a brighter and more mindful world. My project is <strong><i>The Solution to Everything</i>.</strong> I chose this title because I believe that many of the world's problems could be solved if we were all more kind and compassionate as a society. TSTE is a multidisciplinary installation made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstract paintings that convey the essence of loving-kindness</li>
<li>paper sculptures and assemblages made from my own weathergrams (I'll explain what these are a bit later.)</li>
<li>LED lights</li>
<li>an interactive element (I'll explain this more later, too.)</li>
<li>confetti</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I said confetti! Not only is TSTE intended to make a positive impact, but it also invites people to participate in spreading kindness both by contributing to the installation and also through acts of kindness. Thus, the project is a collaboration between artist and the public. </p>
<p><strong>I am honoured to be invited to exhibit this installation at the <u><a href=""https://www.florencebiennale.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Florence Biennale</a></u></strong> in October of 2021 <i>(I</i><i><i>t</i> is possible that the biennale will be postponed to 2022 due to the pandemic)</i>. This is the biggest opportunity of my career to achieve my mission for good at such a high level. </p>

<p>TSTE is a reincarnation of my previous project <a href=""https://www.weathergramsforgood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Weathergrams for Good</i></strong></a>. This public artwork was commissioned by the City of Fredericton (New Brunswick, Canada) and installed in front of city hall. The installation was made up of two large-scale structures featuring thousands of weathergrams strung up on chains and wooden posts. The structures surrounded a garden area and some trees, allowing the weathergrams to live in harmony with nature. Loving-kindness mantras were printed on each of the thousands of weathergrams and intended to radiate kindness into the community. Visitors were invited to engage by writing their own messages of kindness on blank weathergrams, which were then added to the installation. Global News broadcast a segment on national tv about this project. You can <strong><a href=""https://globalnews.ca/news/7181326/frederictons-city-hall-made-more-colourful-by-weathergrams-for-good-art-installation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">view the short clip here.</a></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What are weathergrams?</u></strong></p>
<p>Most people don't know what weathergrams are. They were developed in the 1970's by art professor Lloyd J. Reynolds, who was inspired by a Japanese cultural tradition. Weathergrams are strips of paper that are hung outside to become weathered by the elements. They contain a poem or inspiring phrase that is meant to delight whoever comes across them.</p>
<p>As a kid, I was introduced to weathergrams by a dear family friend named Swede. He was a practitioner of the traditional weathergrams, where italic poems were written on brown paper strips. I honour these traditions, and respectfully add my own twist. My weathergrams are colourful strips of paper, many of them hand-painted. Rather than poems, I print a loving-kindness mantra on the paper that I have carefully curated from the metta mindfulness tradition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why this needs to exist</h3>
<p>It is alarmingly clear that the world is struggling with division in the midst of this devastating pandemic. Speaking personally, it has been difficult to remain hopeful during these dark times. We each need to step up and do what we can to contribute to efforts of unity and compassion. As an artist, I am fully committed to this, which is why I am creating this project. </p>
<p>This is not *just* an artwork. It is the catalyst for a tidal wave of compassion. Visitors to this installation will be enveloped in the energy of loving-kindness from viewing and interacting with all of the colourful and uplifting art. They will be invited to participate by writing their own messages of kindness on weathergrams. Not only that, but I will be giving out discrete cards that challenge the person to perform an act of kindness for a stranger. They will be encouraged to give out the card to the recipient of their kindness, and the pay-it-forward momentum will ripple outwards. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614108234/c5xljrtfuk7ijfqzugdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Getting others involved</strong></u></p>
<p>In addition to the kindness challenge cards, the mission of this project will be directly impacting many others in several ways. First, through <strong>a series of workshops for adults</strong>. The first workshop will take place at the Florence Biennale as part of the educational aspect of the event. <strong>What's even more exciting and potentially impactful is my plan to bring Weathergrams for Good to schools. </strong>The school initiative will <strong>empower entire school communities</strong> to promote kindness and activate compassion through the act of creation. </p>
<p>This project has no end it sight! It has SO MUCH potential to do good and uplift people through both the exhibition aspect and the educational aspect. Without concerted effort, our society will continue to struggle with toxic divisiveness. Please join me in contributing to the solution... the solution to EVERYTHING: spreading kindness.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>How to Get Involved</b></h3>

<h3>THE PROJECT! (A GIANT INFLATABLE WHALE THEATRE!!!)</h3>
<p>Hey it's your friendly neighborhood puppeteer Ali! I'm a puppeteer and mayhem maker coming at you from NYC with a BOLD FRESH FUN NEW project! The past year I've been working in miniature (maybe you caught <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnwWHXLaNRM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">In the Time of the Blue Ball</a> at Dixon Place) but we're are kicking it up a knotch--we're going GIANT. </p>
<p>In 1893 on the North West Coast of France a whale washed up on the shore of a local beach. The people did what naturally one should do in that situation--create a theatre in the stomach of the whale. The theatre only lasted 3 days but its memory lives on and shall live on THIS MAY AT THE WASSAIC PROJECT. </p>
<p>THAT'S RIGHT! I will be building a late 19th century theatre inside of the stomach of a giant inflatable whale this May as an artist in residence at the Wassaic Project in Wassaic New York and NEED YOUR HELP!!! </p>
<p>In the past 2 years, I have worked extensively with inflatables in public performance in collaboration with Melbourne-based Snuff Puppets, Kinshasa-based Espace Masolo and students at the University of Stuttgart like these!:</p>

<p>What I have found spectators most excited to enter an inflatable as opposed to existing outside as a spectator.</p>
<p>Baleine de Villerville (in Wassaic!) will give life to a quixotic moment and let audiences dive straight into the art they view featuring inflatables, projection and puppetry performance. The whale isn't meant to be just viewed, it will serve as a stage for the Wassaic community and beyond to let their whale song be heard. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE MATERIALS!</h3>
<p>The funds I am asking for will go towards materials. For this project I need: </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">-yards and yards and yards of ripstop fabric (the standard for building inflatables) to build the body of the whale</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">-house paint to paint said whale</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">-lumber for building the theatre</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">-a floor dryer (one of these things! <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/CFM-Pro-Carpet-Blower-Outlets/dp/B00K2BGER0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/CFM-Pro-Carpet-Blower-Outlets/dp/B00K2BGER0</a>) to inflate the theater! </p>
<p>The rest of the funds will go towards defraying residency fees. </p>
<h3>THE PERKS!</h3>
<p>In return for your support you could get zines! a custom puppet! a sleepover! And the knowledge that you've help made this whale a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>BUT FOR REAL</h3>
<p>This project is near and dear to me. Wassaic will be my first residency in my career as an artist and I'm excited for the chance to take a month to make this project a reality not only for myself but for those who will be able to make the whale a home for their own work. Wassaic as a residency has a deep commitment to their community ties and I'm excited to collaborate with the Wassaic community young and old in building a hub for ideas and performance in a unconventional setting. I only hope it stays standing longer than the three days the original whale did!</p>

<h3>The Digital Encyclopedia of Symbols</h3>
<p>Currently the only resources available for a good research about symbology are paper books, as digital designer I think that would be great to have a <strong>web resource</strong> easy to access from wherever, where to find a <strong>vector graphic symbol</strong>, read its <strong>description</strong> and look for further references.</p>
<p>Living in a ""World of screens"" we are overwhelmed of images, <strong>ancient symbols</strong> are bricks where our modern visual design bases itself. As much as we know about <strong>archetypal symbolism</strong>, as much as we can make meaningful designs and create new symbology.</p>

What began as a small project has now evolved into an enormous database of more than 650 symbols, along with details of their origins and meanings. This is a resource that, as a designer, I find hugely valuable. Now, I would love to share this research with others who might also benefit from my work. What categories are available? What styles are available?Every single symbol has 4 different versions, carefully designed for its own distinct purpose: 

 Light - for fine graphics 

 Bold - for a strong style 

 Outline - for a more complex visual 

 Colorable -  for color customization
  Why the colorable version?The colorable symbol style has been designed to be customized with user-selected color. Each individual element can be selected and modified, with either gradient or flat colors.  Search the symbol you need using tags.A useful combination of tags related to each symbol make the research easy and efficient. Tags help to get drive the search into the direction you need. 
The Digital Encyclopedia of Symbols
Currently the only resources available for a good research about symbology are paper books, as digital designer I think that would be great to have a web resource easy to access from wherever, where to find a vector graphic symbol, read its description and look for further references.
Living in a ""World of screens"" we are overwhelmed of images, ancient symbols are bricks where our modern visual design bases itself. As much as we know about archetypal symbolism, as much as we can make meaningful designs and create new symbology.
Symbolikon Digital Encyclopedia is a collection of symbols taken from historical, global civilizations, given a new life where ancient culture meets modern design. 
 

 
What can I do with these symbols?
Here are just a few suggestions for the kind of projects users may embark upon using the Symbolikon library.
 

Illustrations for Game design

Jewelery designPatterns for 3D designCreate graphic design for t-shirts.Find inspiration for music artwork.Create minimal Tarot cards using the Tarot category.​Design unique works of art.  Why I need your help?Ultimately, I believe that this is an important undertaking. As the speed of culture increases, we run the risk of losing sight of these elements of our past.Living in a digital world, constantly confronted with screens and monitors. We are overwhelmed by images. Ancient symbols are the bricks upon which our modern visual design is built. The more we know about archetypal symbolism, the more we can make meaningful designs and create new symbols.This has been a long journey, in which I have studied symbols, their origins, meanings, uses and their relationships with other symbols and events. It takes a lot of effort to discover and redesign each and every symbol.I need your help to build a website to collect and organize new categories, symbols, style variation downloads and much more. I also need your support to extend the library and continue my research, growing the database and providing further resources for creative users. How will the funds be used?  Additional Gifts for all backers unlocked! Special edition inspired by the Lovecraftian Mythos: 16 symbols inspired by the “Great Old Ones” original deities created by Lovecraft. Symbolikon Wallpapers desktop and mobile. Risks and challengesThis is not the first time I have thrown myself into a new venture and I’m fully aware of the risks and challenges involved. But then, that's what I’m about: Challenges and rising to them!As the Symbolikon library is almost entirely complete in advance of the product launch, the primary challenge at this stage will be to secure the appropriate levels of funding to build the online resource.A further challenge will be to reach out to the creative designers who will be our end users, in order to make them aware of the potential benefits of the Symbolikon library.One final challenge will be to continually update and improve upon the product after it is launched. My goal is to create an extensive modern visual library of ancient and mystic symbols, and to build a community that enjoys being involved in a wide ranging cultural project where history, symbols and culture combine with graphic design. I believe that these challenges can and will be met. All I need now is your support.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>In 2020, division was witnessed in various scenes.<br/>Our challenge is to create a common symbol of confronting division to take the first large leap towards overcoming these distances.</p>
<p>Earth Light Project is a project initiated by youth volunteers in Japan, whose hopes are to preserve, and develop further connectivity amongst one another, despite the separation we feel which is caused by physical distances we are experiencing today.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of human history, people have gathered around flames to connect and share their lives with one another. The Olympic Torch, is another example of flame connecting people beyond borders and distances.</p>
<p>Given hints from the past, Earth Light Project will launch and take a photograph of “The Earth Light,” an ephemeral flame launched to stratospheric space, an atmosphere where one can view the world as a borderless planet. </p>
<p>In Summer 2020, this project was supported by 655 people in Japan to prepare for the technological aspect of this project. The project has been endorsed by various supporters including individual “Dream Supporters” such as astronaut Ms. Naoko Yamazaki, Founder of Enhance, Resonair and Synesthesia Lab Mr. Tetsuya Mizuguchi, as well as companies and NPOs such as Panasonic, along with many others.<br/><br/>The project now needs YOUR generous support, this time to make the project a movement created by borderless effort.<br/> </p>

</h3>The reason I started this crowdfunding project is simple. I am a talented writer and author, and I am passionate about my writing, but in today's world, sometimes that's not enough. I have been funding my own art for as long as I have been in the arts, and my budgetary restraints have held the quality of my work back in the past. My goal is to raise enough money to cover the cost to have my audiobook read by a talented actor, and professionally produced. I have already found the talent and negotiated an aggressive deal with the production company, but I still can't do it all on my own. If I raise enough to cover the costs of production, I will use the remainder for marketing.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Where it goes:</p> <ul> <li>As mentioned above all of the funding raised will be used to either produce or promote the audiobook. The total cost of production will be around $800.00, of which I have to pay $400.00 up front. I am prepared to make this deposit out of my savings and will hope to replace that if, and only if, the entire goal is met. I am setting the goal at $500.00 because I can justify paying $300.00 out of my savings if absolutely necessary, but the remainder is a must have from outside sources. Exceeding the $500.00 goal is preferable.<br/>
</li> <li>For your contribution, I will be providing free audiobooks in the form of Mp3 CDs, and Audible downloads, as well as providing signed copies of the novel in hardcover and paperback. Certain backers will get the opportunity to have an honorable mention in the dedications page of the second edition of the novel (simply because the first edition will be complete and published before the funding goal date) and will be given the opportunity to meet and chat with me.<br/>
</li> <li>If for any reason I am not able to meet the mandatory $500.00 goal, what will happen? Time will pile up and I may lose the agreement I have with the talent and production company. Due to the actor wanting to read this book in particular, and my financial station, I was able to leverage the quality of my work and get the production costs down to HALF of their normal rate. For transparency, the normal rate for this company and actor is $150.00 per finished hour of audio. The book should be about 10 hours, give or take. My negotiated rate of $80.00 per finished hour is contingent upon paying the $400.00 up front on March 2nd, and the remainder upon completion, which should take no more than 60 Days (till the end of this crowdfunding campaign). SO... if I don't meet my goal, the production company will hold the final product, with the option to increase the rates for services, preventing the audiobook from seeing the light of day until I can justify the additional funds. I can tell you I am resourceful and driven, so the money will come from somewhere, and the book will be available soon, but i'd ratehr not miss a car payemtn to get it done!<br/>

I am setting the goal at $500.00 because I can justify paying $300.00 out of my savings if absolutely necessary, but the remainder is a must have from outside sources. Exceeding the $500.00 goal is preferable.
 For your contribution, I will be providing free audiobooks in the form of Mp3 CDs, and Audible downloads, as well as providing signed copies of the novel in hardcover and paperback. Certain backers will get the opportunity to have an honorable mention in the dedications page of the second edition of the novel (simply because the first edition will be complete and published before the funding goal date) and will be given the opportunity to meet and chat with me.
 If for any reason I am not able to meet the mandatory $500.00 goal, what will happen? Time will pile up and I may lose the agreement I have with the talent and production company. Due to the actor wanting to read this book in particular, and my financial station, I was able to leverage the quality of my work and get the production costs down to HALF of their normal rate. For transparency, the normal rate for this company and actor is $150.00 per finished hour of audio. The book should be about 10 hours, give or take. My negotiated rate of $80.00 per finished hour is contingent upon paying the $400.00 up front on March 2nd, and the remainder upon completion, which should take no more than 60 Days (till the end of this crowdfunding campaign). SO... if I don't meet my goal, the production company will hold the final product, with the option to increase the rates for services, preventing the audiobook from seeing the light of day until I can justify the additional funds. I can tell you I am resourceful and driven, so the money will come from somewhere, and the book will be available soon, but i'd ratehr not miss a car payemtn to get it done!

<div></div>
<p><span>The Sharonville Cultural Art Center is a 501 C(3) non-profit located in Sharonville, Ohio with mission to have offer comprehensive arts and cultural initiatives for the City of Sharonville and the surrounding region. This nearly 100 year old building was saved from the wrecking ball about 10 years ago. Over the last few years the center has struggled to keep it viable while serving the community through their arts programs. The hefty mortgage and expenses to maintain this historic building makes it challenging to turn this facility around to meet the demands of the arts community. </span></p>
<br/>In 2014, the center received a sizable donation of a high end projector from a large local company. This donation has opened the doors for the SCAC to reinvent itself and become the center for artists in the community to share their work in theater, music and fine arts. Now is the time to continue this momentum. The SCAC REBOOT PROJECT will allow the SCAC to reinvest in the center and create a theater that will be world class in audio, sound, and picture. In addition, the lighting upgrades will improve the quality of theatrical productions and remove the nearly 50 year old (and potentially dangerous lights) from the theater. Increased bookings of film and theater will help make the center viable and provide a better experience for all filmmakers, children's theater, and adult theater. Ultimately, donations to the SCAC REBOOT PROJECT will allow the facility to continue its mission: a place that foster the ARTS in Sharonville (and Tri-state area) for generations to come!</div><div>  <div></div>
<div><b>WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING</b></div>
<div>
<i>
“You can practice, practice, and practice but it’s not the same as getting in front of people and performing what you do. It’s one thing to be in your gallery and create a beautiful painting, but it’s another thing to be able to show that off to people. That’s why this venue is important, it gives local artists a place to showcase what they can do.”</i>

</div></div>","ABOUT US

The Sharonville Cultural Art Center is a 501 C(3) non-profit located in Sharonville, Ohio with mission to have offer comprehensive arts and cultural initiatives for the City of Sharonville and the surrounding region. This nearly 100 year old building was saved from the wrecking ball about 10 years ago. Over the last few years the center has struggled to keep it viable while serving the community through their arts programs. The hefty mortgage and expenses to maintain this historic building makes it challenging to turn this facility around to meet the demands of the arts community. 
In 2014, the center received a sizable donation of a high end projector from a large local company. This donation has opened the doors for the SCAC to reinvent itself and become the center for artists in the community to share their work in theater, music and fine arts. Now is the time to continue this momentum. The SCAC REBOOT PROJECT will allow the SCAC to reinvest in the center and create a theater that will be world class in audio, sound, and picture. In addition, the lighting upgrades will improve the quality of theatrical productions and remove the nearly 50 year old (and potentially dangerous lights) from the theater. Increased bookings of film and theater will help make the center viable and provide a better experience for all filmmakers, children's theater, and adult theater. Ultimately, donations to the SCAC REBOOT PROJECT will allow the facility to continue its mission: a place that foster the ARTS in Sharonville (and Tri-state area) for generations to come!  
WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING


“You can practice, practice, and practice but it’s not the same as getting in front of people and performing what you do. It’s one thing to be in your gallery and create a beautiful painting, but it’s another thing to be able to show that off to people. That’s why this venue is important, it gives local artists a place to showcase what they can do.”
- Kevin Hardman, Sharonville City Mayor 



 “I remember the SCAC growing up as a kid and really loving the place, it had childhood movies I grew up with. This place grew up being one of the catalyst of why I love cinema and film.”  - 
Michael Peake, Local Filmmaker

HOW WILL THE REBOOT BRING THE ARTS BACK TO THE COMMUNITY?

There are currently over 35 active arts organizations in the Cincinnati region, and many of them do not have a facility to express or share their work. The $40,000 needed for the center will allow it to be more of an effective arts center for these groups. 


Creative Need
We’ve had filmmakers request the facility to have a better audio system to showcase their slate of films. We’ve gotten theater groups inquire if we could have safer and secure lighting to create a better experience for their audiences. The SCAC REBOOT PROJECT will be able to achieve this. 
Community Need
In most cases, the arts community are the first budgets cut. It has been proven that the arts is an important fundamental factor in a child’s development process. The SCAC will provide a space for the youth to have artistic exposure, providing creative growth for all learners in all ages. 
Economic ImpactWith SCAC being in the heart of historic Sharonville it is our hope that we can help drive economic impact and growth. The upgrades will allow for more events and therefore bringing more people to Sharonville. The increased traffic will allow for more reasons to go to restaurants and businesses in the downtown area.

Drawing has been my passion since I was practically able to walk as a toddler. You see, I have this great big dream of becoming an illustrator. To do this, I plan on majoring in art and Japanese at the University of Iowa so that after my initial years in college, I can study abroad in Japan at one of the many illustration schools.</p><p><b>Goal:</b> My hopes for this project are to generate enough support and donations so that I can buy the tools I need to start my illustration project and to help support my art education so that I can continue learning in this field. As a job throughout college, I would like to be able to practice and further my artistic skills, but my ultimate goal in life as an artist is to write and illustrate comic books. </p><p>By advertising myself and this project in my community and online, I want to make a website called UM (like the awkward filler phrase in conversation when someone doesn't know what to say). </p><p><b>UM stands for Understand Me</b>, a website illustrating social and personal situations that are difficult to explain in words but are also very relatable. I'd like to be able to successfully represent complex ideas through art that stand for common problems or joys of the average person's life (ex. depression, simple joys, bullying, isolation, impacts from the media, emotions, etc.). I feel like discussing topics typically difficult to talk about would make the subject almost easier to understand. I decided to name it ""UM"" (Understand Me) because I have first-hand experience being someone who has difficulty expressing themselves and having ""... Um..."" come out of my mouth when all I wanted was to be understood. I think a website like this could be a form of support for many people and I'd like to make it to increase my experience and abilities as an illustrator.</p><p><b>What happens to the money?</b> This project would help me to be able to pay for a website to advertise and create UM, to buy materials I need to improve my art, and support my art education so that my ultimate goal of professional illustrator is met. Sometimes, people who don't have to come up with the tools to make something do not understand why artists spend so much on tools. The reason is because we want to provide quality in our art, so we aspire after the best tools to make the outcome we desire.

I'm a street artist from Austin, Texas that travels all over the country sharing my art, inspiring strangers, and protesting the hindering stereotypes of American culture and counter culture without having to say a word. I wear a suit and tie every day then sit quietly and draw beside an open suitcase holding my portfolio and a cardboard sign saying ""Grandma says I need a job wearing a suit and tie...this is my compromise.""</p>
<p>I've had my sign called a gimmick in the past, however I think of it as a multi faceted tool. I get to make the suit and tie business men ponder if they pawned off their passion for monetary security, I get to show artists that being a sell out isn't about the clothes you wear it's about the actions you do, and hopefully I inspire a beggar or protester, to be the change they beg for. Every time someone is curious enough to approach me on the street they are an inspiration to everyone who wouldn't dare talk to a ""street"" person. </p>
<p>Over the past three years I've traveled over 20,000 miles doing this and Chicago's been my favorite city so I plan on spending the majority of the summer there.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Ouija board came straight out of the American 19th century obsession with spiritualism. </span><br/>
</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 1891, a Pittsburgh toy and novelty shop, started advertising: “Ouija, the Wonderful Talking Board,”  which went on to describe </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a magical device that answered questions “about the past, present and future with marvelous accuracy”,  ""a link between the known and unknown, the material and immaterial.” Another advertisement declared it “Proven at Patent Office before it was allowed.”</span></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144372260X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=144372260X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=smithsonianco-20&amp;linkId=LCW2QRNMGUSLWLFP"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Little has changed in the way of design for that board, patented over 120 years ago. A flat wood grain looking board with the letters of the alphabet arrayed in two semi-circles above the numbers 0 through 9 all printed in black which makes it a basic two colour piece; the words “yes” and “no” in the uppermost corners, “goodbye” at the bottom; the planchette is a teardrop-shaped device, comes with it and is used to travel over the board and stopping at a letter or a number, when the connection with a spirit has been made.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441376824/x8gczskaaeyvmvur0dy4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Two or more people take part placing their finger tips on the planchette, pose a question, and follow the planchette as it moves from letter to letter.</span></p>
</div><p>My name is Shara Ross a career graphic designer, artist and writer.  I love design, creating and writing and am thankful that I can create art for a living.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I became fascinated with Ouija Boards when I was in my teens when my girlfriends and I used it to speak to her deceased cousin. I don’t know who we ended up speaking to but I know it was someone..... or something.... and it ended up spinning the plaquered on the board so quickly it left the board entirely! Since then I have always loved what the board represents. A possible link to that which is beyond our scope of reality, a portal through which communication is possible. I do believe in life after life and I believe you can talk to those who have passed on. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Ouija board gained a sinister reputation after the movie called 'The Exorcist' implied the character played by Linda Blair became possessed by a demon after using one. Before that, it was more of a fun game meant and played by the whole family. It became associated with evil because of movie hysteria. That doesn't mean to say you can't invite negative spirits to talk to you. But imagine all the millions of people who have used Ouija boards, and continue to do so to this day.

<p><br/></p>
</div></div>","Fulfilling a life long passion of creating an alternative look tothe traditional Ouija board.
The Ouija board came straight out of the American 19th century obsession with spiritualism. 
In 1891, a Pittsburgh toy and novelty shop, started advertising: “Ouija, the Wonderful Talking Board,”  which went on to describe a magical device that answered questions “about the past, present and future with marvelous accuracy”,  ""a link between the known and unknown, the material and immaterial.” Another advertisement declared it “Proven at Patent Office before it was allowed.”
Little has changed in the way of design for that board, patented over 120 years ago. A flat wood grain looking board with the letters of the alphabet arrayed in two semi-circles above the numbers 0 through 9 all printed in black which makes it a basic two colour piece; the words “yes” and “no” in the uppermost corners, “goodbye” at the bottom; the planchette is a teardrop-shaped device, comes with it and is used to travel over the board and stopping at a letter or a number, when the connection with a spirit has been made.



Two or more people take part placing their finger tips on the planchette, pose a question, and follow the planchette as it moves from letter to letter.
My name is Shara Ross a career graphic designer, artist and writer.  I love design, creating and writing and am thankful that I can create art for a living.  I became fascinated with Ouija Boards when I was in my teens when my girlfriends and I used it to speak to her deceased cousin. I don’t know who we ended up speaking to but I know it was someone..... or something.... and it ended up spinning the plaquered on the board so quickly it left the board entirely! Since then I have always loved what the board represents. A possible link to that which is beyond our scope of reality, a portal through which communication is possible. I do believe in life after life and I believe you can talk to those who have passed on. The Ouija board gained a sinister reputation after the movie called 'The Exorcist' implied the character played by Linda Blair became possessed by a demon after using one. Before that, it was more of a fun game meant and played by the whole family. It became associated with evil because of movie hysteria. That doesn't mean to say you can't invite negative spirits to talk to you. But imagine all the millions of people who have used Ouija boards, and continue to do so to this day. If it was a means for spirits to possess you, we'd have a lot of demonic like people wandering the earth. Just saying. :)I felt inspired to create new boards. I always thought it would end up being a Tarot deck I would do first, a long standing passion of mine as well, but what started out as a pet project grew into the three boards shown here.... as I've always thought that the Ouija board deserved more than the very generic design it has displayed almost since it's inception.I’ve created a series of Soul Gate Boards. The first three designs
        are the feature boards in this campaign and as of yet the only designs thus far. If there is interest, I will continue to do more.
The first design is titled PORTAL. 
It signifies a gateway or a
        ‘portal’ to connect the user with the other side. It’s the most
        traditional of the three, more in line with the traditional
        Ouija Boards. 





        The second board is called CAROUSEL.
        Sometimes life can feel like it is a continuous ride of ‘ups and
        downs’. As if you’re on perpetual carousel. We all want to get a
        glimpse of where the next ‘up’ is going to lead us, or when the
        next ‘down’ is coming. We consult the board for a little helpful
        insights, or to say hi to a loved one, or even just for the
        thrill.








The third board is named SYMBOLS. 
It features the drawing of The Vitruvian Man by Leonardo Da Vinci, positioned on
        a pentagram. Man’s position inside the metaphysical. How
        appropriate I thought, for a Ouija Board. There is the “Les
        reines de France” by A.Celliez ed. Lehuby in 1851 France which
        represents the female aspect of humanity, and a symbol of
        ‘building your life’ with the architectural drawing on the left.
        The medallion underneath symbolizing the perfection of geometry,
        in an ancient, perfectly proportioned drawn vine.

<p><b>SHORT SUMMARY</b></p>
<p><b>My name is Victor. I
am a digital nomad. Digital nomads are people who are able to work online while traveling (more information can be found
on the bottom of this page). It's a dream come true. I now earn money for my
trips through photography. However, my camera was broken as it has exceeded its
shutter limit preset by the manufacturer. Therefore, I can no longer create the
photographs that make my travels possible. I have enough income to provide me
with food, accommodation, and transportation, but not enough to buy new
equipment. This is why I'd like to offer prints of my artwork in exchange for
your kind contribution. More details about these perks can be found on the
right of this page.</b></p><b>
</b><p><b>All these artworks, which are featured in the
gallery section of this campaign, are the result of more than two years of
experimentation with the double exposure technique. This technique was invented
during the era of film photography. The first images of this kind were created
in-camera by exposing film twice without changing the frame. </b><br/>
<br/>
<b>I believe in everyone’s unique and natural beauty and I hope to show this
through my photographs to the public. Thank you for your support. It is only
with your help that I'll be able to get back on my creative path.  <br/></b></p>

</p><p><b>What I Need &amp; What You
Get</b></p>
<p>With great pleasure
I would like to share the results of my work, which I hope would let me buy a
new camera. The artworks  that I offer
you are gallery quality Giclée prints
on natural white, matte, ultra smooth, 100% cotton rag, acid and lignin free
archival paper using Epson K3 archival inks and custom trimmed with
1""-2"" border for framing. As you already know, the technique of double exposure was
initially created with film cameras. These days, digital equipment allows users
to have more control over the process, but I still value the natural feel in
photographs, that can be achieved by minimizing digital manipulations. In these
prints, post-production only consisted of combining two images, brightness,
contrast and color corrections. In other words, no tools were used that
wouldn’t be possible in a dark room. I hope that these prints will add an
artistic flair to your interior.</p>
<p>The goal of this
project is set to <b>6000 USD</b>. The breakdown of the cost is as follows:</p>
<p><b>3000 USD</b> – price of
the camera</p>
<p><b>1500 USD</b> –
production of prints</p>
<p><b>900 USD </b>– shipping
costs</p>
<p><b>300 USD</b> – Indiegogo
fees</p>
<p><b>300 USD</b> –
transaction fees<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441905067/anf75bglhz4lha3s6uaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><p>My choice of camera
is the Sony A7II and Sony FE 55mm F1.8 lens. These equipment have the power of
professional functionality in a more compact size. Small dimensions of
this camera are crucial for travel photographers because it is easier to carry
and it doesn't attract much attention. It may look like a camera for
beginners, but it is truly a powerful and professional tool.</p>
<p>If I'm not able to
reach the target amount, the funds raised will be saved until I find a way to
collect the rest of the money to purchase the desired equipment.</p>
<p>If I'll collect more than the target amount, all extra funds will
go to purchase additional
pieces of equipment. First tool in the list is smartphone with good camera for
mobile photography. </p>

</p><p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>After first
experimenting with the double exposure technique, I realized that it is also a
great tool to show the world the natural beauty of people without applying
excessive retouching and manipulations, which highlight the unachievable
standards of beauty that is widely used by the commercial world to
attract potential customers' attention.</p>
<p>For the past 6
years I've been <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/g/tondee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">involved</a><a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/g/tondee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> with stock image banks that shaped the
visual communication of our time. My artwork is seen by hundreds of thousands
of people and could influence people's perceptions. This made me more selective
with what I create because images from these banks are seen everywhere such as
in shops, billboards, magazines, TV, the Internet, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>The double exposure
technique is one of the <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/blog/dramatic-double-exposures-that-blend-portraiture-and-nature-photography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">upcoming trends </a>these days and I feel that with your support,
more wonderful discoveries are still to come.</p>

<p><b>DIGITAL NOMADISM<br/></b></p>
<p>We hear the term “digital nomadism”
more frequently in this day and age.<span>  Digital
nomads are people who are able to work online while traveling. This is an
emerging culture and gaining more interest as tools and technologies such as
crowdfunding continue to evolve. That is bringing exciting changes to our
society. A professional can now have his or her entire office in one backpack.
Tools are more and more compact and Internet technologies are advancing each
year. This offers independence to many people who now are able to design their
own lifestyles.</span></p>
<p>Being digital nomad definitely opens
many doors. It offers freedom and allows for experimentation and control of all
aspects of our lives including food, medicine, business and housing. Many
people are used to their lifestyles and routines. However cultures of the world
are very diverse and traveling provides an opportunity to exchange knowledge
and share your culture. Travelers experiment with alternative lifestyles and are
willing to share their discoveries, which benefit people from all over the
world. I’m excited to find points where different cultures meet. We accomplish
and learn from each other. We are one.</p>
<p>I’ve sacrificed almost everything in pursuit of my dream to travel. In

SHORT SUMMARY
My name is Victor. I
am a digital nomad. Digital nomads are people who are able to work online while traveling (more information can be found
on the bottom of this page). It's a dream come true. I now earn money for my
trips through photography. However, my camera was broken as it has exceeded its
shutter limit preset by the manufacturer. Therefore, I can no longer create the
photographs that make my travels possible. I have enough income to provide me
with food, accommodation, and transportation, but not enough to buy new
equipment. This is why I'd like to offer prints of my artwork in exchange for
your kind contribution. More details about these perks can be found on the
right of this page.
All these artworks, which are featured in the
gallery section of this campaign, are the result of more than two years of
experimentation with the double exposure technique. This technique was invented
during the era of film photography. The first images of this kind were created
in-camera by exposing film twice without changing the frame. 

I believe in everyone’s unique and natural beauty and I hope to show this
through my photographs to the public. Thank you for your support. It is only
with your help that I'll be able to get back on my creative path.  

What I Need & What You
Get
With great pleasure
I would like to share the results of my work, which I hope would let me buy a
new camera. The artworks  that I offer
you are gallery quality Giclée prints
on natural white, matte, ultra smooth, 100% cotton rag, acid and lignin free
archival paper using Epson K3 archival inks and custom trimmed with
1""-2"" border for framing. As you already know, the technique of double exposure was
initially created with film cameras. These days, digital equipment allows users
to have more control over the process, but I still value the natural feel in
photographs, that can be achieved by minimizing digital manipulations. In these
prints, post-production only consisted of combining two images, brightness,
contrast and color corrections. In other words, no tools were used that
wouldn’t be possible in a dark room. I hope that these prints will add an
artistic flair to your interior.
The goal of this
project is set to 6000 USD. The breakdown of the cost is as follows:
3000 USD – price of
the camera
1500 USD –
production of prints
900 USD – shipping
costs
300 USD – Indiegogo
fees
300 USD –
transaction fees
My choice of camera
is the Sony A7II and Sony FE 55mm F1.8 lens. These equipment have the power of
professional functionality in a more compact size. Small dimensions of
this camera are crucial for travel photographers because it is easier to carry
and it doesn't attract much attention. It may look like a camera for
beginners, but it is truly a powerful and professional tool.
If I'm not able to
reach the target amount, the funds raised will be saved until I find a way to
collect the rest of the money to purchase the desired equipment.
If I'll collect more than the target amount, all extra funds will
go to purchase additional
pieces of equipment. First tool in the list is smartphone with good camera for
mobile photography. 
     
THE IMPACT
After first
experimenting with the double exposure technique, I realized that it is also a
great tool to show the world the natural beauty of people without applying
excessive retouching and manipulations, which highlight the unachievable
standards of beauty that is widely used by the commercial world to
attract potential customers' attention.
For the past 6
years I've been involved with stock image banks that shaped the
visual communication of our time. My artwork is seen by hundreds of thousands
of people and could influence people's perceptions. This made me more selective
with what I create because images from these banks are seen everywhere such as
in shops, billboards, magazines, TV, the Internet, and the list goes on.
The double exposure
technique is one of the upcoming trends these days and I feel that with your support,
more wonderful discoveries are still to come.

HOW TO CHOOSE
THE PRINT
I offer you a
selection of 16 different prints. They can be found in the gallery of this
campaign. All images are numbered. At the end of the
campaign I will send you a message to ask which piece you would like. You can
order more than one print as well by choosing multiple perks.
If you've chosen
«digital image» perk, then I will ask your e-mail address where it
can be sent.

DIGITAL NOMADISM
We hear the term “digital nomadism”
more frequently in this day and age.  Digital
nomads are people who are able to work online while traveling. This is an
emerging culture and gaining more interest as tools and technologies such as
crowdfunding continue to evolve. That is bringing exciting changes to our
society. A professional can now have his or her entire office in one backpack.
Tools are more and more compact and Internet technologies are advancing each
year. This offers independence to many people who now are able to design their
own lifestyles.
Being digital nomad definitely opens
many doors. It offers freedom and allows for experimentation and control of all
aspects of our lives including food, medicine, business and housing. Many
people are used to their lifestyles and routines. However cultures of the world
are very diverse and traveling provides an opportunity to exchange knowledge
and share your culture. Travelers experiment with alternative lifestyles and are
willing to share their discoveries, which benefit people from all over the
world. I’m excited to find points where different cultures meet. We accomplish
and learn from each other. We are one.
I’ve sacrificed almost everything in pursuit of my dream to travel. In
my backpack you’ll find a few days worth of clothes, documents, and most of space
is packed with equipment. Luckily nowadays laptop, smartphone and camera are
enough. So I’m inviting you to help me fill the empty space that occurred due
to my camera breakage.

<div>Hey dearest ones. Well, for now I am in this place in the forest, initially for reasons tied to the flaming political and social situation in Mexico.

In this moment through this music I will share my respect,  my multiple hopes, my song from the heart. I offer this music in favor of recognizing ourselves as powerful communities. May it assist in us seeing that we are already INDEED co-creating and weaving our communities. Let us celebrate. Let us recognize, reconnect. Let us Remember to Remember.

<p><b>Dyslexia:
It’s about celebrating difference and diversity</b></p>
<p><b>Dyslexic
Pathways CIC was set up to break down the barriers to success in education, employment
and in everyday life faced by dyslexics everywhere. </b></p>
<p><b>Our
message is dyslexia represents the diversity inherent in humanity and we want
to define dyslexia by what we can do and do well. The idea behind this crowd
funding is to enable the 6 million dyslexics in the UK, the 66
million dyslexics in the USA and the nearly one billion dyslexics across the
world to self advocate for a better deal for dyslexics everywhere, to
start developing a coherent community and social movement as well
as to raise awareness of a more positive profile of dyslexia.</b></p>
<p><b>Our Unique
Dyslexic crowd funding campaign is seeking to raise funds to enable dyslexics
across the world to advocate for a more positive profile of dyslexia for themselves.
This is going to be done by printing and selling tee shirts with positive
message logos about dyslexia that we have designed. The funds from this crowd funding
will be used to do this to sell more tee shirts and to enable us to work
towards Dyslexic Pathways CIC other goals. </b></p>
<p><b>Designs
used will be selected by our social media followers. We will also be running a
little competition for children under 16 years old. This will be to design a
dyslexia logo for a tee shirt one that has a positive message. The winner will
be selected by our social media followers.</b></p>
<p>Personally
I have a very positive attitude towards my own dyslexia. This was not always so
though. I know from my own personal experience and from other dyslexics I talk
to that dyslexia can be a real pain. Our experiences of being dyslexic can
impact our self esteem and confidence and can leave us feeling like failures. I
do not see dyslexia as a disability but as a difference that represents the
diversity inherent within humanity. It is society that disables us and this
disabling begins in school where we are not taught be teachers who are trained
to work with us in an inclusive learning environment. </p>
<p>But we
can succeed I think we have to remember the world be poorer place were not for
the creative talents of dyslexic, visionaries, entrepreneurs, architects,
artists, inventers or writers etc? </p>
<p>I founded
Dyslexic Pathways Community Interest Company in 2009 it is a social
enterprise. The main objective is to support and enable people with dyslexia to
unlock their potential. Dyslexia Pathways CIC was the first dyslexia
focussed social enterprise to be constituted in the world.  We have supported
over 400 dyslexic students at universities here in Scotland supporting them on
their degree and post graduate degree courses. We also work with individuals
and organisations as well as on a couple of groups at the Scottish Parliament.</p>
<p>In 2014
we ran our Unique Dyslexic Get Creative campaign which was all about promoting
and celebrating dyslexic creativity and raising awareness of the social model
of dyslexia. It was about getting dyslexics together, having fun creatively, and
sharing their stories of being dyslexic and rebuilding self esteem and self
confidence.<span>  We reached out dyslexics
locally here in Fife and central Scotland but throughout the world. 50 people
attended of five free creative workshops on visual art, music creating fused

dyslexics across the would follow our social media</span></p>
<p>Most recently
Dyslexic Pathways CIC held the “Unique Dyslexic: Get Creative – Celebration of
Creativity”. Here we exhibited the work done by participants at the
workshop and artwork from creative dyslexics from across the world. Dyslexic
entertainers such as dyslexic poet Anita Govan provided our audience with
brilliant entertainment. The feedback provided for the Unique Dyslexic
programme and the Festival of Creativity was extremely positive. Over 60 people
attended the event and 15 volunteers helped us to make it a success.</p>
<p>This is
part of a larger fundraising effort to diversify and grow as an organisation.
Dyslexia Pathways CIC is planning to open a new dyslexia centre to support

that we have developed an exclusive production process that allows
us to make signed fine art prints to order. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1274082/files/20150306113544-Indiegogo_2.jpg?1425670544"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Your Input Welcome.</strong> </p><p>I've  developed the wide variety of
styles of images and collections we currently offer. Over the next 3 months the “Work” section of our site will  be greatly expanded from the current
approx. 225 images to 500 by listening carefully to all
of you around the world and the images you select for your Perk. I believe a key success factor to business is listening to your clients and I embrace  the challenge of expanding my “repertoire”
 and growing Artistically with input from those who love my work enough to
invest in it. </p>

<p>In my view, the
Fine Art Print/Gallery business really does not have an equivalent nationally
known brand in North America at this time – except perhaps in lower end “decorative
art” sources we really don’t compete with. My point is F.A.B is structured and
designed from launch to become the highest growth online and retail Art business
of it’s type. A  key part of that strategy is using a proven luxury branded
business model which I created with my advisors based on 20+ years of
experience with my family run luxury retail business that reached $900 Million in
revenues worldwide and had 60+ luxury stores operating in the most expensive retail
locations in the US and Canada.  </p>

<b>
</b><p></p>
<p><strong>It’s about the Art.</strong></p>
<p>My reality based art creates a truly different Art selection process for the collectors who like my work and want original signed art on their walls. It allows you to choose the image you love, sized it to fit the  space you have in mind and then print it on the material or frame it exactly as you like (just like professional Decorators do).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290276/files/20150312114026-Indiegogo_Birdhouse.jpg?1426185626"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>One of the things that fascinates me spiritually and creatively when I create my reality based art is the “transformation” stage which can result in  radical changes to the original image or very subtle textures and new details  that can only be seen when you get close to the print. My images reproduce with high definition detail  and rich, bold color whether they are 10 inches wide or 10 feet wide. For example in my image Empire State View I - shown below- in larger sizes you
can count the people walking on the sidewalk and see brake lights on the
taxis!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1274262/files/20150306123107-Indiegogo_4.jpg?1425673867"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Viewing Art online kinda
sucks.</b></p>
<p>It may not be obvious but I think it is important to point out that though
viewing my Art online is the best way to select the image you want the
limitations of today’s Internet/display technology is 72 PPI (pixels
per inch) so online images <i>kind of suck</i>
in comparison to the Fine Art Prints we offer which are printed at 400 DPI
(dots per inch).  </p>
<div>
</div><p>Shopping for F.A.B Fine Art online is a  cool experience and FUN -  it allows you to relax in your comfy spot, see a lot of images in a
short period of time, compare images and truly appreciate the composition and
statement that each image represents. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1274267/files/20150306123330-Indiegogo_Artichokes.jpg?1425674010"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Use of Funds. Target $100,000 in the 30 day Indiegogo Campaign.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Printing and Computer Equipment - $ 8,200</b></p>
<p>To increase the number of Fine Art Printers we
use, buy print supplies at lower cost in volume and add the PC’s and Back Up
Systems we need to increase our ability print/deliver faster and ensure we have
excellent back up capabilities.</p>
<p><b>Fine Art Print Inventory - $9,500</b></p>
<p>Majority of this cost will be invested in the
actual Fine Art Prints we display in our Showroom which will also be used to
help retail Partners and to do promotional events.</p>
<p><b>E-Commerce Web Site - $2,500</b> <b>Upgrades.</b></p>
<p>The current web site was designed to be
upgraded to offer full e-commerce functions for both fine art print orders and
gift certificate programs when we wanted to transition it. </p>
<p><b>SEO Services - $18,000</b></p>
<p>To establish both the web site and each of the
prints we offer in our target markets in both the US and Canada with a focus in
our target retail city markets is a lot of work over a 12 month period so we
have a budget of $1500 a month.</p>
<p><b>Social Media Services - $18,000</b></p>
<p>Establishing the brand and myself on Social
Media will also take a lot of effort – forever! In our first year I have
budgeted $1,500 a month to pay for these programs though in this case about
half of that will be used in the first 3 months.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Email Campaigns - $12,000</b>.</p>
<p>We plan to aggressively market by email to
“Trade” (professional decorators and interior designers, etc.,) by area and the
most cost effective way to do that is by acquiring email lists we can market
to. </p>
<p><b>Promotion/Public Relations - $6,800</b></p>
<p>We plan to put out weekly press releases on
the success we realize through the 1<sup>st</sup> year Marketing Plan for our
brand and our partners – this amount represents the additional costs we need to
cover over and above the budget we have now.<span> 
</span></p>
<p><b>*Facilities - $24,500 </b></p>
<p>We plan to move our current production only
operations into a larger leased space that will include a Showroom/Art Gallery
for our product line and this cost includes the additional lease cost,
furniture, decorations, etc., needed. Please note we will not invest in this
option until the marketing we need is done and only if we achieve 100% of our
goal as our priority is growth related marketing.</p>
<p>Please note: These amounts represent net new
marketing and resources we need to grow at a faster pace than our current
budget and resources allow. We have the costs of the team, existing facilities,
supplies, equipment, etc., covered with our existing finances and resources but
we do also plan to attract individual equity investors in 2015 and when we do
so will use those funds to double+ the amounts we spend on marketing for growth
over and above funds raised through Indiegogo. </p>

It’s about the Art.
My reality based art creates a truly different Art selection process for the collectors who like my work and want original signed art on their walls. It allows you to choose the image you love, sized it to fit the  space you have in mind and then print it on the material or frame it exactly as you like (just like professional Decorators do).One of the things that fascinates me spiritually and creatively when I create my reality based art is the “transformation” stage which can result in  radical changes to the original image or very subtle textures and new details  that can only be seen when you get close to the print.

can count the people walking on the sidewalk and see brake lights on the
taxis!

It may not be obvious but I think it is important to point out that though
viewing my Art online is the best way to select the image you want the
limitations of today’s Internet/display technology is 72 PPI (pixels

Dream Photography Packages.
An interesting and unique photographic service we offer  is
something we call “Dream Photography Packages”. A simple concept - you dream it and together we
make it reality – the results of a Dream Photography Package are
usually beautiful One-of-a-Kind large scale Mark Nicholas Burack Fine Art
Prints that make a very cool personal statement you can share and
enjoy forever in your home, cottage or office. These packages
are also an amazing gift idea, especially for the person who has everything or
as a special treat for yourself (you deserve it). Please note: We offer a great
deal on a Dream Photography Package as a Perk here – check it out.
Fabulous F.A.B. Gift Certificates Perks.
This BUY ONE GET TWO FREE F.A.B. Gift Certificate offer is exclusively available here through our Indiegogo Campaign.


Doing Good Stuff - Fine Art for Fundraising and Profit Programs.
In my view, leveraging art to promote your brand or organization can be a stroke of genius for many organizations. Iconic and beautiful Fine Art Prints are a thoughtful and artistic way to promote your School, Sports Team, League, Municipality, Tourist Area, Religious Organization or Hotel and they lend themselves to creating great Art  exhibit events that can help other programs you already have.My Vision. I love creating these images in partnership with those leading
Organizations who want to stand out from the herd. I think it is an excellent way to give back to the world by
using my art to generate fundraising and profitable revenues for institutions that give so much to so many.
Use of Funds. Target $100,000 in the 30 day Indiegogo Campaign.

Printing and Computer Equipment - $ 8,200
To increase the number of Fine Art Printers we
use, buy print supplies at lower cost in volume and add the PC’s and Back Up
Systems we need to increase our ability print/deliver faster and ensure we have
excellent back up capabilities.
Fine Art Print Inventory - $9,500
Majority of this cost will be invested in the
actual Fine Art Prints we display in our Showroom which will also be used to
help retail Partners and to do promotional events.
E-Commerce Web Site - $2,500 Upgrades.
The current web site was designed to be
upgraded to offer full e-commerce functions for both fine art print orders and
gift certificate programs when we wanted to transition it. 
SEO Services - $18,000
To establish both the web site and each of the
prints we offer in our target markets in both the US and Canada with a focus in
our target retail city markets is a lot of work over a 12 month period so we
have a budget of $1500 a month.
Social Media Services - $18,000
Establishing the brand and myself on Social
Media will also take a lot of effort – forever! In our first year I have
budgeted $1,500 a month to pay for these programs though in this case about
half of that will be used in the first 3 months.  
Email Campaigns - $12,000.
We plan to aggressively market by email to
“Trade” (professional decorators and interior designers, etc.,) by area and the
most cost effective way to do that is by acquiring email lists we can market
to. 
Promotion/Public Relations - $6,800
We plan to put out weekly press releases on
the success we realize through the 1st year Marketing Plan for our
brand and our partners – this amount represents the additional costs we need to
cover over and above the budget we have now. 

*Facilities - $24,500 
We plan to move our current production only
operations into a larger leased space that will include a Showroom/Art Gallery
for our product line and this cost includes the additional lease cost,
furniture, decorations, etc., needed. Please note we will not invest in this
option until the marketing we need is done and only if we achieve 100% of our
goal as our priority is growth related marketing.
Please note: These amounts represent net new
marketing and resources we need to grow at a faster pace than our current
budget and resources allow. We have the costs of the team, existing facilities,
supplies, equipment, etc., covered with our existing finances and resources but
we do also plan to attract individual equity investors in 2015 and when we do
so will use those funds to double+ the amounts we spend on marketing for growth
over and above funds raised through Indiegogo.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Through the success of these small projects, what was originally a bespoke service has now grown into a small collective of local artists in a similar position to us, with our <a href=""http://www.thefifthwall.co.uk/shop/index.php/artists/all-artwork.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collection</a> of available works slowly expanding as our contacts grow.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Michelle Pier, and I am a full-time artist born and raised on Guam. The creative arts in general is my passion, and it is my goal to inspire people to reconnect with their own creativity, here on Guam and abroad. Along with original paintings and workshops, I also coordinate many community events, festivals and craft fairs to contribute to the local creative arts industry and to help local entrepreneurs grow and flourish. I've been painting under my business name Creative Indeed for 6 years now, and all this time, my work was created either on the kitchen table (back when I  was a single mom on welfare, homeschooling my two little boys), or now on my easel on the floor in the bedroom I share with my boys at my parents' house in a rural area of southern Guam. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>I am proud to say that my career as a full-time artist here on Guam is steadily growing, and I am now ready to move into an actual art studio! Last year, I was awarded the 2015 Home-Based Business Champion of the Year by the Guam SBA. I'm hoping that I won't qualify for the home-based category this year! ;) </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>At the start of the new year, I painted a Divine Mother piece for myself, as my own sort of ""guide"" to keep on my wall, to inspire me to live with love, peace and joy, and to remind me that I am on the right path. I put my heart and soul into this painting, and of course, shared it, with the note that it is not for sale. I had more messages about purchasing this painting than any other piece EVER. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452124983/c8dkdc1ydkvyt2pcn8in.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>SO, I decided that I would offer a series of Divine Mother paintings, and these would be available for purchase, contributing toward the capital needed to open my own art studio. Your original painting will be unique to your preferences (more about the art below).</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why this is so important:</h3>
<p>Opening the Creative Indeed art studio will mean that I can paint MORE, and paint bigger pieces. I LOVE painting large canvases! The energy just magnifies itself, and I feel more freedom to move. I will be able to hold classes, workshops, and mini exhibits in my own space instead of having to accommodate at other establishments. I can keep all my supplies organized in one space, instead of having to transport things back and forth. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On a more personal note, it means my boys can open their drawers and closet doors without me having to shift around big canvases blocking the way. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This will also mean that I can help more people. I can have people come visit me in person, and I can offer my art and creative services to a wider audience. This expansion will ripple out to more people than even I can imagine. </span></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>***Side note about my connection with this painting:</b> My birthday is 12/12/84 at 12:12pm. Needless to say, I have a connection with the #12 by birth. The #12 is also very much connected to divine mother energy. I am not very religious, but I do have a strong connection with my own spirituality, and highly resonate with this energy. The divine mother energy goes by many names, probably most familiar are: Mary, Virigin Mary, Virgin Mother, Our Lady of Peace, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Divine Mercy, Queen of Peace, Black Madonna, Quan Yin, Divine Feminine, Queen of Roses, Our Lady of Lourdes, Blessed Mother, Holy Trinity, Goddess, Mother Nature, etc. This first painting was my own personal version, my image that came through on the canvas. I feel there are many more waiting to be painted. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>My Goal &amp; What You Get for Contributing</h3>
<div>The space that I am hoping to lease, is in Hagatña, here on Guam. My goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the first 6 months of expenses (including $1200/mo for rent &amp; utilities, $2800 for initial updates to the space such as painting the walls, installing fixtures and furniture, and buying some basic supplies). I am hoping to avoid having to take out a small business loan to cover the rest of the expansion (marketing, promotions, payroll, and the rest of the year's rent), though it may be necessary. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The space (my boys checking it out):</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452125289/ifznhqxctsv5h9oxdwxm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In return for your contribution, I am offering up unique perks at varying levels in the form of my divine mother art on postcards, greeting cards, prints, AND original paintings on canvas. </div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Perks:</h3>
<p>$10- a handwritten thank you on a postcard with the original Divine Mother print shown.</p>
<div>$25- a handwritten thank you on a greeting card with the original Divine Mother print shown, plus one blank one.<p></p>
<p>$60- a 6""x8"" signed &amp; matted print of the original Divine Mother art shown + a handwritten thank you postcard.</p>
<p>$120- an 8""x10"" signed AND FRAMED print of the original Divine Mother art shown + a handwritten thank you greeting card.</p>
<p>$190- an 11""x14"" ORIGINAL Divine Mother intuitive acrylic painting (you will be contacted after your contribution for your unique image preferences, as it doesn't have to be the same or even similar to the original Divine Mother image shown) on stretched canvas + a handwritten thank you greeting card.</p>
<p>$360- a 16""x20"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$490- an 18""x24"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$640- a 24""x24"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$760- a 24""x30"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$980- a 30""x30"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$1300- a 30""x40"" (same description as above perk)</p>
<p>$3800- a 48""x72"" (same description as above perk)</p>
</div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>The original paintings on canvas will be done on an intuitive level. I will contact you after you make your contribution (at the end of the campaign), and find out if you'd like to stick with abstract style of my 1st original Divine Mother painting, or if you'd like a little more traditional look interwoven (like specifically Mary, or include roses, or the black crescent that the original Lady of Guadalupe image stands upon, or if you have certain colors in mind for your piece). </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Or you can even commission a totally different image.</b> Paintings will be completed in order of contribution, all to be completed within this year. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE ON GUAM:</b> Shipping fee is added onto the price automatically. If you will be picking up your artwork locally, I will refund the shipping fee. Thank you for understanding. </div>
<div>If I don't meet the goal of $10,000, any funds raised will still go towards initial rent for leasing the space, it just means I may have to take out a small business loan in addition to funds raised. Of course, all perks will still be fulfilled. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>More about the art</h3> <p>While going for a print may be more budget-friendly (and totally a great start if it's all you can swing right now), there is just no replacement for the texture and energy that comes with an original canvas painting. I started painting abstract pieces on an intuitive level for friends, simply by tuning into their energy and painting whatever I felt for them. It took off and that's what got my art career going in a way I never expected. </p>
<p>Now, when I do commission paintings, there is still the intuitive element, where I have a basic idea to work with, but I ask that you trust me and where the creative process goes. I have also done commission pieces based on photos (but in my style of course), and it has been so cool to experience my own evolution in my art style and the results of the finished pieces.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452125485/mcugzuls1zp314om403w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Every year, I raise my prices. This is so that I can keep raising the value on my end (buying higher quality supplies, and offering higher quality services and products), and also so that you know your investment is one that will increase in value over the years. Those who bought my paintings years ago could potentially turn around and sell them now for more than twice the amount they purchased them for. I want people to invest in an artwork that speaks to them with emotion and meaning, and know that they are making a potentially long-term investment in themselves, through my artwork. It helps me create more and sustain my livelihood for myself and my children, and it helps you to have a piece that holds a story and value beyond the purchase price. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I am making the big step to commit to a commercial space. In any business, this is a big risk, and usually a necessary one. As an artist, this means I am asking myself to step up to the next level, to build more consistency and stability through solid systems in my business. I have been building this foundation for about 10 years now, before I even had a business license. I have been developing business systems that work for me and my artist lifestyle. Now it is time to bring this foundation into a physical commercial space.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge will be balancing the transition from working at home to working in a commercial studio space. I believe I can do it, because I've been through many major transitions in the last 10 years, and while each step was scary, I put my all into it, and have pulled it off every time. I have more support than ever now, and my network has grown to a level I never imagined it would. I am involved in several business programs and trainings that hold me accountable to my business goals, values, and services. I am more excited than anything to take on this challenge.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>You might not be able to make a monetary contribution or invest in an original painting at this time. That is totally okay, I completely understand, as I have been there. What you CAN do is share this campaign, through email, on any social media platforms that you are on, or even through word of mouth. </p>
<p>Use the share button and help spread the word. You'd be surprised how much this simple act can make a difference! THANK YOU! </p>

The space (my boys checking it out):


In return for your contribution, I am offering up unique perks at varying levels in the form of my divine mother art on postcards, greeting cards, prints, AND original paintings on canvas. 


The Perks:
$10- a handwritten thank you on a postcard with the original Divine Mother print shown.
$25- a handwritten thank you on a greeting card with the original Divine Mother print shown, plus one blank one.
$60- a 6""x8"" signed & matted print of the original Divine Mother art shown + a handwritten thank you postcard.
$120- an 8""x10"" signed AND FRAMED print of the original Divine Mother art shown + a handwritten thank you greeting card.
$190- an 11""x14"" ORIGINAL Divine Mother intuitive acrylic painting (you will be contacted after your contribution for your unique image preferences, as it doesn't have to be the same or even similar to the original Divine Mother image shown) on stretched canvas + a handwritten thank you greeting card.
$360- a 16""x20"" (same description as above perk)
$490- an 18""x24"" (same description as above perk)
$640- a 24""x24"" (same description as above perk)
$760- a 24""x30"" (same description as above perk)
$980- a 30""x30"" (same description as above perk)
$1300- a 30""x40"" (same description as above perk)
$3800- a 48""x72"" (same description as above perk)



The original paintings on canvas will be done on an intuitive level. I will contact you after you make your contribution (at the end of the campaign), and find out if you'd like to stick with abstract style of my 1st original Divine Mother painting, or if you'd like a little more traditional look interwoven (like specifically Mary, or include roses, or the black crescent that the original Lady of Guadalupe image stands upon, or if you have certain colors in mind for your piece). 


Or you can even commission a totally different image. Paintings will be completed in order of contribution, all to be completed within this year. 


IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE ON GUAM: Shipping fee is added onto the price automatically. If you will be picking up your artwork locally, I will refund the shipping fee. Thank you for understanding. 
If I don't meet the goal of $10,000, any funds raised will still go towards initial rent for leasing the space, it just means I may have to take out a small business loan in addition to funds raised. Of course, all perks will still be fulfilled. 

    More about the art While going for a print may be more budget-friendly (and totally a great start if it's all you can swing right now), there is just no replacement for the texture and energy that comes with an original canvas painting. I started painting abstract pieces on an intuitive level for friends, simply by tuning into their energy and painting whatever I felt for them. It took off and that's what got my art career going in a way I never expected. 
Now, when I do commission paintings, there is still the intuitive element, where I have a basic idea to work with, but I ask that you trust me and where the creative process goes. I have also done commission pieces based on photos (but in my style of course), and it has been so cool to experience my own evolution in my art style and the results of the finished pieces.


Every year, I raise my prices. This is so that I can keep raising the value on my end (buying higher quality supplies, and offering higher quality services and products), and also so that you know your investment is one that will increase in value over the years. Those who bought my paintings years ago could potentially turn around and sell them now for more than twice the amount they purchased them for. I want people to invest in an artwork that speaks to them with emotion and meaning, and know that they are making a potentially long-term investment in themselves, through my artwork. It helps me create more and sustain my livelihood for myself and my children, and it helps you to have a piece that holds a story and value beyond the purchase price. 
    Risks & Challenges I am making the big step to commit to a commercial space. In any business, this is a big risk, and usually a necessary one. As an artist, this means I am asking myself to step up to the next level, to build more consistency and stability through solid systems in my business. I have been building this foundation for about 10 years now, before I even had a business license. I have been developing business systems that work for me and my artist lifestyle. Now it is time to bring this foundation into a physical commercial space.
The biggest challenge will be balancing the transition from working at home to working in a commercial studio space. I believe I can do it, because I've been through many major transitions in the last 10 years, and while each step was scary, I put my all into it, and have pulled it off every time. I have more support than ever now, and my network has grown to a level I never imagined it would. I am involved in several business programs and trainings that hold me accountable to my business goals, values, and services. I am more excited than anything to take on this challenge.
    Other Ways You Can Help You might not be able to make a monetary contribution or invest in an original painting at this time. That is totally okay, I completely understand, as I have been there. What you CAN do is share this campaign, through email, on any social media platforms that you are on, or even through word of mouth. 
Use the share button and help spread the word. You'd be surprised how much this simple act can make a difference! THANK YOU!",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

and I’ve been a professional painter for about six years now. I’ve been really
lucky; I’ve met and worked with a lot of amazing people, and most of the work I
made was for gallery shows, exhibitions, and commissions. But I soon realized working under that kind of pressure for a long time tends to stifle your work and there's no room to experiment, or any freedom to be ok with making bad work!</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455562001/pthsqm4jskwrayo90zpo.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>

learning to be content when each piece didn’t turn out perfectly. Last year
taught me that in order to keep growing as a painter, I need to make a lot of mediocre paintings to get to the good ones, and the few great ones.  It also taught me a lot about myself!</span></p>

title of the series of paintings I have begun. Each painting deals with a personally important moment of ‘</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">actuality</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">’. In
philosophical terms, actuality is the moment an individual can really only know and observe in truth; it is the moment of present, without the impression of foresight or hindsight. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><p>Actuality has been described as the spaces between the ticking
of a clock, the darkness between the flashes of a lighthouse, the calm in the
center of a hurricane; or, the eye of the storm.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is no 'understanding' such as that

<p>Residencies are the overlooked miracles of the art world. They are havens of calm, collectedness, introspection, wonder, culture, and connectivity. They help establish international conversations between art communities, encourage experimentation and growth, promote intercultural learning and advance studio practice and careers.

That experience was why I spent 2015 in such obsessive study, experimentation, and general hermitage....</p>

My name is Archer Dougherty,
and I’ve been a professional painter for about six years now. I’ve been really
lucky; I’ve met and worked with a lot of amazing people, and most of the work I
made was for gallery shows, exhibitions, and commissions. But I soon realized working under that kind of pressure for a long time tends to stifle your work and there's no room to experiment, or any freedom to be ok with making bad work!
In 2015, I took the year off gallery shows and spent my time studying, experimenting, and
learning to be content when each piece didn’t turn out perfectly. Last year
taught me that in order to keep growing as a painter, I need to make a lot of mediocre paintings to get to the good ones, and the few great ones.  It also taught me a lot about myself!
In January of this year, I
began a different body of work. Not for a gallery, not for a show - not for anyone but
me. I need to make it on my own
terms.                           

                                                             “Eye of the Storm” is the
title of the series of paintings I have begun. Each painting deals with a personally important moment of ‘actuality’. In
philosophical terms, actuality is the moment an individual can really only know and observe in truth; it is the moment of present, without the impression of foresight or hindsight. 
Actuality has been described as the spaces between the ticking
of a clock, the darkness between the flashes of a lighthouse, the calm in the
center of a hurricane; or, the eye of the storm.There is no 'understanding' such as that
which comes with foresight and hindsight. These moments simply are.
This last year I discovered things about myself only visible in hindsight - certain concepts which kept resurfacing in my work. These ideas are what I am most interested in exploring: difficulties with religion, the acceptance of death and mortality, the idea of ‘home’ and ‘displacement’, and the very morphous yet impressionable time between dependence and responsibility.       Within these concepts there are always moments of profound change. With this body of work, I want to collect these moments from my past and represent them with the calm and clarity offered by seeing them as moments of actuality. Without considering what led to these instances or what change they affected afterwards, these paintings are my interpretation of the moments in the eye of the storm - the hinges of my transition from the person I was into the person I am now.                               There are two very exciting events happening for me this spring, for which I decided to launch this fundraiser: 
Conceiving and painting all the work for ""Eye of the Storm""
Six week painting residency in Assisi, Italy

I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be working on paintings for which there are no outside expectations - just me and my paint and my ideas! This work is so different than anything I have ever attempted before; the ideas are more complex and more personal, the techniques I am using are far more explorative and the sizes are, well....REALLY big!!! The biggest piece I have begun is about five by six feet!
Beginning this body of work is a huge financial commitment - materials are not cheap, and neither is the amount of time spent painting. I've already begun the five (or more: I've built five panels!) large scale pieces that will eventually comprise Eye of the Storm. I'm not worrying about shipping them anywhere, about how they will look hanging on a wall, or even what I am going to do with them once they're finished! I've built myself a large rolling palette, bought good sturdy brushes of all sizes, and built a few of the panels already. I don't need the funds to begin - I need the funds to finish. Here are some of the main materials I need on an ongoing basis; since it is ongoing, I am unsure how much each category will cost: 

Paint
Brushes
Wood and braces
Wax Medium
Glazing mediums



Residencies are the overlooked miracles of the art world. They are havens of calm, collectedness, introspection, wonder, culture, and connectivity. They help establish international conversations between art communities, encourage experimentation and growth, promote intercultural learning and advance studio practice and careers. I was lucky enough to attend a painting residency in Sibiu, Romania in the summer of 2014, and the experience changed my life. That experience was why I spent 2015 in such obsessive study, experimentation, and general hermitage....
            I am going overseas again for a longer period this time, to the art historical center of Europe - Italy! Artistically motivated communities, groups, and individuals who are generous enough to host residencies make it possible for artists like me to travel and experience the world; they are much more reasonable than traveling without, but are not free. 
As with my body of work, I have paid the hosting fee and have been saving for food and materials - but I need help finishing. Here is a breakdown of what I still need for my six weeks in Italy:


Airfare: 1600.00 USD
Rest of food and materials: 500.00 USD 
Extras (such as travel between cities, visiting museums, churches, etc.): 750.00 USD

I have chosen flexible funding because anything helps. These aren't manufacturing or publishing costs - anything you wish to donate will help a great deal in furthering my goals for the spring!



                                                   




As a thank you for everything - even though I couldn't possibly thank you enough for considering donating to support my ventures - I'm offering a variety of artwork to choose from: paper giclee prints editioned and uneditioned, original drawings, paintings, and prints on acrylic. The tiers are broken up into the following sections; if you are interested in a particular section, just scroll to the appropriate heading. 


PAPER AND ACRYLIC PRINTS
ORIGINAL DRAWINGS AND PRINT COMBINATIONS
FRAMED AND LARGER ORIGINAL WORKS

Due to printing, packing, and shipping time and energy, all pieces will be shipped after the campaign has ended :)


*****************
Here are all the tiers in detail - I hope you can find something exciting below! (all dollar amounts are in USD). 


1.00 + -  A great, wonderful thank you! Every little bit helps!

10.00 +  - Exclusive access to my Work and Travel Blog, where you can follow my works in progress and on my adventures in Italy!

(All donations $10.00 and up include access to my blog.) 

I wanted to offer you something you can't get from me all the time. The prints I will be offering - ten images of work ranging from 2010 - 2015 - have never before been reproduced (with the exception of Sandman - which has had one large-size limited edition run), and will never be reproduced again with my permission. A series of five paintings and five drawings that represent the span of my artistic growth and career exclusive to this fundraiser; once the campaign is over, you will never be able to receive prints of these pieces again!

Here are the ten pieces that are available as both acrylic and paper prints, in 5x7"" and 8x10"" sizes.

<div>This year's second installment titled, Yooth: Loss &amp; Found is focused on the idea of youth and all its permutations. We’re looking closely at how the scourge of the AIDS epidemic influenced artists that came of age during the 1980-90s and a potential bridge or connection to how a new generation of artists reflect (or choose <i>not </i>to reflect) on that lineage of QUEER history.

Programming for QBII will include a month-long gallery exhibition in Los Angeles, as well as, a several performance events, an academic series of lectures and public forums and, finally, a literary journal documenting the progress, curation and final product. In this way, QBII not only looks to create inclusive and expansive experiences for audiences, but it hopes to become a current snapshot and ongoing document of this moment in queer history and youth culture.</p>

</div></div>","We've also created a poster based on the 3D model. Craving to create something outstanding, we added as much detail as possible. We've created an extremely detailed giclee print





      



 


There are 3 versions of the poster available in our campaign:
- full HD digital version - 50cm/53cm (20/21 inch)  size version of the poster.- a limited 90cm/96cm (35/38inch) size version of the poster. There are only 100 pieces that all come with a quality certificate.













We managed to produce prototypes that we are very pleased with but we need your help to expand the production. We need at least 15400 $ to be able to place a larger order. If you like our product or our idea, support us! In return for your support and trust, you will receive a unique product.
Estimated Delivery Date is June 2016.
 The only possible problem that we can foresee might be delays in production, but we have taken that into consideration when its comes to our proposed delivering timeline. We will hand check every mug for defects to insure you receive the best quality.




        


In 2012, we bought an Ultimaker 3D printer. It took us about a year to familiarize ourselves with all the functions of the device. We were testing how the printer worked with different materials and different sizes of prints. In 2013, we started to move our digital works to the real world and started testing different production processes.






At the end of 2014 we started searching for the perfect solution for the production of ceramics using prototyping in 3D. 2015 was a struggle to make the mug as practical as possible. We were testing various materials – ceramic clay and finally porcelain to be precise. Our goal was to combine ergonomics and looks to create a useful sculpture.



In 2015 we also began to work on the poster. At the end of that year we were able to achieve first satisfactory results – a porcelain, colored mug.











At this point we were confident that our idea, Technocraft, works. Was that the end? NO! For a long time we have been working on new designs. Your support will be very helpful to us!

<p>Our
Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign has now come to an end. Thank you to
everyone who made a donation, no matter how large or small. We
promise to keep our end of the bargain, and as well as announcing a
venue for the installation over the next few weeks we’ll also be
sending out the promised perks to those who asked for them once the
project is fully up and running. As well as the kind and generous
crowdfunding donations we’ve received, we’ve also been showered
with financial contributions from other sources including cheques
sent in the post and direct bank transfers. The campaign to raise
money is still open, and as well as writing cheques and making bank
transfers you can also donate directly to our NGO PayPal account or
make a contribution through our partner in the United States. And
don’t forget to subscribe to our newsletter, which we’ll be
sending out on a monthly basis to keep you informed about <i>The
Kaunas Requiem</i> and our other projects in general.

</p>
<p>Thank you
again for helping keep Litvak history in the picture.</p>

<p>In Between 1941 and 1944 around 95 percent of Lithuania’s pre-war Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) population of over 200,000 men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>In 2013, we uncovered an extraordinary
collection of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.843591102356951.1073741830.811184158930979&amp;type=3&amp;__mref=message_bubble"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">111 family photographs</a> that had been smuggled out of the Kaunas
Ghetto into the hands of sympathetic local Lithuanians. See the photographs here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.843591102356951.1073741830.811184158930979&amp;type=3&amp;__mref=message_bubble"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook.com/litvakphoto</a></p>

<h2>Creating a musical memorial</h2>
<p>Together with the photographs, we found fascinating evidence of musical performances and show-business activities. Using this as inspiration, we started to plan a fitting memorial for the family, combining the photos with a specially commissioned piece of music and a Reading of the Names. But first we had to find out their names...<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457880410/efrfxuafckh8vuqicnje.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Finding the family</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We didn't know where to start, so we appealed to you for help. Soon after we launched the appeal, we received many messages of support, and exciting things began to happen. Shelly Tandy Johnson kindly sent us a photograph of her grandmother and grandfather’s sister sitting in the same ‘aeroplane’ that’s featured in one of the photographs in our collection. Read more about her story here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/litvakphoto/photos/a.834081573307904.1073741829.811184158930979/940453476004046/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;notif_t=like"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook.com/litvakphoto</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458833438/htdlq2wgmysl4qnjpqsj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>However, the name of the family in the photographs still eluded us. One of the only clues we had was the name of the small Lithuanian town Birštonas, scribbled on the back of a photograph of a young girl, so we started there.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459605979/girlbirstonas_dffzcw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, with the hard work and help of researcher Saulė Valiūnaitė we have miraculously managed to identify the family and learn much more about their story. It seems the family ran a sanatorium in Birštonas, and there are a lot of records related to them over a period of many years. Tragically, we have also confirmed that they perished, along with so many of their fellow Litvaks, in the Holocaust in Lithuania.</p>

<p>In order to commemorate this lost Litvak family and all Lithuania’s Holocaust victims, we’re

establishment of the Kaunas Ghetto. It will close with a live Reading of the
Names event on Lithuanian Holocaust Remembrance Day, September 23, 2016. </p>
<p>The music will be created electronically,
converting the names of Kaunas Holocaust victims into sounds. The performance
will be accompanied by projections of the photographs that inspired the
project. The installation will be simultaneously broadcast online.</p>

Dear
friends and supporters,


Our
Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign has now come to an end. Thank you to
everyone who made a donation, no matter how large or small. We
promise to keep our end of the bargain, and as well as announcing a
venue for the installation over the next few weeks we’ll also be
sending out the promised perks to those who asked for them once the
project is fully up and running. As well as the kind and generous
crowdfunding donations we’ve received, we’ve also been showered
with financial contributions from other sources including cheques
sent in the post and direct bank transfers. The campaign to raise
money is still open, and as well as writing cheques and making bank
transfers you can also donate directly to our NGO PayPal account or
make a contribution through our partner in the United States. And
don’t forget to subscribe to our newsletter, which we’ll be
sending out on a monthly basis to keep you informed about The
Kaunas Requiem and our other projects in general. 



Thank you
again for helping keep Litvak history in the picture.


Richard.

The Family
In Between 1941 and 1944 around 95 percent of Lithuania’s pre-war Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) population of over 200,000 men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators during the Holocaust.
In 2013, we uncovered an extraordinary
collection of 111 family photographs that had been smuggled out of the Kaunas
Ghetto into the hands of sympathetic local Lithuanians. See the photographs here: facebook.com/litvakphoto






Creating a musical memorial
Together with the photographs, we found fascinating evidence of musical performances and show-business activities. Using this as inspiration, we started to plan a fitting memorial for the family, combining the photos with a specially commissioned piece of music and a Reading of the Names. But first we had to find out their names...

Finding the family



We didn't know where to start, so we appealed to you for help. Soon after we launched the appeal, we received many messages of support, and exciting things began to happen. Shelly Tandy Johnson kindly sent us a photograph of her grandmother and grandfather’s sister sitting in the same ‘aeroplane’ that’s featured in one of the photographs in our collection. Read more about her story here: facebook.com/litvakphoto

However, the name of the family in the photographs still eluded us. One of the only clues we had was the name of the small Lithuanian town Birštonas, scribbled on the back of a photograph of a young girl, so we started there.


Finally, with the hard work and help of researcher Saulė Valiūnaitė we have miraculously managed to identify the family and learn much more about their story. It seems the family ran a sanatorium in Birštonas, and there are a lot of records related to them over a period of many years. Tragically, we have also confirmed that they perished, along with so many of their fellow Litvaks, in the Holocaust in Lithuania.
UPDATE: An incredible breakthrough
Amazing news! We have managed to contact living relatives of the family in the photographs! Read more about the latest developments in this interview with our Director, Richard Schofield.

The Kaunas Requiem. A musical memorial for a Litvak family.
In order to commemorate this lost Litvak family and all Lithuania’s Holocaust victims, we’re
creating The Kaunas Requiem, a musical
composition lasting 75 years if played in its entirety. A short extract will be
performed over a seven-day period to mark the 75th anniversary of the
establishment of the Kaunas Ghetto. It will close with a live Reading of the
Names event on Lithuanian Holocaust Remembrance Day, September 23, 2016. 
The music will be created electronically,
converting the names of Kaunas Holocaust victims into sounds. The performance
will be accompanied by projections of the photographs that inspired the
project. The installation will be simultaneously broadcast online.
You can get an exclusive signed CD of this
performance by donating €35!


Who are we?





The International Centre for Litvak Photography is an independent organisation that uses photography as the catalyst for a wide range of educational and cultural events. We aim to put Lithuanian Jewish history back in the picture and create a better understanding of Lithuania’s diverse Litvak cultural heritage.




Anton Degtiariov and Richard Schofield 

Composer Anton Degtiariov graduated from Kiev Music Academy and has completed many experimental musical projects and performances in his native Ukraine. He will work with Lithuanian programmer Rokas Anisas who will teach a computer how to ‘perform’ the Requiem.

He founded the International Centre for Litvak Photography as a way to reinvigorate heritage studies and engage the younger generation of Lithuanians.
The project will be helped by members of the International Centre for Litvak Photography’s Advisory Group, including the Litvak writer and activist Sergey Kanovich and the Lithuanian Holocaust historian Milda Jakulytė.

CHROMA is a collaborative installation of photographs and performance art based in the healing modalities of chakra alignment and color psychology. It will explore, individually, each color of the chakras. CHROMA is a black-led project created by Anicka Austin and Crystal Monds, both active artists and yogini healers in Atlanta, GA.

Art As HealingUsing colors for healing, with a focused artist’s eye can bridge the gap between art, healing justice, and spiritual maintenance. As healers, we continue to research color healing & psychology, and explore how we can harness our ancestral power to promote emotional and spiritual wellness. Because color is necessary and ancestrally, color has been used for healing since human consciousness, we can intentionally use it to positively enhance lives.

</div><br/></div>","We've got lights, sound, and fire! StarDust is a custom built art car that made its on playa debut at Burning
Man 2014.  The exoskeleton of StarDust rotates independently
from the base vehicle delivering a continually changing 360 degree view of the
passing scenery.  The disorienting visual
sensation challenges the rider to experience the sights and sounds of Black Rock city with whole new perspective.

Since September 2014 we have overhauled the electrical/lighting system, gave StarDust a shiny new paint job and completed much need mechanical maintenance on the quad.  We like to share that burner love and wonderment with our local community too.  In May StarDust
participated at the San Mateo Makers Faire and Meet the Machines, giving children of all ages have
the opportunity to touch, climb on and explore alternative transportation methods. Next stop is the burn in Black Rock City NV help us bring the Star to the playa to keep the city moving!   What We Need & What You Get I'm ask for your assistance to raise $650 to off set transportation, operation and fabrication costs.  The end result is for ME to help burners like YOU to get from point A to point B.

$250 - fabrication materials to  pacify the DMV and 'disguise' the quad

$100 - transportation to Black Rock City 
$160 - propane for flame effects
$60 - trailer jack
$80 - metal stock for ramps 

The one piece of feedback I received from the Department of Muntant Vehicles last year was they could still see the base vehicle a blue Yamaha Kodiak.   We squeaked though by driving back to camp, duck taping a bed sheet over the quad and returned for a re inspection with a bottle of Jack.  This year I'd like to fabricate a ying-yang over the center of the quad to obscure it completely from view.

   Did You Know?

Come out and play with us!<br/><br/><h3>Philosophical statement</h3>
<p>We go from place to place, often for the sole purpose of getting there. We work, expend energy and intellect, just to get where we're going. Often we wind up not far form where we were, but transformed by the journey rather than the destination. It was the work that mattered, and the experience on the way.</p>
<p>The journey on the bridge starts easily, and gets more crowded and convoluted across the path. The transformative moment signals the change; traversing the unsettling twist puts one truly on the other side of the journey. At the end, we can view the journey as an accomplishment on its own. It's a solo endeavour, made easier with the help of others on the same path, and done in the midst of those who have made the same journey, and those who may be willing to take it on.</p>
<p>On the way, we fight the elements as well. The bridge, totally suspended save for its endpoints, will move with the exertions of others, and with the wind and elements. It is a small struggle with rewards, pushing ourselves to achieve the goal and overcome the obstacles to come out the other side.</p>
<p>Work must be done. Rewards are reaped with the accomplishment of investment.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Project description</span><br/></p>
<p>The bridge structure itself is fully suspended from tall 6x6 masts, which loom high above. The mouths of the bridge are anchored tightly to the ground. The bridge itself, composed of suspended planks of wood (2x4), extends from wide mouths through a wicked S-curve. In the center of the bridge the flat planks perform a half-twist, Mobius-style, on which the traveller must negotiate an edge of the bridgework, using the hanging ropes and hands of her fellows for stability. On crossing the twist, the traveller will find herself truly on the other side of the bridge, where she will complete her journey through the other symmetrical side. The wind may wreak some havoc with the traveller on her journey across as well.</p>
<p>The planks are suspended from the masts by numerous ropes. The juxtaposition of curved contours and linear planks and ropes make for a compelling silhouette. The curves themselves are organic, and provide very differnt shapes from different viewing angles. The ropes are attached to planks with a strong, metal-free design.</p>
<p>The masts are 6x6 posts, buried into the playa and guyed down for stability and safety. The suspension ropes are likely to be attached to steel rings capping the masts. The masts must be strongly coupled at their joins, likely with 2x6 cladding and tongue-in-groove construction. (The original proposal specified curved metal trusswork from which the bridge was suspended, but this has proven costly and the stability was uncertain. The masts are a fine replacement, and burnable to boot.)</p>
<p>Beneath the bridge, most of which is suspended above head-height, is a light garden. Seating around the mast bases and LED lights will feature, where others can gather, take small shelter form the wind, and enjoy the serenity of a transformative achievement. Other artists will have the opportunity to display smaller sculptures below as well. We are also considering artful shade structures for daytime relief, and monitored burn barrels for warmth at night.</p>
<p>Viewed during the day, the bridge presents a visually appealing curved shape composed of straight lines. The twist has a functional purpose as well, that of preventing bikes from recklessly plowing into unsuspecting burners. At night, the bridge is lit with animated LED lights and the garden below. The suspension lines may be lit as well. Guy lines must be lit at their bases.</p>
<p>A small powerhouse is erected to the side, housing a generator providing power to the lights. It is ventilated but otherwise sound-shielded to minimize the noise of the generator. We are also considering a solar-battery component as a nice-to-have, but this much light gets power-hungry. Trenches will conceal power cables in conduit.</p>

Update 7/4
We have an amazing fundraising event coming up in just a few weeks. On 7/24, join us at Re-Bar for WOD and Inflection Present: Bridge Burner!

https://www.facebook.com/events/712212988908486/This family un-friendly event will feature not so 
classic Amerikan style picnic games like Pajama Tug-of-War, A Three 
Legged Dance Off, and a chance to unload your emotional baggage publicly
 by Burning Bridges with Inflection. Get your tickets early before they sell out!Our most recent work party was last Thursday. We continued cutting, drilling, and assembling planks for the Bulb sections - check out our progress diagram!
Sections in white are complete, yellow are in progress, and blue have not been started. As you can see we are on schedule and working hard, but we still need your help. We need funds to buy more fabrication materials and to transport this amazing installation to Black Rock City!
Don't forget about our Oscillator perk - rope swings are great! 




We will have rope swings and other interactive pieces of Inflection for you to enjoy at our Bridge Burner party. Come out and play with us!Philosophical statement
We go from place to place, often for the sole purpose of getting there. We work, expend energy and intellect, just to get where we're going. Often we wind up not far form where we were, but transformed by the journey rather than the destination. It was the work that mattered, and the experience on the way.
The journey on the bridge starts easily, and gets more crowded and convoluted across the path. The transformative moment signals the change; traversing the unsettling twist puts one truly on the other side of the journey. At the end, we can view the journey as an accomplishment on its own. It's a solo endeavour, made easier with the help of others on the same path, and done in the midst of those who have made the same journey, and those who may be willing to take it on.
On the way, we fight the elements as well. The bridge, totally suspended save for its endpoints, will move with the exertions of others, and with the wind and elements. It is a small struggle with rewards, pushing ourselves to achieve the goal and overcome the obstacles to come out the other side.
Work must be done. Rewards are reaped with the accomplishment of investment.

Project description
The bridge structure itself is fully suspended from tall 6x6 masts, which loom high above. The mouths of the bridge are anchored tightly to the ground. The bridge itself, composed of suspended planks of wood (2x4), extends from wide mouths through a wicked S-curve. In the center of the bridge the flat planks perform a half-twist, Mobius-style, on which the traveller must negotiate an edge of the bridgework, using the hanging ropes and hands of her fellows for stability. On crossing the twist, the traveller will find herself truly on the other side of the bridge, where she will complete her journey through the other symmetrical side. The wind may wreak some havoc with the traveller on her journey across as well.
The planks are suspended from the masts by numerous ropes. The juxtaposition of curved contours and linear planks and ropes make for a compelling silhouette. The curves themselves are organic, and provide very differnt shapes from different viewing angles. The ropes are attached to planks with a strong, metal-free design.
The masts are 6x6 posts, buried into the playa and guyed down for stability and safety. The suspension ropes are likely to be attached to steel rings capping the masts. The masts must be strongly coupled at their joins, likely with 2x6 cladding and tongue-in-groove construction. (The original proposal specified curved metal trusswork from which the bridge was suspended, but this has proven costly and the stability was uncertain. The masts are a fine replacement, and burnable to boot.)
Beneath the bridge, most of which is suspended above head-height, is a light garden. Seating around the mast bases and LED lights will feature, where others can gather, take small shelter form the wind, and enjoy the serenity of a transformative achievement. Other artists will have the opportunity to display smaller sculptures below as well. We are also considering artful shade structures for daytime relief, and monitored burn barrels for warmth at night.
Viewed during the day, the bridge presents a visually appealing curved shape composed of straight lines. The twist has a functional purpose as well, that of preventing bikes from recklessly plowing into unsuspecting burners. At night, the bridge is lit with animated LED lights and the garden below. The suspension lines may be lit as well. Guy lines must be lit at their bases.
A small powerhouse is erected to the side, housing a generator providing power to the lights. It is ventilated but otherwise sound-shielded to minimize the noise of the generator. We are also considering a solar-battery component as a nice-to-have, but this much light gets power-hungry. Trenches will conceal power cables in conduit.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

See below for interim goals. We'll use what we can raise, but we want to raise more than than our immediate needs, so that we can keep expanding our vision.</p><h3>About this campaign</h3><p>This proje<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538924591/abr6xmgxhiipxbd6lsgi.png"" src="""" style=""padding-left:5px;""/>ct is about helping me realize my dream to share with everyone the knowledge that has had such a powerful impact on me and my communities, that's inspired and informed my art and my activism. I consider this <strong>Juneteenth Calendar</strong>, filled with my art and my research, to be my most important contribution to society. It will reach more people and has the potential to inspire others to learn more and do more than anything else I've done.</p><p>I'm <strong>Isaka Shamsud-Din</strong>. I'm 77 and I've been an artist since I was 5 or 6. It's been a long road to get to where I am today, I've encountered many obstacles and many successes and lucky breaks. I am fortunate. Making art has always been at the core of my being. And teaching allows the sharing of my knowledge, technique, and zeal to create. The discoveries and revelations that I experience in my research reward and compel me to dig for more. I'm committed to producing the highest quality art that I can, and to sharing notes and articles about historical and contemporary people and events that have helped shape our world, our society.</p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539024219/zgot12ssiomwhytzysfh.png"" src="""" style=""padding-right:10px;""/>I've been doing the research that is feeding into this calendar for more than 50 years. And let me tell you, there was no Wikipedia back when, and few good sources of authoritative information about the lives of black folk. It’s been tedious at times, yet so inspiring. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know, the more I want to share. I want to share my experience with as many people as possible. The <strong>Juneteenth Calendar</strong> offers a way to do that, and it gives a glimpse into a broader view of how we all got to this chapter of our shared history.</p><h3>Our goals</h3><p><strong>If we raise $5,000</strong>, that will secure the cost of printing the calendar. Final costs will be in the range of $8,000 - $12,000 (we'll let you know). <strong>If we raise it by October 25</strong>, we'll open up an exclusive $150 perk: invitation to a LIMITED ATTENDANCE OPEN STUDIO EVENT at my Cathedral Park Place studio in the St Johns neighborhood of Portland.</p><p><strong>If we raise $10,000--this is the real deal--</strong>it means we can keep on using Indiegogo to raise funds for related programs. We'll be able to establish a non-profit and get the financial services we need to create a solid foundation for ongoing programs related to the calendar, run with transparency and accountability.</p><p><strong>If we raise $15,000</strong> before the campaign deadline, every Indiegogo supporter will receive a invitations to a Black History Month block party, a Juneteenth Celebration, and/or any other invitation-only events we dream up, held in conjunction with the <strong>Children's Art &amp; Social Justice Council</strong> (formerly Don't Shoot Portland) and other sponsors. We'll develop a <strong>companion website</strong> to the Juneteenth Calendar, where we'll tell more in-depth stories of the people, places, and events featured in the calendar.</p><p><i><strong>If we raise more than $15,000, you know we'll put it to good use!</strong><i>  </i></i>In fact, if we meet our goal, we plan to keep raising money to sustain the operation of the non-profit and develop curricula and supporting materials to continue this work. We'll work to help un-erase the erasure of the black community in Portland and to use art as a means of social engagement, inclusion, and healing for all people.</p><p>Some of this money is going to help with the operating expenses of Shamsud-Din Studio related to the calendar project during this time, including space, utilities, and supplies. This is the place where I make art and where my collaborators work with me to create, document, and share everything that we're doing. If you would like to help with my studio expenses directly, you can provide ongoing support on <strong><a href=""http://patreon.com/isaka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a></strong> or make a donation at <strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/shamsud-din-studio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GoFundMe</a></strong>. BAM! I can get to these funds more quickly than through Indiegogo. I'm dedicated to art and community engagement that lifts and celebrates black lives. Your support is amazing! We'll provide more detailed information as we get it, but we can't wait—this calendar needs to get printed NOW, and my team of supporters and I think a rolling start is the best way to get moving.</p><h3>More about me</h3><p>I was treated as a child prodigy by age 11. In 1955, I won a national art competition and a scholarship, attending the Midwestern Music and Art Camp at the University of Kansas in the summers when I was 14, 15 and 16. But by my Junior year in high school I became disenchanted with school and almost dropped out. A turbulent home life following the break up and divorce of my parents, an oppressive racial environment and the exclusion of black people in the curriculum created feelings of alienation and resentment in me. I descended into street life after graduating and became a thug. It was the continued pursuit of making art and my independent study of the black experience that helped me survive this dangerous, near disastrous time.</p><p>Since then, I've been a working artist, a husband and father, a black studies professor, and a community activist. I've been an art instructor from 3rd grade up to college students. <strong>Some of the efforts I've led that are similar to this Indiegogo campaign include</strong>:</p><ul>
<li>Raising funds to design, construct, and run projects that employed and trained professionals and youth apprentices in creating community-based, public art murals—like the Albina Mural Project, Albina Neighborhood Murals, Ojo Tuntun Murals Project, and the Cultural Streams Mural Project.</li>
<li>Establishing an African American Visual Arts Scholarship at Portland State University, which helped four students graduate with fine arts degrees.</li>
<li>Creating the Young, Black and Gifted art competition with a $10,000 contribution from then-mayor Tom Potter, a ""mural marathon"" with local volunteer artists, and other benefits to fund cash awards for the winners.</li>
<li>Planning, funding, and organizing a series of three Public Art &amp; Murals programs with Guadalupe Rivera Marín, daughter of Diego Rivera.</li>
<li>I'll have more detailed information on these projects on my website very soon!</li>
</ul><p>Honey in the Bee Ball, a completed Dawson Park installation funded by the Regional Arts and Culture Council (go check it out, Portlanders!), has consumed much of my time over the last six years, leaving little time to be active in other aspects of my career. Since I finished last summer, I've come back to new works in my studio and pursuing this calendar project.</p><h3>More than a calendar</h3><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538924799/dhovxyll58c9sukqnbko.png"" src="""" style=""margin-right:10px;""/>The <strong>Juneteenth Calendar</strong> is a creation that can enlighten and inspire people from all walks of life, in any setting; offices, homes and classrooms, any place there’s a wall to hang it on. It is portable and moderately priced. Teaching Black Studies and creating paintings, drawings and murals—these all reach a limited audience. It can open up new avenues of knowledge and understanding, and make my art accessible to a greater audience. Your support makes you a partner in this greatly needed undertaking.</p><p>If we're successful, there will be <strong>more than just a calendar</strong>. There will be a <strong>companion website</strong>, programming with libraries and educational organizations around Black History Month and Juneteenth, and the development of new projects building on the ideas of the calendar. We'll create a non-profit so that we can continue to seek funding and collaborate with the amazing people in Portland who are committed to social justice, equity, art-in-action, and telling the stories of disenfranchised people—especially un-erasing the erasure of the black community here.</p><h3>Our amazing sponsors!</h3><p>Check this out: if you become a backer, you'll be joining this stellar list of people and organizations who are supporting this calendar project:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Arlene Schnitzer</strong>, Harold &amp; Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation – a long-time personal supporter of mine and the core sponsor of the Juneteenth Calendar</li>
<li>
<strong>Teressa Raiford</strong>, Don't Shoot Portland (soon to be the Children's Art and Social Justice Council) and 2020 Portland Mayor candidate – fiscal sponsor (and our vital energy!)</li>
<li>
<strong>Victor Maldonado</strong>, professor of art and diversity &amp; inclusion guru at PNCA – documentation and archive sponsor</li>
<li>
<strong>Matt Letzelter</strong>, director, Watershed, and professor, PNCA – fine art printmaking sponsor (my collaborator on the limited-edition print perk)</li>
<li>NEW! <strong>Scott Ballo</strong> &amp; <strong>Morel Ink</strong> – printing sponsor</li>
<li>NEW! <strong>Tiffany Burnette</strong>, Designhype – design sponsor</li>
</ul><h3>About the calendar contributors</h3><p>I created all the art in this calendar over the course of my career. Some of it is earlier, some of it I created under commission, and some of it I've shared in other forms. But never like this. Building on my artwork and my decades of scholarship, I've worked on the development of the calendar with no compensation.

This will help us cover the cost of producing the 12-month, 2019 Juneteenth Calendar. See below for interim goals. We'll use what we can raise, but we want to raise more than than our immediate needs, so that we can keep expanding our vision.About this campaignThis project is about helping me realize my dream to share with everyone the knowledge that has had such a powerful impact on me and my communities, that's inspired and informed my art and my activism. I consider this Juneteenth Calendar, filled with my art and my research, to be my most important contribution to society. It will reach more people and has the potential to inspire others to learn more and do more than anything else I've done.I'm Isaka Shamsud-Din. I'm 77 and I've been an artist since I was 5 or 6. It's been a long road to get to where I am today, I've encountered many obstacles and many successes and lucky breaks. I am fortunate. Making art has always been at the core of my being. And teaching allows the sharing of my knowledge, technique, and zeal to create. The discoveries and revelations that I experience in my research reward and compel me to dig for more. I'm committed to producing the highest quality art that I can, and to sharing notes and articles about historical and contemporary people and events that have helped shape our world, our society.I've been doing the research that is feeding into this calendar for more than 50 years. And let me tell you, there was no Wikipedia back when, and few good sources of authoritative information about the lives of black folk. It’s been tedious at times, yet so inspiring. The more I learned, the more I wanted to know, the more I want to share. I want to share my experience with as many people as possible. The Juneteenth Calendar offers a way to do that, and it gives a glimpse into a broader view of how we all got to this chapter of our shared history.Our goalsIf we raise $5,000, that will secure the cost of printing the calendar. Final costs will be in the range of $8,000 - $12,000 (we'll let you know). If we raise it by October 25, we'll open up an exclusive $150 perk: invitation to a LIMITED ATTENDANCE OPEN STUDIO EVENT at my Cathedral Park Place studio in the St Johns neighborhood of Portland.If we raise $10,000--this is the real deal--it means we can keep on using Indiegogo to raise funds for related programs. We'll be able to establish a non-profit and get the financial services we need to create a solid foundation for ongoing programs related to the calendar, run with transparency and accountability.If we raise $15,000 before the campaign deadline, every Indiegogo supporter will receive a invitations to a Black History Month block party, a Juneteenth Celebration, and/or any other invitation-only events we dream up, held in conjunction with the Children's Art & Social Justice Council (formerly Don't Shoot Portland) and other sponsors. We'll develop a companion website to the Juneteenth Calendar, where we'll tell more in-depth stories of the people, places, and events featured in the calendar.If we raise more than $15,000, you know we'll put it to good use!  In fact, if we meet our goal, we plan to keep raising money to sustain the operation of the non-profit and develop curricula and supporting materials to continue this work. We'll work to help un-erase the erasure of the black community in Portland and to use art as a means of social engagement, inclusion, and healing for all people.Some of this money is going to help with the operating expenses of Shamsud-Din Studio related to the calendar project during this time, including space, utilities, and supplies. This is the place where I make art and where my collaborators work with me to create, document, and share everything that we're doing. If you would like to help with my studio expenses directly, you can provide ongoing support on Patreon or make a donation at GoFundMe. BAM! I can get to these funds more quickly than through Indiegogo. I'm dedicated to art and community engagement that lifts and celebrates black lives. Your support is amazing! We'll provide more detailed information as we get it, but we can't wait—this calendar needs to get printed NOW, and my team of supporters and I think a rolling start is the best way to get moving.More about meI was treated as a child prodigy by age 11. In 1955, I won a national art competition and a scholarship, attending the Midwestern Music and Art Camp at the University of Kansas in the summers when I was 14, 15 and 16. But by my Junior year in high school I became disenchanted with school and almost dropped out. A turbulent home life following the break up and divorce of my parents, an oppressive racial environment and the exclusion of black people in the curriculum created feelings of alienation and resentment in me. I descended into street life after graduating and became a thug. It was the continued pursuit of making art and my independent study of the black experience that helped me survive this dangerous, near disastrous time.Since then, I've been a working artist, a husband and father, a black studies professor, and a community activist. I've been an art instructor from 3rd grade up to college students. Some of the efforts I've led that are similar to this Indiegogo campaign include:
Raising funds to design, construct, and run projects that employed and trained professionals and youth apprentices in creating community-based, public art murals—like the Albina Mural Project, Albina Neighborhood Murals, Ojo Tuntun Murals Project, and the Cultural Streams Mural Project.
Establishing an African American Visual Arts Scholarship at Portland State University, which helped four students graduate with fine arts degrees.
Creating the Young, Black and Gifted art competition with a $10,000 contribution from then-mayor Tom Potter, a ""mural marathon"" with local volunteer artists, and other benefits to fund cash awards for the winners.
Planning, funding, and organizing a series of three Public Art & Murals programs with Guadalupe Rivera Marín, daughter of Diego Rivera.
I'll have more detailed information on these projects on my website very soon!
Honey in the Bee Ball, a completed Dawson Park installation funded by the Regional Arts and Culture Council (go check it out, Portlanders!), has consumed much of my time over the last six years, leaving little time to be active in other aspects of my career. Since I finished last summer, I've come back to new works in my studio and pursuing this calendar project.More than a calendarThe Juneteenth Calendar is a creation that can enlighten and inspire people from all walks of life, in any setting; offices, homes and classrooms, any place there’s a wall to hang it on. It is portable and moderately priced. Teaching Black Studies and creating paintings, drawings and murals—these all reach a limited audience. It can open up new avenues of knowledge and understanding, and make my art accessible to a greater audience. Your support makes you a partner in this greatly needed undertaking.If we're successful, there will be more than just a calendar. There will be a companion website, programming with libraries and educational organizations around Black History Month and Juneteenth, and the development of new projects building on the ideas of the calendar. We'll create a non-profit so that we can continue to seek funding and collaborate with the amazing people in Portland who are committed to social justice, equity, art-in-action, and telling the stories of disenfranchised people—especially un-erasing the erasure of the black community here.Our amazing sponsors!Check this out: if you become a backer, you'll be joining this stellar list of people and organizations who are supporting this calendar project:

Arlene Schnitzer, Harold & Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation – a long-time personal supporter of mine and the core sponsor of the Juneteenth Calendar

Teressa Raiford, Don't Shoot Portland (soon to be the Children's Art and Social Justice Council) and 2020 Portland Mayor candidate – fiscal sponsor (and our vital energy!)

Victor Maldonado, professor of art and diversity & inclusion guru at PNCA – documentation and archive sponsor

Matt Letzelter, director, Watershed, and professor, PNCA – fine art printmaking sponsor (my collaborator on the limited-edition print perk)
NEW! Scott Ballo & Morel Ink – printing sponsor
NEW! Tiffany Burnette, Designhype – design sponsor
About the calendar contributorsI created all the art in this calendar over the course of my career. Some of it is earlier, some of it I created under commission, and some of it I've shared in other forms. But never like this. Building on my artwork and my decades of scholarship, I've worked on the development of the calendar with no compensation. All of my work, studio space, and resources so far have been at my own expense. The money that we raise will be put toward supporting the broader goals that I have for the calendar: to educate and inspire! This includes the costs of creating future calendars, so that my work does not continue to be uncompensated. So if successful, we'll budget for compensation for me and for major contributors to work in the future.I've had major support since this spring from a friend and expert at making technology work for people like me who want to use it as a means to support other interests.

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>I am creating a mobile, moving artwork exploring my childhood journeys from the Midlands to coastal holidays in the South West, the memories, the excitement, the early starts, the car sickness, the model villages and our ever-present and trusty Volvos.</p>
<p>Part homage, part personal journey, part wacky races and part serious investigation of the place holidays have in our lives, this project will ultimately form the core of a new body of work to be exhibited in venues tbc.</p>
<h2>Project Outline:</h2>
<p>The project has multiple strands but with the main focus being a recreation of the Volvo that was used to transport our family to our annual seaside pilgrimage, but with some extensive modifications. Using an existing Volvo of similar spec it will be made as close as possible to my memories of the journeys, from body colour to the seat pockets full of Softmints and i-Spy books. The main difference will be the addition of a large faux neon arrow. This arrow will sit atop the roof as an illuminated beacon signalling the excitement, intent and direction of the journey to be ‘Westward Ho!’. The arrow alludes to roadside signage, the glitz of seaside piers and amusement arcades whilst referencing prior work and the promise of the great American West.</p>
<p>The completed vehicle will be transported to our perpetual starting point of the village of Blisworth in Northamptonshire and then driven towards the South West along routes taken gleaned from memories and old maps. Stopping at our regular stopping points including Frome and Avebury before arriving at one of our common destinations of Westward Ho!</p>
<p>The journey acts like a pilgrimage, a way to honour the memory of my late father (the catalyst for these holidays making them a priority each year). The rituals involved will be followed, from checking of tyre pressures, leaving promptly at 5.30am, and stopping for breakfast on route and avoiding motorways at all cost.</p>
<p>The project is a way to explore my own childhood experiences, my relationship with travel, the coast and the joy and anguish of the long 5+ hour journey. The piece will later journey to other locations, becoming an object for starting discussions with communities and tourists alike as well as forming the centrepiece of an exhibition.</p>
<p>The whole journey will be extensively documented with 'drivers eye' video and photographs on route which will form part of the exhibition.</p>
<h2>What I Need:</h2>
<p>Having been fortunate to receive some funding through Cultivator Cornwall for equipment to make the Neon Arrow the rest of the project is fully self-funded and this is where I need your support to help make the project happen.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2><u>About Me</u></h2><p>When I was about five, my grandmother taught me how to sew. It's been my most defining skill throughout my entire life. In middle school and high school, I loved sewing my own clothing and costumes. Afterwards, I worked in a tailor shop followed by a leathercrafting store. It was during my time at the tailor shop that I won a gift card to an online retailer of various sewing machines. I had my eye on one that could sew through leather, but the first thing I saw was the single-needle Brother PE770 Home Embroidery Machine. Intrigued, I did a few weeks of research. I looked up software, how to design, and what other materials or tools I might need. My mind was set! Now here I am, with that single-needle as well as a professional ten-needle machine.</p><p>The goal of my business has always been to hire other independent artists and support them through sales. I wouldn't have been able to start doing that without my best friend, Teal Sather, to be my first business partner. Since starting my portfolio with her beautiful illustration work, I've also had the immense pleasure of licensing work from three other artists. That number will hopefully continue to grow!</p><p> </p><h2><u>About My Campaign</u></h2><h3>What I Am Asking For:</h3><p>(Edit 11/2/18): In addition to securing a, well, security blanket for the year, the space comes ""as-is"" and will need a few hundred dollars of renovations before it's ready. So far I've spent about $150 on paint, spackle, light fixtures/bulbs, and the miscellaneous tools that I didn't already have. Every hour that I'm fixing up the place is also time spent away from selling and creating new product, so the quicker I can get this done the less money I'll be out from that perspective. </p><p>My goal for this campaign is set at a year's worth of rent. All funds except a deposit fee and first month's rent will go into my business savings account immediately. Each month, I will only take out what I need for rent. In all likelihood, I will be able to make each month’s rent just fine from profits alone. However, there’s always the risk of off-months, and that's what this fund is for: security. I have no doubt that by one year from now, I will be more than capable of selling enough each month to make rent and then some. But for now, I'm going to need a bit of a security blanket just in case. If I end up not needing any amount of the funds in the savings account, the funds will stay there until absolutely necessary.</p><p>If my goal is not reached, the funds will go into a savings account that I've set up specifically for growing my business. No matter how close to my goal I get, I will still be able to sign a lease! I am privileged to have the ability to be confident in my future success. This campaign is simply to start that future with a steadier foothold.</p><h3>Backer Rewards:</h3><ul>

For a while, I could manage from my current setup, but now I’m hitting the limits of what I can do with the space I have.</p><p>Separating my work from home would allow me to take on more custom projects. For example: keeping blank items such as caps, shirts, and a wide range of fabric choices are impossible in my current space. Keeping more items in stock would allow me to offer a better selection of goods to independent artists.  Having the appropriate space to place more machinery - or even hire a part-time employee to assist with item creation - is vital to the growth of any small business.</p><p>Being able to provide services to small businesses and local organizations that don’t have the resources to engage with larger industrial embroidery operations is very important to me!  I want to keep my business open to working with both end-users and resellers. That’s why I will continue to not have a minimum quantity requirement.</p><h3>Current Space:</h3><p>Right now, I'm using some space in our rented house. It's completely non-insulated while being in the basement. It gets so cold during the cold months that I can hardly be in my studio for half an hour at a time. The rafters are exposed, and our landlord has been storing all sorts of spare wood and tools in them. In addition, there's exposed wiring and only three outlets. It's also taking up an entire room in our house - one we'd prefer to use for storage or a living space.</p><p>It's certainly not terrible aside from the temperature, but it's not great either.

<p>Chapel Perilous is an interactive ruin — dark, mysterious, and illuminated from within. Its two remaining walls, built to resemble distressed stone, stand 16 feet tall. Four stained “glass” windows and a large rosette made from acrylic are lit by LEDs, programmed to display memorizing light patterns. At the chapel’s center is an interactive altar, which visitors can manipulate to trigger new light patterns and sounds.Residents of Black Rock City are invited to explore the ruin if they dare.</p>
<p>Until Chapel Perilous finds its way to Burning Man 2019, Rob and the Enchanted Booty Forest will be hard at work creating four beautiful stained glass windows, building the chapel’s frame, spires, and interactive art pieces, as well as imbuing the structure with the power of chaos magic!Chapel Perilous received an honoraria grant for over $14,000, but it’ll cost about $23,000 to build it sturdily enough to withstand the harsh conditions of the playa and to transport it to Black Rock City and back. We need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>But who is Rob? And what is an Enchanted Booty Forest?</h3>
<p>Four years ago, Rob took a leap of faith. He’d been building a successful but ultimately unfulfilling career at a large bank, but he left it all behind and built a small workshop in his apartment where he could experiment with laser cutting and making art.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564437264/eo5bsvntvwjyp1isxzru.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564437281/ow4qt8v4hpfkrepnuugw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>He’s spent thousands of hours designing and laser cutting since then, learning lots of new tools and developing an artistic style along the way. Chapel Perilous is the biggest project he’s taken on yet, and the culmination of a lot of hard work to this point.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564437310/hyevwrxrm5weu6njpzcz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But it’s not just Rob’s work and ideas that have led to this project’s creation—over 25 artists are coming together to design, engineer, build, decorate, and otherwise bring this ruined chapel to life. Mostly hailing from Los Angeles, the members of this team have a variety of expertise but are all driven by the same call to bring an amazing experience to the citizens of Black Rock City and beyond. The crew comes together under the Enchanted Booty Forest art collective, which is also a village of Black Rock City.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Alright, but what’s the point?</h3>
<p>We’re building a physical manifestation of the eight-circuit model of consciousness because it’s really, really special. Each of the eight circuits represents a type of intelligence. Developing them can help you experience bliss, reimagine your limitations, overcome trauma, connect to your genetic memory, access the Akashic records, and perhaps even understand the true nature of existence. It’s basically a path to unlocking the secrets of the universe, so we’re building a beautiful, rapture-inducing playground for burners to explore it.</p>
<p>As part of that exploration, chapel guardians will guide burners through some of the symbols in the piece and offer support through personal transformation, if desired. An altar will stand in the middle, an offering of an ideal setting for personal or group rituals dedicated to growth and transformation. We’re building a stomping grounds for people to experiment with both practical and magical methods of changing their lives, and we hope you’re excited to support it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Honoraria grant is covering a lot of the engineering, material, and build costs to create the chapel. But, in order to stand up to the harsh conditions of the playa, the project requires a previously unexpected $5,000 worth of aluminum truss. We also need to raise another $4-5,000 for transportation, decor, audio equipment, computer, Production Designer, and the necessary enclosures to keep all the electronics clean and cool.In addition to the satisfaction of knowing you’ve personally helped our crew and all the chapel’s visitors to progress along their paths, here’s what your donations will get you at various levels:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>$15  <strong>Thank you</strong> -  Your support for this project at any level is appreciated.</p>
<p>$30  <strong>Postcard</strong> - We'll take professional photos of the chapel for these post cards. Our build crew will send you a handwritten note of thanks on the back after the event!</p>
<p>$50   <strong>Sigil</strong> - Everything above PLUS: Draw your own magick sigil to call in or release something that's meaningful to YOU! (Don't worry—we'll teach you how.) Send it in, and we'll put it in part of one of the chapel walls then we'll take it to the temple to burn on Sunday night.</p>
<p>$100  <strong>Sticker pack</strong> - Everything above PLUS: a sticker pack including images of each of the Chapel's stained glass windows.</p>
<p>$250 <strong>Photo print</strong> - Everything above PLUS: a gorgeous, professional printed art photo of the chapel on the playa.</p>
<p>$500  <strong>12"" Epoxy Rosette</strong> - You get a postcard, sigil, sticker pack, AND a 12"" replica of the chapel's rosette window, made using the same painted epoxy technique as the original 48"" rosette! </p>
<p> </p>

<p> Rising from the dust, our sculpture invites you to touch, explore, and inhabit.  In order to activate her fullest potential; people must work together. Through collaboration participants can mobilise her 16ft wingspan and activate beautiful illuminating light graphics.</p>
<p>The Archaeopteryx serves as a physical and symbolic reminder that in order for humans to evolve, we must work together.</p>
<p>We need your help to finish the work we've started and bring her to the playa. </p>

<h3>Philosophy </h3>
<p>The work is open to multiple interpretations.  We like the idea that it might help one to see and situate themselves in an evolving and connected world.  By drawing parallels between the primal nature of evolution and the current human condition, we believe it has a powerful message that empowers others to evolve towards a better future; one that is more inclusive, equitable, and harmonious.  From the individual to the collective scale, the theme encapsulates the characteristics of something much larger than itself.</p>

<h1>A half century in the making and just in time to mark our 10th anniversary in Las Vegas...the Burlesque Hall of Fame is ready to pull back the curtain on our NEW HOME!</h1>
<p>The Burlesque Hall of Fame, <b>the world's only not-for-profit organization with a mission to preserve, celebrate and inspire the art of burlesque</b>, is thrilled to announce that <b>in 2016 we will take the keys to a newly renovated museum, exhibition, retail and office venue</b>, and begin installation for a grand opening in the summer!</p>
<h2><b>This is a tremendously thrilling--but also challenging--time in the history of
the Burlesque Hall of Fame! And your support will play a vital role in our
success. </b></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><i><b>So what's The Big Reveal all about?</b></i></h3>
<div>

<i>Above: Miss Exotic World 1995, Pillow, outside the gates to our original home, the Exotic World Museum in the Mojave Desert of California.</i>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<p><b>The move to our new home launches the third era in BHoF's history. </b>The first was the era of our beginnings as a small, dusty roadside attraction, a museum of memorabilia collected by our founder, Jennie Lee, from her compatriots in the business of tease. Jennie began the annual reunion of the performers from burlesque's heyday, and from those seeds our events and the collection grew. The annual Miss Exotic World Pageant was founded by the legendary Dixie Evans, as a way to draw new fans and performers to the museum. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443732815/bvolqhgw09wo7echcdip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Above: Dixie Evans, ""The Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque"" in our original home.</i>
</div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>The second
key point in our history was in the early 2000s, when a small group of volunteers,
representing the next generation of burlesque enthusiasts from around the
world, took on the challenge of preserving this one-of-a-kind collection of
costumes, props, photos, ephemera and more and of making it an organized, permanent and official not-for-profit institution dedicated to celebrating and preserving an often-overlooked
area of entertainment history. This is the era when we became the Burlesque Hall of Fame, moved the collection to Las Vegas and our primary fundraiser, the
annual Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender, became the four-day showcase it is
today. Held every year on the first weekend in June in Las Vegas, the BHoF Weekender is attended by thousands of fans and contemporary burlesque performers,
with nightly performances, vendors, classes, panel discussions and
parties—and of course, the reunion of the elder stars of yesteryear.  
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443733165/tbqts9qt08wldveyzqqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Our 2013 exhibition ""Not-So-Hidden Histories: Performers of Color in Burlesque.""<br/></i>
</div><div><i><br/></i></div><div>
<p>And
now, we’ve reached a third pivotal point, when <b>the Burlesque Hall of Fame, the museum itself, can begin to match the international
stature of its main event, and become a true destination for fans, tourists and

<h3>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</h3>
</div></div>","A half century in the making and just in time to mark our 10th anniversary in Las Vegas...the Burlesque Hall of Fame is ready to pull back the curtain on our NEW HOME!
The Burlesque Hall of Fame, the world's only not-for-profit organization with a mission to preserve, celebrate and inspire the art of burlesque, is thrilled to announce that in 2016 we will take the keys to a newly renovated museum, exhibition, retail and office venue, and begin installation for a grand opening in the summer!
This is a tremendously thrilling--but also challenging--time in the history of
the Burlesque Hall of Fame! And your support will play a vital role in our
success. 


So what's The Big Reveal all about?


Above: Miss Exotic World 1995, Pillow, outside the gates to our original home, the Exotic World Museum in the Mojave Desert of California.


The move to our new home launches the third era in BHoF's history. The first was the era of our beginnings as a small, dusty roadside attraction, a museum of memorabilia collected by our founder, Jennie Lee, from her compatriots in the business of tease. Jennie began the annual reunion of the performers from burlesque's heyday, and from those seeds our events and the collection grew. The annual Miss Exotic World Pageant was founded by the legendary Dixie Evans, as a way to draw new fans and performers to the museum. 


Above: Dixie Evans, ""The Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque"" in our original home.
The second
key point in our history was in the early 2000s, when a small group of volunteers,
representing the next generation of burlesque enthusiasts from around the
world, took on the challenge of preserving this one-of-a-kind collection of
costumes, props, photos, ephemera and more and of making it an organized, permanent and official not-for-profit institution dedicated to celebrating and preserving an often-overlooked
area of entertainment history. This is the era when we became the Burlesque Hall of Fame, moved the collection to Las Vegas and our primary fundraiser, the
annual Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender, became the four-day showcase it is
today. Held every year on the first weekend in June in Las Vegas, the BHoF Weekender is attended by thousands of fans and contemporary burlesque performers,
with nightly performances, vendors, classes, panel discussions and
parties—and of course, the reunion of the elder stars of yesteryear.  

Our 2013 exhibition ""Not-So-Hidden Histories: Performers of Color in Burlesque.""

And
now, we’ve reached a third pivotal point, when the Burlesque Hall of Fame, the museum itself, can begin to match the international
stature of its main event, and become a true destination for fans, tourists and
scholars alike! 

The Burlesque Hall of Fame is
currently housed in a small storefront space of only 220 square feet, inadequate to properly exhibit and store our
growing collection and support our growing audience.
Our new home in Las Vegas’s art district will include:



3,000 square feet of exhibition and
program space (which will provide room for rotating exhibitions on a variety of
themes featuring the more 3,500 artifacts
in our collection (including costumes, props, photos, posters, written material
and much more)

Spaces specifically
for programs such as performances, readings, classes and events, as well as offices,
a retail gift shop, and space to store, catalogue and preserve our unique
collection 

So, how can you help?
The
build-out and preparation of our new home comes with some very real costs, and
we remain a small, grassroots not-for-profit organization. 
We need your help to raise at least $50,000 to open our new doors. Costs include:

The architectural design of our new interior spaces
Professional wall construction for 150 linear feet of display walls (nearly 3 times what we have now!)
Flooring installation, including for a professional-quality performance, teaching and event space
Museum-quality lighting installation
New signage both inside the space and outside on our new building
Display cases, shelving, and other installation supplies
Building and installation of safe, professional storage and work space where our collection can be preserved, catalogued and accessed by scholars and fans 

There's a lot to be done, but with friends like you, we know that we can achieve it!

I'm Jayme -<span style=""background-color: initial;""> fiber artist, female entrepreneur and alpaca farm manager for Sage Hill Farms Alpacas where we have 50 wonderful alpacas &amp; lots of raw alpaca fiber begging to made into something fabulous for someone to wear. I create nuno felted or cobweb scarves and wraps or as I like to call them ""Wearable Art"". I love designing and creating scarves and wraps.  I love the tactile feel of the fiber in my hands, dyeing it in fantastic colors and shaping it into a luxurious scarf for someone to wear.  I've also decided to add a line of felted embellished arm cuffs and book/ipad covers. </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Currently I lack the ideal tools to take my scarf making from a hobby to a business. The process of dyeing, carding and felting is much longer because I'm working with tiny carders, small crock pots for dyeing in small batches and can only work on one scarf at a time. It's not a very efficient process because of the lack of the correct tools.  I love the process from start to finish but I want to make this work as a business rather than a sideline or hobby.  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</div><div><br/></div><div>My purpose for this campaign is to raise funds to buy equipment that will make the process or making scarves more efficient and there allow me time to produce more scarfs to sell making this a viable business. </div><div>Two examples of how specific equipment would speed up the process:  a drum carder can card large amounts of fiber at one time versus using the small hand carders I am now, which take a long time to card enough fleece for a scarf.  The second example is  an electric EZ Roller Felting Machine, which would allow me to be felting one scarf while I was laying out the design for the next,  Both of these items would speed up production time significantly. The campaign funds would allow me to purchase these items, as well as the other items specifically detailed below,  materials such as dyes, blending fibers and fabric necessary for creating my ""Wearable Art""</div><div><br/></div><div>There are hundreds of pounds of alpaca fiber languishing around here waiting to be made into wearable art or anything you or I can imagine.  I just need a helping hand to start making good use of all that fiber and showing people the luxurious warmth and softness of alpaca fiber.  </div><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Let me tell you a little more about me. I started learning about fiber and fiber art when we purchased our first alpacas 8 years ago. Since then I have discovered a passion for fiber and color that I use to create various kinds of fiber art - scarves, shawls, wraps, Christmas stockings and needle felted creatures. </span></div><div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My focus right now is on wearable art - scarves &amp; wraps, which I love, but I'm flexible and I like to play around with different ideas all the time. <br/><br/>Fiber art is a labor of love and artistic expression. Every piece is made by passionate hands with love and hope that it will bring pleasure to the wearer. Wearable art is unique, whimsical and tactile – brightening the soul and comforting with a touch. <br/><br/>Every scarf I create is infused with a piece of me. Each piece is a reflection of my love of my alpacas, the fiber and my hope that the wearer enjoys it as much as I enjoyed the process of making it. Each piece tells a story. </span>
</div><div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Please take a look at my  <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/AlpacaWhimsy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Etsy shop: <u>Alpaca Whimsy</u> </a>to see examples of some of scarves and other items I've made.   I also have a Facebook page called:  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AlpacaWhimsy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/AlpacaWhimsy</a>. You can also find me on Twitter at @sagehillfarms.<br/><br/>We currently have 50 alpacas who graciously let me utilize their fiber for my ""play"". Their fiber is a sustainable resource as they grow new fiber every year.  They are wonderful creatures and it gives me real joy to use fiber from animals I love to create art for others to enjoy. Check out the awesome creatures who make this luxurious fiber on my website  <a href=""www.shfpacas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sage Hill Farms Alpacas</a> or on Facebook at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sage-Hill-Farms-Alpacas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sage-Hill-Farms-Alpacas</a>. </span>

<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It would mean the world to me if you would support my ambition of making my love of creating ""Wearable Art"" into a real business by making it work efficiently with the correct tools.  I love working with my alpaca's fiber and I love the enjoyment people get from my creations. </span></p></span>

</div></div>","Hi. I'm Jayme - fiber artist, female entrepreneur and alpaca farm manager for Sage Hill Farms Alpacas where we have 50 wonderful alpacas & lots of raw alpaca fiber begging to made into something fabulous for someone to wear. I create nuno felted or cobweb scarves and wraps or as I like to call them ""Wearable Art"". I love designing and creating scarves and wraps.  I love the tactile feel of the fiber in my hands, dyeing it in fantastic colors and shaping it into a luxurious scarf for someone to wear.  I've also decided to add a line of felted embellished arm cuffs and book/ipad covers. 

Currently I lack the ideal tools to take my scarf making from a hobby to a business. The process of dyeing, carding and felting is much longer because I'm working with tiny carders, small crock pots for dyeing in small batches and can only work on one scarf at a time. It's not a very efficient process because of the lack of the correct tools.  I love the process from start to finish but I want to make this work as a business rather than a sideline or hobby.    
My purpose for this campaign is to raise funds to buy equipment that will make the process or making scarves more efficient and there allow me time to produce more scarfs to sell making this a viable business. Two examples of how specific equipment would speed up the process:  a drum carder can card large amounts of fiber at one time versus using the small hand carders I am now, which take a long time to card enough fleece for a scarf.  The second example is  an electric EZ Roller Felting Machine, which would allow me to be felting one scarf while I was laying out the design for the next,  Both of these items would speed up production time significantly. The campaign funds would allow me to purchase these items, as well as the other items specifically detailed below,  materials such as dyes, blending fibers and fabric necessary for creating my ""Wearable Art""There are hundreds of pounds of alpaca fiber languishing around here waiting to be made into wearable art or anything you or I can imagine.  I just need a helping hand to start making good use of all that fiber and showing people the luxurious warmth and softness of alpaca fiber.  Let me tell you a little more about me. I started learning about fiber and fiber art when we purchased our first alpacas 8 years ago. Since then I have discovered a passion for fiber and color that I use to create various kinds of fiber art - scarves, shawls, wraps, Christmas stockings and needle felted creatures. 
My focus right now is on wearable art - scarves & wraps, which I love, but I'm flexible and I like to play around with different ideas all the time. Fiber art is a labor of love and artistic expression. Every piece is made by passionate hands with love and hope that it will bring pleasure to the wearer. Wearable art is unique, whimsical and tactile – brightening the soul and comforting with a touch. Every scarf I create is infused with a piece of me. Each piece is a reflection of my love of my alpacas, the fiber and my hope that the wearer enjoys it as much as I enjoyed the process of making it. Each piece tells a story. 

Please take a look at my  Etsy shop: Alpaca Whimsy to see examples of some of scarves and other items I've made.   I also have a Facebook page called:  https://www.facebook.com/AlpacaWhimsy. You can also find me on Twitter at @sagehillfarms.We currently have 50 alpacas who graciously let me utilize their fiber for my ""play"". Their fiber is a sustainable resource as they grow new fiber every year.  They are wonderful creatures and it gives me real joy to use fiber from animals I love to create art for others to enjoy. Check out the awesome creatures who make this luxurious fiber on my website  Sage Hill Farms Alpacas or on Facebook at Sage-Hill-Farms-Alpacas. 

It would mean the world to me if you would support my ambition of making my love of creating ""Wearable Art"" into a real business by making it work efficiently with the correct tools.  I love working with my alpaca's fiber and I love the enjoyment people get from my creations.

I will then use those in a solo show in the Fall of 2016 and after that they go home to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I have been shooting landscapes for more than 30 years and have recently hit on a new approach that I am very excited about - a new way of conveying what I find out in nature. What makes these images unique is also what requires them to be printed and mounted in such a specific way and this is what has given rise to this campaign.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Deal</h3> <p>I am pre-selling 8 of these light boxes for the cost of producing the pieces and mounting the show - this will be one half of the cost of that same image once it is hanging on the wall. Each image will be sold as an edition of 8 with a tiered pricing system meaning as we move through the edition ( 1/8, 2/8, 3/8 ) the price goes up as well. Starting price for the 2/8 photos will be $3600 so you have this opportunity to get them at a great deal.<br/></p>
<p>The images are printed on transparency using a <a href=""http://abcphoto.com/digital/lightjet-printing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light Jet</a> printer and are mounted in light boxes that are roughly 4 feet wide and 2 feet high. The frames are hand made by Neil Wilkinson out of beautiful, tight-grain Fir.</p>
<p>I have posted the set of 12 images above, <a href=""http://www.mikebernard.ca/new-landscape-index/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you can also look at them on my website</a> and <a href=""http://www.headwatersdesign.com/NewLandscape_PreviewImages.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you can also download them here.</a> Have a look through them, it will be your selections that decide which 8 images will be in the show. </p>
<p>*Note - There will be some additional re-touching on the final prints, nothing drastic, just minor tweaks.</p>
<p>For shipping, if you are in Vancouver that's easy - you can pick up your piece after the show. If you are further out, contact me and we can price out shipping based on where you are. Note that shipping costs will your responsibility above and beyond the price of the work.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Having your support at this stage is crucial - I wouldn't be able to mount a show of this quality and scale without the pre-sales. Having my own show will also allow me to attract attention, forge new relationships with galleries, and let me start working on more of these landscapes as well as the other projects that I have in the works.</p>
<p><br/></p>

We - Nadia and Mai - are two curators who have been working on ‘Chapter 31’ for over a year, in both the UK and Palestine. The project means everything to us. We are very excited to have secured the bulk of our funding but we still need to raise some money for the show to be able to go ahead this year. This is where YOU come in...Our vision We are aiming to raise £5000
This will go towards promoting Palestinian art and artists in the UK, something we think is of great importance.

If we smash our goal, The
Attic Arts Centre has pledged to host a FREE weekly community clay workshop,
not just to thank everyone for their support and donations, but to give back to
you, the community. 
***We’re only £540 short!***
We need 108 donations

 Hello,
My name is Donna. I'm a deaf artist. I've been working with children and
schools, running art clubs and projects for the past 8 years and I love it! In
March this year I launched an independent Art Centre called, The Attic Arts
Centre & Studio.




Top requests from children are:

Can we make with clay? Can we fire the clay? Can we glaze the clay?
But we don't have a kiln of our own!
The kiln is a critical tool, and an enormous investment and commitment. I have the space and my Saturday and School clubs are popular. This term a total of 83 children between the ages of 5 - 12 are attending my classes, each week. In August I ran a series of Kids Art Fun Clubs and drop in Family Creative Hangout events and had close to 200 visits in the studio!


Making with clay was our most popular activity this summer and we're lucky to have access a kiln on a short term basis for small firings. 
We want to continue in January and so we're fundraising for our very own kiln! Can you help us? 
We Really Want A Kiln Campaign 



 
   What We Need & What You Get

We need
£1,500 to purchase a small electric kiln with shelves and props needed to
stack a range of ceramics including hand built ceramics, painted plates and
mugs. If we exceed our target, I can buy pottery stock to get our pottery
painting classes running, bags of clay, glazes and a potters wheel.
*Approximately
10% of our total raised will go back into Indiegogo to cover Credit Card
Fees and is included in the goal amount.
In exchange for your donation,
we will make sure you get something for your money! We have ceramic hearts made

If we don't
raise all the funds here, we will keep fundraising till be get all the money
needed! We've started raising money already and we have £400 so far!


The Impact
By donating you will be helping to create an environment where people can come to the studio for a class or to drop in and create with love and work with their hands. 


With a small electric kiln, myself and guest tutors would be able to run workshops in the studio and visit schools, nurseries and community groups on outreach projects and introducing children & young people to clay  

A kiln on site would enable the studio facilitate pottery parties and ceramic workshops which would go along way to covering the costs of the studio lease and making other workshops and art clubs cheaper.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>                      I'm staci b - also known as The Haiku Ninja - a literary and visual artist.                                </strong></i><i><strong>My mission is to connect people to each other, themselves and their environment and I love doing this through Haiku.</strong></i></p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p> I've been writing and sharing the joy of Haiku for twenty years. My adventure with this ancient Japanese art form - a three-line poem with a 5/7/5 syllable structure - reaches new heights with this project! </p>
<p>Over the years, I've written more than a thousand of these poetic nuggets and they've been read in super cool places, like on Rick Steves Europe and in an Orange County Museum of Art project. For over a decade, I've created art using Haiku that has been seen on numerous platforms.  </p>
<h3>Current Story</h3>
<p>When the COVID shutdown occurred, I began hosting Haiku Happiness parties on Zoom. Every week, people gathered and spent the first half hour pouring their hearts out about the challenges of navigating the enormous change thrust upon us. Notes were jotted in chat and these words served as a jumping off point to write a collaborative multi-stanza Haiku called a Ku-Ren. But there's a twist!</p>
<p>Instead of everyone writing their own Haiku, I asked for a five-syllable line and wrote down what was offered. Then seven. Then five. Before you knew it, we had ten to twelve Haiku, each written by three different people, representing a cross section of unique experiences about this universal challenge.  </p>
<p>We did this for twelve weeks! At the end of three months, I had over 120 Haiku written by people of all ages, genders, skin colors, and economic backgrounds. Some were figuring out how to work from home, while others had lost their jobs; some lived alone and others were quarantined with roommates or family; there were those who had kids and were navigating home schooling and some who helped take care of others. </p>
<p>Although our individual experiences were different, the Haiku proved we shared a lot of the same challenges, thoughts and emotions.</p>
<h3>Concurrent Story</h3>
<p>Each week, after we created the Haiku about the pandemic, we drew inspiration from a piece of art (always with the artist's permission) and then shared our observations. Using those as a starting point, we then developed a Ku-Ren in the same way we did for the shutdown. I then took the original art and the Haiku and designed a new piece of collaborative art! Below is an example of what we created (and what you could do if you get your own private Haiku Happiness Party).  Keep in mind that each Haiku has three authors!

<h3>Now What?</h3>
<p>I knew we had produced something special! It was exciting to share the art Ku-Ren with the artist and across social media. But what could I do with the Haiku about the shutdown? I was at a loss. Then a friend sent me a notice about Corona Crafted, a visual and digital art show in Dormont, PA (right outside Pittsburgh) specifically for work created during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Within a week, an idea showed up for an interactive exhibit that would connect the people who saw the work with those who created it, and anchor the understanding that although we may have different specifics to our experiences, many of our emotions and thoughts are the same. </p>
<p>I've met with the folks at Flowercity Print Makers, a home grown-locally owned shop, and together we've taken my idea for <i><strong>Welcome to the Future: Interactive Haiku Art - Part One </strong></i>into the production phase.  Because of time constraints, I've chosen to do the first four weeks of what we created and develop the remaining eight weeks later for a larger exhibition.</p>
<p>Your support means that the collaborative work of twenty people will be shared with the world, connecting all of us through art! How cool is that?!</p>
<h3>Why It's Important</h3>
<p>Sharing this project with the world reinforces that we are not alone in how we think and feel about what will likely be the biggest global challenge of our lifetime. It reminds us of our resiliency, to be kind, laugh and smile - even if it is from behind a mask. </p>
<p>It nudges us not to ignore the fact that we all struggle and that most of us are doing our best, even if it doesn't look like it sometimes.  Most importantly, it connects us to each other through our humanity - flaws, desires and all.  The best way to understand the universality of a situation is through the specificity and this project accomplishes that.</p>
<h3>So You Know...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>$350 of the total campaign goes to print and production of the four pieces to be exhibited at the Dormont Corona Crafted Visual and Digital Art Show running August 21-September 20, 2020 at businesses along Liberty and Potomac Avenues in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>I have budgeted $25 per hour for labor. </p>
<p>The balance is allocated for framing , hanging the show, Indiegogo fees and time/materials for the perks.</p>
<p>Anything raised over the goal will be put towards the print, production and time needed to create the other eight weeks of  <i><strong>Welcome to the Future: Interactive Haiku Art.</strong></i></p>
<p>If the goal is not met, I will use what is raised to produce as many of the four pieces as financially possible with the priority being print and production.</p>
<h3>PERKS?! Have we got PERKS!!</h3>
<p>From a simple social media shout out to hosting your own private Haiku Happiness Party, there is something for everyone! Check out the details on the page and find the one that fits you best.</p>

<p>There's always a small risk that production could get derailed for one reason or another. The good news is the show runs for an entire month, so I'm confident we'll get these four panels hung during the run!</p>

There aren't any guarantees about gathering the financial support, but I'm determined to exhibit as many of the four panels as I can to get started.
As with any project, you can't know what you don't know. What I do know is that I am resourceful and a hardcore networker with a lot connections and believe without a doubt I have what I need to overcome any challenge that might pop up.Who Is Involved?The Haiku Collective is comprised of the following intrepid souls who showed up week after week to create this amazing work!Tina AndrewsDenise BaileyKat BelskeyEric DavidsonAnneLouise FeenyPete FernbaughTaylor MeszarosMary RandolphThe following contributed their thoughts and feelings over the four-month period:Evelyn CastilloBob CreoRossilyne CulganKathleen DonnellyEd GerstenhaberBethany FernbaughLibby KavoulakisMandy MinorLouise SchulhoffKay ShapiroMartha TerryDeb WetzlerOther Ways You Can HelpI know things are challenging for some, so if a contribution isn't possible, please share this campaign with your friends, neighbors, family... basically anyone you encounter!    ​",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Fifty years from now, when your children look back at the childhood photographs, will you be in them?  
Do you shy away from the camera because you don't think you are (pick any of the following) skinny enough, pretty enough, hair isn't done, makeup isn't on, clothes aren't good enough and on and on and on?
Will your children see how much you loved them?

I want to change the conversation.  Stop comparing yourself to other Moms.  We all want the same thing.  We want our children to know we are doing our best, and that we love them more than anything.  I want to publish a book that combines images of Mother/Child connection side by side with stories from real Moms about their joys and worries in Motherhood.  
    It's a big big deal.  I realize that this is a big dream, with hefty goals.  I whole heartedly believe in the message of this project.  This needs to be seen.  I can't do this alone.  The Mom Project began in 2013 and I have been committed to photographing Moms and their children ever since. I plan on expanding my portfolio to include Moms of all kinds.  There will truly be something that every Mom can relate to.

<p>Thank you, Please Come Again Sponsorship Campaign for Jan Johnson</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you, Please Come Again is the title for my project and is based on a little red bag from Greece, with particular thread found inside. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Jan Johnson and thank you for tuning in to hear about my Indiegogo funding campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support will help me go to work with these lace-making women in Greece and make a performance with them on the island of Aegina over the course of 3 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This past year I was a Fulbright Scholar in the United Kingdom and lived in the city of Dundee, Scotland.  My research is in historic needlework and textiles, material and women’s studies and contemporary art practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a Fulbright, I traveled with the students and folks that I work with at the university, to Greece for a field study trip and collaborative project. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There, it was my privilege to join with women’s Kopaneli lace-making groups and artists for an evening on Aegina.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During our meeting, they made lace and told stories about how they had come to know this skill.   I told my stories and stitched each willing person there to the next and to the next with thread and felt a part of bringing them together for the first time. So from this, I’d like to join with them again in September.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very soon, an exhibition is taking place from the wide array of artists that I came with from Scotland and those that we collaborated with in Greece.   A new space has been renovated for this international exhibition.   I have new work to be installed, and along with this, I have an invitation to return and collaborate with them for a 3-day performance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Talking with the women, documenting, and listening to the bobbins making their distinctive kopaneli sound, I was able to take in some of the materials and tools, but not the skilled techniques. I did meet many of them and exchanged contact information. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is not only my personal research interest, but also my desire to contribute to the community and indirectly the financial situation of these women by encouraging and promoting expertise in this art form.  Your contribution to this research bridges cultural exchange and keeps these traditional forms alive and moving forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the upcoming show, I’ve made my own cushion and bobbins. “Oscillation”—the title for the exhibition – is a moving back and forth of ideas, techniques and materials between people and place. What will we make?  We will make a beginning in lace, taken from a drawing, theirs and mine to make something new and contemporary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you will consider the contribution of artists in the fabric of life and lend your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $2300 for 6 days of travel and daily expenses, materials and project funds and technical support. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can you help?  You can help get the word out to interested folks.  Also, I have some unique perks to consider, and many reflect my research and experiences as an American in Aegina and Scotland.</p>
<p>As a featured perk, a $100 contribution will bring a 4-color silkscreen print, 22 x 30 inches, delivered to your door.</p>
<p>For $20, you will receive a personalized hand-written digital print thank you note with a postcard print of my work.</p>
<p>For support with $50,  you will receive a Thank you digital print, OR a jar of homemade lemon honey marmalade with a Scotch whiskey kick. </p>
<p>A hand-printed etching of the Thank you bag from Aegina will be delivered to you with support of $75. </p>
<p>Have a ready-to-hang 4-color silkscreen for your wall with a contribution of $250.</p>
<p>In your venue, I will gladly share my research and experience from Aegina and as a Fulbright scholar in Scotland during an afternoon or evening presentation for your group with the help of $350 towards my campaign.</p>
<p>A uniquely hand-painted 4-colour silkscreen is framed and YOURS, delivered to your door and ready for your wall with a $400 contribution.</p>
<p>With a $650 support, your group or organization can enjoy a workshop and presentation in your venue, where I will demonstrate with authentic materials and share my travel and research experiences as a Fulbright Scholar in Greece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank You for your time and your support.  And Please Come Again to check out further details and spread the word. </p>

<h3>Our Goal </h3>
<p>At the moment BEING is based in an old converted classroom in the Bronson Center. We have been in this beautiful community space for 13 years and have created and grown a lot in that time. We’ve made thousands of drawings and paintings and every cabinet, drawer and surface of our space is packed with art. We are ready to update our studio and get our work out of this room and into the world!</p>
<p>We have built an enormous amount of creative energy and experience over the years and are determined to take things to the next level. We are eager to create and collaborate on an ambitious scale. However we need your help! The $12,000 we are working to raise will help us become a vibrant presence in the arts community locally and beyond. Your donations will work to support a studio that allows us to create the kind of innovative, dynamic work we want to make. Supporting BEING studio will make this dream a possibility and will help shape an inclusive creative community that is open and accessible to all.  </p>

<h3>Our Projects</h3>
<p><strong>Operations/Materials</strong>:</p>
<p>Our artists have been working with the same student-quality paint and canvases for over a decade. We would like to invest in new materials so our artists have the opportunity to individualize their work not only through approach but through material choices. We also currently rely on a single older model computer - an updated computer and equipment such as a scanner, a high volume printer and programs such as indesign and photoshop would allow us to invest in our brand and develop our digital and online presence. Your donations will be able to help us in so many different ways!</p>

<p><strong>The Studio:</strong></p>
<p>Our studio is overflowing with work.  Alterations to the layout of the room would provide artists with the opportunity to work in privacy and experiment with larger canvases. A new paint job and hanging system and better storage facilities will help the studio present as professional and protect artists work from damage.</p>
<p><strong>Applications and Grants:</strong></p>
<p>Your donations will help us allocate the necessary resources to ensure that we can apply to funding sources and grants. In the past we have not had the resources to work on this. We believe an investment in this important area will be returned tenfold.</p>
<p><strong>Shows and Exhibitions:</strong></p>
<p>Our artists deserve to be showcased! Whether it be the participation in or hosting of art shows, or in partnering with respected art galleries, your donations will be used to help our artists exhibit their work and support them in bringing their creations to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Guest Artists and Workshops:</strong></p>
<p>Bringing guest artists into the studio provides our members with the opportunity to work in new ways and consider their work from an alternative perspective. It also creates connections with the arts community and paves the way for lasting relationships between BEING studio artists and other local creatives.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527529447/gnfh2lnsstqx0b6nrp5j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If you could even skip your large coffee tomorrow and donate $5, anything is appreciated. If you do donate $20 or more, there are some perks :)</p>
<p>**You can also just donate whatever amount you'd like, minimum is not $20**</p>

If you could even skip your large coffee tomorrow and donate $5, anything is appreciated. If you do donate $20 or more, there are some perks :)
**You can also just donate whatever amount you'd like, minimum is not $20**
    The Impact Ad Hoc is an important piece of the Los Angeles fashion industry because it is trying to be nicer to its tenants(designers) we don't want those who have amazing talent to be hidden. We want to make an event that will get those people where they deserve to be!
    Risks & Challenges So far we have just faced the struggle of rates on venues we need to involve more people, not only as viewers, but for the team of Ad Hoc! We are continuing to grow, and your contribution will help just that. 
    Other Ways You Can Help If you would rather have your coffee, or simply can't contribute in that way, please help us spread the word so we can get this moving! We also would love to see your faces there! So share this with friends and save the date! (Once we have a date)

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IO&amp;U</strong> is a group of contemporary jewellery and gemstone artists and recent graduates from the University of Trier in Idar-Oberstein, Germany. We are 12 female emerging artists from 9 different countries from all over the world (Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Latvia, Slovakia, United States of America, Taiwan, Iran, and South Africa). While we come from different cultures, we have formed a strong connection in Idar-Oberstein as artists and friends. While our work differs visually and conceptually, we each push the boundaries of contemporary jewellery with our handmade and unique pieces.</p>
<p>Our work relates to experimental, jewellery-body concepts which focus on the choice of materials in relation to handcraft approaches. With patience, passion, and excitement for these experimental challenges, we move our artistic research forward. Having finishing our studies in 2020, our next step is to share our work with the public.</p>
<p>As artists we believe our work is not just contemporary jewellery, it is an expression of the hidden places within ourselves that we all seek to discover. There is a cycle, initiated by the maker to the object, to the wearer through materials and ideas, involving and connecting different people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>As emerging artists and recent graduates of contemporary jewellery and gemstones at the University of Trier in Idar-Oberstein, Geramany, the heart of the gemstone trade in Europe, rich in history for cutting and mining gemstones, we have finished either our Bachelors or Master’s of Fine Arts degrees. We would like to exhibit our graduation work during Munich Jewellery Week, the largest and most famous contemporary jewellery event in the world. We ask for your support to allow us to travel from Idar-Oberstein, Germany and build a special exhibition with displays that we are making ourselves.

<p>We would like to take part during this important event in Germany to represent ourselves and to propose a direct discussion with a wide audience about the contemporary jewellery scene and offer an open discussion about it with the public. The next step transitioning from student to professional is an important, yet difficult one to make alone.

<p style=""font-family: UICTFontTextStyleTallBody;font-size: 17px;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15pt;"">My name is Katalin Pazmandi, I am an installation / performance artist.  The Healers Art Team and I are building a glow in the dark installation at Burning Man  2016. We are well on our way but we are still in need of additional funding.</p>
<p style=""font-family: UICTFontTextStyleTallBody;font-size: 17px;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15pt;"">This interactive installation is a 25' portal to other dimensions, a gate to other worlds.  It is being created with 80% of recycled materials! Participants will be able to experience daytime at night and nighttime during the day.  This will give a sense of each light state being unified, blending dualism and giving those who experience the piece the ability to see both of these states overlapping each other at the same time. This will stimulate the feeling of oneness with the universe. A oneness with the earth and everyone and everything all around them. This is the perfect state to learn compassion and love.</p>

<br/> 
<p style=""font-family: UICTFontTextStyleTallBody;font-size: 17px;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15pt;"">There are some interactive elements: you can paint your own designs on the wrapped around black wind breaker with glow in the dark paint! It can only happen if we receive enough funding, so it all depends on YOU who will come to the Playa this year! The portal experience can be individual or communal. At daytime, you will experience the sun beams playing with the piece and at night you will be able to experience the glow. The wings will feature the northern star constellations. There will be a shamanistic drum ceremony once a day in the portal that you can also participate in.</p>

<div>Lumenoctis is a low budget art project that is mainly made out of recycled materials, built in a backyard and tried out in a driveway of a small house in Upstate New York. Please support us, we really need your help!</div>
<p style=""font-family: UICTFontTextStyleTallBody;font-size: 17px;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15pt;"">The installation is 25' in diameter, 10' high, using wood, steel, ropes and canvas with intricate psychedelic patterns that glow. The themes of the canvas will be constellations and phosphorescent sunbeam effects. Each will have unique visual aspects that  exhibit different lighting traits through out the day and night.</p>
<p style=""font-family: UICTFontTextStyleTallBody;font-size: 17px;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15pt;"">Please help this project become a reality!</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
My name is Katalin Pazmandi, I am an installation / performance artist.  The Healers Art Team and I are building a glow in the dark installation at Burning Man  2016. We are well on our way but we are still in need of additional funding.
This interactive installation is a 25' portal to other dimensions, a gate to other worlds.  It is being created with 80% of recycled materials! Participants will be able to experience daytime at night and nighttime during the day.  This will give a sense of each light state being unified, blending dualism and giving those who experience the piece the ability to see both of these states overlapping each other at the same time. This will stimulate the feeling of oneness with the universe. A oneness with the earth and everyone and everything all around them. This is the perfect state to learn compassion and love.

Glow in the dark design on the wings...
 
There are some interactive elements: you can paint your own designs on the wrapped around black wind breaker with glow in the dark paint! It can only happen if we receive enough funding, so it all depends on YOU who will come to the Playa this year! The portal experience can be individual or communal. At daytime, you will experience the sun beams playing with the piece and at night you will be able to experience the glow. The wings will feature the northern star constellations. There will be a shamanistic drum ceremony once a day in the portal that you can also participate in.



Lumenoctis is a low budget art project that is mainly made out of recycled materials, built in a backyard and tried out in a driveway of a small house in Upstate New York. Please support us, we really need your help!
The installation is 25' in diameter, 10' high, using wood, steel, ropes and canvas with intricate psychedelic patterns that glow. The themes of the canvas will be constellations and phosphorescent sunbeam effects. Each will have unique visual aspects that  exhibit different lighting traits through out the day and night.
Please help this project become a reality!




Plan version 3...
What We Need…
The work is ongoing, but to be able to finish and make it happen, we need to:
1. Buy more materials, including wood, fabric, stakes, guy wires, paint, solar generator and miscellaneous supplies that still needed. ~ $3500
and
2. Get a trailer to bring it down from New York to Nevada. ~ $1500



If you support this project you can receive handmade glow in the dark necklace, original glow in the dark artwork, or credit in our promotional materials at Burning Man among other things. Check our perks and see the gallery for samples.
