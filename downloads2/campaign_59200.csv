<p style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your donations will help subsidize 200 wheelchairs for kids who cannot afford them! <strong>Find out more at <a href=""http://www.arsobo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.arsobo.org</a>.</strong></strong></p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>To give the gift of mobility to children and young adults with birth defects or permanent injuries who need a special wheelchair to do the things others can do.</p>
<p>Non-mobile children are too often stuck at home unable to get to school or to play with their friends. No child deserves to be confined to their home. A wheelchair for a child who is unable to walk allows for an escape and an entrance to a child’s world.</p>
<p>Non-mobile young adults are trapped in an unnatural life at home with little chance to get out. They want to find work and to become a part of society and contribute.</p>
<p>However a conventional wheelchair is not the answer when the walkways are rough, the sidewalks uneven and filled with holes</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>RoughRider</strong>, a specially designed all-terrain wheelchair. Rough surfaces, grates in the road, roots and rocks in the ‘off road’, sandy or wet soil are no match for the RoughRider. It goes where no other wheelchair goes. The All-Terrain Wheelchair Shop (Sillas de Ruedas Todo Terreno) in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico is a not-for-profit shop that employs wheelchair users to build wheelchairs from scratch. Some chairs are a standard model and others are customized to fit the specific needs of each special rider.</p>
<p>We are asking for donations to subsidize the materials and labor to construct these chairs for children and adults in need. Even though the chairs are sold at cost and the price is low, many families cannot afford the full price but each family will be asked to pay something to establish pride of ownership</p>
<p>Our goal is $50,000 by December 31, 2012.</p>
<ul>
<li>All donated money goes directly to subsidize the purchase of the chair and enables families to obtain a chair for the person in their lives who is in great need and wants to become more active and engaged.</li>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Ted ""Tetris"" Morgan has been in the entertainment industry for nearly 15 years, touring the country with multiple large acts and taking the world on by storm.  He has a passion to work in the entertainment industry rivaled by few and loves every moment.  He has spent his years traveling and not only working behind the scenes but also giving to the people he works with.  Many people that know Ted will do anything he can for anyone that has a need.  Now he needs your help!</p>
<p>  On October 15th, Ted was diagnosed with Stage 2 Non-Hodgekins Burkitt's Lymphoma as a result from a trip to the hospital for what he thought was his Crohns disease flare-up.  Shortly thereafter in a follow-up visit, he was advanced to Stage 3 and given less than 6 months to beat this.  Being a freelance guy, Ted of course doesn't have health insurance, and as result has limited treatment options.  Florida Hospital and Johnson &amp; Johnson have taken on his initial case, but are only able to offer the basic treatments in the program.  With these treatments, Ted will have a little time left to bring his sarcastic and asshole self to the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Need &amp; Goal</h3>
<p> There is hope though, Pfizer has offered Ted a program with one of their drugs that has a proven track record and an 80% remission rate for patients with Lymphoma.  Unfortunately to get in the program, Phizer needs a down payment of $5000.  After Ted is in the program, they will work on the continued payments.  This campaign is to raise the money to get Ted into the program as well as help cover his living expenses during his treatment schedule.  We are hoping that we will exceed our goal which will only cover his medical expenses so that Ted has the money to live in Orlando where his treatments are.  We are hoping to reach out to the people Ted has worked with and impacted over the years and ask for your help to keep Teds smiling face around.  Your contribution, be it even a dollar, will help go to getting Ted the treatment he needs and the support you show will help him take on this treatment. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Schedule</h3>
<p> Ted has already begun his chemo treatment, by both oral and infusion treatments.  He has insisted on doing a one last hoorah tour with the band Epica this month but beginning the first week of December, his life will change.  He will begin infusions 3 times a week in order to keep the cancer under control.  Depending on this campaign, Ted is hoping to be able to start the next set of treatments beginning mid-December.  During the treatments, Ted will be unable to travel but has insisted on trying to be independant and will continue to try and freelance depending on his ability.  According to the doctors, he will be very tired all the time and have limited mobility.  He will need not only the financial support, but emotional as well.  Please feel free to contact him via Facebook and even if you can't give anything, a positive note to him will mean a lot!</p>
<p>With your help, lets help get Ted the treatment it needs and help relieve the stress of finances and working while he undergoes treatment.  With your contribution, either financially or emotionally, we can help Ted beat this thing that the doctors have given him grim outlook on!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are in a band or have access to a band, we are looking for small merch items (such as CD's or T-shirts) or larger items (such as autographed items) that you would be willing to donate, we are using the items as ""Perks"" for people as Ted refused to take any financial help unless he was able to give something back to the people.  Please email <a href=""mailto:%20bmoorefl@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BmooreFL@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3>No matter the diagnosis there is ALWAYS hope ! Campaign.</h3>
<p>My name is Tanessa Tilsley, I am 21 years old. My Dad, Rodney Tilsley was born April 6 1964.</p>
<p>My dad had been having stomach issues for quite awhile, he thought it was just simply due too stress, but he went into the doctors regularly to find out what was going on, they kept telling him he just had stomach ulcers, and to take these new medications and he would be fine in about two weeks. well the medicine never worked and he always went back, and they kept changing his meds hoping something would work.</p>
<p>Eventually a doctor suggested a blood test just too check and make sure everything was ok. Shortly after on June 14th (three days after my 20th birthday) my dad got the call that he had stage four pancreatic cancer, and the chances of him living more than a year were about 5%. My dad stayed extreamly optomistic and kept staying strong. He had just fallen in love with this women named Andrea who changed his life completly and couldnt imagine leaving her, as well as I just had my second baby, so there was alot going on for him too be quite happy about.</p>
<p>August he married the love of his life, in his back yard, it was beautiful, and his wish of making Andrea a Tilsley was acomplished. </p>
<p>In September, he was hospitalized for ten days due too catching pnemonea in Victoria on their honeymoon. The doctors didn't think there was any chances of improvment so they sent him home. </p>
<p>October 5th 2011 the home nurse came too the house where he was now being taken care of, and said she didnt think he was going to live more than a few hours. October 7th 2011 I headed down too Victoria to get married, we had planned it so he could be there, because to both me and my dad the most important thing to either of us was for him too be there, sadly he couldnt be but i know he was in spirit. October 8th i came home, went to his house sat beside his bed and told him about the wedding. he smiled which he hadnt been responsive since wednesday, and then his body started too shut down. My dad waited for me too come home too say goodbye. </p>
<p>My dad was 47 years old when he passed away. October 8th was the day i lost my best friend. and would never get another chance to hug him and hear him say i love you. It's been extreamly hard to deal with. </p>
<p>But through pain comes hope, and comes strength. the things he taught me i had too hold onto so tightly. and with that, since he passed away just through my community i have been raising money through collecting bottles and was donating to ""relay for life"" i had raised $500+ along side my friend Janelle Vananrooy and step mom Andrea. My goal as you can see is too raise at least $1000 and donate it too pancreatic cancer canada. </p>
<p>My campaign is too raise money for hope. To raise money so one day a little girl doesnt have to say goodbye to her best friend like i had too. It's too raise money for a cause which hasnt had any improvments in funding in the last forty years. </p>
<p>If you donate you will be helping so that doctors might be able too find at least early symptoms of the disease. anything. Also all money thats donated a portion goes towards people in the comox valley and around canada who drive cancer patients and a loved one too the nearest hospital, for us, we live in courtenay and the closest one is a three hour drive too victoria, so thats 100 in gas just for my dad any time he had an appointment. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>What we need is any donations towards <a href=""http://www.pancreaticcancercanada.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pancreaticcancercanada.ca</a> </p>
<p>Also, if you dont want too donate here, but would like to donate, try having a purple party, invite people by donations and donate all the money too the sites donation page, or collect bottles in your town, or even just bring in your own bottles and send whatever money you can afford to do towards this site. </p>
<p>Those are the three ways i try and make a difference. </p>

Also all money thats donated a portion goes towards people in the comox valley and around canada who drive cancer patients and a loved one too the nearest hospital, for us, we live in courtenay and the closest one is a three hour drive too victoria, so thats 100 in gas just for my dad any time he had an appointment. 


What We Need
What we need is any donations towards www.pancreaticcancercanada.ca 
Also, if you dont want too donate here, but would like to donate, try having a purple party, invite people by donations and donate all the money too the sites donation page, or collect bottles in your town, or even just bring in your own bottles and send whatever money you can afford to do towards this site. 
Those are the three ways i try and make a difference.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is [rgp]?</h3>
<p>[rgp] stands for Reporting on Ghana's Presidency. The purpose of the news blog site will be to inform, educate and inspire all Africans on the top leadership job in Ghana.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How will it be different from other blogs and news sites?</h3>
<p>Reporting on Ghana's Presidency news site is going to take a multi-media/multi-platform approach where we feature recorded speech snippets and analytical, easy-to-comprehend articles that report the weekly activities of the President with professional pictures and weekly video updates. We will include informal elements by interviewing and featuring students and young professionals on each weekly update to share a role or responsibility or request for the office of the presidency. On a monthly basis, we will inquire lifestyle preferences from the The Castle, Osu like the literary and musical influences of whoever the sitting President is.</p>
<p><br/> We are confident that by soliciting ideas from citizens and sharing some of the roles and responsibilities of the office, a by-product will be that many students will aspire to be the next President with a better understandiong of the leadership traits and characteristics required to do so. The launch date for the [rgp] website <a href=""http://www.reportingghanapresidency.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.reportingghanapresidency.com</a> coinicides with the first round of presidential elections on December 7th, 2012.</p>
<h3>How will your support help [rgp]?</h3>
First off, a majority of what you raise will go towards the main news site, creating a modern, easy to use blogsite that works on different computer operating systems and mobile devices. The countdown for the site launch has begun and we're expecting to go live on December 7th, 2012. <a href=""http://www.reportingghanapresidency.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.reportingghanapresidency.com</a>

<strong>Equipment costs:</strong> A huge chunk of the money will go towards equipment upgrades. Quality video equipment is costly and we look to document interviews with students and professionals alike to maintain the interactive feel and intent of the site.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Travel &amp; staff costs:</strong> We will run a lean operation. As the lead, <a href=""http://about.me/emmanuelagamor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emmanuel A.

<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
In the midst of all the devisive political rhetoric, [rgp] will seek to highlight the leadership qualities that make a successful president in sub-Saharan Africa in a non-partisan unbiased way; and encourage students to identify and develop these characteristics. Reporting on Ghana's Presidency will be a refreshing take on Ghanaian &amp; African politics.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those who may not be able to contribute to the fundraiser we would greatly appreciate you sharing the link with people who may be interested in positive journalism that explores African politics.</p>
<p>Once the website is launched, we'd appreciate feedback, comments, questions &amp; concerns.</p>

<p>As most of us know, and for those of you who do not, Diane has been hit with mini series of bad situations.  Soon she has to be out of the house she has been living in due to unforeseen circumstances which is weighing heavy on her soul.  To top that off, she is now out of work due to a terrible fall she took during a skiing accident and shattered her right upper arm which has made it impossible for her to work as one of the most amazing hairstylists you'll ever know.</p>
<p>Diane has the heart and soul of the best friend, sister, daughter and mother you could ever know.  She is the kind of person who does so much for everyone else always out of the goodness of her heart.  Now she needs our help!  Since she will be out of work for at least a couple of months and soon to be homeless for herself and her 2 sons, we need to try to raise as much money as we can to help her pay medical bills, pay rent for her workplace and hopefully find new living accomodations. </p>
<p>Diane is the most loving, giving person I know and anything we can do to help give back would be a blessing.  Let's all help Diane get back the life she loves and deserves!</p>

As most of us know, and for those of you who do not, Diane has been hit with mini series of bad situations.  Soon she has to be out of the house she has been living in due to unforeseen circumstances which is weighing heavy on her soul.  To top that off, she is now out of work due to a terrible fall she took during a skiing accident and shattered her right upper arm which has made it impossible for her to work as one of the most amazing hairstylists you'll ever know.
Diane has the heart and soul of the best friend, sister, daughter and mother you could ever know.  She is the kind of person who does so much for everyone else always out of the goodness of her heart.  Now she needs our help!  Since she will be out of work for at least a couple of months and soon to be homeless for herself and her 2 sons, we need to try to raise as much money as we can to help her pay medical bills, pay rent for her workplace and hopefully find new living accomodations. 
Diane is the most loving, giving person I know and anything we can do to help give back would be a blessing.  Let's all help Diane get back the life she loves and deserves!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Destiny's story starts centuries ago and thousands of miles away:</p>
<p>As the Arctic ice cap has melted, the planet's coldest, purest water has plunged to the bottom of the ocean and traveled around the globe as a suboceanic aquifer. Moving through the Pacific, this current of cold, pure water it is drawn by the warmer, volcano-heated waters toward the Hawaiian island chain, where it passes close enough to civilization that man can harvest it.</p>
<p>Destiny has obtained harvest rights to this water, developed a patented purification and desalination process that removes the salty taste while leaving in the <em>naturally occurring 90 vital trace minerals</em>, and is now bottling the world's purest and most nutrient rich water.</p>
<ul>
<li>People around the world have sampled <strong>Destiny Deep Sea Water</strong>. They love it as much as we do! In fact, our friends in Asia are telling us they need <em>millions of bottles a month</em> to quench their thirst for hard-to-find drinking water.</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet the demand, <em>we need to expand </em>our small, state-of-the-art water processing plant on the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Then, we can take orders for millions of bottles from our thirsty friends on the Asian continent, and you!</p>
<p>The story doesn't end there. <em>We want </em><strong>Destiny Water</strong><em> to nourish a thirsty world</em>. That's why we pour a portion of our proceeds into <em>humanitarian work </em>that's teaching villagers in Ethiopia to build sustainable lives for themselves, their families, and their communities.</p>
<p><em><strong>This is not a charity!</strong></em> This is a modern-day business model, making amazing things happen in one of the world's most impoverished places.</p>
<p><strong>Destiny</strong>, through the <strong><em>""Deep Frontier""</em></strong> project, is <em>creating jobs</em> for villagers who've never had a way to earn an income. Those villagers are <em>learning modern agriculture and animal husbandry</em>. They're <em>growing and harvesting crops</em> never before possible in that region of the world. They're <em>working in co-ops</em> to <em>build adequate housing, community meeting places, a soccer field, and most importantly for them, schools.</em></p>
<p>In <em>two years</em>, our work will be complete in the Ethiopian village where we're working now. Then, depending on how successful we are at growing Destiny Deep Sea Water, we'll flow the love around the world!</p>

Destiny has obtained harvest rights to this water, developed a patented purification and desalination process that removes the salty taste while leaving in the naturally occurring 90 vital trace minerals, and is now bottling the world's purest and most nutrient rich water.

People around the world have sampled Destiny Deep Sea Water. They love it as much as we do! In fact, our friends in Asia are telling us they need millions of bottles a month to quench their thirst for hard-to-find drinking water.

To meet the demand, we need to expand our small, state-of-the-art water processing plant on the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Then, we can take orders for millions of bottles from our thirsty friends on the Asian continent, and you!
The story doesn't end there. We want Destiny Water to nourish a thirsty world. That's why we pour a portion of our proceeds into humanitarian work that's teaching villagers in Ethiopia to build sustainable lives for themselves, their families, and their communities.
This is not a charity! This is a modern-day business model, making amazing things happen in one of the world's most impoverished places.
Destiny, through the ""Deep Frontier"" project, is creating jobs for villagers who've never had a way to earn an income. Those villagers are learning modern agriculture and animal husbandry.

What We Need & What You Get


Water is becoming more valuable than oil on many continents that simply do not have the same access that we have in North America.  Even worse, the water they have is not nutritious, and lacks many qualities that we take for granted.


Our process is unique in the water industry.  We de-salinate while retaining the original minerals.  To get our unique water to the people who desperately need it in Asia and Africa we must upgrade the process which will also drive down our costs which better allows us to push this product to these continents that so badly need it.

The Impact




Your contribution will allow us to get our improve our state-of-the-art de-salination process, and also drive down the cost which will enable our water to be sold in the undernourished continents of Asia and Africa.
My partner and I have built 6 water plants that were very successful providing water to the troops in Iraq.  We have brought in water processing equipment from around the world to accomplish our objectives.
Proceeds from our efforts into Asia will be invested into the Arise project in Ethiopia.  This is a project that has proven to lift an entire village as we focus on building families.

EVERY VOICE MATTERS!

 My journey to increase awareness of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) began with my diagnosis in December 2007. Like most women, I'd had never heard of pelvic organ prolapse, and had no idea that: 


 1/3 to 1/2 the female population suffers in silence with POP symptoms. 
Childbirth and menopause are common POP causes, and aggressive athletic activities, constipation, chronic coughing, genetics, hysterectomy, neuromuscular diseases, and heavy lifting are POP causes as well. 

Women of ALL ages experience POP. 






         The Most Common POP Symptoms:


Women need to know signs and symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse, ALL women. While marketing my book Pelvic Organ Prolapse: The Silent Epidemic to share what I'd learned on my journey, I recognized something more needed to be done to generate awareness and provide guidance and support for women navigating POP. Association for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Support (APOPS), a US based 501(c)(3) with international arms, was born in 2010.




POP has been on medical record for over 4000 years and is still not talked about out loud because stigma keeps embarrassing symptoms hidden behind closed doors. We must continue to talk out loud and share POP information until it becomes common knowledge for all women.
                  Who Should Join STIGMA*STRIDE                                        EVERY VOICE MATTERS!



Women with pelvic organ prolapse. 
Advocacy providing support and guidance for women's pelvic health. 
Healthcare practitioners treating POP.
Industry evolving tools and treatments. 
Research exploring the POP frontier.
Academia educating practitioners.
Media providing exposure. 

We must all come together to generate the next big shift in women's health awareness. The time for change is NOW. As we all start talking about POP out loud, women will recognize POP symptoms, healthcare will start routinely screening for POP,  education, research, and media exposure will increase, and every sector engaged in the POP arena will evolve. 



                       What is STIGMA*STRIDE                                                   EVERY VOICE MATTERS!


 STIGMA*STRIDE   will bridge the world with an international Walkathon/Giving Day to break down the shroud of stigma that has kept pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence hidden behind closed doors. APOPS will host the mother walkathon in the Milwaukee, WI. The vision is to springboard at least 20 walkathons in the US, 5 walkathons in other countries, and a multitude of individual online giving days and other fundraising events during June 2015, POP Awareness Month, to generate awareness, inspire dialogue, and provide funding to evolve projects and programs in APOPS pipeline. Our budget to host our first STIGMA*STRIDE is $17,950. Funds generated in excess of event expenses will go toward tooling for our International POP Awareness Campaign.


Your generous contributions will fund STIGMA*STRIDE event expenses including:



Facility costs.
Publicity and marketing.
Fees/licenses/insurance.
Print materials.
Sound system/media exposure.
Detailed project proposal and budget available for download.

</div></div>","I’m Elisha Simpson, yogi and kids yoga teacher.  I know yoga can change lives. It
changed mine.  My mission is to
help a particularly vulnerable group, exploited and at-risk teenage
girls through our organization, The Crossover Yoga Project.  We bring a curriculum of yoga and creative art therapy to girls in
the juvenile justice system, empowering them to make positive changes for a
better future.  
With your help, I can bring this powerful tool to Westchester County, NY, and the Northeast through The Crossover Yoga Project.

For the past 8 years, the Art of Yoga Project in Palo Alto, CA, has seen impressive results from this curriculum.  At least 80% of their participants have made better life choices, steering away from violent reactions during stressful situations.  This evidence informed method integrates yoga, creative arts, health education and character development to help girls gain self-control, self-awareness and self-respect. 
Let's face it - too many women are traumatized and incarcerated:



In the past 10 years in the United States, the rate of incarcerated women has increased over 800%, double the rate of men.


Westchester county spends $270,000 a year for one teenager to go to prison


When kids go to jail, they are mentored by their peers to commit crimes as means to survival: within 3 years, 80% of teens are re-arrested.




The Crossover Yoga Project gets to the root of the problem- we get to girls who have been broken down by society and help them rise, heal and move towards a new identity on a brighter path to their future. 
We need $7000 to help our girls, helping them make a difference in their lives and their community.  Your support of The Crossover Yoga Project will help us work towards reducing the skyrocketing rate of recidivism.
Your donation will:
Purchase the curriculum ($3000) - a unique teen girl-centered, 18-week art and yoga program with a 80% positive impact on participants
Kickstart our visual identity campaign letting more people become aware of this powerful tool ($3000)Initiate the process of becoming a legal non-profit.  Establishing resources to reach out and make a difference in a girl's life ($1000). Your dollars CAN make a difference, one life at a time.

Our team of committed  yogis and creative art therapists guide traumatized teen girls to self-healing.  Yoga and art therapy helps steer them away from the trauma held inside that is expressed through crime, depression, eating disorders, self-mutilation and self-medication.  
Donate now to our campaign.  Spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, Indiegogo share tools, or any other social media. Encourage your friends to help The Crossover Yoga Project .  All it takes is one girl to make a difference
within herself and within her community.
Thank you!

<p><i>Group Classes</i></p>
<p>Group classes will be offered throughout the day, between 6am and 10pm to meet your demanding schedule. There will be a wide variety of different classes offered such as basic stretching classes, bootcamps, circuit training, HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), Pilates, Yoga,  and Mommy (post-natal) classes.  The variety of classes will provide you with the opportunity to cross-train or to only participate in specific classes that you enjoy. Depending  on how you feel and what your goals are, you pick the class and we will make sure you feel fitter and happier because of that choice.<br/></p>
<p><i>Personal Training</i></p>
<p>Personal training sessions will be planned and created just for you. Your trainer will utilize a variety of different types of equipment and techniques to make you work hard and have you reach your fitness goals. You will always have the option to receive periodic fitness evaluations and to set your goals and personalize your program to cater to your individual lifestyle and needs.<br/></p>
<p><b>Space</b></p>
<p>FitLife will be open from 6am until 10pm. The spaces we are considering are between 3500 to 4500 square feet. The size of the space should allow us to provide group classes, personal training as well as a few other amenities and comforts.  We will have women’s and men’s change rooms with at least one shower in each change room (depending on space and plumbing). The studio will be very accommodating to client needs and schedules as we will provide services including secure lockers (no need to bring a lock); towel service to ensure clients have one less thing to worry about; clean and high quality yoga mats for group classes for clients who are unable to bring their own mats or prefer to use the studio's. Since we know the importance of being hydrated a variety of beverage options will also be available. We are planning on being located close to Varsity Tennis Center while also being easily accessible from interstate 94.</p>

<p>We currently have about $45,000 allocated for renovating the space, but require another $25,000 to ensure that all renovations can be completed. The goal of this funding campaign is to raise funds to help renovate the space for the fitness studio. The funding campaign is also being used to show stakeholders (lenders, landlords, employees) that FitLife has clients and supporters prior to opening day.</p>
<p>These funds will allow us to provide the amenities and equipment that we know clients value. Showers, flooring and ventilation for fitness studio purposes increase renovation costs substantially, but with your help we can ensure that we provide a high quality studio from the opening day.</p>By helping us fund FitLife, you can choose from a variety of FitPerks to help you attain your fitness goals once we open FitLife studio. FitPerks are discounted packages, a great deal nobody else can get except those who helps us to fund FitLife.

<p>Our Challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge #1: Getting the space we want. Landlords are reluctant to rent space to new businesses without some signal of a revenue generating client base. We can overcome this challenge by reaching our funding goal as it helps establish that FitLife has a credible client base that cares about the studio's success.</li>
<li>Challenge #2: Expanding interest in FitLife to potential new clients. The funding campaign is also being used to get people who do not currently train with me (Dominika) to learn more about me and my training services, with the hope that they come join our group classes and personal training sessions in the studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>These challenges can be solved by reaching the $25,000 goal and showing that we do have a client base  to start a new business. They will also be overcome by having a location near individuals who care about a healthy lifestyle and where there is a lack of fitness opportunities. A successful marketing plan as well as word of mouth by current clients will also help tackle these challenges.</p>

areas with a <b>simple, safe, and waterless toilet system</b>.</p>
<p>In Peru’s capital, there are still
around 2 million people who don’t have their own toilet and can only rely on pit latrines. This leaves
families at risk for many diseases. Failing sanitation leads  to increasingly contaminated and eventually
inhabitable and dangerous neighborhoods.</p>
<p>After a successful pilot in
2012, 
x-runner has expanded its sustainable sanitation
system, <b>reaching more than 1000 people every

continue to bring dignity and a basic human right to Peru’s poorest families.
Your contribution is crucial to helping us expand our waterless toilet system to

<div>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>BACKGROUND</b></h2>
<p>Lima is the 2<sup>nd</sup> driest
capital in the world. The city faces severe water scarcity and has to rethink
how to provide safe sanitation to families without relying on a water-based
sewer system. <b>No other invention has
saved more lives in its history than the toilet!</b> A reliable and safe toilet
system prevents infectious diseases, increases hygiene at home, and
prevents ground water contamination. This means that not only the person who
“has to go” benefits from reliable sanitation, but also the entire family, and even surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

</div></div>","IN SHORTX-RUNNER is an innovative and
award-winning social enterprise providing families who live in Lima’s poorest
areas with a simple, safe, and waterless toilet system.
In Peru’s capital, there are still
around 2 million people who don’t have their own toilet and can only rely on pit latrines. This leaves
families at risk for many diseases. Failing sanitation leads  to increasingly contaminated and eventually
inhabitable and dangerous neighborhoods.
After a successful pilot in
2012, 
x-runner has expanded its sustainable sanitation
system, reaching more than 1000 people every
day!
YOUR SUPPORT creates direct impact and value!With your support we can
continue to bring dignity and a basic human right to Peru’s poorest families.
Your contribution is crucial to helping us expand our waterless toilet system to
the next 10 neighborhoods and to
doubling our impact by reaching another 1000 beneficiaries!


BACKGROUND
Lima is the 2nd driest
capital in the world. The city faces severe water scarcity and has to rethink
how to provide safe sanitation to families without relying on a water-based
sewer system. No other invention has
saved more lives in its history than the toilet! A reliable and safe toilet
system prevents infectious diseases, increases hygiene at home, and
prevents ground water contamination. This means that not only the person who
“has to go” benefits from reliable sanitation, but also the entire family, and even surrounding neighborhoods.



OUR MISSION
X-RUNNER provides families
who live in the poor urban parts of Lima with an innovative, waterless
sanitation system.




HOW X-RUNNER WORKS




Families who sign up for
our service receive a waterless toilet installed directly in their homes. The
toilet doesn’t
require any water and it separates urine from feces, allowing for the latter to be collected in a dry state in a portable container.
For a small monthly fee, our X-RUNNER collection
truck goes by the communities once a week and picks up the poop in compostable
bags. This way, X-RUNNER safely removes tons of feces filled with pathogens
from communities and allows families to live in clean homes. 
At X-RUNNER we care about
the environment. Therefore, we treat the collected waste and turn it into nutrient-rich compost.

WHY WE NEED YOU
Reliable and safe sanitation will
bring social, environmental, economic and educational benefits to the region.
That’s why YOUR SUPPORT creates direct impact and value!
With your support, X-RUNNER
can expand its system and its operations to another 10 neighborhoods by:



Supplying more toilets

Picking up many more tons of poop

Hiring more local employees


Increasing our composting infrastructure


Launching larger health campaigns 



X-RUNNER ‘s effectiveness can be seen in our latest reports: 



93% of our beneficiaries say that the dry toilet has improved their lives.
82% of our
beneficiaries say that they plan to keep it for a long time.
4 months
after installing the toilet, users reported an average diarrhoea reduction of
12%











OUR GOAL
We want to raise at least 25’000 US$ to expand to the
next 10 neighborhoods.  And this is just the beginning: The more money we raise, the quicker we
can reach more families and change more lives.

</h1>
<p>New Discoveries regarding the movement of fluids such as wind or water by Physicist and Inventor, Robert D. Hunt have vast implications for the design of hundreds of devices we use everyday. However, the greatest contribution is most likely to come from: new aircraft and sea glider designs: new wind turbine designs; new wing designs; and new vacuum valve deigns.<br/></p>How fluids flow at higher speeds affects the design criteria of flight in regard to wings, aircraft bodies and
helicopter blades; and, is required in the design of wind turbines and wind turbine blades, as well as power turbine blades and anything else
that involves high velocity fluid flow. It is extremely important that we have a correct model with which to improve the design of numerous products in common use. 
<p>
</p>
<p>The most important finding of Mr. Hunt's private research is
that <b>DRAG IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF NEGATIVE PRESSURE IN FLOWING FLUIDS such as wind
or water and not an increase in velocity as has been mistakenly believed for
over 275 years. </b></p>
<p>Obviously these New Discoveries relate to the physics of how how vacuums are formed, how
drag is created as wings move through air or as wind turbine blades rotate in a
body of fixed air, or a propeller in water, how turbine engines create thrust
and much more, which matters a very great deal to our future technological
development in efficient flight and power generation, especially renewable energy.
</p>
<p>Hunt claims that his personal laboratory tests disprove
Bernoulli’s Law and maintains that current understandings of fluid dynamics are
incorrect. “It is imperative to get it right! Otherwise none of these devices
will ever attain their true potential and their development will forever
forward be held back due to outdated antiquated incorrect assumptions based on
faulty science performed centuries ago” he concluded.</p>
<p>One of the new designs inspired by the New Discoveries is the Hunt 
Vacuum Valve that is featured in our video. The Hunt Vacuum Valve  is 
the first valve capable of creating suction since the creation of the 
Venturi valve in 1797 -- two hundred seventeen (217) years ago. <br/></p>

Mr. Hunt's New Discoveries in Fluid Dynamics are far reaching and create a new scientific model
that holds the potential to further the science of fluid dynamics for centuries
to come. Which should give you good reason to support this campaign to advance development of Mr. Hunt's groundbreaking research that will forever improve the science of fluid flow. <br/><br/>

<h2><b>Drag VS Friction</b></h2>
<p>Drag increases exponentially as the velocity increases and
it is drag that is the only true cause of a negative pressure in flowing fluids
– not the change in velocity itself but the creation of drag being “boundary
layer effect” exhibited on the exterior of a fluid only. Therefore increasing
the velocity only reduces the pressure as measured at the boundary layer
between two fluids or of a fluid and a solid surface. The central body of the
fluid increases in pressure. And, the overall effect of increasing the velocity
of a fluid is an increase in pressure in direct ratio thereto in accordance
with Newton’s Laws of Motions and more specifically Newton’s Law of Inertia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1026794/files/20141118124708-Slide8_DRAG_SQUARE_OF_VELOCITY.PNG?1416343628"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Changing the velocity from 10 miles per hour to 320 miles
per hour increases the drag by 4 billion times. Friction on the other hand is
fractional to drag and remains relatively constant with increased velocity. There
is a major difference between the magnitude of drag and friction as velocity
increases.

<p>Friction’s ability to hold back an aircraft for example is
minimal while drag increases rapidly with increased velocity until there is not
enough engine power to travel faster; and, the “drag limit” is reached, which limits
the ability for ultra-high velocity transport of aircraft or any other objects
moving through a fluid, such as wind or water.<br/></p>
<h4>

The result of which clearly indicates that an
engineer must first understand how and where drag is created in order to either
increase or to decrease the amount of drag. Until then he does not have the right
tools with which to work. The vacuum valve and a vertical axis wind and water turbines that beneficially use drag are two
examples of designs in which it is desirable to increase drag to improve their performance. <br/>
</h4>
<h4>In opposition,
wings, boats, submarines, horizontal axis wind turbines (use the principal of
lift to work), cars and trucks, trains all wish to reduce the amount of drag. All of these items where designed to increase
or decrease drag can be improved due these New Discoveries made by Mr. Hunt</h4>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Novel Vacuum Valve<br/>
</h2>Our new vacuum valve provides a means to pump liquids to the surface from a reservoir using the heat energy contained in the liquids (even ultra low-temperature heat) that alone has enormous application in the production of fresh potable water for developing countries and holds great potential for lowing the costs of pumping water and of lowering the costs of producing oil and gas.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
The Hunt valve is designed to overcome the limitation caused by 
constriction of the fluid by forming a large diameter flow ""ring"" that 
allows far greater flow rates; and, provides far greater surface area to
 beneficially produce much greater volume of boundary layer drag 
suction; and, gives an open center area to allow the suction fluid to 
readily mix with the motive fluid.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/792588/files/20140816152156-Slide_1_VENTURI_COMPARE_RESTRICTION.PNG?1408227716"" src="""" style=""""/></p>However, the Hunt Vacuum Valve is only one of many useful devices that can be created due to our new discoveries regarding fluid dynamics. Aircraft and their wings can be designed much more efficiently. In 
coming campaigns (each of which will begin with the title ""New Fluid Discoveries""), we will explore several new wing and wind turbine 
designs in more detail and build and evaluate models of them, along with a novel wind turbine concept that has the potential to outperform existing models that is designed to use drag beneficially. We need 
your support to get there both now and the future. So, join  in with us.  <br/><br/><p>Your help is in regard to much more than just the Hunt Vacuum Valve (although the valve is extremely important to the developing world but will make a large impact on the industrial world as well). Our new discoveries are also about bringing to life a new understanding 
of fluid dynamics, with all of its crucially important ramifications in 
regard to fight, power generation, reducing the costs of producing fresh
 water as well as the costs of oil and gas production. <br/></p>
<h2>The Effect of Drag</h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<p> However, without understanding that <b>drag is the true cause of suction or vacuum (negative pressure) in flowing fluids</b>, it not possible to understand how our new vacuum valve works to create negative pressure by working together with inertia that keeps the driving gas or liquid moving forward so that it does not turn back and fill the center area, as drag provides suction within the center area. <br/></p>
<p>Think of a fire hose at 75 psi shooting a stream of water outward 150 feet into the air. Then, imagine the extremely high level of inertia and drag that is possible within a water or oil well at ten thousand feet of depth having over 4,000 psi of  hydrostatic head pressure of a liquid pumped down from the surface to shoot the liquid ahead with enormous force yielding an incredibly powerful suction or vacuum!<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/855900/files/20140914090255-Slide3_INERTIA_HANDS.PNG?1410710575"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Drag only applies to high velocity flow. High velocity flow creates a high level of inertia that increases exponentially by the square of the velocity that causes the molecules to resist any change (so they keep going straight ahead), including a change in direction. Therefore the fast moving molecules continue to move past an area protected from the flow. While passing the shielded area, they pull molecules from the protected area due to the drag created as a result of the their high velocity flow. And, suction is created in the protected area. <br/><br/><p>The suction or pull (drag) that forms the vacuum in the protected area is due to the  effect of boundary layer viscous drag. In short; fluids are viscous (have viscosity) or they would not flow. At the interface of two moving fluids or a moving fluid and a solid object, the moving fluid pulls on the second fluid or solid object in the same direction as its flow or movement. In this way drag from stationary air holds an airplane back as the surfaces of its air-body and wings move through the air at high velocity. Its engine therefore must overpower drag in order to fly. Remember that all of the suction due to drag happens at the surface or boundary layer.</p>
<h2>Why Hasn't it been Previously Known that Pressure Does not Drop when the Velocity of a Fluid Increases or that Drag is the True Cause of Negative Pressure?</h2>
<p>Actually,<b> it was known or believed right from the start that pressure increases with velocity</b> and Newton's Law's of Motion in 1670 clearly state that the pressure increases as velocity increases. He also correctly deducted that direction is required to fully describe fluid flow within his laws. And, it was only later that it came to be believed that the pressure drops as the velocity increases and that pressure is a scale quantity that requires no direction (which actually is only true for static fluids and is not  true for moving dynamic fluids), which became the subject of a fierce scientific debate that has been going on unsettled for over 200 years.<br/></p>
<p>In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli made the reading of lower pressure on the high 
velocity side of early ""Venturi effect"" style test equipment and jumped to the wrong conclusion as to why, without 
considering all the facts and because drag (one of the two causes) was 
not yet known. Actually both Bernoulli and Venturi missed the opportunity to realize the 
existence of drag; however, they should have realized the creation of 
back-pressure but failed to do so. </p>
<p>Thereafter, devices were constructed that were claimed to work because of a reduction in pressure due to increasing a fluids velocity such as the Venturi valve that created suction. The first reading of blood pressure were also attributed to the Venturi effect. With such seemingly important evidence and with no other apparent answer (drag was not known and back-pressure was not diagnosed) as to why the Venturi meter or valve created suction. It became generally accepted as being correct that the pressure drops as the velocity increases and all of the evidence otherwise presented by Newton temporarily fell to way side -- although Newton's supporters strongly denounced Bernoulli's Principal at the time and for the next 100 years, their protests eventually fell away as the years passed.<br/></p>
<p>Bernoulli was one of the first mathematicians to employ calculus working with integral equations that simply use two real numbers and then calculates any points in between them. Bernoulli used the lower pressure reading on high velocity and the higher pressure reading on the low velocity side of the Venturi effect and made those two numbers into a calculus formula, which in fact can be done for any two numbers. The two numbers were real pressure reading; however, the problem lies in the cause of the pressure readings, which Bernoulli readily attributed to velocity. As described herein, we are confident that we have proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Supporters of Newton's Laws of Momentum strongly criticized Bernoulli's 
Principal that was in stark contract to the teachings of Newton when it first came out, which led to years of fierce debate between factions within 
the scientific community. However, over time no one came forward with suitable explanations as to why the pressure was lower on the high velocity side of the Venturi meter and gradually Bernoulli's Principal generally became reluctantly accepted by the rest of the scientific community.  <br/></p>
<p>With devices attributed to Bernoulli's Principal that work such as the Venturi vacuum valve, blood pressure instruments, wings, etc. and with mathematical formulas in place, Bernoulli's Principal has essentially gone unchallenged for over 275 years, which brings us forward to now. <br/></p>
<p>Our team is bringing the first real challenge to Bernoulli's Principal after hundreds of years with understandable causes (other than velocity) for the lower pressure reading on the high velocity side of a Venturi valve that can be documented and supported by modern science. The effect of drag has become well known, but it still isn't fully realized that it is the true cause of negative pressure in flowing fluids. Most scientists still cling to the Bernoulli version of lower pressure being caused by an increase in velocity because that is what they have been taught and no one has previously shown otherwise. <br/></p>
<p>We have pointed out that the point of measurement at which the pressure is read in a Venturi valve is at the boundary layer where drag occurs which lowers the pressure reading on the high velocity side as drag only occurs at high velocity. And we have shown back-pressure, being the pressure build-up within fluid molecules due to the constriction of flow area, within the Venturi valve is the cause of artificially higher pressure readings on the low velocity side of the valve. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/831084/files/20140903071110-HAVV_SLIDES_USED_IN_MOVIE_slide_14.png?1409753470"" src="""" style=""""/></p>These two scientific factors together explain the cause of lower pressure readings on the high velocity side and provide viable and believable alternate reasons as to why the pressure reading on the high velocity side is lower than on the low velocity side. And should provide sufficient cause for anyone with an open mind to question the validity of Bernoulli's Principal. And, if Bernoulli's Principal is disproved, everything designed using it as the underlying science is flawed, which creates an  immense opportunity to improve many of the devices we use and depend upon every day.  
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When the Venturi meter or valve was created in approximately 1797, 
drag was unknown. The early scientist that observed drag for the first 
time did not realize what they were seeing and mistakenly thought that 
the reduction in pressure that occurred in the fluid that they had 
accelerated was due to the increase in velocity, without considering 
other causes such as: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Back-Pressure caused by forcing a large flow area into a small area being somewhat 
like forcing five lanes of traffic into one lane. There is going to be a
 traffic jam. Additional force that causes a pressure build-up is needed to push the fluid into the 
smaller area called ""back-pressure""; and,</li>
<li>Their measurements were taken at the boundary layer where the 
moving air flow met the stationery air that was pulled along with the 
fast moving fluid's flow on the high velocity side by the effect of drag
 and not on the low velocity side because drag only forms as the 
velocity increases (which was not known then); and, 
(3) Due to the design of their particular test equipment that reduced
 the area of flow thereby creating back-pressure in the first place. How
 and why a fluid gains high velocity flow is not the question or 
consideration. </li>
</ol>
<p>The effect of drag as a function of boundary layer was first introduced 
by Prandtl in 1904, when man began to fly and when it was realized that 
at high speeds that an enormous resistance to forward moment occurred. 
So powerful was the force (which exponentially increases by the square 
of its velocity)  that scientists of the day predicted that man could 
never fly faster than the ""sound barrier"" being near 760 mph. Later jet 
engines provided the enormous power needed to do so. </p>
<p>Over the years no scientist took the effort to recreate the 
experiment to determine if there might be other causes, instead of 
velocity to account for the lower pressure reading.
A major reason for the long continued misconception is that when 
reading the pressure on the low velocity side of a Venturi meter or 
valve, it is actually higher than the pressure on the high velocity 
side, which appears to support the idea that there is a drop in pressure
 as the velocity increases. However the primary reason for the lower 
pressure reading on the high velocity side is that back-pressure forms 
going from a large area to a small area that causes restriction of flow 
and a buildup of pressure on the low velocity side. <br/></p>
<p>They got a reading of 
lower pressure and jumped to a conclusion without considering other 
causes, such as back-pressure created by forcing a large flow area into a
 small area being somewhat like forcing five lanes of traffic into one 
lane. There is going to be a traffic jam. Additional force is needed to 
push the fluid into the smaller area called ""back-pressure"". 
Back-pressure and boundary layer effect viscous drag (on the high 
velocity side causing negative pressure) combined to cause the higher 
pressure reading on the low velocity side. Back-pressure was not 
considered as perhaps it should have been and boundary layer drag was 
not known.
And, back pressure causes a loss of energy doing work on the 
fluid that dissipates as heat; and, thereby, energy is wasted and is 
never recovered, which is what occurs within the Venturi valve that 
explains its poor performance, especially at higher pressures. <br/></p>
<p>Bernoulli did contribute to our understanding of fluid dynamics by being
 the first scientist to realize that reducing the cross flow area causes an 
increase in velocity, even if he did not identify back-pressure as the 
cause of the higher pressure reading on the low velocity side of the 
test apparatus and the energy losses that it causes as it compresses the
 fluid to higher pressure (that dissipates as heat) or realize the 
creation of viscous drag as being the cause of negative pressure in 
regard to high velocity fluid flow . <br/></p>
<h2>Doing the Original Experiments Again to Gain New Understanding!</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>
</h2>After years of not being able to understand why the Bernoulli's Principal and the kinetic formula that uses Newton's Laws of Motion were in such contrast, Mr. Hunt decided to recreate the original experiments in late 2013. In doing so, he discovered the 
formation of back-pressure as the cause of an artificial high pressure 
reading on the low velocity side of their test equipment in the first 
hour after testing began. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/859746/files/20140915164534-slide_15_test_equipment_used_to_determine_back_pressure.png?1410824734"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>There is no real excuse why back-pressure
 was not realized by early experimenters or by other scientist much 
earlier than our recent discovery.</p>Robert D. Hunt and Mark Leslie experimentally determined that pressure 
build-up was the cause of higher pressure reading during laboratory 
experiments on the Venturi effect, which led to a greater understanding 
of fluid dynamics; and, to the discovery that drag is the cause of 
negative pressure within flowing fluids; and, to the invention of the 
Hunt Vacuum valve.<br/><br/><h2>How Fluids Act at Different Velocities is the Real Consideration <br/>
</h2>
<p>The real consideration is how a fluid acts or functions at different velocities and that is what is important for us to understand. Early experimenters, such as Bernoulli and Venturi, totally lost sight of that important consideration, which they missed I believe due to their focus on increasing a fluid's velocity by reducing its cross flow area. And, failed to  identify either back-pressure or the effect of boundary layer drag created at their measuring point on the high velocity side after doing so.</p>
<p>Forget how velocity is attained. Simply measure the attributes of the free open flow (not within an area of decreasing area of flow that skews the results) of air or water, such as its pressure being its force applied per unit area; its speed of movement; the level of inertia; and the level of kinetic energy with the direction of flow straight ahead (optimum 90 degree vector angle). Then speed the flow up with an air fan or water pump and you will see all of those attributes rise uniformly together. All of these attributes operate in unison and have continuity, as each is dependent upon the other as is taught within Newton's Laws of Momentum. Pressure for example can not drop while force increases as pressure is merely the force divided into a series of units that when combined are equal to the total force applied. <br/></p>
<p>It is really that simple. If you do so, you can also readily determine that the pressure of the fluid at twice the velocity possess four times the pressure / force of the original fluid, as the pressure per unit area increases by the square of the velocity.

<h2>So How Realistic is it to think that the Pressure of a Fluid Falls as its Velocity Increases with Such Empirical Evidence Surrounding us that Shows Otherwise? <br/>
</h2>
<p>The answer is that it is not and never has been. There is no scientific underlying reason whatsoever as to why a high velocity fluid should drop in pressure. And, it is in conflict with the important teaching of Newton the greatest scientist of all time who was the master at understanding motion. The only evidence supporting the notion is the flawed original Venturi effect experiment that is analyzed above and is shown to be incorrect for the reasons indicated.<br/></p>
<p>How a fluid increases in velocity has no meaning at all (unless it 
creates back-pressure in the process to give false readings of course). 
The question is how does a fluid act after it increases in velocity or 
changes direction, etc. -- the results before and after are the key to 
understanding the true nature of fluid dynamics, along with also 
realizing that negative pressure is caused by drag; not any change in 
velocity.</p>
<p>Measurements taken (without forming back-pressure) 
show that the internal pressure of a high velocity fluid is higher in 
accordance with Newton's Laws of Motion; and, demonstrate that the outer pressure or boundary layer is lower
 due to viscous drag. High velocity fluid flow is ordered flow having uniform 
straight forward motion with all of its force directly ahead due to its high level of inertia, which causes a substantial increase of pressure within the center central
 body of flow. High velocity forward momentum forms boundary 
layer drag induced suction or vacuum along its surface interface with a 
solid surface or with the surface of another fluid or with the surface 
of a stationery body of the same fluid. </p>
<p>High velocity flow has a higher pressure central body of flow than does a flow at lower velocity. The lower velocity flow has minimal drag induced suction at its surface boundary; and, high velocity flow has exponentially greater suction at its boundary layer in direct proportion to the square of the increase in velocity difference of the two fluid flows. This suction or vacuum is the true cause of lower pressure in regard to high velocity flow.<br/></p>
<p> Newton correctly identified the characteristics of fluids, including the requirment of direction, within his Laws of Motion. Newton was right all along. Bernoulli and Venturi got it wrong because they made the wrong conclusions in answering as to why the pressure reading was lower on the high velocity side being:  (1) the design of their test apparatus, which was the cause of back-pressure being created in the first place; and, (2) the creation of boundary layer drag on the high velocity side due to increased velocity, which is the true cause of negative pressure in flowing fluids!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Newton, by all accounts the greatest physicist of all time and the 
inventor of calculus, corrected believed that there is a continuity (or 
conservation) associated with momentum. His belief of continuity of 
motion was that energy in the form of force or pressure in a specific 
direction is needed to accelerate an object whereby its inertia 
increases (resistance to change), its velocity increases, its force 
increases, its pressure (merely a measure of the force divided into 
units of area) increases, and its kinetic energy of motion increases in 
uniformity. And there is no difference between solids, liquids and gases
 in regard to these laws of motion.
</p>
<p>Likewise to decrease the object's velocity back to its original state
 precisely the same amount of resistance force / pressure in exactly the
 opposite direction, being exactly the same amount of energy as input 
are given back or is conserved. Newton's Laws of Motion were the basis 
of Einstein's Theory of Relativity to which he gave credit to Newton. If
 pressure were to drop (pressure being a measure of force units over a 
specific area) while force, inertia and energy increased, then there 
would be no continuity or conservation of motion or of energy! Basically
 it would be impractical.
</p>
<p>Those who came later and suggested that as the velocity of a fluid 
increases its pressure (which is merely units of force) decreases were 
in direct conflict with Newton's Laws of Motion (1687) and implies that 
the force also decreases. This scientific debate has been going on for 
over 300 years. Anyone in the wind turbine business will quickly tell 
you that the energy of the wind rises as the wind's velocity increases. 
If the pressure (units of force per area) of the wind drops with 
velocity, then why do hurricanes and tornadoes destroy everything in 
their path?.
</p>
<p>Newton made the claim that Leibniz and the Bernoulli family of 
mathematicians plagiarized his work and distorted it after he showed the
 math of calculus to Leibniz. Later The Royal Academy of Sciences ruled 
Newton to the be the true inventor of calculus and correct in his 
conclusions regarding motion but that did not end the argument. It is 
still an open wound in the scientific community whereby both sides claim
 victory and science simply ignores the glaring conflict. Please support
 our work to determine the true nature of fluid dynamics and to resolve 
this crucially important issue for once and all. 
</p>
<p>The answer we believe lies in the understanding that drag is the true
 cause of suction and that drag only occurs at the boundary layer during
 high velocity flow; and the central body's fluid pressure increases as 
its velocity increases while the surface or boundary pressure decreases.
 Lower pressure only occurs at the surface due to the effect of boundary
 layer drag. And that drag is the true cause of suction or vacuum 
negative pressure in flowing fluids. And we believe that Newton was 
right all alone in regards to pressure of a flowing fluid increasing as 
it accelerates, which he clearly stated! 
</p>
<p>If Newton was correct and we are correct, then it becomes evident 
that we have been using the wrong scientific basis for the design of 
items that involve high velocity flow. We have been adding drag to our 
design of wings for example by adding cantilever (a hump on the upper 
surface of the wing) in regard to flawed principals of fluid flow, such 
as Bernoulli's Law that cause very little lift and dramatically increase
 drag until the point of stall unnecessarily. Newton's equal and 
opposite reaction of forcing air downward is the main cause of lift.<br/></p>
<br/><p>Our research is also about resolving old scientific debates that have been going
 on for hundreds of years through new discoveries with conclusive scientific proof, including but not limited to: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding that drag is the true
 cause of negative pressure (suction or vacuum) in flowing fluids; and, </li>
<li>Bernoulli's Principal is incorrect -- the force and pressure of a 
fluid increases instead of decreases as the velocity of a fluid 
increases, instead of decreases as Bernoulli believed and is currently 
taught; and, </li>
<li>Flowing fluids require degrees of direction known as ""force vector 
angles"" to be fully described and are thereby vector quantities and are 
not scalar quantities (described merely by a number on a scale such as 
the temperature) as Bernoulli  previously thought; and,</li>
<li>Increasing the velocity of a fluid creates ordered flow (in much the
 same manner as occurs with random light that is transformed within a 
laser into a laser beam having direction and greater amplified force in 
the forward direction or in the same way that a high pressure water jet 
cutter having high velocity can cut through steel or solid concrete). 
All the molecules move uniformly together is a straight organized 
fashion and apply all of their force directly ahead, as compared to a 
stationery fluid having random movement and applying force equally in 
all directions. The ordered state of flow created by inducing high 
velocity flow causes a substantial increase (amplification) of the 
pressure within the center central body of flow. Meanwhile, the forward 
momentum or velocity forms boundary layer drag induced suction or vacuum
 along its surface interface with a solid surface or with the surface of
 another fluid or with the surface of a stationery body of the same 
fluid.</li>
</ol>
<p>These above theories may be considered radical by some at this time, 
which is why we need your help to further prove otherwise. We have 
already proven the science to our own satisfaction in our own laboratory
 experiments and are confident we are going in the right direction. The 
next step is to create a sufficient body of empirical evidence in order 
to convince the entire scientific community because it is that 
important. <br/></p>
<p>Now we need your help to go to the next stages of performing 
additional work such as test trails conducted in association with 
university research teams; and, preparation of scientific technical 
papers in order to inform the scientific community; computer modeling; 
and, development funds to build additional prototypes of new wing 
designs; wind turbine designs, new aircraft designs, etc. that are 
dictated through the science of our new discoveries. Old designs are 
based on fluid dynamic principals that are incorrect or incomplete; and,
 therefore, logically can not possibly meet their full potential. Help 
us get it right!</p>

New Discoveries regarding the movement of fluids such as wind or water by Physicist and Inventor, Robert D. Hunt have vast implications for the design of hundreds of devices we use everyday. However, the greatest contribution is most likely to come from: new aircraft and sea glider designs: new wind turbine designs; new wing designs; and new vacuum valve deigns.How fluids flow at higher speeds affects the design criteria of flight in regard to wings, aircraft bodies and
helicopter blades; and, is required in the design of wind turbines and wind turbine blades, as well as power turbine blades and anything else
that involves high velocity fluid flow. It is extremely important that we have a correct model with which to improve the design of numerous products in common use. 


The most important finding of Mr. Hunt's private research is
that DRAG IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF NEGATIVE PRESSURE IN FLOWING FLUIDS such as wind
or water and not an increase in velocity as has been mistakenly believed for
over 275 years. 
Obviously these New Discoveries relate to the physics of how how vacuums are formed, how
drag is created as wings move through air or as wind turbine blades rotate in a
body of fixed air, or a propeller in water, how turbine engines create thrust
and much more, which matters a very great deal to our future technological
development in efficient flight and power generation, especially renewable energy.

Hunt claims that his personal laboratory tests disprove
Bernoulli’s Law and maintains that current understandings of fluid dynamics are
incorrect. “It is imperative to get it right! Otherwise none of these devices
will ever attain their true potential and their development will forever
forward be held back due to outdated antiquated incorrect assumptions based on
faulty science performed centuries ago” he concluded.
One of the new designs inspired by the New Discoveries is the Hunt 
Vacuum Valve that is featured in our video. The Hunt Vacuum Valve  is 
the first valve capable of creating suction since the creation of the 
Venturi valve in 1797 -- two hundred seventeen (217) years ago. 

Mr. Hunt's New Discoveries in Fluid Dynamics are far reaching and create a new scientific model
that holds the potential to further the science of fluid dynamics for centuries
to come. Which should give you good reason to support this campaign to advance development of Mr. Hunt's groundbreaking research that will forever improve the science of fluid flow.

Drag VS Friction
Drag increases exponentially as the velocity increases and
it is drag that is the only true cause of a negative pressure in flowing fluids
– not the change in velocity itself but the creation of drag being “boundary
layer effect” exhibited on the exterior of a fluid only. Therefore increasing
the velocity only reduces the pressure as measured at the boundary layer
between two fluids or of a fluid and a solid surface. The central body of the
fluid increases in pressure. And, the overall effect of increasing the velocity
of a fluid is an increase in pressure in direct ratio thereto in accordance
with Newton’s Laws of Motions and more specifically Newton’s Law of Inertia.

Changing the velocity from 10 miles per hour to 320 miles
per hour increases the drag by 4 billion times. Friction on the other hand is
fractional to drag and remains relatively constant with increased velocity. There
is a major difference between the magnitude of drag and friction as velocity
increases.

Friction’s ability to hold back an aircraft for example is
minimal while drag increases rapidly with increased velocity until there is not
enough engine power to travel faster; and, the “drag limit” is reached, which limits
the ability for ultra-high velocity transport of aircraft or any other objects
moving through a fluid, such as wind or water.


The result of which clearly indicates that an
engineer must first understand how and where drag is created in order to either
increase or to decrease the amount of drag. Until then he does not have the right
tools with which to work. The vacuum valve and a vertical axis wind and water turbines that beneficially use drag are two
examples of designs in which it is desirable to increase drag to improve their performance. 

In opposition,
wings, boats, submarines, horizontal axis wind turbines (use the principal of
lift to work), cars and trucks, trains all wish to reduce the amount of drag. All of these items where designed to increase
or decrease drag can be improved due these New Discoveries made by Mr. Hunt

Novel Vacuum Valve
Our new vacuum valve provides a means to pump liquids to the surface from a reservoir using the heat energy contained in the liquids (even ultra low-temperature heat) that alone has enormous application in the production of fresh potable water for developing countries and holds great potential for lowing the costs of pumping water and of lowering the costs of producing oil and gas.



The Hunt valve is designed to overcome the limitation caused by 
constriction of the fluid by forming a large diameter flow ""ring"" that 
allows far greater flow rates; and, provides far greater surface area to
 beneficially produce much greater volume of boundary layer drag 
suction; and, gives an open center area to allow the suction fluid to 
readily mix with the motive fluid.However, the Hunt Vacuum Valve is only one of many useful devices that can be created due to our new discoveries regarding fluid dynamics. Aircraft and their wings can be designed much more efficiently. In 
coming campaigns (each of which will begin with the title ""New Fluid Discoveries""), we will explore several new wing and wind turbine 
designs in more detail and build and evaluate models of them, along with a novel wind turbine concept that has the potential to outperform existing models that is designed to use drag beneficially. We need 
your support to get there both now and the future. So, join  in with us.  Your help is in regard to much more than just the Hunt Vacuum Valve (although the valve is extremely important to the developing world but will make a large impact on the industrial world as well). Our new discoveries are also about bringing to life a new understanding 
of fluid dynamics, with all of its crucially important ramifications in 
regard to fight, power generation, reducing the costs of producing fresh
 water as well as the costs of oil and gas production. 
The Effect of Drag


 However, without understanding that drag is the true cause of suction or vacuum (negative pressure) in flowing fluids, it not possible to understand how our new vacuum valve works to create negative pressure by working together with inertia that keeps the driving gas or liquid moving forward so that it does not turn back and fill the center area, as drag provides suction within the center area. 
Think of a fire hose at 75 psi shooting a stream of water outward 150 feet into the air. Then, imagine the extremely high level of inertia and drag that is possible within a water or oil well at ten thousand feet of depth having over 4,000 psi of  hydrostatic head pressure of a liquid pumped down from the surface to shoot the liquid ahead with enormous force yielding an incredibly powerful suction or vacuum!
Drag only applies to high velocity flow. High velocity flow creates a high level of inertia that increases exponentially by the square of the velocity that causes the molecules to resist any change (so they keep going straight ahead), including a change in direction. Therefore the fast moving molecules continue to move past an area protected from the flow. While passing the shielded area, they pull molecules from the protected area due to the drag created as a result of the their high velocity flow. And, suction is created in the protected area. The suction or pull (drag) that forms the vacuum in the protected area is due to the  effect of boundary layer viscous drag. In short; fluids are viscous (have viscosity) or they would not flow. At the interface of two moving fluids or a moving fluid and a solid object, the moving fluid pulls on the second fluid or solid object in the same direction as its flow or movement. In this way drag from stationary air holds an airplane back as the surfaces of its air-body and wings move through the air at high velocity. Its engine therefore must overpower drag in order to fly. Remember that all of the suction due to drag happens at the surface or boundary layer.
Why Hasn't it been Previously Known that Pressure Does not Drop when the Velocity of a Fluid Increases or that Drag is the True Cause of Negative Pressure?
Actually, it was known or believed right from the start that pressure increases with velocity and Newton's Law's of Motion in 1670 clearly state that the pressure increases as velocity increases. He also correctly deducted that direction is required to fully describe fluid flow within his laws. And, it was only later that it came to be believed that the pressure drops as the velocity increases and that pressure is a scale quantity that requires no direction (which actually is only true for static fluids and is not  true for moving dynamic fluids), which became the subject of a fierce scientific debate that has been going on unsettled for over 200 years.
In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli made the reading of lower pressure on the high 
velocity side of early ""Venturi effect"" style test equipment and jumped to the wrong conclusion as to why, without 
considering all the facts and because drag (one of the two causes) was 
not yet known. Actually both Bernoulli and Venturi missed the opportunity to realize the 
existence of drag; however, they should have realized the creation of 
back-pressure but failed to do so. 
Thereafter, devices were constructed that were claimed to work because of a reduction in pressure due to increasing a fluids velocity such as the Venturi valve that created suction. The first reading of blood pressure were also attributed to the Venturi effect. With such seemingly important evidence and with no other apparent answer (drag was not known and back-pressure was not diagnosed) as to why the Venturi meter or valve created suction. It became generally accepted as being correct that the pressure drops as the velocity increases and all of the evidence otherwise presented by Newton temporarily fell to way side -- although Newton's supporters strongly denounced Bernoulli's Principal at the time and for the next 100 years, their protests eventually fell away as the years passed.
Bernoulli was one of the first mathematicians to employ calculus working with integral equations that simply use two real numbers and then calculates any points in between them. Bernoulli used the lower pressure reading on high velocity and the higher pressure reading on the low velocity side of the Venturi effect and made those two numbers into a calculus formula, which in fact can be done for any two numbers. The two numbers were real pressure reading; however, the problem lies in the cause of the pressure readings, which Bernoulli readily attributed to velocity. As described herein, we are confident that we have proven otherwise.
Supporters of Newton's Laws of Momentum strongly criticized Bernoulli's 
Principal that was in stark contract to the teachings of Newton when it first came out, which led to years of fierce debate between factions within 
the scientific community. However, over time no one came forward with suitable explanations as to why the pressure was lower on the high velocity side of the Venturi meter and gradually Bernoulli's Principal generally became reluctantly accepted by the rest of the scientific community.  
With devices attributed to Bernoulli's Principal that work such as the Venturi vacuum valve, blood pressure instruments, wings, etc. and with mathematical formulas in place, Bernoulli's Principal has essentially gone unchallenged for over 275 years, which brings us forward to now. 
Our team is bringing the first real challenge to Bernoulli's Principal after hundreds of years with understandable causes (other than velocity) for the lower pressure reading on the high velocity side of a Venturi valve that can be documented and supported by modern science. The effect of drag has become well known, but it still isn't fully realized that it is the true cause of negative pressure in flowing fluids. Most scientists still cling to the Bernoulli version of lower pressure being caused by an increase in velocity because that is what they have been taught and no one has previously shown otherwise. 
We have pointed out that the point of measurement at which the pressure is read in a Venturi valve is at the boundary layer where drag occurs which lowers the pressure reading on the high velocity side as drag only occurs at high velocity. And we have shown back-pressure, being the pressure build-up within fluid molecules due to the constriction of flow area, within the Venturi valve is the cause of artificially higher pressure readings on the low velocity side of the valve. 

These two scientific factors together explain the cause of lower pressure readings on the high velocity side and provide viable and believable alternate reasons as to why the pressure reading on the high velocity side is lower than on the low velocity side. And should provide sufficient cause for anyone with an open mind to question the validity of Bernoulli's Principal. And, if Bernoulli's Principal is disproved, everything designed using it as the underlying science is flawed, which creates an  immense opportunity to improve many of the devices we use and depend upon every day.  



When the Venturi meter or valve was created in approximately 1797, 
drag was unknown. The early scientist that observed drag for the first 
time did not realize what they were seeing and mistakenly thought that 
the reduction in pressure that occurred in the fluid that they had 
accelerated was due to the increase in velocity, without considering 
other causes such as: 


Back-Pressure caused by forcing a large flow area into a small area being somewhat 
like forcing five lanes of traffic into one lane. There is going to be a
 traffic jam. Additional force that causes a pressure build-up is needed to push the fluid into the 
smaller area called ""back-pressure""; and,
Their measurements were taken at the boundary layer where the 
moving air flow met the stationery air that was pulled along with the 
fast moving fluid's flow on the high velocity side by the effect of drag
 and not on the low velocity side because drag only forms as the 
velocity increases (which was not known then); and, 
(3) Due to the design of their particular test equipment that reduced
 the area of flow thereby creating back-pressure in the first place. How
 and why a fluid gains high velocity flow is not the question or 
consideration. 

The effect of drag as a function of boundary layer was first introduced 
by Prandtl in 1904, when man began to fly and when it was realized that 
at high speeds that an enormous resistance to forward moment occurred. 
So powerful was the force (which exponentially increases by the square 
of its velocity)  that scientists of the day predicted that man could 
never fly faster than the ""sound barrier"" being near 760 mph. Later jet 
engines provided the enormous power needed to do so. 
Over the years no scientist took the effort to recreate the 
experiment to determine if there might be other causes, instead of 
velocity to account for the lower pressure reading.
A major reason for the long continued misconception is that when 
reading the pressure on the low velocity side of a Venturi meter or 
valve, it is actually higher than the pressure on the high velocity 
side, which appears to support the idea that there is a drop in pressure
 as the velocity increases. However the primary reason for the lower 
pressure reading on the high velocity side is that back-pressure forms 
going from a large area to a small area that causes restriction of flow 
and a buildup of pressure on the low velocity side. 
They got a reading of 
lower pressure and jumped to a conclusion without considering other 
causes, such as back-pressure created by forcing a large flow area into a
 small area being somewhat like forcing five lanes of traffic into one 
lane. There is going to be a traffic jam. Additional force is needed to 
push the fluid into the smaller area called ""back-pressure"". 
Back-pressure and boundary layer effect viscous drag (on the high 
velocity side causing negative pressure) combined to cause the higher 
pressure reading on the low velocity side. Back-pressure was not 
considered as perhaps it should have been and boundary layer drag was 
not known.
And, back pressure causes a loss of energy doing work on the 
fluid that dissipates as heat; and, thereby, energy is wasted and is 
never recovered, which is what occurs within the Venturi valve that 
explains its poor performance, especially at higher pressures. 
Bernoulli did contribute to our understanding of fluid dynamics by being
 the first scientist to realize that reducing the cross flow area causes an 
increase in velocity, even if he did not identify back-pressure as the 
cause of the higher pressure reading on the low velocity side of the 
test apparatus and the energy losses that it causes as it compresses the
 fluid to higher pressure (that dissipates as heat) or realize the 
creation of viscous drag as being the cause of negative pressure in 
regard to high velocity fluid flow . 
Doing the Original Experiments Again to Gain New Understanding!


After years of not being able to understand why the Bernoulli's Principal and the kinetic formula that uses Newton's Laws of Motion were in such contrast, Mr. Hunt decided to recreate the original experiments in late 2013. In doing so, he discovered the 
formation of back-pressure as the cause of an artificial high pressure 
reading on the low velocity side of their test equipment in the first 
hour after testing began. 
There is no real excuse why back-pressure
 was not realized by early experimenters or by other scientist much 
earlier than our recent discovery.Robert D. Hunt and Mark Leslie experimentally determined that pressure 
build-up was the cause of higher pressure reading during laboratory 
experiments on the Venturi effect, which led to a greater understanding 
of fluid dynamics; and, to the discovery that drag is the cause of 
negative pressure within flowing fluids; and, to the invention of the 
Hunt Vacuum valve.How Fluids Act at Different Velocities is the Real Consideration 

The real consideration is how a fluid acts or functions at different velocities and that is what is important for us to understand. Early experimenters, such as Bernoulli and Venturi, totally lost sight of that important consideration, which they missed I believe due to their focus on increasing a fluid's velocity by reducing its cross flow area. And, failed to  identify either back-pressure or the effect of boundary layer drag created at their measuring point on the high velocity side after doing so.
Forget how velocity is attained. Simply measure the attributes of the free open flow (not within an area of decreasing area of flow that skews the results) of air or water, such as its pressure being its force applied per unit area; its speed of movement; the level of inertia; and the level of kinetic energy with the direction of flow straight ahead (optimum 90 degree vector angle). Then speed the flow up with an air fan or water pump and you will see all of those attributes rise uniformly together. All of these attributes operate in unison and have continuity, as each is dependent upon the other as is taught within Newton's Laws of Momentum. Pressure for example can not drop while force increases as pressure is merely the force divided into a series of units that when combined are equal to the total force applied. 
It is really that simple. If you do so, you can also readily determine that the pressure of the fluid at twice the velocity possess four times the pressure / force of the original fluid, as the pressure per unit area increases by the square of the velocity. This is commonly used in making wind power calculations at different wind velocities and is well known within the art.
So How Realistic is it to think that the Pressure of a Fluid Falls as its Velocity Increases with Such Empirical Evidence Surrounding us that Shows Otherwise? 

The answer is that it is not and never has been. There is no scientific underlying reason whatsoever as to why a high velocity fluid should drop in pressure. And, it is in conflict with the important teaching of Newton the greatest scientist of all time who was the master at understanding motion. The only evidence supporting the notion is the flawed original Venturi effect experiment that is analyzed above and is shown to be incorrect for the reasons indicated.
How a fluid increases in velocity has no meaning at all (unless it 
creates back-pressure in the process to give false readings of course). 
The question is how does a fluid act after it increases in velocity or 
changes direction, etc. -- the results before and after are the key to 
understanding the true nature of fluid dynamics, along with also 
realizing that negative pressure is caused by drag; not any change in 
velocity.
Measurements taken (without forming back-pressure) 
show that the internal pressure of a high velocity fluid is higher in 
accordance with Newton's Laws of Motion; and, demonstrate that the outer pressure or boundary layer is lower
 due to viscous drag. High velocity fluid flow is ordered flow having uniform 
straight forward motion with all of its force directly ahead due to its high level of inertia, which causes a substantial increase of pressure within the center central
 body of flow. High velocity forward momentum forms boundary 
layer drag induced suction or vacuum along its surface interface with a 
solid surface or with the surface of another fluid or with the surface 
of a stationery body of the same fluid. 
High velocity flow has a higher pressure central body of flow than does a flow at lower velocity. The lower velocity flow has minimal drag induced suction at its surface boundary; and, high velocity flow has exponentially greater suction at its boundary layer in direct proportion to the square of the increase in velocity difference of the two fluid flows. This suction or vacuum is the true cause of lower pressure in regard to high velocity flow.
 Newton correctly identified the characteristics of fluids, including the requirment of direction, within his Laws of Motion. Newton was right all along. Bernoulli and Venturi got it wrong because they made the wrong conclusions in answering as to why the pressure reading was lower on the high velocity side being:  (1) the design of their test apparatus, which was the cause of back-pressure being created in the first place; and, (2) the creation of boundary layer drag on the high velocity side due to increased velocity, which is the true cause of negative pressure in flowing fluids!



Newton, by all accounts the greatest physicist of all time and the 
inventor of calculus, corrected believed that there is a continuity (or 
conservation) associated with momentum. His belief of continuity of 
motion was that energy in the form of force or pressure in a specific 
direction is needed to accelerate an object whereby its inertia 
increases (resistance to change), its velocity increases, its force 
increases, its pressure (merely a measure of the force divided into 
units of area) increases, and its kinetic energy of motion increases in 
uniformity. And there is no difference between solids, liquids and gases
 in regard to these laws of motion.

Likewise to decrease the object's velocity back to its original state
 precisely the same amount of resistance force / pressure in exactly the
 opposite direction, being exactly the same amount of energy as input 
are given back or is conserved. Newton's Laws of Motion were the basis 
of Einstein's Theory of Relativity to which he gave credit to Newton. If
 pressure were to drop (pressure being a measure of force units over a 
specific area) while force, inertia and energy increased, then there 
would be no continuity or conservation of motion or of energy! Basically
 it would be impractical.

Those who came later and suggested that as the velocity of a fluid 
increases its pressure (which is merely units of force) decreases were 
in direct conflict with Newton's Laws of Motion (1687) and implies that 
the force also decreases. This scientific debate has been going on for 
over 300 years. Anyone in the wind turbine business will quickly tell 
you that the energy of the wind rises as the wind's velocity increases. 
If the pressure (units of force per area) of the wind drops with 
velocity, then why do hurricanes and tornadoes destroy everything in 
their path?.

Newton made the claim that Leibniz and the Bernoulli family of 
mathematicians plagiarized his work and distorted it after he showed the
 math of calculus to Leibniz. Later The Royal Academy of Sciences ruled 
Newton to the be the true inventor of calculus and correct in his 
conclusions regarding motion but that did not end the argument. It is 
still an open wound in the scientific community whereby both sides claim
 victory and science simply ignores the glaring conflict. Please support
 our work to determine the true nature of fluid dynamics and to resolve 
this crucially important issue for once and all. 

The answer we believe lies in the understanding that drag is the true
 cause of suction and that drag only occurs at the boundary layer during
 high velocity flow; and the central body's fluid pressure increases as 
its velocity increases while the surface or boundary pressure decreases.
 Lower pressure only occurs at the surface due to the effect of boundary
 layer drag. And that drag is the true cause of suction or vacuum 
negative pressure in flowing fluids. And we believe that Newton was 
right all alone in regards to pressure of a flowing fluid increasing as 
it accelerates, which he clearly stated! 

If Newton was correct and we are correct, then it becomes evident 
that we have been using the wrong scientific basis for the design of 
items that involve high velocity flow. We have been adding drag to our 
design of wings for example by adding cantilever (a hump on the upper 
surface of the wing) in regard to flawed principals of fluid flow, such 
as Bernoulli's Law that cause very little lift and dramatically increase
 drag until the point of stall unnecessarily. Newton's equal and 
opposite reaction of forcing air downward is the main cause of lift.
Our research is also about resolving old scientific debates that have been going
 on for hundreds of years through new discoveries with conclusive scientific proof, including but not limited to: 


Understanding that drag is the true
 cause of negative pressure (suction or vacuum) in flowing fluids; and, 
Bernoulli's Principal is incorrect -- the force and pressure of a 
fluid increases instead of decreases as the velocity of a fluid 
increases, instead of decreases as Bernoulli believed and is currently 
taught; and, 
Flowing fluids require degrees of direction known as ""force vector 
angles"" to be fully described and are thereby vector quantities and are 
not scalar quantities (described merely by a number on a scale such as 
the temperature) as Bernoulli  previously thought; and,
Increasing the velocity of a fluid creates ordered flow (in much the
 same manner as occurs with random light that is transformed within a 
laser into a laser beam having direction and greater amplified force in 
the forward direction or in the same way that a high pressure water jet 
cutter having high velocity can cut through steel or solid concrete). 
All the molecules move uniformly together is a straight organized 
fashion and apply all of their force directly ahead, as compared to a 
stationery fluid having random movement and applying force equally in 
all directions. The ordered state of flow created by inducing high 
velocity flow causes a substantial increase (amplification) of the 
pressure within the center central body of flow. Meanwhile, the forward 
momentum or velocity forms boundary layer drag induced suction or vacuum
 along its surface interface with a solid surface or with the surface of
 another fluid or with the surface of a stationery body of the same 
fluid.

These above theories may be considered radical by some at this time, 
which is why we need your help to further prove otherwise. We have 
already proven the science to our own satisfaction in our own laboratory
 experiments and are confident we are going in the right direction. The 
next step is to create a sufficient body of empirical evidence in order 
to convince the entire scientific community because it is that 
important. 
Now we need your help to go to the next stages of performing 
additional work such as test trails conducted in association with 
university research teams; and, preparation of scientific technical 
papers in order to inform the scientific community; computer modeling; 
and, development funds to build additional prototypes of new wing 
designs; wind turbine designs, new aircraft designs, etc. that are 
dictated through the science of our new discoveries. Old designs are 
based on fluid dynamic principals that are incorrect or incomplete; and,
 therefore, logically can not possibly meet their full potential. Help 
us get it right!


About the Inventor
Physicist and Inventor Robert D. Hunt is a leading expert on
fluid dynamics. He started his career as a nuclear engineer in 1969 designing
reactors for the aircraft carrier the USS Nimitz; was the first to commercially spawn the salt water fish species
Redfish in 1986 and patented an artificial gas lift system that using liquid oxygen that supersaturates water with oxygen to hold record high fish densities and to pump or circulate water; holds world’s records in geothermal low temperature power generation generating enough power for a home from 92 degree water at this fish farm; has
generated power from the heat energy in the air with his cryogenic thermoelectric
generator that was powered by ambient air with heat rejection to -380 deg. F. liquid oxygen as it was converted to oxygen gas to support fish life; is the creator of the Atmospheric Thermal Energy Conversion (ATEC)
that is a novel power cycle to fly using heat from the air via the gravityplane
that beneficially uses gravity as part of the process; conducted over twenty
years of work in kinetic renewable energy wind research and over ten years of
intensive work on kinetic engine development being the inventor of the Free Piston Engine that has been tested at the highest ever mechanical efficiency for a piston style engine of 92% efficient that is equal to the highest precision turbine engines ever built.  
Mark Leslie, a long time research associate said, “Robert is
one of the great thinkers of our day and has boundless curiosity. He is not
bound by what other scientists say you can do or not do and runs experiments to
accurately figure it out for himself when in doubt. When others said you cannot
gain benefit from gravity, he created an aircraft the gravityplane that rises
into the sky by buoyancy without the need of a power source and then glides back to earth like a glider and a geothermal power
cycle that almost double their power output by using thermodynamics and gravity
beneficially working in unison”.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Imagine your name is Maureen from Nairobi, Kenya, working as a hairdresser. You are the only breadwinner for your parents and siblings sometimes working 15 hours a day. You start catching a cold that you cannot seem to shake off, your vision starts to blur, and you are losing a significant amount of weight over time. Despite knowing how important your vision is for your work, you ignore the symptoms. The stigma around it limits your access to diagnosis and treatment. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Finally, after your sister was able to convince you, you went to a local hospital and got tested for HIV. You are HIV positive. How could this have happened to you?</p>
<p>After a while, the untreated HIV made you blind and you could no longer work because of how long you had to wait to seek diagnosis and treatment due to fear of the stigma around it. Now you are 34 with no partner or children, and you have been contemplating suicide. </p>
<p>Maureen's story is the embodiment of many more people in which HIV/AIDS has left people in unstable positions within society, ultimately killing them prematurely. According to <a href=""https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/young-people"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Avert</a>, there are 4,500 new HIV infections every day among adults 15 years and older. 37% of those infections are among young people (aged 15-24 years), and this is an even worse statistic when we find out that women in the same age group have a higher HIV prevalence than men in the same age group.</p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>My story begins with my parents fleeing to Germany as political refugees. Racism left me ostracized at a young age. From those experiences, questions related to social stigma have been a part of me ever since I can remember. And they have, in part, led me to start my venture, </span>Cumasu<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>, which seeks to address the lack of access to healthcare faced by marginalized communities in developing nations. Specific challenges include lack of privacy, social instability, and a general social stigma governing sexual behavior. We seek to create a new normal in which there is easy access to clinics for sexual health-related diagnoses and support, maintaining patient dignity in the process.</span></p>
<p>Through an appointment-scheduling platform using USSD technology along with an SMS component, we are providing access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as, allowing clinics the opportunity to provide psychosocial support to improve appointment and prescription adherence all via a mobile device as mobile penetration is over 90% in 2016. </p>
<p>Through this, Cumasu came to the conclusion that we envision a world in which every human including marginalized communities receive access to proper healthcare as dignified participants through the leveraging of technology and collaboration to tackle the stigma around sensitive diseases, and ultimately connect care providers with those in need of care.</p>

<p><strong>The Technology</strong></p>
<p>On a daily basis, we have many things we interact with but we have actually never known their real name. <a href=""http://www.inteligentcomp.com/2017/03/what-is-ussd-and-how-secure-ussd-is.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USSD</a> is one of them. It stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data which is a function of your mobile device allowing you to dial numbers on your phone when you want to call somebody. However, instead of calling somebody, you are dialing a set of 3 digits and * and # to access an application provided to you by your network provider.</p>
<p>Think of any operation one does on their cell phone which is not text, internet or making calls. Let us pick an operation, for example checking credit or buying bundles on your cell phone. The process normally involves entering a number in your cell phone with a unique structure. Imagine typing in *473# on your cell phone.</p>
<p>Interactive USSD applications are ubiquitous in the African mobile ecosystem. USSD is universally accessible on any mobile phone, making it a powerful tool for data collection. Through USSD technology, Cumasu will be able to make use of the robust analytics to help monitor appointment and prescription adherence as we will receive feedback in reflection to the questions we will be texting the patients. The USSD gateway is built to handle thousands of simultaneous requests at any one time. Cumasu can give anyone with a mobile device access to structured information via the interactive nature meaning we can layer authentication and leading questions to deliver the right information.</p>

<p><strong>The Requested Funding/Budget</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our start-up is in need of $3,984 to run a proof-of-concept of </strong><strong>Cumasu</strong><strong> 1.0 with health clinics with the help of KANCO to have a strategic </strong><strong>plan for</strong><strong> improvements and functionalities for </strong><strong>Cumasu</strong><strong> 2.0. </strong>These are the expenses associated with the pilot project after extensive research and discussions with locals living in Nairobi, Kenya with these breakdowns:</p>
<p><strong>1. $2,000</strong> for the development of Cumasu 1.0 which will be paying for various expenses associated with the development, as well as, animators. </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>$213</strong> for a shared USSD code for 4 months by <a href=""http://africastalking.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Africa's Talking</a> </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>$514</strong> for the flight from Frankfurt to Nairobi (round-trip, 01/10/18 - 03/16/18)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>$700</strong> for lodging  (65 days)</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>$260</strong> for nourishment (considering $3-5 for two meals each day)</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>$126</strong> for transportation within Nairobi with Matatus</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>$51</strong> for Visa for 3 months</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>$120</strong> for Yellow Fever Vaccination in Germany</p>
<p>This brings it to a total of <strong>$3,984</strong> in order to begin the pilot project starting <strong>January 10th, 2018</strong> until <strong>March 16th, 2018.</strong> </p>
<p>The minimum viable product of Cumasu 1.0 functioning on any mobile device will entitle these functions:</p>
<p><strong>Functionalities for the patient:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Schedule initial appointments</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Reschedule appointments</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Request test diagnosis result</p>
<p><strong>Functionalities for the clinic:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Send delays or cancellations to scheduled appointments</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Send SMS reminders for appointment and prescription</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Make data-driven decisions through assessment of certain health recommendations via our robust data analytics</p>
<p><strong>Functionalities for the Cumasu team:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Web platform will demonstrate data on appointment attendance and prescription adherence</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Data will allow for us to make certain health recommendations in collaboration with health clinic</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Develop the Minimum Viable Product Cumasu 1.0 by December 18th, 2017</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Pilot run Cumasu 1.0 with a health clinic</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Gather data of proof on improvements of appointment and prescription adherence</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. Build partnership with a health clinic to continue working with them</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Receive feedback from the clinic and patients to iterate on Cumasu 1.0 and use all our learnings to develop a strategic plan for Cumasu 2.0</p>
<p><strong>Measurement</strong></p>
<p>Part of Cumasu’s commitment is to demonstrate the impact the mobile platform will have for health clinics and the patients we wish to serve. Therefore, Cumasu promises to track its impact through these measurements to demonstrate them to each supporter and the public:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>USSD Technology </strong>allows with the <strong>robust analytics</strong> to monitor appointment and prescription adherence to see via the web platform how many people attended their appointments, as well as, understand if it improves prescription adherence</p>
<p><strong>2. Pre and post interviews</strong> with both health clinic practitioners and patients</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Video/Photo documentation</strong> of the progress of the development of Cumasu 1.0 and the work with health clinic and patients based on consent</p>

Introduction
Imagine your name is Maureen from Nairobi, Kenya, working as a hairdresser. You are the only breadwinner for your parents and siblings sometimes working 15 hours a day. You start catching a cold that you cannot seem to shake off, your vision starts to blur, and you are losing a significant amount of weight over time. Despite knowing how important your vision is for your work, you ignore the symptoms. The stigma around it limits your access to diagnosis and treatment. 

Finally, after your sister was able to convince you, you went to a local hospital and got tested for HIV. You are HIV positive. How could this have happened to you?
After a while, the untreated HIV made you blind and you could no longer work because of how long you had to wait to seek diagnosis and treatment due to fear of the stigma around it. Now you are 34 with no partner or children, and you have been contemplating suicide. 
Maureen's story is the embodiment of many more people in which HIV/AIDS has left people in unstable positions within society, ultimately killing them prematurely. According to Avert, there are 4,500 new HIV infections every day among adults 15 years and older. 37% of those infections are among young people (aged 15-24 years), and this is an even worse statistic when we find out that women in the same age group have a higher HIV prevalence than men in the same age group.
My story begins with my parents fleeing to Germany as political refugees. Racism left me ostracized at a young age. From those experiences, questions related to social stigma have been a part of me ever since I can remember. And they have, in part, led me to start my venture, Cumasu, which seeks to address the lack of access to healthcare faced by marginalized communities in developing nations. Specific challenges include lack of privacy, social instability, and a general social stigma governing sexual behavior. We seek to create a new normal in which there is easy access to clinics for sexual health-related diagnoses and support, maintaining patient dignity in the process.
Through an appointment-scheduling platform using USSD technology along with an SMS component, we are providing access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as, allowing clinics the opportunity to provide psychosocial support to improve appointment and prescription adherence all via a mobile device as mobile penetration is over 90% in 2016. 
Through this, Cumasu came to the conclusion that we envision a world in which every human including marginalized communities receive access to proper healthcare as dignified participants through the leveraging of technology and collaboration to tackle the stigma around sensitive diseases, and ultimately connect care providers with those in need of care.
Primary Assets:
Startup Experience - Sohrab Co-founded Bean Voyage in 2015 to empower women coffee farmers in Costa Rica to enhance their income by 300% via an e-commerce platform. 
Education - Sohrab majored in Linguistics, as well as, in Business and Non-profit Management at Earlham College which has aided him in adapting to other cultures through a lens of language. He has also learned basic skills such as accounting, business plan writing, and grant writing among many more. 
Incubator - Sohrab is currently attending an incubator for social entrepreneurs called the Watson Institute based in Boulder, CO where he receives both mentorship and the tools on essential understanding and acknowledgement of the challenge he is tackling, as well as, further team building skills which are detrimental in Sohrab’s pursuit to build a team on the ground in Nairobi, Kenya.
Mentors -

Founder/CEO Stevan P. Simich and VP of Product Rob Blatchley from Mogli SMS provide SMS solutions for organizations globally. 

Eric Glustrom as an EchoingGreen and Ashoka Fellow is guiding me in expanding my supporting network on the ground as he has extensive experience working on the ground in East Africa. 

KANCO - KANCO as a partner, has a membership of over 1,200 organizations and numerous individuals that are networking, collaborating and are bound together by a common vision of an HIV, AIDS, TB and other public health issues of importance in  Kenya. 
Developer -


Gerald Ogola from Nairobi, Kenya, is a mobile applications developer who graduated from Strathmore University and has extensive experience in developing various USSD platforms. 

Brian Lyuba is by trait a web applications developer based in Nairobi, Kenya who will be responsible for building our website mycumasu.com in which users will have dashboards unique to them and their needs. 

Support - I have seasoned entrepreneurial support and guidance by Wyclife Omondi and Sonia Kabra, founders of Buupass based in Nairobi, Kenya working with USSD Technology with an SMS component.
Passion - Sohrab Amiri is fully committed to seeing this project be piloted with one health clinic on the ground. He will be building up his network and forming partnerships with different organizations, clinics, and communities. He will also be building up a team with identified positions by contacting professors and students from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore University
The Technology
On a daily basis, we have many things we interact with but we have actually never known their real name. USSD is one of them. It stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data which is a function of your mobile device allowing you to dial numbers on your phone when you want to call somebody. However, instead of calling somebody, you are dialing a set of 3 digits and * and # to access an application provided to you by your network provider.
Think of any operation one does on their cell phone which is not text, internet or making calls. Let us pick an operation, for example checking credit or buying bundles on your cell phone. The process normally involves entering a number in your cell phone with a unique structure. Imagine typing in *473# on your cell phone.
Interactive USSD applications are ubiquitous in the African mobile ecosystem. USSD is universally accessible on any mobile phone, making it a powerful tool for data collection. Through USSD technology, Cumasu will be able to make use of the robust analytics to help monitor appointment and prescription adherence as we will receive feedback in reflection to the questions we will be texting the patients. The USSD gateway is built to handle thousands of simultaneous requests at any one time. Cumasu can give anyone with a mobile device access to structured information via the interactive nature meaning we can layer authentication and leading questions to deliver the right information.

The Requested Funding/Budget
Our start-up is in need of $3,984 to run a proof-of-concept of Cumasu 1.0 with health clinics with the help of KANCO to have a strategic plan for improvements and functionalities for Cumasu 2.0. These are the expenses associated with the pilot project after extensive research and discussions with locals living in Nairobi, Kenya with these breakdowns:
1. $2,000 for the development of Cumasu 1.0 which will be paying for various expenses associated with the development, as well as, animators. 
2. $213 for a shared USSD code for 4 months by Africa's Talking 
3. $514 for the flight from Frankfurt to Nairobi (round-trip, 01/10/18 - 03/16/18)
4. $700 for lodging  (65 days)
5. $260 for nourishment (considering $3-5 for two meals each day)
6. $126 for transportation within Nairobi with Matatus
7. $51 for Visa for 3 months
8. $120 for Yellow Fever Vaccination in Germany
This brings it to a total of $3,984 in order to begin the pilot project starting January 10th, 2018 until March 16th, 2018. 
The minimum viable product of Cumasu 1.0 functioning on any mobile device will entitle these functions:
Functionalities for the patient:
1. Schedule initial appointments
2. Reschedule appointments
3. Request test diagnosis result
Functionalities for the clinic:
1. Send delays or cancellations to scheduled appointments
2. Send SMS reminders for appointment and prescription
3. Make data-driven decisions through assessment of certain health recommendations via our robust data analytics
Functionalities for the Cumasu team:
1. Web platform will demonstrate data on appointment attendance and prescription adherence
2. Data will allow for us to make certain health recommendations in collaboration with health clinic
Outcomes
1. Develop the Minimum Viable Product Cumasu 1.0 by December 18th, 2017
2. Pilot run Cumasu 1.0 with a health clinic
3. Gather data of proof on improvements of appointment and prescription adherence
4. Build partnership with a health clinic to continue working with them
5. Receive feedback from the clinic and patients to iterate on Cumasu 1.0 and use all our learnings to develop a strategic plan for Cumasu 2.0
Measurement
Part of Cumasu’s commitment is to demonstrate the impact the mobile platform will have for health clinics and the patients we wish to serve. Therefore, Cumasu promises to track its impact through these measurements to demonstrate them to each supporter and the public:
1. USSD Technology allows with the robust analytics to monitor appointment and prescription adherence to see via the web platform how many people attended their appointments, as well as, understand if it improves prescription adherence
2. Pre and post interviews with both health clinic practitioners and patients
3. Video/Photo documentation of the progress of the development of Cumasu 1.0 and the work with health clinic and patients based on consent
4. Newsletters will be written once a month summarizing each month’s work, progress, and experience to share via social media, as well as, each supporter. Within the newsletter, feedback from both patients and health practitioners in reflection to Cumasu 1.0 will be shared
Now imagine you are again in Maureen's shoes and you were aware of the benefits that come with using the Cumasu application. Imagine you could have simply scheduled an appointment in privacy and see a doctor. Imagine you would have received constant reminders and support from the health facility and the Cumasu team to stay on your prescribed treatment in order for you to live a more prolonged life, as well as, be equipped with the information and motivation to battle the stigma around your disease.

</div>
<p><strong>Canadian Science for Comfort - World's only one of a kind orthopedic solution to sooth your back, anywhere you sit. <br/></strong></p>
<p>As a Human Spinal Biomechanics Researcher, I have been working with thousands of licensed back healthcare specialists across United States and Canada. In the past decade, my team and I have created an extensive line of home spinal health care solutions that helps people take care of the health of their entire spine from the neck to the lower back. However, QiPillow (pronounced as Chi-Pillow) is the one we are most proud of, because it will benefit the most people in the world.</p>
<p>Most of us have a sedentary life style, today. Unfortunately, our body is not built for sitting. And most chairs, sofas and car seats are not built to support our back. The problem with sitting is that it tends to destroy our healthy posutre and cause the deep stabilizing muscles in our lower back to tense and stiffen, both of which often lead to stiffness, pain and fatigue in our back.   </p>
<p>As a 100% Canadian innovation, QiPillow is here to rescue. Being world's only one of a kind orthopedic solution, QiPillow effectively helps you both improve your sitting posture and prevent your deep stabilizing muscles from tensing. </p>
<p>In a third party consumer use study, 91% of participants were amazed about how well QiPillow helped them improve their sitting posture and comfort while relieving their back stiffness, pain and fatigue while sitting. (See below for details) </p>
<p><img alt=""Most scientifically engineered pillow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/884872/pictures/full/20130621134539-QiPillow_anatomy_575.jpg?1371847668"" src="""" style="""" title=""Most scientifically engineered pillow""/></p>
<p><img alt=""QiPillow seamlessly blend in any living environment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/887556/pictures/full/20130623055421-QiPillow_sofa201.jpg?1371992063"" src="""" style="""" title=""Orthopedic Back Support can be this beautiful""/></p>
<p><strong>How does QiPillow work?</strong></p>
<p>The secret is in its air-controlled ergonomic core. Powered by the same technology used in expensive back support of luxury cars, QiPillow also uses air as its supporting medium. Its air-controlled ergonomic core is great at maintaining its support, and is highly conforming and easily adjustable. As a result, QiPillow will never collapse under your body weight, and never lose its ergonomic support to your back. And like a Sleep Number Bed, QiPillow will adjust to your body, your seat and your comfort, instead of the other way round.</p>
<p>QiPillow maintains its support, while ordinary pillows lose 2/3 or more of their support under body weight (imagine that the forearm is your spine).</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""QiPillow maintains its support while ordinary pillow collapsed."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/885116/pictures/full/20130621161401-compresson_comparison.jpg?1371856444"" src="""" style="""" title=""Superior support of QiPillow""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who can benefit from QiPillow?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can benefit from QiPillow, whether your are an office worker, a taxi driver, a truck driver, a retired senior, or even a student doing a lot of home work. QiPillow helps you sooth and protect your back while seemlessly blending into your sitting environment, at home, work, school or in your car.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know have a challenged back or simply wish to improve sitting posture or comfort, this innovation is engineered for you. </p>
<p><img alt=""QiPillow perfectly works everywhere, in on airplanes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/910677/pictures/full/20130704153720-QiPillow_office_chair_c5.jpg?1372977443"" src="""" style="""" title=""QiPillow works everywhere""/></p>
<p><strong>Plant a tree!</strong></p>
<p>For each QiPillow you order, we will make a donation to plant a tree in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil - one of world's most endangered tropical forests on earth. As the lung of the world, it benefits everone in the world by regulating the global climate. It helps stabilizing global climate and fighting global warming. Its health directly impacts the health of the glabal ecological system.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>WHY WILL YOU LOVE QIPILLOW?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. QiPillow helps 91% of users improve sitting posture and comfort, while reducing back stiffness, pain and fatigue due to prolonged sitting </strong>– The support provided by QiPillow to your back is gentle and soothing at all times, regardless the design of your sofa, chair or seat. In a third party consumer use study, after seven days of use, 91% of participants agreed that QiPillow helped them sit more comfortably. Imagine you could sit and play longer with your kids on you sofa. Imagine you don't have to stand up and stretch your back every 3 minutes and could achieve more in less time. Imagine you could rest and rejuvenate better, the next time you sit!</p>

You can make it a little softer or firmer in less than 10 seconds.  It will always conform to your back, seat and comfort. Your comfort is set completely according to your preference.    </p>

<p><strong>3. Stylish and universal</strong> – orthopedic back support is important to anybody who sits for prolonged periods. But they often don't look good.

It adds a beautiful touch in virtually any sitting environment at home, work and in cars.</p>

<p><strong>4. QiPillow helps improve your sitting posture instantly</strong> – the ergonomic support of QiPillow automatically goes where it is needed the most behind your back, and helps support your back and maintain a healthy posture effortlessly. Your back will stop sinking into the sofa. Your posture will be improved instantly. A third party consumer use study shows that QiPillow helped 91% of study participants improve sitting posture.</p>

<p><strong>5. QiPillow Helps you reduce stiffness, pain and fatigue in the back</strong> – it has been said that 90% of chairs used in offices are not fit to what they are used for. One of the key problems is that people have a hard time to maintain a good sitting posture. Slouching increases the stress and tension in the back, and is the key cause for mechanical back pains, stiffness and fatigue due to prolonged sitting. QiPillow helps users prevent slouching, reduce stress and tension in the back. In a third party clinical study, after seven days of use, 91% of participants with back pain found that QiPillow helped them reduce stiffness, aches, pains or fatigue.  <strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Why did I create QiPillow?</strong></p>
<p>For over a decade starting in 2002, my team and I have been working with thousands of back pain specialists around USA, Canada, UK, Australia and many other countries, and assisting their patients in drug-free back-pain relief while sitting. Our innovations can be characterized as effective, versatile, multifunctional, easy to use and low cost.</p>
<p>I love having a good rest sitting on my favorite sofa. However It was always difficult to maintain a proper posture. I couldn’t find a sofa pillow that could help because they all collapsed behind my back. I was tired of slouching when sitting on sofas. That’s when I started creating a solution to help people to improve their sitting posture and comfort while sitting. I hope that QiPillow will help make people's lives a little more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>R&amp;D, Quality standard?</strong></p>
<p>In order to satisfy the demands of the most discriminating doctors, we consistently followed the highest standard throughout the R&amp;D process. The efficacy of QiPillow has been proven by third part consumer use study. The product quality has been rigorously tested by SGS – an internal quality assurance agency with its origin traces back to Switzerland in 1878.</p>
<p><strong>What it is not for?</strong></p>
<p>QiPillow is not designed as a sleeping pillow which you would use for regular sleep through out the night day in day out. Its health benefits are best utilized when used to spport the back. </p>
<p>QiPillow is not a pain killer. It helps combat the cause for back pain, but not the pain itself. In particular, it helps you reduce and prevent slouching which is a key cause for back pain.</p>
<p>QiPillow is not designed for users without core stability or any acute medical conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Where we are at?</strong></p>
<p>We have been working on QiPillow for 3 years now. We have completed the design and a small production run. Product performance is clinically proven.  Product quality is rigorously tested tested by SGS.

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Canadian Science for Comfort - World's only one of a kind orthopedic solution to sooth your back, anywhere you sit. 
As a Human Spinal Biomechanics Researcher, I have been working with thousands of licensed back healthcare specialists across United States and Canada. In the past decade, my team and I have created an extensive line of home spinal health care solutions that helps people take care of the health of their entire spine from the neck to the lower back. However, QiPillow (pronounced as Chi-Pillow) is the one we are most proud of, because it will benefit the most people in the world.
Most of us have a sedentary life style, today. Unfortunately, our body is not built for sitting. And most chairs, sofas and car seats are not built to support our back. The problem with sitting is that it tends to destroy our healthy posutre and cause the deep stabilizing muscles in our lower back to tense and stiffen, both of which often lead to stiffness, pain and fatigue in our back.   
As a 100% Canadian innovation, QiPillow is here to rescue. Being world's only one of a kind orthopedic solution, QiPillow effectively helps you both improve your sitting posture and prevent your deep stabilizing muscles from tensing. 
In a third party consumer use study, 91% of participants were amazed about how well QiPillow helped them improve their sitting posture and comfort while relieving their back stiffness, pain and fatigue while sitting. (See below for details) 


How does QiPillow work?
The secret is in its air-controlled ergonomic core. Powered by the same technology used in expensive back support of luxury cars, QiPillow also uses air as its supporting medium. Its air-controlled ergonomic core is great at maintaining its support, and is highly conforming and easily adjustable. As a result, QiPillow will never collapse under your body weight, and never lose its ergonomic support to your back. And like a Sleep Number Bed, QiPillow will adjust to your body, your seat and your comfort, instead of the other way round.
QiPillow maintains its support, while ordinary pillows lose 2/3 or more of their support under body weight (imagine that the forearm is your spine).

Who can benefit from QiPillow?
Anyone can benefit from QiPillow, whether your are an office worker, a taxi driver, a truck driver, a retired senior, or even a student doing a lot of home work. QiPillow helps you sooth and protect your back while seemlessly blending into your sitting environment, at home, work, school or in your car.
If you or someone you know have a challenged back or simply wish to improve sitting posture or comfort, this innovation is engineered for you. 

Plant a tree!
For each QiPillow you order, we will make a donation to plant a tree in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil - one of world's most endangered tropical forests on earth. As the lung of the world, it benefits everone in the world by regulating the global climate. It helps stabilizing global climate and fighting global warming. Its health directly impacts the health of the glabal ecological system.

 
 WHY WILL YOU LOVE QIPILLOW?
1. QiPillow helps 91% of users improve sitting posture and comfort, while reducing back stiffness, pain and fatigue due to prolonged sitting – The support provided by QiPillow to your back is gentle and soothing at all times, regardless the design of your sofa, chair or seat. In a third party consumer use study, after seven days of use, 91% of participants agreed that QiPillow helped them sit more comfortably. Imagine you could sit and play longer with your kids on you sofa. Imagine you don't have to stand up and stretch your back every 3 minutes and could achieve more in less time. Imagine you could rest and rejuvenate better, the next time you sit!
Amazing benefits proven by the third party study:
 

2. With QiPillow, your back support adjusts to your body, your seat and your comfort – instead of the other way round.

QiPillow helps users prevent slouching, reduce stress and tension in the back.

<p><strong>My Name is Tracy Murphy, I am a Dialysis patient.</strong> I've been on Dialysis for a little over 3 years now. A few months back I was talking with one of my Doctors about ways to work out while being on Dialysis. Before my kidneys failed I was a fitness instructor and would teach aerobics classes a few times a week.  The Doctor had suggested looking into a bike I could use while having dialysis done. I never heard of it before and went home that night after my treatment of dialysis to find out more. Sure enough after doing a quick google search on the net I was able to find some dialysis bikes and all the benifts they had to offer a dialysis patient like myself.</p>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"" id=""id_518d5f98915d49856637755"">Biking while on Dialysis has been a huge success for many dialysis patients. Recently we had some Physiotherapy Students from Dalhousie University work with our dialysis patients to find out just how much using the bike while on dialysis would help benefit their physical and mental health. The results were amazing - It Really helped to <span class=""text_exposed_show"">improve the patients quality of life. One of the goals the dialysis patient Peggy had set was to be able to walk around her block with confidence that she could make it there and back. Seems like a simple goal for most however to many of our dialysis patents this is a big achievement.</span>
</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""><span class=""text_exposed_show""> Another issues as a Dialysis patient that we have is dealing with Restless Legs - Having to sit in a chair for 3 to 5 hours at a time 3 - 5 days a week is no easy task. There are many times that I'd love to just get up and walk around however while connected to the machine it's not safe. Having the option to peddle is a great relief when you feel the need to move.</span></div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">While reading up on the dialysis bike I also learned how by using the bike while having dialysis done we can actually help clean more of our blood!. Theres a pump on the dialysis machine that we can increase or decrease the speed of depending on what a safe pump speed would be for each person. The faster the pump the more blood that will get cleaned in your body. When we ride the bike and have dialysis done at the same time our blood will pump that much faster there for leaving us with less toxins in our blood at the end of our treatments ;) </span></div>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""><span class=""text_exposed_show""> With the help of Trenas Studio in Bedford NS I taught a kick boxing class where we donated any funds given to this cause. We raised a little over $80.00 towards our Goal. My goal is to raise enough to purcase 3 bikes for our units. </span></div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each Bike is $1300 to purchase. We have 3 Dialysis Units at our Halifax Hospital. My goal is to raise enough funds to purchase 1 bike per unit.</li>
<li>One of the perks I will give to those who are able to donate is to skype you while I am at the dialysis unit so you can see where your donations have helped.</li>

There are many times that I'd love to just get up and walk around however while connected to the machine it's not safe. Having the option to peddle is a great relief when you feel the need to move.
While reading up on the dialysis bike I also learned how by using the bike while having dialysis done we can actually help clean more of our blood!. Theres a pump on the dialysis machine that we can increase or decrease the speed of depending on what a safe pump speed would be for each person. The faster the pump the more blood that will get cleaned in your body. When we ride the bike and have dialysis done at the same time our blood will pump that much faster there for leaving us with less toxins in our blood at the end of our treatments ;) 
 
 With the help of Trenas Studio in Bedford NS I taught a kick boxing class where we donated any funds given to this cause. We raised a little over $80.00 towards our Goal. My goal is to raise enough to purcase 3 bikes for our units. 
 
The Bikes are about $1300 each making our goal $ 3900.00  
The hospital does not have it in their  budget to help with any of the costs for the bikes. please helps us reach our goal and make this dream possible. 


What We Need & What You Get

Each Bike is $1300 to purchase. We have 3 Dialysis Units at our Halifax Hospital. My goal is to raise enough funds to purchase 1 bike per unit.
One of the perks I will give to those who are able to donate is to skype you while I am at the dialysis unit so you can see where your donations have helped.
Every dollar Truly helps. If we are not able to reach our goal of one bike per dialysis unit then we will combine all the funds raised to purchase what we can.



 

 Please help us make some noise about our campaign and pass the word around. Thank you so much for your time and support",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Voice Of An Angel</strong></p>
<p>Born with a voice of an angel, Julie began singing professionally in 1982.  Over the years, she has sung for greats such as <strong>Rod Stewart, Diana Ross, kd Lang, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Andrea Bocelli, Barbara Streisand, Beyonce', Usher, Celine Dion, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, and the list goes on. </strong></p>
<p>Three years ago, while on tour backing up 7-time Grammy award winning recording artist <strong>John Mayer, </strong>as well as preparing for her own solo project, she discovered a lump on her breast during a self examination.  After seeing a doctor, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Devastated, she had to leave the tour in order to begin chemo and radiation treatments.  While dealing with the pain of this disease, and discomfort of the treatments she endured, Julie was determined to support other survivors by speaking and even singing for many national cancer foundations such as <strong>The Patient</strong> <strong>Advocate Foundation,</strong> the <strong>Patrick Dempsey Cancer Challenge,</strong> and <strong>Amgen’s Break Away From Cancer </strong>organization. </p>
<p>While staying the course with her mission spreading hope to others, and surviving her breast cancer, one year later, <strong>the cancer returned</strong>, but this time, <strong>in her lungs</strong>. The very organ that supports the deliverance of her ethereal voice to the masses.  Julie finds it difficult to breathe when just walking to her mailbox to retrieve her mail.  However, she pushes on and continues to sing whenever possible. Late last year, <strong>the cancer spread to her bones and brain</strong>.  Julie is literally fighting for her life.</p>
<p>With the high cost of medical treatments, Julie's savings from past tours and other performance projects are exhausted.  She has spent her career supporting others, and now she could use the support. In the beginning of her fight, a select few have come through for Julie above and beyond her wildest dreams; helping her get through her initial series of treatments.  However, the battle is still on and she needs our help now.</p>
<p>Your donation will assist with Julie's future medical expenses including therapy, medicine &amp; supplements needed to keep her body strong, and rid the cancer from her body.  Not to mention, it will assist with her everyday living expenses as she's unable to work at this time.</p>
<p>Julie is ready to beat this cancer for good.  She knows it will take every ounce of fight she can muster, and the financial assistance to do so. Be assured, she is up for the fight!</p>
<p>We can give Julie a fighting chance and provide her some peace of mind! Can we count on you?</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<p><span>We reached our 12K goal, which is <strong>amazing</strong>!! Thank you so much to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>We're setting ourselves a stretch goal of 15K, and here's why:</span></p>
<p><span>We got an interesting email last week, followed up by an interesting phone call, informing us that People In The Know think there is a US market for the Drip Clip. If we're able to rally folks in the next few hours and meet our stretch goal, we could use the funds to help us file for FDA approval of the device much sooner than we anticipated! We're still trying to process all of this, but the potential sounds really exciting! It would help us build our market more rapidly, and with lower barriers to sales and marketing. </span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Dream</h3>
<p>We are a start-up company with the mission of building hyper low-cost medical devices for resource-limited settings (anywhere from hospice care to developing world clinics, disaster relief, etc). This campaign is to fund the manufacturing and field testing of our first product, the Drip Clip. <br/><br/>We think there is room for more than philanthropy in the world of global health, and we want to show that if you build the right kind of solutions, then people will buy them. The Drip Clip is the first prototype developed by Shift Labs, and with your support we can gather critical user feedback to ensure the first product we sell is one people actually want. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>What is the Drip Clip? </h3>
<p>Our first product is a drip monitor, a replacement for expensive pumps that dose fluid from IV bags. A physician at Doctors Without Borders alerted us to the difficulty that front-line health workers in resource-limited settings often have counting IV drips by hand and then, in their heads, estimating the accurate doses of crucial medicines. </p>

<div class=""template asset""><span>To use the Drip Clip, you clip it to an IV bag and it reads instantaneously. It requires no expertise to use, but it can provide precise information. It measures drip rates by detecting variations in light transmission between an LED and photodiode. The LCD screen displays the flow rate pre-calculated to the units of mL per hour. </span></div>
<h3>Who we are </h3>
<p>The highly paid actors you saw in the video: Beth, Lisa, Phil, Cameron, Shevin, and Jacqueline are only a small portion of the founders, advisors, and doctors collaborating on this project. We have a crew of multidisciplinary hackers, makers, business experts and entrepreneurs contributing their passion and expertise. <br/><br/>The core of Shift Labs are: <br/>Beth Kolko, PhD - human-centered design, ethnography, technology design for resource-limited settings <br/>Lisa Lafleur, PhD - diagnostic test design for resource-limited settings, microfluidics, immunoassays <br/>Phil Rutschman - signal processing, embedded software, electronics <br/>Dr. Shevin Jacob, the newest member of our core team - infectious disease specialist and WHO consultant who has spent several years practicing in resource-limited settings<br/><br/>We also have a larger team of talented medical professionals and engineers, and some first-rate mentors and advisors. Some of the people who help make us great are: Dr. Eric Rasmussen, Dr. Cameron Bass, Dr. Xandra Rarden, Rob Flickenger, David Hulton, Adam Cecchetti,<strong> </strong>Pablos Holman, Pierce Nichols, Matthew Borgatti, and Bre Pettis. </p>
<p>Shift Labs emerged from our belief that medical technology could be more creative and less expensive -- and ultimately sustain a for-profit business model. We’d worked on technologies and products in the past, only to have them never see the light of day. We’d try; we’d take some of our work to companies with the knowledge and power to change the world, but they weren’t interested. The tipping point was having a VP at one company explain why they weren’t interested in the low-cost innovation being discussed: “we could make cheaper technology, but it wouldn't support the cost of our sales force."" We believe that the world has changed enough that old models need not dominate. We think there is a space in the world where we can fuel an ethically successful and sustainable business without it being driven solely by charity and donation. We can maintain very low costs in ideation, engineering, and manufacturing so the people who need our devices most can afford them. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>What we have done so far </h3>
<p>Worked with doctors to identify needs in the field <br/>Determined low-cost solution to drop rate counting need <br/>Designed and validated early prototypes <br/>Validated electronics systems and created two board revisions</p>
<p><img alt=""Drip Clip prototypes and test rig"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://shiftlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/prototype_progression_photo_600wide.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Drip Clip prototypes and test rig""/></p>
<h3>What we have left to do</h3>
<p>Finalizing the housing. We're finalizing the design with an industrial designer over the next 6-8 weeks, and concurrently we'll be shopping around for manufacturers for our production run. We’re focusing on simplicity of use, durability, and resource efficient manufacturing. <br/><br/>Drip Clip assembly. We've reached out to local ""Opportunity Workshops"" that employ disabled workers to do electronics assembly. They do a lot of work for Boeing, so they have experience with precision assembly, and they are local so we can eliminate some of the complexities with outsourcing. <br/><br/>Determine field testing goals and surveys. We want to make sure that our products pass the ""want"" as well as the ""need"" test, especially in rural areas. We'll also use our field tests to see if there are other features that are important, and how usage under real-world conditions can help us improve our design. </p>

<h3>What we'll do with the money</h3>
<p>Fund the Manufacturing of a First Batch of Drip Clips <br/>Electronics - For a run of 10 - $44.84, 100 - $12.60, 1000 - $7.36, 5000 - $6.49 <br/>Housings - Depending on the number of Drip Clips, we’ll either use resin casting (approx $3 per unit), or a small run of plastic housings (approx $3-5 per unit). We have materials to do the tooling on site for resin casting, and we would outsource for plastic housings. <br/>Assembly - $15/hr, 1 hr/unit <br/><br/>Fund Field Testing in India and East Africa <br/>Sending doctors to field sites - $0 (all company advisors volunteering their time) <br/>Sending 2 engineers to field sites - $5000 <br/><br/>Our medical partners will do the testing, and Shift Labs team members will travel to help collect and analyze data and hack on the prototype as necessary in the field. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Distribution and regulation </h3>
<p>It turns out there are lots of great, low-cost medical technologies out there -- either actually being produced, or in prototype stage. But the complex world of distribution means that by the time a $10 piece of technology makes it to an actual purchaser, it costs $100 or maybe $1000 because of all the steps in the chain. We're being creative about distribution, too. But for more on that, keep an eye on our blog at <a href=""http://shiftlabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shiftlabs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Also, we want to make sure you know we're following all local and international guidelines for testing of our devices. And we'll go through the regulatory procedure for the markets where we sell our devices.</p>

We have a crew of multidisciplinary hackers, makers, business experts and entrepreneurs contributing their passion and expertise. The core of Shift Labs are: Beth Kolko, PhD - human-centered design, ethnography, technology design for resource-limited settings Lisa Lafleur, PhD - diagnostic test design for resource-limited settings, microfluidics, immunoassays Phil Rutschman - signal processing, embedded software, electronics Dr. Shevin Jacob, the newest member of our core team - infectious disease specialist and WHO consultant who has spent several years practicing in resource-limited settingsWe also have a larger team of talented medical professionals and engineers, and some first-rate mentors and advisors. Some of the people who help make us great are: Dr. Eric Rasmussen, Dr. Cameron Bass, Dr. Xandra Rarden, Rob Flickenger, David Hulton, Adam Cecchetti, Pablos Holman, Pierce Nichols, Matthew Borgatti, and Bre Pettis. 
Shift Labs emerged from our belief that medical technology could be more creative and less expensive -- and ultimately sustain a for-profit business model. We’d worked on technologies and products in the past, only to have them never see the light of day. We’d try; we’d take some of our work to companies with the knowledge and power to change the world, but they weren’t interested. The tipping point was having a VP at one company explain why they weren’t interested in the low-cost innovation being discussed: “we could make cheaper technology, but it wouldn't support the cost of our sales force."" We believe that the world has changed enough that old models need not dominate. We think there is a space in the world where we can fuel an ethically successful and sustainable business without it being driven solely by charity and donation. We can maintain very low costs in ideation, engineering, and manufacturing so the people who need our devices most can afford them. 
What we have done so far 
Worked with doctors to identify needs in the field Determined low-cost solution to drop rate counting need Designed and validated early prototypes Validated electronics systems and created two board revisions

What we have left to do
Finalizing the housing. We're finalizing the design with an industrial designer over the next 6-8 weeks, and concurrently we'll be shopping around for manufacturers for our production run. We’re focusing on simplicity of use, durability, and resource efficient manufacturing. Drip Clip assembly. We've reached out to local ""Opportunity Workshops"" that employ disabled workers to do electronics assembly. They do a lot of work for Boeing, so they have experience with precision assembly, and they are local so we can eliminate some of the complexities with outsourcing. Determine field testing goals and surveys. We want to make sure that our products pass the ""want"" as well as the ""need"" test, especially in rural areas. We'll also use our field tests to see if there are other features that are important, and how usage under real-world conditions can help us improve our design. 

What we'll do with the money
Fund the Manufacturing of a First Batch of Drip Clips Electronics - For a run of 10 - $44.84, 100 - $12.60, 1000 - $7.36, 5000 - $6.49 Housings - Depending on the number of Drip Clips, we’ll either use resin casting (approx $3 per unit), or a small run of plastic housings (approx $3-5 per unit). We have materials to do the tooling on site for resin casting, and we would outsource for plastic housings. Assembly - $15/hr, 1 hr/unit Fund Field Testing in India and East Africa Sending doctors to field sites - $0 (all company advisors volunteering their time) Sending 2 engineers to field sites - $5000 Our medical partners will do the testing, and Shift Labs team members will travel to help collect and analyze data and hack on the prototype as necessary in the field. 
Distribution and regulation 
It turns out there are lots of great, low-cost medical technologies out there -- either actually being produced, or in prototype stage. But the complex world of distribution means that by the time a $10 piece of technology makes it to an actual purchaser, it costs $100 or maybe $1000 because of all the steps in the chain. We're being creative about distribution, too. But for more on that, keep an eye on our blog at shiftlabs.com.
Also, we want to make sure you know we're following all local and international guidelines for testing of our devices. And we'll go through the regulatory procedure for the markets where we sell our devices.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>T is for... Top Surgery.</h3> <p>Hi! My name is Aron or Moe, depending on when and where we met. I'm a 29-year-old genderqueer transguy, and I'm finally having <a href=""http://www.topsurgery.net/procedures/double-incision-top-surgery.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top surgery </a>with Dr. Curtis Crane on <b>August 18th</b>.</p>
<p>Holy cow! That's in less than 17 days, right? </p>
<p>Yeah, it is!</p>
<p><a href=""http://brownsteincrane.com/meet-the-doctors/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Crane</a> is a world renowned surgeon, running a plastic surgery clinic out of Greenbrae, Calif., that is dedicated exclusively to gender confirmation procedures for the transgender community.  I shopped around a lot, and his combination of experience and the holistic approach he brings to his practice led me to choose him for my surgery. He's so popular in fact, that I was going to have to wait until June 2015 for a surgery date! Then, the miraculous happened: Someone cancelled, and I took the appointment. </p>
<p>While I've saved for this surgery for over five years, it turns out I'm still a bit short. (More on that below.) </p>
<p>Most important for you to know, however, is that this surgery has been a long time coming and is very important to my mental and physical well-being. While I don't have the kind of soul-crushing body dysphoria that some trans people experience, I experience consistent stress, distress, and downright physical pain trying to hide this part of my body from the rest of the world -- a world that now thankfully sees me as male due to the wondrous effects of testosterone. Chest binding has numerous negative impacts on one's health and has caused enough back &amp; neck damage over the last 9 years that I can't even bind anymore. Having this surgery, and having it soon, will make a permanent, positive impact on my daily life, health, and happiness.</p>
<p>I'm ready to be healthier, happier, and more comfortable. </p>

<p>Our program is self-funded.  Each player pays dues to help pay for travel, uniforms, staffing and medical.  We will recieve ZERO help from the school, so the funds that are not raised will be an additional burden to each of the student-athletes on the team. This life changing experience is something that everyone involved with the program will remember forever.  Our playoff run will promote the club and help us with recruitment to keep UCSB one of the top Rugby Clubs in America.  Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In reality, we need a lot more than our $15,000 goal, but this is a total we think it realistic for this campaign.  The dues the team pays goes towards team kit and funding the regular season.  We need your support to help us make it through the playoffs!</p>

<h1>Creation story</h1>
<p>Creation of FlameTube was very exciting but not easy. Step by step, we tested our ideas of user interface, the design, circuits, electronic components, materials and other important elements. We made an uncountable number of prototypes until FlameTube got its final appearance.</p>
<p>After 3 years of hard work, we got the product, that we really love. We’ve made 20 units and granted them to our friends. Each of them use FlameTube in everyday life and like it very much.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3><strong>Nate's story</strong></h3>
<p>Nate is an exceptional little six year old boy. He is an extremely smart kindergartener reading at a third grade level and a lover of animals (especially birds). He loves to laugh and has a wonderful imagination. Unfortunately, all of what follows is somewhat normal to Nate, as he knows nothing else, which saddens us. However, he has faced such adversity with nothing but pure spirit and serious courage and truly is a role model for all of us.</p>
<p>At twenty weeks pregnant with Nate we were given the devastating news that he had <a href=""http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/t/tricuspid/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Tricuspid Atresia"">Tricuspid Atresia</a>, a congenital heart defect that would require three open-heart surgeries to correct. His first surgery was at three weeks of age, soon followed by the second at nine months. This second surgery landed him at Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, NY for a month and a half due to a serious staph infection. This infection also incidentally led to two mini stokes — subsequent focal seizures. Because the infection ravaged the tissue surrounding the incision, he was sent home with a wound vac and a pic line leaving us to administer three types of antibiotics every three hours for two months after. Nate finally had his last surgery (Fontan procedure) in May of 2011. With all three procedures now behind us, coupled with a number of hospitalizations, we were hopeful that he was finally in the clear and set to start kindergarten in the fall of 2011.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, shortly after starting kindergarten, Nate started having little flash headaches in the mornings before school that seemed to come and go rather quickly. Soon it reached a point where the headaches had been going on for well over a week, and we started to become somewhat concerned. We decided to take him to see his pediatrician. The visit uncovered nothing, but his doctor did say that if he wakes up with a headache and/or vomiting in the middle of the night to have him seen right away. The morning of Thanksgiving day 11/24/2011, Nate woke up in the middle of the night vomiting and screaming in pain with a headache. We immediately rushed him to the emergency room at Levine Children’s Hospital, here in Charlotte. After an initial CT scan, it was discovered that he had plum size mass in his brain near his cerebellum. After an extremely successful five-hour surgery to remove the mass, he was soon in recovery and we eagerly awaited the pathology report. A few days later we met with an Oncologist from Levine to review the findings, and were delivered the news that no parent ever wants to hear… The diagnosis for Nate was Grade IV <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medulloblastoma"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Medulloblastoma on Wikipedia"">Medulloblastoma</a>, a very aggressive type of malignant brain tumor. We were completely devastated.</p>
<p>Secondary to that, in order to complete the follow-up MRI (to be certain that the entire tumor was removed) another surgery had to be completed in order to remove the pacemaker leads that had been <span>implanted </span>from Nate's last open heart surgery. We were told that there was a strong possibility the leads could become superheated during the scan, and the procedure could burn up his little heart. The leads were removed on 12/6/11. The MRI was finally completed on 12/16/11 in conjunction with a spinal tap to be certain that the tumor was completely removed and to check for any circulating malignant cells in his spinal fluid — Both tests returned negative.</p>
<p>The Oncologist was adamant about beginning treatment immediately. We were inundated with next steps regarding standard of care therapy to treat Nate's diagnosis which would include six weeks (5 days/week) of radiation therapy coupled with nine cycles (approximately 10 months) of chemotherapy utilizing the following treatment drugs: Vincristine, Lomustine, Cisplatin and Cyclophosphamide. This type of intense treatment on a developing six year old can also bring about a whole range of potentially severe and long-term permanent damage. We were told by numerous doctors that the radiation could cause Nate's spine to stop growing and the radiation to his brain could also potentially result in a loss of some cognitive function as well. In addition, side effects ranging from the typical nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and diarrhea, to those more serious (and permanent) lung/kidney damage, hearing loss, developmental problems, as well as the strong possibility for developing other types of cancer years later could also follow. This honestly scared us beyond belief, especially considering Nate's already pre-existing condition with Tricuspid Atresia and weakened heart. It is such a hard decision, because no matter which way we go regarding treatment, be it standard of care radiation and chemotherapy or alternative therapies, it will always be a roll of the dice. However, being very concerned for Nate's overall health and quality of life, we were bound to find another solution and began searching high and low for an alternative cancer treatment.</p>
<p>We discovered the Alivizatos Treatment Program… An immunotherapy-based approach to treating various forms of cancer, especially brain tumors. We have been following the treatment protocol initially suggested by Nate's doctors at IBC (International BioCare Hospital) and to date, Nate has gone through two rounds of treatment. Because the Alivizatos Treatment Program is not recognized by the FDA as being a standard of care treatment protocol for cancer patients, none of the costs are covered by insurance carriers and it is only available outside the United States. Until now, we have been able to pay for all of Nate's treatments, but we have currently exhausted all of our resources and now living check to check trying to see that Nate and our other children at least have their basic needs met.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where we stand now</h3>
<p>Nate's most recent MRI on September 14th of this year delivered some very unfortunate news, and we were completely disheartened to learn that there has been a recurrence of the tumor. On 9/25/12 Nate had surgery once again to remove the new tumor, and the latest MRI from 9/26/12 showed that there was still some residual tumor left in his brain as well as additional areas of concern in two regions of his spine. We are currently awaiting a final pathology report and have been speaking with his team of doctors — Hopefully we will soon know what our next steps will be. His little body threw us a curveball. We knew either way, conventional or alternative, that his treatment would be a gamble, but we have complete faith he WILL get through this. We still fear the devastating effects of conventional radiation and chemotherapy, however, we are open-minded and simply want the best possible outcome for him.</p>
<p>The idea of letting Nate have a normal childhood is what keeps us going, and we will continue holding onto that dream for him. Please know that help in any way possible is appreciated more than you can imagine. We just want to ""Keep Nate Great!""</p>

I started playing hockey when I was seven years old, because my father came from the Netherlands, where it is a huge sport, and he wanted me to try it out too. I quickly grew to love the game, and when i turned eleven I joined the Potomac Field Hockey Travel League. The travel league was very helpful and fun for me to join because I had never played competitively before. I went to many tournaments with that team, including Harvest Hockey, Disney Junior Field Hockey Showcase and many smaller tournaments. Soon I decided to play for a higher class team, Rampage Field Hockey, but soon switched back to PFH (Potomac Field Hockey). In all I have played for five different teams, and went to Festival, the largest hockey tournament in the United States, and to the Disney Field Hockey Showcase three different times, I also play for the Olympic team feeder program.</div><div>    This campaign is to raise money to go to World Camp Barcelona, an internationally acclaimed field hockey camp that I was invited to when I played at World Camp USA this summer.

My name is Nathalie and I play field hockey. I started playing hockey when I was seven years old, because my father came from the Netherlands, where it is a huge sport, and he wanted me to try it out too. I quickly grew to love the game, and when i turned eleven I joined the Potomac Field Hockey Travel League. The travel league was very helpful and fun for me to join because I had never played competitively before. I went to many tournaments with that team, including Harvest Hockey, Disney Junior Field Hockey Showcase and many smaller tournaments. Soon I decided to play for a higher class team, Rampage Field Hockey, but soon switched back to PFH (Potomac Field Hockey). In all I have played for five different teams, and went to Festival, the largest hockey tournament in the United States, and to the Disney Field Hockey Showcase three different times, I also play for the Olympic team feeder program.    This campaign is to raise money to go to World Camp Barcelona, an internationally acclaimed field hockey camp that I was invited to when I played at World Camp USA this summer. Out of the three hundred kids there I was one of the thirty-six selected for the elite camp that will take place in August of next summer. This camp is really important to me because I want to play competitive field hockey in college, and it would be amazing for me to be able to go to a camp with nationally acclaimed coaches and international field hockey players.    I need to raise 3495 USD for the fee for the camp, this fee includes boarding, food, coaching expenses, airfare, etc. This fee is all inclusive, so airfare, food, boarding etc. are included, and I've included some perks for donating myself!

You will be excited to learn that I, Carina Claire, am attending Bikram Yoga Teacher Training in Phuket, Thailand this fall! This is a very big step in my life towards becoming a more self sustaining person and it is a true passion. The yoga has radically transformed my life in so many ways. My body is so happy and strong, my mind is so much more peaceful and my spirit has been warmed up. My relationships are more open and honest and so is the way I interact with the world. I am much less afraid to be pushed out of my comfort zone into something new and unknown. I can finally breathe. These are all things I want to share with others, I want to stand at the front of the room and see people change - to be part of their changes. I look back an cannot believe how much I have changed in six months since starting at Bikram Yoga Portsmouth. I have gotten off of methadone, I have gotten a job for the first time in five years, ended an unhealthy relationship, moved back to Eliot, got a car (thanks Dad!) and everything I needed to drive it, made so many amazing new friends, and became my own person. I will always be eternally grateful to those who were instrumental in the beginning of my yoga days - Jess Bacon and Sara Curry, you guys rock!</p><p>To accomplish my goal of becoming a Bikram Yoga teacher, I have worked with Vocational Rehab to have them pay for the training. This still leaves a few things I cannot afford on my own! The big one is, I will need a plane ticket from the states to Thailand and back. The training is September 14 - November 16, so I don't have much time left. I have a really short deadline for this fundraiser because it can take up to 15 days to receive the money once the deadline is reached. If anyone in my family wanted to coordinate for the plane ticket instead of donating the money, that would be incredible and less stressful having to wait until the last minute to buy the ticket. Other things I will need are more yoga clothes (!), money for food and water (as we are only provided 1 liter of water per day, plus at two meals and must purchase any additional water), a visa,  and probably money to ship my medication out to me while in Thailand. </p><p>Also if you don't know me, my name is Carina Claire.

<p>My beautiful wife of 22 years was diagnosed with stage IIIA breast cancer this past April while I was working as a guard at the US Embassy in Kabul Afghanistan. My name is Tony Key and my wife is Beverly. I was able to shorten my contract to come home to take care of my wife and our two children. Since I was able to come home the middle of May she has had surgery to have lymph nodes removed on her right side. She had biopsy and abmormal cells removed from her left side as well as a Chemo port installed. We have started the Chemo Therapy cycle now and still have 5 months left before we can schedule her for a double masectomy and then begin daily radiation for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>I am now at the point where I am asking my friends, their friends and every other generous soul to help me pay for her treatment. Beverly is being treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center and is recieving unmatched care, however, Medicaid only pays part and we don't have any other insurance so this has become extremely financially overwhelming and we still have a long way to go. What ever amount that you could give may seem small to you but I can promise you that it means a life time to us. I have loved this wonderful lady for the last 22 years and I want at the very least 22 more.</p>
<p>I cant offer large or significant perks other than I will update everyone on Beverly's continued progress as well as our prayers for everone. Please remember to pass this on to your family and friends as we need all the help we can get. If you leave your name and address we will send you a hand written thankyou card and a pink ribbon. God bless everyone that reads this.</p>

<p><span>Frank Mancinelli saw a need for an easy way to carry multiple loose clubs when his buddy walked out of the woods with clubs sticking every which way, making a trip away from the cart to rescue his ball less enjoyable because he was struggling with his clubs. Surprisingly, Frank found there was no product out there for carrying a few clubs that wasn't bulky and impracticle for everyday use. So he decided to invent it himself. The result is <strong>Extra Caddy.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When you've hit your ball into the woods opposite the cart path, typically you grab a few clubs you might need and take a field trip, often bringing your putter so you have it when you reach the green. You may set those clubs down near the green while you putt. Then you reunite with the cart and put your 3 iron, pitching wedge, putter, etc, back in your golf bag. Unless you left your pitching wedge on the far side of the green. It happens. With Extra Caddy those not so great holes of golf don't get any worse because your clubs are fighting you. You keep those loose clubs together so misplacing one is less likely. And, of course, it makes them easy to carry. It's a simple problem, and the solution is simple. That solution is <strong>Extra Caddy</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>Designed to be as easy to use as a product like this should be, <strong>Extra Caddy</strong> just works, plus it stows easily by clipping to your bag. You look great using it too. Yes, even though you're walking out of the woods and having just overshot the green <strong>Extra Caddy</strong> allows you to do so with style.</span></p>
<p><span>You can stop using handkerchiefs and zipties, stop fumbling with carrying, setting down &amp; picking up, and keeping track of multiple clubs when you're away from your bag. <strong>Extra Caddy</strong> is here. FINALLY.  </span></p>
<p><span>The good news is that Frank and his team have gotten this product to the tipping point. This project is up and running. But to go big we need money to do things including: <strong><em>placing bulk orders to reduce manufacturing costs, redesigning to keep quality but reduce costs, engaging in a marketing campaign, &amp; adapting to what we hope will be growing order fulfillment needs</em></strong>. We feel this is a great product and that with the right resources <strong>Extra Caddy</strong> will be a success. We'd love you to be a part of that!

<p>Scans have returned and they were not great, but it doesn't give me a reason to give up hope.

<p>While continuing my treatment as planned, I am daring to go beyond. Stepping up and taking back control, I am now seeking help and ready to ask for third and fourth opinions. Unfortunatley, due to the rarity of my cancer, there are very few specialists in this country (only five to be exact). This is where you come in... my soldiers and bELIevers. Not one to typically ask for extra help, and always one to acknowledge that I am blessed, I humbly come to you for help.</p>
<p>My family has been so supportive and by my side throughout this entire experience, but we can only afford so much. The specialists that I wish to meet are in Houston, Texas and New York. While my insurance has covered most of my treatments, they do not cover outside consultations. I humbly ask you, if you can, to donate and bELIeve. Donations will be used to cover airfare, traveling expenses, but most importantly the appointment fees. Any little help is extremely appreciated and I can't thank you enough in advance. Any extra funds after these consultations will be saved for either future medical expensives or once recovered and in remission (which I am claming I will be in one day) will be donated; 50% to Cancer Research and 50% to Dancers With Cancer.</p>

are what waits people with this illness as not even doctors know much about it. there is no treatment and research into a cure hasn't been attempted. it is so rare that it only affects 500 families within the world, us being one of them. </p><p>my mum suffered with this illness since she was 18. some days are better then others. on her worst days she stays in bed with a migraine that is so bad that it causes her to lose her eyesight and her memory. she has suffered numerous mini strokes and a few i have sadly witnessed. it has effected her memory to the point where she has become distressed due to the fact of not remembering that she even had children. she cant do simple things like wash her hair or brush her teeth so these things shes needs help to do most of the time. we as a family have dedicated our time to making her as comfortable as possible with the time that we have with her as her illness makes it hard to determine how long we really have left. </p><p>my mum has always

vessels in the brain. strokes, heart attacks, dementia and eventual death are what waits people with this illness as not even doctors know much about it. there is no treatment and research into a cure hasn't been attempted. it is so rare that it only affects 500 families within the world, us being one of them. my mum suffered with this illness since she was 18. some days are better then others. on her worst days she stays in bed with a migraine that is so bad that it causes her to lose her eyesight and her memory. she has suffered numerous mini strokes and a few i have sadly witnessed. it has effected her memory to the point where she has become distressed due to the fact of not remembering that she even had children. she cant do simple things like wash her hair or brush her teeth so these things shes needs help to do most of the time. we as a family have dedicated our time to making her as comfortable as possible with the time that we have with her as her illness makes it hard to determine how long we really have left. my mum has always been the rock that has held our family together, but one day i witnessed all that fall apart and my mum deteriorate until she was so depressed

<h2>About us</h2>
<div class=""clear"">We are Good Ventures, a small ethical product development company based in London, UK. We specialise in developing ethical, natural skincare products. We are a small team of 2, completely boot strapped and self funded. </div>
<div class=""clear""> </div>
<h2>About S5</h2>
<p>Our new range, S5, is a range of treatment skincare products designed to transform stressed, reactive skin into resilient, healthy skin. We see people with stressed skin conditions such as acne, redness, dryness and premature ageing every day and we wanted to develop products that would work for them. </p>
<p>We strongly believe organic and natural is the future of skincare, but we also know people need to see results. The products we've created are the results of months of research into ingredients to find the most effective natural and organic ingredients out there, to match the performance of that nasty chemical stuff you've been putting on your skin. And the research we've done shows that the irritation those chemicals cause can actually lead to skin stress and ageing. </p>
<p>Our products don't do that, they break the cycle of skin stress by limiting exposure to chemical irritants and by stopping skin inflammation in its tracks. They reinforce the natural barrier layer of the skin and help it protect itself against environmental aggressors. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.s5skincare.com/images/S5Skincare/Croppedslides/originals/Arctic.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>How do we do that? By using natural ingredients that have naturally evolved a defence mechanism against stress in extreme environments such as the Arctic, the Desert, the Rainforest, the High Altitude regions and the Sea. These extremophilic ingredients thrive in conditions that would normally kill most life because of adaption mechanisms they've evolved over millions of years. We've harnessed these and put them into the S5 range. </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>The project</h2>
<p>We've designed the products, they are in testing at the moment with our partner lab. We've just secured our first major retail listing (Selfridges department store, London, UK, launching August/September) and we need to invest into brochures and sampling materials. We also need to manufacture all of the products over the next few months, before funds start coming in from our first few sales. We've got most of our funding in place but we need a little bit more to make sure the launch really goes well as we will only get one shot to get it right. </p>
<h2>Where's the Money Go?</h2>
<p>Quality materials and the labor to fill the products (all based in the UK). Quality packaging materials such as 100% recyclable glass  jars (UK based) and FSC board for the beautiful cartons we are creating (also UK based). Once the packaging has been manufactured, we will have enough for several production runs and the new range will be up and running with several customers (hopefully) on board. </p>
<p>This helps us to build a sustainable small, independent product design business that supports an ecosystem of other small businesses, from production to retail. </p>
<h2>How you can get involved</h2>
<p>We'd love you to be one of the first to experience this unique new range and to have the best skin you can have. You can also (if you wish) join the fold of our wonderful product development group who try all new products we develop before the launch and give us their feedback so our products are the best they can be. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> In the Highlands of Scotland there are very few months a year where the weather is suitable for skateboarding activities and there are no indoor facilities to help the kids progress and develop. We aim to open a small indoor ramp for all ages to provide a space for skateboarding.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need funding to pay for the initial build of the ramp and making the space safe for people to use.<br/>
</li>
<li>The ramp will be a low cost admission to help cover bills and repairs. The ramp will be situated in a city center building and open 7 days a week throughout the year.<br/>
</li>
<li>The funds will cover building materials, labor costs, sound proofing and lighting.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>There was a previous facility in our old location which can be seen in the image above. This gave children and teenagers a safe environment to practice and develop their skills whilst benefiting from a larger social group. We observed previously that this helped children gain more confidence and creativity.  We can further develop by running lessons and growing the scene further.<br/><p></p>

<p>My name is Gary Hamilton and I am the creator of the NIK STIK disposable electronic cigarette. I am a former CEO Of Mid America Lumber Company and Vice Chairman of Gilbert and Bennett Manufacturing, a steel company, as well as JGH Acquisition which was a holding company. In an effort to produce the finest disposable electronic cigarette available, I enlisted the help of Dr. Peter Wirshing, PHD in biochemistry whom was previously employed as a research scientist at Scripps in La Jolla, California. Dr. Wirshing now resides in China and oversees all aspects of NIK STIK production, design, quality control and logistics.</p>
<p>For a very long time, I have deplored the negative effects the smoking of tobacco cigarettes has had on people. It destroys their health, has a terrible odor, burns clothing and furniture, and pollutes the air that other people breathe. And it sometimes results in death. Although I no longer smoke tobacco cigarettes - I quit as a young Marine in Vietnam of all places - I suffered through the deaths of both parents and a sister brought on by cancer. They each were very heavy ong time smokers. Another sister lost her husband to lung cancer at age 43. I would like to see tobacco cigarettes become a thing of the past as soon as possible and that is what this campaign is about: To convince people that there is a way of weaning themselves from tobacco with the NIK STIK.</p>
<p>Yearly, there are about 1.7 billion cartons of cigarettes sold in the U S. Although that number is slowly declining as taxes on cigarettes continue to climb, it is still ruining lives by the millions in this country. With the NIK STIK disposable electronic cigarettes, a tobacco smoker can achieve the same satisfaction without the filthy smoke and carcinogens which number in the hundreds. You see, the NIK STIK contains nicotine just like a tobacco cigarette. This is what satisfies the craving. Nicotine by itself, although addictive much like caffeine, is a naturally occurring substance that is even found in some vegetables. Nicotine is not the cause of all the problems from smoking tobacco. You see, the cigarette manufacturers put hundreds of ingredients in their product to make them taste good. this includes things like dozens of spices and sugars. All of these things are burned including the tobacco and cigarette paper and then sucked into the lungs. That is what makes people sick and short of breath and creates respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>I am looking to raise $1 million in funding which will pay for product production and inventory, print advertising and radio campaigns, marketing tools such as in store displays, and a concentrated sales effort in the field. The cigarette companies abhor a product such as this. After all, who needs them when a smoker can get the same enjoyment from a NIK STIK. And guess what? Smokers will save a ton of money when they get off of tobacco cigarettes and use the NIK STIK. You see, each NIK STIK is equal to three packs of cigarettes. Big $$ savings of $1000 or more per year. Although $1million is the desired contribution for a rapid campaign success, a lesser amount of money will also be effective but at a slower rate. Remember, the whole idea is a way of weaning smokers from the big tobacco cartel. They are the pusher man. And by the way, the government is part of the problem as they add their taxes so as to further hurt the addicted tobacco smoker.</p>
<p>We will make a real difference when we get the NIK STIK in the hands of smokers. They will enjoy the same smoking pleasure while enjoying the NIK STIK which looks like a cigarette, has smoke (atomized water vapor) like a cigarette, lights up on the end when puffed (LED) like a cigarette, and tastes like a cigarette. And all of this for a lot less money. Please help us wean smokers from their nasty and unhealthy habit. Let's get rid of second hand smoke, and let's put a dent in the BIG TOBACCO/GOVERNMENT CARTEL. Even a small contribution will be helpful. Your $25 contribution will get you one each of a regular and menthol NIK STIK for you to use your self or to pass on to someone you know that smokes. They will thank you as this will provide them a way of breaking from the chains that bind them to their addictive tobaco cigarettes. This product has a chance to change the world. Become a part of it and please let everyone you know about this worthwhile effort. Thank you for your support.</p></div>","STOP SECOND HAND SMOKE !! Help people stop smoking & save lives.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Chaya Grossberg, writer for Mad in America and my own popular blog <a href=""http://www.chayagrossberg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chayagrossberg.com</a>. My dream has been for the past decade-plus to help every single person who wants to come off psychiatric pharmaceuticals to do so. I have helped many people get off psychiatric drugs through my consultations, support groups I have led, and writings. I have worked with thousands of individuals at Freedom Center, Western Massachusetts Recovery Learning Community, Alternative to Meds Center, Portland Hearing Voices, Mental Health Association of Portland, Mental Health Association of San Francisco's Warm Line. The next mission is to write a book ""Breaking free from psychiatric drugs"" guiding people how to come off psychiatric drugs. This book will include my extensive experience over the last 10 years and I will also be interviewing many experts for the book. The editorial advisory board for the book includes Advisory Board: Jon Keyes, Matthew Morrissey, Celia Brown, George Badillo, Nancy Rubenstein Delgiudice Gottsteinm Delphine Brody, and Lyle Murphy.<br/><br/>We need to raise money to cover the costs of writing, interviewing, editing, and printing the book. So we are turning to you to help support us. In return we are offering a variety of perks, from books, healing sessions, detox guidance, massage, and cleaning services. Your contribution will help us get this book written, and spread the book out to the various networks. Thanks!</span><br/>

<div>As a consultant I have helped many people get off psychiatric drugs. Here are some of their testimonials:</div>
<div>
<p>Chaya Love, your article has me all teary eyed.  You are such an inspiration to me! When we first met, I sought out your expertise, as a peer mentor and as someone who had successfully tapered off all psych drugs. What transpired during our sessions was profoundly healing for me. You met me where I was, never above me, and showed me a true picture of the gifts I had within, to be shared with the world. I felt so understood and seen through your keen insight. You awakened in me, treasures and as you spoke them aloud, I knew that my voice was important. You told me that you saw me speaking in front of large crowds and that made me very nervous yet excited all at once.

</div></div>","I am Chaya Grossberg, writer for Mad in America and my own popular blog www.chayagrossberg.com. My dream has been for the past decade-plus to help every single person who wants to come off psychiatric pharmaceuticals to do so. I have helped many people get off psychiatric drugs through my consultations, support groups I have led, and writings. I have worked with thousands of individuals at Freedom Center, Western Massachusetts Recovery Learning Community, Alternative to Meds Center, Portland Hearing Voices, Mental Health Association of Portland, Mental Health Association of San Francisco's Warm Line. The next mission is to write a book ""Breaking free from psychiatric drugs"" guiding people how to come off psychiatric drugs. This book will include my extensive experience over the last 10 years and I will also be interviewing many experts for the book. The editorial advisory board for the book includes Advisory Board: Jon Keyes, Matthew Morrissey, Celia Brown, George Badillo, Nancy Rubenstein Delgiudice Gottsteinm Delphine Brody, and Lyle Murphy.We need to raise money to cover the costs of writing, interviewing, editing, and printing the book. So we are turning to you to help support us. In return we are offering a variety of perks, from books, healing sessions, detox guidance, massage, and cleaning services. Your contribution will help us get this book written, and spread the book out to the various networks. Thanks!


As a consultant I have helped many people get off psychiatric drugs. Here are some of their testimonials:

Chaya Love, your article has me all teary eyed.  You are such an inspiration to me! When we first met, I sought out your expertise, as a peer mentor and as someone who had successfully tapered off all psych drugs. What transpired during our sessions was profoundly healing for me. You met me where I was, never above me, and showed me a true picture of the gifts I had within, to be shared with the world. I felt so understood and seen through your keen insight. You awakened in me, treasures and as you spoke them aloud, I knew that my voice was important. You told me that you saw me speaking in front of large crowds and that made me very nervous yet excited all at once. The thing is, being in your presence, I recognized myself beyond all roles and labels and was able to take my place in the orchestra of life, center stage. Thank you for all that you share and be!– Ayin Cushnir, Portland, OR

once told me that living life with a chronic illness would be easy, that a
doctor would diagnose you, give you treatment and you would be able to go back
to living life the way you knew before. I never really took this into
consideration as I thought “that will never happen to me, a family member,
anybody I hold close to my heart”. But, unfortunately, I was wrong. <br/><br/>
This is my mother’s story.<br/><br/>
It all started six years ago, waking up one morning to a new day. Something was
wrong, my mom began having troubles seeing, blurry and double vision, constant
migraines, dizziness, and much more. Doctors visit after doctor’s visit, nobody
knew what was wrong. It was all just thought to be strabismus, which further
lead to eye surgery. For a solid month after surgery, my mother’s vision and
pain was outstanding, it was like she had a new set of eyes. No pain and clear
vision. But it didn’t last long. At <a href=""#_msocom_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>[td1]</u></a> moment, symptom after symptom of what seemed to
be “Lyme disease” started showing up. Let me tell you, my mom and dad LOVE the
outdoors, if they could be anywhere in the world it would be in BC, sitting in
a lawn chair enjoying the scenery and the beautiful atmosphere. As my mom later figured out, this Is where her
disease took place, and took over her body, her well-being, her relationships
and more importantly, her own life. Six years have come and gone and 9 months
ago, after begging to be tested for Lyme disease and blood work done in Canada constantly
showing up negative, further action began to take place. Blood work was sent to
the USA, resulting in a big POSITIVE.<span>  My
mother knew well enough to make herself aware of Lyme disease, but she wasn’t at
all prepared for it and what the disease would do to her, al the symptoms her
body would be putting her through. Panick attacks, migraines, arthritis,
stomach aches, nauseas, numbness, weakness in her limbs, stiff neck, memory
loss, insomnia, constant vomiting, tingling sensations, heart problems,
twitching in her face, night sweats, shortness of breath, diarrhea, unexplained
shaking, seizures, depression, light sensitivity, this was just the start of
all her symptoms, all her excruciating pain she was about to go through. There are days I don’t even know how she is still surviving
and finding the courage, hope, and strength to wake up each day and go about
it, repeatedly telling herself that she is okay and she is getting better, but
she finds it within herself and all her pain, to face another day. I don’t know how she does it, but she is my
biggest role model and inspiration. This, is my mother’s story. <br/><br/>
“The road to recovery never runs straight, flat, and smooth, with no bumps or
hills. I’ve taken many steps forward and many more backward, mentally and
physically. But the bravest thing I ever did was continuing my life when all I wanted
to do is die.”<br/><br/>
My goal is to raise money for treatment for my best friend, my mother, but the
more important goal of mine is spreading her story and letting her know she is not
alone, thousands are suffering. If 5,000 is raised, my mom can see the light in
treatment and a better tomorrow, if 10,000 is raised, my mom has a chance of
seeing an even brighter future ahead of her. If more than my goal of 10,000 is
contributed, all remaining money will be donated towards LymeLife Charity.<br/>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">LidFlush replaces the traditional flush lever on your toilet with a magnetic tether which engages your toilet seat lid. The toilet flushes simply by closing the lid. By requiring the lid to be closed when the toilet is flushed, aerosolized bacteria is suppressed. In addition, LidFlush ends the contention between couples over whether or not the toilet seat should be up or down.</span></p>

</div><div>
<div>
<div>LidFlush is a retrofit product that will fit most ""gravity flush"" toilets. LidFlush installs under the toilet tank lid, providing a slide for a magnetic tether which attaches to the ""flapper valve"". This replaces the traditional lever and chain.<br/>

<p><b>Requirements</b>

<p></p>
<div>
<b>Note: </b>LidFlush may not work with some artisan toilets due to tank design.<br/><br/><b>Q.</b> Will LidFlush permanently alter my toilet?<br/><b>A.</b> No. LidFlush is a retrofit product which can be removed without damage to your toilet.<br/><br/><b>Q.</b> How does LidFlush attach to my toilet?<br/><b>A.</b> A plastic tether guide rests on top of the tank wall, and a metal disk is affixed to the toilet lid using a removable adhesive.<br/><br/><b>Q.</b> Can I put the lid down without flushing to save water?<br/><b>A.</b> Yes, the production unit will have a flush optional function built-in.<br/>
<b>Q.</b> I am concerned about the gap between the lid and tank.<br/><b>A.</b> The production unit will be significantly refined to minimize the gap. In addition, an optional decorative trim will be provided to close any remaining gap. The gap is required to allow the tether to move freely.<br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<b>The Hygiene</b><br/>
</div>
<div>in 1975 Dr. Charles Gerba (known widely as Dr Germ) released a research paper on the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC187159/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">microbiological hazards of household toilets</a>. Referred to as the ""Toilet Plume"" Clostridium difficile, which is known to cause diarrhea, is sprayed 25 centimeters, or nearly 10 inches, above the toilet seat when you flush without putting the lid down, This aerosolized bacteria persists in the air for 12 minutes after flushing with the toilet lid open.</div>

<div>Steve and Chris have both run successful service based businesses both in B2B and B2C markets, and we are both avid problem solvers accustomed to working in lean startup mode. We've taken a serious look at the problems we wanted to solve, and how to engineer the simplest solution (which is usually always the best solution).

<p>We have partnered with a local plastic component manufacturer with 24 
years in business who has demonstrated the technical and business 
competency, including fortune 500 customers. We are confident this was

</div></div>","What is LidFlush?
LidFlush replaces the traditional flush lever on your toilet with a magnetic tether which engages your toilet seat lid. The toilet flushes simply by closing the lid. By requiring the lid to be closed when the toilet is flushed, aerosolized bacteria is suppressed. In addition, LidFlush ends the contention between couples over whether or not the toilet seat should be up or down.



Note: This is a prototype unit. The production unit will be significantly refined.

How does it work?


LidFlush is a retrofit product that will fit most ""gravity flush"" toilets. LidFlush installs under the toilet tank lid, providing a slide for a magnetic tether which attaches to the ""flapper valve"". This replaces the traditional lever and chain.



Note: Prototype shown in video, production unit will operate more elegantly
Requirements


The height of the toilet lid must be higher than the top of the tank (see below)
The tank wall must be vertical like a standard toilet

 


Note: LidFlush may not work with some artisan toilets due to tank design.Q. Will LidFlush permanently alter my toilet?A. No. LidFlush is a retrofit product which can be removed without damage to your toilet.Q. How does LidFlush attach to my toilet?A. A plastic tether guide rests on top of the tank wall, and a metal disk is affixed to the toilet lid using a removable adhesive.Q. Can I put the lid down without flushing to save water?A. Yes, the production unit will have a flush optional function built-in.
Q. I am concerned about the gap between the lid and tank.A. The production unit will be significantly refined to minimize the gap. In addition, an optional decorative trim will be provided to close any remaining gap. The gap is required to allow the tether to move freely.


The Impact


The Hygiene

in 1975 Dr. Charles Gerba (known widely as Dr Germ) released a research paper on the microbiological hazards of household toilets. Referred to as the ""Toilet Plume"" Clostridium difficile, which is known to cause diarrhea, is sprayed 25 centimeters, or nearly 10 inches, above the toilet seat when you flush without putting the lid down, This aerosolized bacteria persists in the air for 12 minutes after flushing with the toilet lid open.

The Harmony
LidFlush provides one less point of contention for couples and families. By fundamentally changing the way the toilet flushes (making the lid the flush lever), nobody has to give anything up and everyone wins.
We have designed LidFlush to be easy to install by anyone with a pair of plyers (if needed) and no technical expertise. By lowering the barrier for adoption, we believe we are further empowering those who wish to promote better cleanliness in the bathroom.


Additional benefits are provided including :


Suppression of aerosolized bacteria
Better aesthetic appearance of restroom
Keeps pets and children out of toilet

<p> </p>
<p><span>     I would like to tell you about my friend Dan Wile. He is a child of God, son, brother, husband, father, uncle, cousin, friend...and he has Pancreatic Cancer. Since his diagnosis 2 years ago, Dan has not let his cancer define him but rather as an opportunity to experience miracles in his life. He is now in need of more miracles.</span></p>
<p><span>     Dan’s story began on a farm in Souderton, PA. By the age of 12 he knew he was here to help others and so he began his career as a Respiratory Therapist by enrolling in the Respiratory Therapy Program at Gwynedd Mercy College. Graduating in 1983, Dan has provided patient care in a variety of areas - teaching hospitals, community hospitals, long term facilities and most recently in home care. His compassion and dedication to his patients has never wavered. Now he is need of that same compassion.</span></p>
<p><span>     It was August 2010 that life changed forever for the Wile family. Married to his soul mate Ruth Ann since 1991, the couple has been blessed with two wonderful children: Alex, 19 years old and Sharra, 15 years old. While assisting with Ventilator Camp, Dan began experiencing extreme fatigue and digestive problems.Rapid weight loss over the next few weeks led him to seek answers. The devastating diagnosis of Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer came quickly. Some sobering facts on Pancreatic Cancer:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><span>It is the 4th most common cause of cancer related deaths worldwide</span></li>
<li><span>95% of patients will not be alive in 5 years</span></li>
<li><span>Complete remission is rare</span></li>
<li><span>In 2010, there were 43,000 cases diagnosed in the US</span></li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p><span>     Standard treatment in the US includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Dan underwent a pancreato-duodenectomy ( Whipple Procedure ) requiring 3 weeks of hospitalization and 6 weeks later began chemotherapy. Dan was not given much hope as to the outcome of treatment and was advised to have his affairs in order. But Dan’s unwavering faith and support of his family and friends provided him with a miracle - his health began to return. He gained weight, his stamina increased and his mission to help others was as strong as ever. He returned to his job with PrO2 Respiratory Services after only 6 months. </span></p>
<p><span>     Dan strove to return to a normal life, to make the most of this gift of more time that he had been given. When an opportunity to change careers was presented to him, he did not hesitate. As the person who replaced him, I can attest to the level of respect and affection of those whom he helped and worked with. He made a difference in the lives of so many people. And then the floor dropped out again. This summer Dan began to lose weight, his energy was not what it once was. Tests revealed the cancer had metastasized to his lungs. The next battle had begun.</span></p>

     I would like to tell you about my friend Dan Wile. He is a child of God, son, brother, husband, father, uncle, cousin, friend...and he has Pancreatic Cancer. Since his diagnosis 2 years ago, Dan has not let his cancer define him but rather as an opportunity to experience miracles in his life. He is now in need of more miracles.
     Dan’s story began on a farm in Souderton, PA. By the age of 12 he knew he was here to help others and so he began his career as a Respiratory Therapist by enrolling in the Respiratory Therapy Program at Gwynedd Mercy College. Graduating in 1983, Dan has provided patient care in a variety of areas - teaching hospitals, community hospitals, long term facilities and most recently in home care. His compassion and dedication to his patients has never wavered. Now he is need of that same compassion.
     It was August 2010 that life changed forever for the Wile family. Married to his soul mate Ruth Ann since 1991, the couple has been blessed with two wonderful children: Alex, 19 years old and Sharra, 15 years old. While assisting with Ventilator Camp, Dan began experiencing extreme fatigue and digestive problems.Rapid weight loss over the next few weeks led him to seek answers. The devastating diagnosis of Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer came quickly. Some sobering facts on Pancreatic Cancer:
 

It is the 4th most common cause of cancer related deaths worldwide
95% of patients will not be alive in 5 years
Complete remission is rare
In 2010, there were 43,000 cases diagnosed in the US
 
     Standard treatment in the US includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Dan underwent a pancreato-duodenectomy ( Whipple Procedure ) requiring 3 weeks of hospitalization and 6 weeks later began chemotherapy. Dan was not given much hope as to the outcome of treatment and was advised to have his affairs in order. But Dan’s unwavering faith and support of his family and friends provided him with a miracle - his health began to return. He gained weight, his stamina increased and his mission to help others was as strong as ever. He returned to his job with PrO2 Respiratory Services after only 6 months. 
     Dan strove to return to a normal life, to make the most of this gift of more time that he had been given. When an opportunity to change careers was presented to him, he did not hesitate. As the person who replaced him, I can attest to the level of respect and affection of those whom he helped and worked with. He made a difference in the lives of so many people. And then the floor dropped out again. This summer Dan began to lose weight, his energy was not what it once was. Tests revealed the cancer had metastasized to his lungs. The next battle had begun.
     That brings Dan’s story to present day...and how we can all be a part of it. At present, the US medical community cannot offer Dan any viable treatment. His search for hope had led him to Bad Salzhausen, Germany and Dr. Herzog’s Special Hospital for Integrated Oncology and Hyperthermia Center. The clinic has helped many patients with  a treatment consisting of hyperthermia therapy ( up to 107 degrees) and moderate doses of chemotherapy. Dan has been accepted as a patient, his passport is on the way  ...and now the cost. $50,000. His family and friends ask you to consider a donation to help the family defray the costs.

<strong>Hi! I'm Dani Slepian, and I'm an HIV/AIDS Certified Registered Nurse from Boston, MA, USA, volunteering for 3 months with the Centre for Popular Education and Human Rights, Ghana, a human rights organization that works with the MSM community (Men wh</strong>o have sex with Men) on HIV education and prevention.</h3>
<p>For the past nearly eight years, I've worked with HIV+ gay men at Fenway Health in Boston, New England's largest community health center serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population.  Having seen the ravages of HIV both personally and professionally over the last twenty years, I am passionate about HIV education and prevention, specifically within the MSM community. </p>
<p>The Drop in Centre's purpose is to provide stigma (and cost) free care to MSMs for both HIV testing and treatment of STIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections).  The Drop in Centre is open once a week from 9 AM to 5 PM.  By donating to CEPEHRG's Drop in Centre, you will be funding free consultations and medications for MSMs.  The level of stigma these men face from Ghanaian society at large is incredibly high.  MSMs in Ghana seek health care at a much lower rate than the general population.  17% of those testing for HIV are testing positive for the first time.</p>
<p>All the money raised will go to direct care costs.  The full-time nurse who staffs the centre - and diagnoses and treats the patients seen there - is a volunteer.  </p>
<p>The centre only needs $1000 to operate for another 3 months.  I will match the first $250 that's donated.  So, really, we only need to raise $750!</p>
<p>The rate of HIV infection in Ghana is still at about 2%.  By donating to this cause, you are helping to reach the UNAIDS vision of ""Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths.""</p>
<p>With the extremely generous support of many of you in 2008, we were able to raise over $6,000 for the Gay Men's Domestic Violence Project (now known as the GLBTQ Domestic Violence Project).  I believe that this campaign can be equally successful in reaching its goal.</p>
<p>I realize that not everyone is able to contribute monetarily.  If you aren't able to give at this time, please just help spread the word.  This nifty site, Indiegogo, has share tools - please use them!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<p>This campaign will help fund my own piece of unique tech to help save lives (and<br/>much more)  in the form of our Remote Emergency Device or R.E.D</p>
<p>You will be able to help me fund the final stages of prototyping, finalising the end<br/>design and safety testing before I look to launch the device on the world<br/>stage.</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I have already invested over £2000 in tools, software and hardware for R.E.D but we have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>To finalise our prototype safety device will cost £8000 and should take no longer than six months to get a fully functional device up and running. This includes finalising patents.</p>
<p>The remaining funds will help to pay for </p>
<p>£4000 on additional software creation and licensing<br/>£5000 safety testing and certification</p>
<p>I will be looking to match the initial goal in order to pay for my time as will be committing my full attention to the project. The projects requirements mean I will not<br/>have time to stay in full time employment but need to be able to still provide for my family.</p>
<p>Any funds raised will be able to go into the project but will reduce the impact by<br/>stretching the time to complete the prototype.</p>
<p>Please remember that initial production, testing and sales of R.E.D will only be available in the UK to start with. We will however look to rolling out production and sales to other countries later. We expect this to start no later than one year after full production begins.</p>
<p>Please help and choose from one of the three initial perks of Contibutor, Assistant or Trialist. More perks will be added as the campaign gather momentum.</p>
<p>You will be able to choose/change your perk as they are added dependent on funds raised.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>With more people using the roads everyday there is also an increasing amount of accidents and thefts of vehicles.</p>
<p>In the UK there is a need for change to help reduce thefts and assist with accident<br/>recovery.</p>
<p>The device proposed in this campaign is aimed at helping with both these<br/>issues.</p>
<p>This new device will be able to once installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Report an accident of a serious nature to the emergency services </li>
<li>Provide the location where the accident has occurred</li>
<li>Provide tracking of a stolen vehicle</li>

<p>The aim is to keep this initial functionality at a consumer cost of approx £100-£150.<br/>Additional functionality is added at extra cost dependent on the consumers<br/>requirements.</p>
<p>The entire device is small enough to be fitted to any Truck, Car, Motorcycle and even push bike. There are some other unique features that will be implemented into the final prototype and the details of which will be revealed later on.</p>
<p>Apart from push bikes, the device will be integrated into the vehicles engine control<br/>for remote disabling and will be hidden so once fitted it can not be tampered with or disabled by criminals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Updated information</em></strong></p>
<p>I would like to add more information with regards to R.E.D and push bikes.</p>
<p>The device has two iterations with one for motorised vehicles and one for<br/>push bikes. The technology for the push bikes is reduced in size and retains<br/>the functionality for accident reporting as well as anti theft tracking<br/>system.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that your bike is stolen, you will be able to track<br/>the device anywhere in the world via the applications. We are working<br/>on an new on-board battery that will last at least one month before<br/>needing a recharge.</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals</b></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My brother, David, was in a horrible freak car accident when he was heading home from the store.  There was a lady traveling in the opposite direction that hit a sign causing it and more importantly its base to come into my brother's lane.  The sign base came through the roof of the truck he was driving right at the top of the windshield hitting him in the face and chest.  Luckily for David, our father was in the truck and immediately performed first aid and got life flight immediately dispatched.  He ended up with a broken neck (luckily no paralysis), a pulverized jaw, a broken clavicle, a broken scapula and many other injuries.  He has fought back and is in stable condition and will soon be released to go home.  He now begins a long recovery process which will include multiple surgeries and an estimated year recovery time to be back to a medical device and procedure free lifestyle.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>David's family consists of himself, his wife Keely (of three years) and his brand new baby Evelyn who was born in June.  With the blessing of a new child, they purchased a new home in Stansbury Park in August and were building their dream life.  His job has promised to hold his spot, but he is a dispatcher which requires him to be on the phone and to be running multiple computers, scanners, and phones all at the same time so he isn't likely to be able to return to work until this surgeries are all complete.  This puts him and his wife in a serious income crunch has he hasn't worked at his current job long enough to receive long term disability through his employer.  This puts a strain on all the families involved as we try and sacrifice and find the money to keep their mortgage payments paid and food for him and his baby.  My aunt had saw this site on television so her and I decided to see if we could try and raise money to help them with their mortgage payments.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we are looking for is enough money to give to David and Keely so that their mortgage can be paid for the next year while David is rehabbing and trying to get back to his job.  His mortgage is roughly $1,100 a month and so $1,100 x 12 months = our $13,200 goal.  Donations will go only for their mortgage payments and if David is able to return to work before a year he would gladly refund money to those people who helped him out.   Donors will be given updates frequently about David and how he is doing as well as all the thanks that our family can give.  (Not to mention an untold amount of good karma).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Prayers, prayers and more prayers.  My brother has been powered by prayer since his accident on Thursday December 29th, 2011.  There is also a donation account set up for David at U.S. Bank and people can make donations there.  Also, if you have other ideas about how you could help their family would love to hear about it.  Please shoot me an email and we can discuss anything you would like: richard.sohler@gmail.com.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br/></p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Rosemary, a Registered Nurse, music artist, and cancer survivor (you can learn more about me at rosemaryphelan.com). This campaign is my effort to bring comfort to some of the two million kids, teens, and adults who will undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation this year because of a cancer diagnosis. Jessica and Wendi work with me to help make this vision a reality (go team)!</p>
<p> <em>The Girl with the Curl</em> and the <em>Curls for Kids</em> campaign were founded with the intention of solving a simple but profound problem in the cancer community: finding an ideal solution to the hair loss that accompanies chemotherapy. This might seem like a minor issue in the face of something as dire as a cancer diagnosis, but go on any cancer chat group and you’ll quickly see how much discomfort and distress people suffer over this unfortunate side effect of their treatment. Having been through it myself, I now understand why.</p>
<h3>The problem we set out to solve</h3>
<p> “Cancer hats” and “chemo scarves” are like a flashing sign announcing “I have cancer!” They do nothing to help protect one’s health privacy. Wigs are too uncomfortable (or even downright painful) on a chemo-sensitive scalp, which often feels “sunburned”. Cancer patients spend tons of money on them (those that have it) and mostly can’t bear to wear them. And it’s important to mention that many families affected by cancer can’t afford any of those alternatives, and the options that are available for free are very limited. Kids and teens especially need a better solution, as their hair is so important to their sense of identity.</p>
<p> Enter The Girl with the Curl Demi-Wig Kit. Here’s how it works: the kit provides everything a chemo patient (or their mom or dad) needs to make a comfortable, beautiful demi-wig from their own hair. The hair is cut at home or the salon (using a special method) after the first chemo treatment, just before it begins to fall out. The very simple kit (no sewing) can be made up the same day and worn the next, which means there’s no “bald time” at all. It can then be worn with almost any type of hat. Simple and inexpensive, but profoundly comforting and empowering. I came up with this idea when I was going through chemo myself, and can attest to it’s practicality, comfort, and effectiveness. That’s what made me determined to create a kit for everyone else who wants to do this for themselves or a loved one.</p>
<h3>How you can be part of the solution</h3>
<p> Here’s why The Girl with the Curl needs you: because we cannot afford to offer these kits for free, we can’t advertise them to the very population who needs them in places where they would easily find the information: cancer groups and help sites, hospitals, etc. Take a look and  you’ll see that all the goods and services that are offered through these venues are free of cost. Which is awesome, but we’re not there yet. That’s where you come in. Hopefully someday we will have some corporate sponsors to cover our costs so we CAN offer the kits for free. Until that time, my team and are willing to work our buns off making up kits and getting them out to the folks who need them (and maybe can’t pay for them), but to do so we need to buy the materials, pay for shipping, sewing, etc., etc. You can see our dilemma.</p>
<p> Every $35 donation pays all the costs of getting one of our fantastic kits made and shipped off to a child or adult in need. Every donated kit will link the recipient with the donor (unless the donor wishes to remain anonymous), so the recipient can send a thank you (and maybe even a photo!), and tell the donor about themselves and what the kit means to them. We’re not (yet) a non-profit org, but you’ll also get a donation receipt from us for your records.</p>
<p> If your feeling us but just don’t have the funds to donate, maybe you can share this campaign info with someone who’s got a few dollars to spare. We’d be deeply grateful to you for that. Or just send them on over to thegirlwiththecurl.com, where they can donate through the “donate” page on the site in any amount they wish – even $10 is a help.</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p> Thanks so much for your time. We hope you never need one of our kits yourself, but if you do, we’re here for you.  J  Rosemary, Jessica, and Wendi. xo</p></div>","The Girl with the Curl & Curls for Kids

<p>Having a
congenital heart defect has provided many challenges throughout my life, but I
have always tried to remain physically active in one way or another. Like any
other challenge in life, there is always an opportunity
to learn, grow, change, and adapt, and while
the list of lessons I have learned from having a congenital heart defect is
long, one lesson has remained a constant fixture
throughout: persevere. Whether it’s dealing with
a medical issue, or fighting through that last mile on a long run, perseverance
is my greatest strength and a lesson I am
continually relearning. </p>

<p>The financial goal for the campaign
is to raise $500 USD by November 30, 2014. Any and all donations go directly to ACHA.
Donators can take advantage of the great perks that come along with the
campaign such as Facebook shout-outs, personalized thank-you messages, ACHA care packages, and
special race-day thanks, with your name printed on the back of my race jersey. All of these perks are of course optional and donators
are not obligated to claim a perk after donating. Additionally,
because ACHA is a 501(c)(3), any donations made to this campaign are tax
deductible. This campaign will be a flex funded,
which means that if we do not meet our fundraising goal, all donations
will still go directly to ACHA, but with a
higher percentage claimed by indiegogo. </p>

<p>Partnering with the Adult
Congenital Heart Association to run five marathons over the next year provides
a great opportunity to both push myself physically and benefit a great
non-profit organization. The work of ACHA ranges from advocacy work on a
congressional level to contributions to research in the cardiovascular health
fields. They offer support and educational resources on
congenital heart defects for patients and their
family members, and provide medical services
through their network of ACHA clinics. Having a congenital heart defect myself,
I am keenly aware that at times having a congenital heart defect can be
confusing, lonely, scary, and intimidating – but also empowering and liberating. The work of the
ACHA directly helps those individuals with congenital heart defects, and
through this campaign you and I can help support that work, with all proceeds donated going directly to ACHA.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The most obvious risk that faces the campaign is the risk of
injury or illness in the time leading up to the marathon. While this would have
little to no impact on the donations to ACHA through the campaign, it would
be a major disappointment to the overall stated goal of the campaign. Consequently, I treat the marathon distance with respect with
a gradual, well-rounded training program that includes long runs, speed
workouts, and cross-training on the bike as well as strength training. I
also eat well and
listen to my body. This means I take care to build rest days into my routine in
order to prevent over-training and injury. While life is life and accidents do happen, I
am confident in both my ability and my preparation, and
look forward to race day! </p>

<p>There are so many ways to be a part of this campaign beyond
a financial donation. Some of the ways anybody can help with the campaign
include: spreading the word anywhere and everywhere about the campaign, visiting ACHA home page to get involved with and
educated on their mission and goals, following the campaign’s and ACHA’s Facebook pages to stay
up-to-date on all the latest happenings, and
simply being a voice of awareness for those with

The sensors were imprecise and only provided very scattered data points, while none of the devices contained the combination of five sensors we wanted to use as the basis of the MAP Health Watcher service.So we had to go into hardware development too – while our doctors and scientists were hard at work on refining the artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning mechanisms, eliminating unwanted noise from the data and overcoming countless other issues.This medical-grade wearable device is capable of delivering data of high-enough quality to support our cloud-based service driven by the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence.  Simply wearing the MAP Health Watch allows us to collect and process medical data in real time and respond immediately in the event of any issue of concern. If our algorithm recognizes any known pattern of a developing disease, we notify you and our medical team provides instant and tailored advice.   All this based on pioneering artificial intelligence developed by the MAP Health Watcher team.When we ship your MAP Health Watch, you’ll be given the choice of a Gold ($30/month) or Platinum ($50/month) service pack. If you have signed up for a perk with 3 or 6 months' full service included, you will automatically receive the Silver pack, which is only available for Indiegogo backers. HOW IT WORKS   MEDICAL CASES Heart attackA heart attack is caused by a blockage to the coronary arteries. This blockage often develops gradually over a number of years and can cause chest discomfort of varying severity.A large number of heart attacks and sudden heart-related deaths could be prevented through the use of the MAP Health Watch.Chest discomfort can have a variety of causes. It is extremely important to know whether any chest pains, breathing difficulties, numbness or tightening are occurring as a result of coronary artery disease. If the user experiences any of these complaints, the MAP Health Watch can help by taking an instant ECG reading. With the help of special algorithms, the data recorded is then immediately analyzed by health professionals. If there is any suspicion of an irregularity, the user is advised to consult a medical professional immediately. Treatment administered in good time can save lives and help ensure a long, full and active life for the user. FALLS AND ROAD ACCIDENTSWith the help of its built-in gyroscope, the MAP Health Watch can immediately detect and send notifications of any falls, road accidents or other similar situations. This means allows assistance to be provided as soon as possible.Falling down at home and not being able to call anyone for help is one of the biggest fears for elderly people who live alone. It is also normal for younger people to be afraid of having an accident and not having anyone around to provide assistance. In the event of loss of mobility or consciousness, the injured person is often unable to call for assistance at a time when every second counts. Professional help sent in time by the MAP Health Watcher team therefore has the potential to save thousands of lives. DEHYDRATIONDehydration is a huge and potentially life-threatening problem, especially for the elderly, but also for athletes, people who carry out physically demanding work and those who spend time in conditions of extreme heat. Wearing the MAP Health Watch can help detect dehydration. This is something completely new, an innovation on a global scale.Our own research has shown that certain changes to the pulse can establish with high probability that the user is suffering from dehydration.Dehydration, which may seem banal but is in fact life-threatening, has been found to be responsible for the poor health of elderly people on countless occasions. Older people are more exposed to the dangers of dehydration as the sensitivity of the brain to thirst is significantly reduced as people get older. USE CASES Measure and predictBy taking vital measurements of your body and analyzing the resulting data, the MAP Health Watcher system can help detect the early signs of serious health issues, including numerous heart conditions and certain types of stroke, allowing you to take preventative or remedial action. React to emergenciesBecause the MAP Health Watch device is equipped with an accelerometer and clinical-grade medical sensors, it can detect if your loved one should suffer a fall or accident, and even a heart attack.If the readings report anything abnormal, the MAP Health Watcher team of qualified doctors will instantly notify relatives or close friends, as well as the relevant emergency services*. The device is also equipped with a panic button to allow users to issue a manual alert.*If available in your region. Monitor health and fitnessWe all want to lead a healthier lifestyle, but how do we know if we are making progress towards our goals? The MAP Health Watch monitors stress levels, recovery time after exercise and steps taken so you can track your health and fitness in the long term, assessing your stress levels and any improvements you have made so you can stay informed and stay motivated! WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYWhile traditional health care has always been focused on treatment rather than cure, that is about to change with the advent of artificial intelligence. This revolution is being led by a variety of enterprises and projects, such as MAP Health Watcher, says Japanese professor and intelligence systems experts Dr. Hamido Fujita.About MAP

  TIMELINE   MESSAGE FROM THE FOUNDERSWe are an ambitious group of medical professionals, mathematicians, and developers who have spent years forging scientifically grounded algorithms to analyze real-time health data in order to spot the very earliest signs of illnesses.This service was the reason we created MAP Health Watch.Our early thinking was that existing smartwatches would be the perfect way to collect this data - but we soon recognized it wasn’t going to be that simple.The sensors used on conventional smartwatches and fitness watches simply aren’t complex or accurate enough to allow us to collect the quality of data we need.We realized we’d have to develop our own device with clinical-grade sensors that are reliable enough to provide accurate medical data.And that’s what we’ve spent the last three years doing. SHIPPINGThe estimated shipping date for the MAP Health Watch packs is December 2017. Production will begin in November, so we expect to be able to deliver the product by Christmas.QUESTION?If you didn't find the information you were looking for on this page, please leave a comment and we'll respond to you within 12 hours. The MAP Health Watcher Team",19.0,7,"1 Campaign

When I think back on the meals my family prepared, I remember all-natural, wholesome foods that tasted great and satisfied my hunger.

At that time, our society was not plagued with problems like obesity, high blood pressure and we never even heard of cancer.</p><p>After arriving in the United States, I was suddenly faced with a different food reality; high fat, high sugar, high cholesterol and fast foods. As I grew accustomed to eating this way, I went from 130 to 200 pounds in less than a year.

After a series of clinic and hospital visits, and hundreds of needle shots later, we discovered he had a serious intolerance to dairy foods. Time and time again, a new medical concoction was prescribed but did not cure him. It was not until my family adopted a totally organic, plant-based diet, that my son’s symptoms receded and in just a few months, completely disappeared. In fact, this profound shift in our eating improved all of our health. Within three months I shed upwards of 40 pounds and could walk freely. The children’s energy levels were noticeably higher and as the seasons changed, I felt no signs of the colds and flu that my friends and employees were experiencing.</p><p>As I continued to research common food practices, I discovered that fast foods and even ‘natural foods’ found in the grocery store, that were conveniently meant to save money and time were not at all natural. They are what we refer to as Genetically Modified Organisms or GMO foods, which could not satisfy hunger due to lack of real nutrients or energy.  Over the years, continual consumption of these foods has wreaked havoc on family, friends and acquaintances with ‘normal’ eating habits. I have painfully watched people I love succumb to the ailments, sickness and disease that are common for people my age. These experiences have reinforced my belief that organic, plant-based foods are the best medicine for a long healthy life.

<p><strong>Understanding children aged 7-12: </strong>We have been intensively studying every aspect of children’s physiological features across ethnicities, and behavioural patterns to design the most intuitive and attractive facewear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Designing a testing standard equivalent for children:</strong> As there are no international certification standards for children’s masks, we are working closely with a renowned 3rd party certification agency to adapt the adult mask testing standards into our own comparable testing standard for children. </p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the Feedbacker Pack?</strong></p>
<p>Our backers who choose the Feedbacker Pack will have the opportunity to try out our tested, non-commercial sample of Freka Go with their children in October before we roll out the final Freka Go facewear. Over the course of one month, Feedback Pack backers (see what we did there?) will participate in four short surveys and will play a key role in helping us make the best design for us and our children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What type of feedback will you ask for?</strong></p>
<p>Nobody understands your children like you do! Your feedback will determine if there is something we need to change in terms of comfort, colours, and fine-tuning. When you choose the Feedback Pack, all you have to do is to complete four short online surveys for you and your child over the course of one month. Once that’s done, we do the rest to make Freka Go the best it can be! How much could this get?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can Freka be used on children younger than 7?</strong></p>
<p>It is possible, but before the age of 7, children’s respiratory systems are still delicate and underdeveloped, and any sort of facial covering or could create discomfort. Around 7 years old, children’s respiratory systems start becoming more developed and are able to easily wear masks without problems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why does the children’s facewear only have one size?</strong></p>
<p>The key indicator in the size guide is the distance between the tip of the nose and the tip of the chin. Almost all kids fall within the same range for this distance, and the width of the facewear is easily adjustable using the ear-straps.  For adults, however, as there is much greater variation between the nose-chin distance, we have created two sizes to accommodate all faces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where is Freka being manufactured?</strong></p>
<p>We already have our value chain in place and ready for additional sampling, mass production, and shipping. Our facewear will be manufactured in the UK and Korea, and will be shipped from Korea. We are so ready to go!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When will my Freka Go be shipped?</strong></p>
<p>We want to give you only the best Freka experience, so the quality of our facewear is our topmost priority. Our launch date will be decided by the feedback we receive from our Feedback Pack backers during the evaluation stage. If we need to make minimal changes, we will launch Freka Go this December. If Freka Go needs a little more work according to our Feedbacker kids and adults, we will refine every necessary part and launch Freka Go early next year in February.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where can I buy filters after the Indiegogo campaign is over?</strong></p>
<p>Once the Indiegogo campaign is over, you will be able to purchase Freka Go’s replaceable filters on our website: <a href=""http://www.freka.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.freka.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How often would I need to replace the filter?</strong></p>
<p>Over time, filters become clogged with air pollutants, dust and bacteria simply by being exposed to the outside. This is why it is important to regularly replace used filters with new ones. Freka Go makes this easy with it’s replaceable filters (rather than having to replace a whole mask).  We suggest replacing Freka’s filters every 5-7 days, depending on the level of pollution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will Freka Go protect me from bacteria?</strong></p>
<p>Freka Go’s filter protects from over 95% of PM2.5 micro-particles, which includes some microbes and bacteria as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I use Freka Go while cycling?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Freka Go can be used during light-moderate exercise. However, we would not suggest wearing Freka Go or any sort of mask during intense physical exercise unless they are specially designed for high intensity purposes. During exercise breathing patterns change drastically and require a much heavier duty respirator to effectively filter the air.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is this testing standard thing you’re talking about?</strong></p>
<p>A CE mark on a product shows that it has passed all the tests for safety and performance according to EU standards. Currently there are no such standards for masks for children. We are developing our own internal standard for children in partnership with one of the very best testing agencies to make sure we develop the highest quality facewear in terms of performance, functionality and safety for children’s masks.</p>

So! Our team consists of three: my two girl friends, let's call them the Model and Yogi and I, the one who does all the work. All three are descendants from the sea! We value and take our health and exercise quite seriously and (in the most demanding form possible) work full time so sometimes, just sometimes, :p we enjoy our trips to Ibiza or Burning Man where we seem to have a hard time leaving and tend to afterwards bring the new wave of thought and this new contemporary hippie to the big city and then of course get disappointed because it is just so chaotic in the real world! So, like everyone else, we buckle up, begin our detox then off we go, back to work between New York and London again...</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442333135/gyraqo6xifmjwgnkauhi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Model and I had both been suffering from bad anxiety and Yogi is just Yogi, she just has always had it alllll figured out all the time =/ but we love her.

We drink coffee in the morning to be more alert and achieve as much as we can, then energy drinks by night to try to have as much energy and fun as we can. In between those hours, we long for a sense of calmness, so we go to Yoga classes now and try to meditate or keep watching The Secret or these new 'I am my own God' books or videos.

</div></div>",""" Hey! So nor I or my two friends here are experts in marketing so I will try my best to keep you entertained next to everyone else's super cool projects, and hopefully maybe make you see the light in the project we love so much and would like for everyone in the world to have the opportunity to feel just as peaceful as we do! So! Our team consists of three: my two girl friends, let's call them the Model and Yogi and I, the one who does all the work. All three are descendants from the sea! We value and take our health and exercise quite seriously and (in the most demanding form possible) work full time so sometimes, just sometimes, :p we enjoy our trips to Ibiza or Burning Man where we seem to have a hard time leaving and tend to afterwards bring the new wave of thought and this new contemporary hippie to the big city and then of course get disappointed because it is just so chaotic in the real world! So, like everyone else, we buckle up, begin our detox then off we go, back to work between New York and London again...Model and I had both been suffering from bad anxiety and Yogi is just Yogi, she just has always had it alllll figured out all the time =/ but we love her. She does have a few things right though, her state of mind, it is as light as a feather, because it comes with her job, just yoga, literally, all day errrday just teaching yoga, but about a year ago, she started studying nutrition because she wanted to come up with a fresh soothing recipe for her clients (that's what she says anyway) but she made us drink this ""detox chill juice"", not the actual name, we just called it our Chill juice because it really helped Model and I get over some inner freak demons we dealt with, especially on those days after a good night-out or when it got really hectic at work or just before visiting the family, God have mercy. Anyway, we started making this magic juice and mixing this secret formula: No added sugar ~ 0.1g fat ~ No concentrate ~ nothing nothing nothing but the above!And for some reason, it tastes like spa water with those cucumbers in it and strangely, with a hint of lychee?! After about a week of this, I began having cooler moments than Yogi, which in my world is pretty freaking brilliant. Model wasn't panicking so much over her weight all the bloody time and finally started laying back. I have the drink nearly every morning and my revelation was: 'this is meditation in a bottle'. I was honestly never able to get myself to meditate, who on earth wanted to be left alone with their thoughts for that long!? I didn't know what would emerge from the eerie depths of my mind!! I have pretty dark humour you know! But now!!? I am able to sit for up to an hour in silence and completely free my mind from any thought that tried to sneak in and literally watch my thoughts like watching traffic from a hill and my thoughts were the cars driving past in the different colours and forms they came in, the madness was, it was just suddenly.. gone! Model's weight obsession was rather annoying because we had to be careful with what food or drink we had in the house, including wine. Yes, we were banned from wine in our own home. Mind you, we are three women in our mid-twenties under the same roof... with no wine. Back to topic. A moment to calm thy self... She only drinks gin and tonic because I believe that's the weight watching drink, but the clever one here suggested the cucumber extract added in the Unwind recipe to go with her Hendricks gin. So that war ended because, well, we all lost weight and it actually tastes quite magnificent. Yogi would mix the drink and put it in a glass jar, making it look very home-made and wonderful in her studio and actually did help some of the fidgety students in her meditation class to relax. People were responding to it.  Us, like anyone else, face the realities of today, the chaos and if not by feet, more so in the mind, the world becomes smaller by day and the more public one’s life gets due to the development of technology, the harder it seems to calm the mind and keep up at the same time. We drink coffee in the morning to be more alert and achieve as much as we can, then energy drinks by night to try to have as much energy and fun as we can. In between those hours, we long for a sense of calmness, so we go to Yoga classes now and try to meditate or keep watching The Secret or these new 'I am my own God' books or videos. But imagine if the moment you go on your lunch- break or after a work- out in your gym, and find a drink right next to the protein drinks and coconut waters that only wants to soothe and help your day? Riiiight? Right? Unwind has been mixed and played with the past year, between London, Stockholm, New York, LA and now we want to begin producing our ~meditation in a bottle~ all over the world and see how it goes… What do you think?""  To add to the excitement, we thought we would add a quote on the back for every new batch.. sort of like a fortune cookie! Just to brighten up your day a little :) Here is roughly how it will look:  So I have been calling and studying the past three months to find out how this works and we now have a set and ready plan, only problem is, it costs.
