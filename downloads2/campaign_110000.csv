<p>Due to overwhelming demand and those that were not able to contribute at the time, I am creating a second campaign to allow additional people to contribute to get <strong>Led Zeppelin Gear</strong> printed. Here is the original story.</p>
<p><b>Hello, there.</b>I am Jeff Strawman, webmaster and editor of Achilles Last Stand, a Led Zeppelin fansite (<a href=""http://www.led-zeppelin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.led-zeppelin.org</a>). Since launching the website in 1996, I have reached Led Zeppelin fans in 214 countries, and made many, many friends along the way.</p>
<p>My top goal with Achilles Last Stand is to create the best Led Zeppelin-related website online. I have spent many hours to make it what it is today. One of the sections in the website details what gear the members of Led Zeppelin have used throughout their careers. <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear </i></b>is the next step.</p>
<p><b>I want to take <i>Led Zeppelin Gear </i>to print!</b></p>
<p>Although <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear </i></b>was started as an online resource, and I will continue to update the website, I have always dreamt of making a physical book. And now I am doing it! <b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear </i></b>will be a beautiful way to preserve some of the content I have featured online and allow it to be enjoyed virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>The book will be a gorgeous piece around 600 pages. It will feature noteworthy information on a lot the instrumentation, amplification, effects and accessories that were used, as described in interview by Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, John Bonham and Robert Plant, as well as some of the people that were there, such as Roger Mayer, Andy Johns, Bruce Becvar, Jeff Ocheltree and Andy Manson.</p>
<p><b>Why this book?</b></p>
<p>There are many Led Zeppelin-related books currently available. Some feature biographies on the band members, some feature the live experience, and are a catch-all, encyclopedia-style, however there is not a book available about the gear that Led Zeppelin used.</p>
<p>There are gear books available for other bands, such as The Rolling Stones, Greatful Dead and The Beatles, however there is not a book available about the gear that Led Zeppelin used.</p>
<p><b>Who am I to write it?</b></p>
<p>Who am I am why should you consider funding and/or reading this book? I am not a former member of Led Zeppelin’s road crew, I wasn’t there while Led Zeppelin was an active band. I don’t work for Gibson or Fender or Marshall. In short, I am not an expert. I am just a thirty-something guy with a deep interest in Led Zeppelin and a penchant for perfection. I started researching for this book sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>In addition to being a Led Zeppelin fan, I am also a musician. I grew up in a musical house. All of my immediate family are musically inclined. After starting with piano as a young child and playing the baritone and tuba, beginning in elementary, I began playing the bass guitar in the summer after senior year of high school. I’ve played in bands for the last twenty-one years and have really made it a point to pay attention to the detail of gear that the various bandmates have used.</p>
<p>Obviously, with being in bands, I am a great lover of music. Although I listen to most genres of music, classic rock of the 1960s and 1970s is my favorite. Led Zeppelin was introduced to me by high school friend, who spun his mom’s Zeppelin vinyl after school.</p>
<p>I grew up in the generation with a computer in every classroom and have been involved with technology my entire adult life. I remember in 1994, while in college, I remember learning about this relatively new thing called <i>HyperText Markup Language </i>that interpret text and images on to the World Wide Web. I recall a handful of Led Zeppelin websites that popped up of the next few years and they often presented different information on the same topics. I figured that I needed to create a website about Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>I found a web hosting company that offered unlimited space and bandwidth and after a few years of presenting my Led Zeppelin website as a sub-domain on my personal website (<a href=""http://www.fancyketchupguy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fancyketchupguy.com</a>–<i>now defunct –</i><b>don’t ask!</b>), I purchased <a href=""http://www.led-zeppelin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.led-zeppelin.org</a> and presented my website there. My website had A LOT of information, as I scoured the internet for every bit and piece of related content. In addition, I’ve picked the brains of a lot of people, including members of the Led Zeppelin, CEOs from gear manufacturers and people who are just plain intelligent. With a fine-tooth comb. I’ve spent countless hours at many libraries searching through books, magazines and newspapers. I want to have the best Led Zeppelin-related website online.</p>
<p><b>What to expect of <i>Led Zeppelin Gear?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Led Zeppelin Gear </i></b>consists of seven chapters that gives a whole look into a lot of information. The book is written chronologically, beginning with the first time each piece of gear was used for each member.</p>
<p>Chapter One, <b>Jimmy Page: The Grand Sorcerer</b>, which comes from a description from Keith Relf, prior to performing <i>Shapes Of Things </i>at the Anderson Theatre, in New York City, New York, on March 30, 1968. From playing <i>Baby, Let’s Play House </i>on a found Spanish guitar to the Martin D-28 Marquis acoustic guitar that was used by Page on his last live performance, on November 5, 2011, the reader will learn about Page use of selected pieces of signature gear to create the sound he wanted.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, <b>John Paul Jones: The Groove</b>, lets the reader learn that Jones is much, much more than just a bass guitarist. He is a multi-instrumentalist that is not afraid to pick up any instrument or have any instrumented crafted to get the music out of his head and projected out through his fingers. Jones had never stopped evolving and transforming sound and was never stuck or felt comfortable in just one genre.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, <b>John Bonham: The Thunder</b>, chronicles a kid from the Black Country that went from pub bands to a stadium band in his eighteen-year professional musical career. The world will never see another drummer with Bonham’s hard-hitting, technical expertise, being able to stay slightly behind the beat, showmanship and good looks.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, <b>Robert Plant: The Lion</b>, addresses that skinny, blond, head-strong Adonis who wanted to make it on his terms. He hasn’t been linked to only just one genre of music, while still appearing current.</p>
<p>Chapter Five,<b>Three Hours of Lunacy</b>, discusses the PA (public address) systems that were used at live Led Zeppelin concerts, from the earliest days up to their last performance in 2007.</p>
<p>Chapter Six,<b>Magic Studio Days</b>, is a song-by-song analysis of the gear that was used in the studio, both by the members of Led Zeppelin, as well by the engineers. Also included is a study of the tracks in each song, as well as some history on the songs.</p>
<p><b>What is so special about this book?</b></p>
<p>1.First of all – me. Nineteen years of research by a 30-something Led Zeppelin fanatic has resulted in a very thorough written experience.</p>
<p>2.<i><b>Led Zeppelin Gear </b></i>is a jam-packed book. All 600+ pages (~120,000 words) are full of well-known and some not-so-well-known information.</p>
<p>3.The approach. I am not here for a quick buck. This is my honest and truthful tribute to Led Zeppelin. I have gone to great lengths to make this book as grand as it could be.</p>
<p><b>Your support means the world to me.</b></p>
<p>I am thrilled about the prospect of seeing <i><b>Led Zeppelin Gear </b></i>in print, and I hope you are, too. There are a variety of costs associated with a project of this size, and you support will allow me to:</p>
<p>·Set aside time to focus on finishing writing the book</p>
<p>·Copy editing content</p>
<p>·Secure print rights for photographs</p>
<p>·Secure ISBNs (International Standard Book Numbers) for printed and electronic versions</p>
<p>·Pay for the printing costs up front</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to Indegogo and/or PayPal <b>fees </b>which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds.</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p><i><b>Led Zeppelin Gear </b></i>is being released in two different offerings: the eBook and the hard cover book.</p>
<p>The eBook will be in your choice of format (EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF, etc.) for compatibility on your eReader.</p>
<p>The hard cover book will be printed on 60 lb 420PPI (pages per inch) 94 opacity paper with a high-gloss cover, created by designer Gerson Vecchi. The book is in a US trade 6x9 inch size.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And, just because, there will be an 11x17 inch, full gloss commemorative promotional poster available.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>So, what?  Now, what?</b></p>
<p>Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you... As you will see in the perks, the contributions that I am shooting for are <b>pre-sales</b>, rather than charitable donations (although I am not in the position to turn those down either!).</p>
<p>If you cannot contribute, I would be very grateful if you could share this campaign. Please join the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ledzepgearbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> or follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/ledzepgearbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Led Zeppelin Gear</a> on Twitter.

Led Zeppelin Gear consists of seven chapters that gives a whole look into a lot of information. The book is written chronologically, beginning with the first time each piece of gear was used for each member.

He is a multi-instrumentalist that is not afraid to pick up any instrument or have any instrumented crafted to get the music out of his head and projected out through his fingers. Jones had never stopped evolving and transforming sound and was never stuck or felt comfortable in just one genre.
Chapter Three, John Bonham: The Thunder, chronicles a kid from the Black Country that went from pub bands to a stadium band in his eighteen-year professional musical career. The world will never see another drummer with Bonham’s hard-hitting, technical expertise, being able to stay slightly behind the beat, showmanship and good looks.
Chapter Four, Robert Plant: The Lion, addresses that skinny, blond, head-strong Adonis who wanted to make it on his terms. He hasn’t been linked to only just one genre of music, while still appearing current.
Chapter Five,Three Hours of Lunacy, discusses the PA (public address) systems that were used at live Led Zeppelin concerts, from the earliest days up to their last performance in 2007.
Chapter Six,Magic Studio Days, is a song-by-song analysis of the gear that was used in the studio, both by the members of Led Zeppelin, as well by the engineers. Also included is a study of the tracks in each song, as well as some history on the songs.
What is so special about this book?
1.First of all – me. Nineteen years of research by a 30-something Led Zeppelin fanatic has resulted in a very thorough written experience.
2.Led Zeppelin Gear is a jam-packed book. All 600+ pages (~120,000 words) are full of well-known and some not-so-well-known information.
3.The approach. I am not here for a quick buck. This is my honest and truthful tribute to Led Zeppelin. I have gone to great lengths to make this book as grand as it could be.
Your support means the world to me.
I am thrilled about the prospect of seeing Led Zeppelin Gear in print, and I hope you are, too. There are a variety of costs associated with a project of this size, and you support will allow me to:
·Set aside time to focus on finishing writing the book
·Copy editing content
·Secure print rights for photographs
·Secure ISBNs (International Standard Book Numbers) for printed and electronic versions
·Pay for the printing costs up front
Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to Indegogo and/or PayPal fees which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds.
The Perks
Led Zeppelin Gear is being released in two different offerings: the eBook and the hard cover book.
The eBook will be in your choice of format (EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF, etc.) for compatibility on your eReader.
The hard cover book will be printed on 60 lb 420PPI (pages per inch) 94 opacity paper with a high-gloss cover, created by designer Gerson Vecchi. The book is in a US trade 6x9 inch size.
And, just because, there will be an 11x17 inch, full gloss commemorative promotional poster available.
So, what?  Now, what?
Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you... As you will see in the perks, the contributions that I am shooting for are pre-sales, rather than charitable donations (although I am not in the position to turn those down either!).
If you cannot contribute, I would be very grateful if you could share this campaign. Please join the Facebook page or follow Led Zeppelin Gear on Twitter. By doing this, I can keep you in the loop about this book, and my next project (yes, something is cooking already!).

by Teramis). I'm a science fiction and fantasy novelist published by
Tor Books, a professional role-playing game designer with roots in
the old-school D&amp;D era, and founder of the <a href=""http://world-building.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Building Academy</a>. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">I'm crowdfunding a collection of my

go to cover editing, artwork, ebook design and print-on-demand book
formatting.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Here's why I'm excited about this
project, and hope you will be too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Why Short Stories, and Why Now?</b></h2>
<p>
</p><p>Because of a very serious health
crisis, I nearly died last year. I spent the next six months in
hospitals and rehab facilities, and when I finally returned home, I
realized that I wanted to bring several creative projects to
completion. (Put this under the header of, “Important Things to Do
Before I Croak.” Which now I don't expect will happen for decades
to come, but that was one serious wake-up call about getting on with
my creative work!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a novelist and don't often write
short stories – but the ones I have done are pretty cool. So, now:
I want to gather all my short stories together under one umbrella and
let them have a life of their own as a publication. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That brings me to this book, <i>Journeys</i>.
I call it that because it offers you several journeys not only into
my imagination, but into many Great Escapes of your own. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Journeys</i> contains 10 tales. It
is a sampler of stories from my fantasy world, from my science
fiction setting, and a couple of oddments not easily categorized but
intriguing nonetheless. (Scroll down to see story details under the ""What Are the Stories?"" header below.)</p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>The World Building Connection</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Because
I am passionate about world building, I must note that my fiction
works are almost all set in role-playing game settings. Or put
another way, my game worlds have spawned stories. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You wouldn't know this to read the
tales – after all, a good story is exactly that, and stands on its
own – but if you, like me, are both a writer and rpg designer, I
have some insights into this process that might be helpful to you. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason, I'll be sharing a
series of video tips during this campaign about how I created some of the stories in
this collection: what their relationship is to game worlds, and how
you too can tell excellent stories with that kind of genesis. Even if
you don't care about writing such things yourself, these videos will
give you insights into my process that went into the stories in this
collection.  The first video in this series will be posted online on
or shortly after Sunday, September 20<sup>th</sup>. (If you're a
campaign supporter, you'll get an update announcement, or you can
sign up to my projects list and get video updates as well:
<a href=""http://bit.ly/dtcprojects"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/dtcprojects</a>.)</p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>Artwork</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>I love illustrated stories. Don't you?
And who says illustrated stories are not for adults? (I still swoon
over Howard Pyle's artwork in his King Arthur and Robin Hood novels.)
 And so I have resolved to have each and very story in this
collection illustrated. That is part of what the funding goal will
cover: appropriate compensation for the artists whose work will help
illuminate these intriguing stories. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read more about the artists and
the stories below. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now let me just leave you with this
thought:  if you want to journey into the land of Imagination and
have a little Great Escape, this book is a great way to do it. Not
only are the tales entertaining, but I think some of them are
challenging to our perceptions and paradigms, and will give you some
interesting food for thought to engage with. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you'll engage with it. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>NOTE: </b>If this project is fully
funded, it will also become a print-on-demand trade paperback (less
than full funding imposes some limitations; see Q&amp;A notes below
for more details and caveats). So check out the sidebar, select the
perks you like, and please help me turn <i>Journeys</i> into the
rockin' exploration it can be for you and me.

</p><h2><b>Q&amp;A</b></h2>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Why IndieGoGo? Why Not
Kickstarter?</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I
mentioned that I'm crowdfunding, without exception everyone assumed I
was doing a Kickstarter project. Obviously I am not, and that is for
one simple reason:  IndieGoGo permits flexible funding. That means
that even if I do not meet my full funding goal, I will still receive
whatever money is pledged. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, this
means that even if project funding falls short, I will still have
something to invest in making this book a reality. In exchange for that, I
promise to produce an ebook version of <i>Journeys</i>
for supporters at the $10 level and higher as the minimum
guaranteed deliverable. The amount of artwork and print options will
be limited (if not fully funded) as discussed under “Risks”
below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>The Trade Paperback Perk</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>Related to the
above, <b>please do not think of this perk as an automatic
“pre-order” system</b> for a paperback copy of <i>Journeys</i>.
<b>It is not. </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather, <b>consider
this a commitment to help fund </b><i><b>Journeys</b></i><b> towards
the goal</b> of becoming a paper book as well as an ebook. The
following conditions and rewards apply: 
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><u>IF funding
	falls short</u>, your
	perk will be <b>a discount coupon</b> that will allow you to
	purchase the paper version at cost <u>when it becomes available</u>.
	Sadly, I cannot guarantee when this will be if we do not make our
	funding goal, because then I will have to dig into my own shallow
	pockets to make this come to pass. However, it is my intention
	to accomplish this within a month or two after release of the ebook
	format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>IF the funding
	goal is met,</u> your perk will be a copy of the trade paperback
	version of <i>Journeys</i> (in addition to the ebook format, which
	you will receive automatically).  We will all be happy and have a
	big party and wear goofy hats. There will be cake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we do not
	make the funding goal, you will need to cover shipping yourself. If
	we DO make the funding goal, I will cover shipping within the United
	States. If you live elsewhere, you will need to pay for shipping and
	I will let you know how much that will be when we're at that point
	in time. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h4><b><br/></b></h4><h4><b><h4><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Funding Priorities</b></h4></b></h4><h4>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Question:</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""> Why
do you not guarantee delivery of a paper book if I have paid for that
perk?</span>
</h4><h4>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Answer: </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">These funds must go to different aspects of this project in descending
order of priority. First priorities are editing; artwork; ebook
formatting. Then comes print-on-demand formatting costs, then a
varying scale of costs to set up with a PoD printer. (The variation
depends on final book length, print options, and whether or not this
project will be accepted by my ideal PoD printer, Booklocker, which
is notoriously picky about the projects they will accept. If we can't
go with them, setup costs will be considerably higher elsewhere.)</span>
</h4>
<p>
</p><p>So it boils down
to a question of how much funding we achieve. If the pool is large
enough, it will cover everything up to and including PoD costs, and
make it possible to simply send you a book, if you've bought the Trade Paperback perk. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the money pool
is not that large, then your contribution has at least helped us get
closer to a complete project, and I will strive to find a way to give you
some tangible value in exchange for your investment. That applies
even if I cannot afford to offer the book completely free and clear
as it would be in a fully-funded situation. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><b>Risks</b></h2>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>The story
collection itself:</b></u> This book is 80% complete as of this
writing. I'll be writing the final stories over the next two months
after the campaign closes. After that, I am an experienced editor and
have seen seven ebooks through to publication. I foresee no
difficulties in creating the baseline minimum deliverable here of an
ebook version for supporters. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Artwork:</b></u>  If the funding falls short, I may not be able to have
all the stories in the book illustrated as planned. See priorities
discussion in “Trade Paperback Perk | Answer” above. The artists themselves are professionals and accustomed to meeting deadlines for publication. </p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Deliverables
and caveats: </b></u> An ebook version is the minimum deliverable you
can expect if you are a basic level supporter. If we are short on funding, I would have to use my
own personal resources to achieve goals like having artwork done, or
getting this book to the print-on-demand stage of production. <u>I
cannot guarantee if or when these higher levels of product polish
will happen if </u><i><u>Journeys</u></i><u> is not fully funded by
the end of the campaign.</u>  I may not be able to overcome the gap
between my desire for a certain caliber of product and my means to
achieve that goal. That's rather the whole point of crowdfunding,
after all. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you, too,
want to see an illustrated book in a dead tree version,<b> please
support and share this project with your social network, and help <i>Journeys</i> reach or exceed its funding goal!</b></p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h2><b>Why
Bother to Read My Work? </b></h2>
<p>
</p><p>I know there's a lot of stuff out there
to choose from, and you probably aren't familiar with my writing. So what's special about my work? 
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>My breakout novel <i>Mainline</i>
	(science fiction) was only the third book ever purchased from the
	slush pile at Tor; it made the Locus Top Ten List of Best First
	Novels in the year it was published. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><i>Kar Kalim</i> (which I think of
	as my “sleeping with the enemy” novel) was so disturbingly
	memorable that the endorsing quote from Piers Anthony was edited to
	leave out the “disturbing” part, because they thought that would
	hinder book sales.  Also, this book grew out of a need to explain an
	anomaly in my rpg world that stemmed from poor design decisions, so
	it has some insights to offer for game designers as well (I'll get
	into that in one of my videos in this rpg/fiction series elsewhere
	on this page.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><i>The Truthsayer's Apprentice </i>was
	praised not only by Lloyd Alexander (author of the classic <i>The
	Black Cauldron</i>) but also by a real-world runemaster who had
	helped consecrate Iceland's  parliament building when its
	foundations were laid. He told me in private correspondence that he
	thought I had an exceptional grasp of the esoterica of rune magic. A
	high compliment, indeed. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>That gives a quick sample of some
things that are unique about my writing. The titles mentioned here
are out of print right now (although you can find used copies
online). I am working to get the rights back so I can self-publish
these books. In the meanwhile, I am
refocusing on some novel projects, and of course, on this collection
of short stories. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><b>What
are the Stories?</b></h2>
<p>
</p><p>Without giving spoilers, here's a
little about the tales that will appear in <i>Journeys</i>: 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>1 “Small Benefits”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very fond of “gotcha” tales –
short things with a twist and an unexpected ending. This is the first
I ever wrote, when I was 19. It features a hapless mage and an
inscrutable gnome in a not-so-generic magic shop in the city of
Nimm-on-Witholl. This has stood up well to the test of time; I
wouldn't change a word of it if I wrote it today.  It also introduces
a story element that has resurfaced in my works across the years, and
features now in <i>Queen Victoria's Transmogrifier</i>,  one of my
novel-length works-in-progress.  “Small
Benefits” foreshadows my later rpg fantasy world
development, and sets the stage for a milieu that I am still writing
adventures for.  This is the first time this story appears in print. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>2 “The Transformation of Gerick
Bare-skin”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Set in the hinterland of the Duchy of
Nimm on the world of Àstareth—the
same land where “Small Benefits” takes place—this is a
coming-of-age tale of a youth from a clan of were-bears. Only problem
is, he can't make the change happen—and then his home is threatened
with war. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href=""https://andrewknighton.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/the-transformation-of-gerick-bare-skin-by-deborah-teramis-christian/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reviewer Andrew Knighton</a> said of this
book, “[I]t let me relax for half an hour, feel things I wanted to
feel, enjoy a brief moment of transformation and adventure, and
emerge rejuvenated. Stories can and should surprise us. But they
should comfort and relax us too, give us the full range of human
experience. And The Transformation of Gerick Bare-Skin definitely has
a place in that range.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>3 “The Duke of Nimm” (in
progress)</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Duke Arn of Nimm is called the Mad Duke
for a reason: this man is off his rocker. Today we would call it
schizophrenia, but in his time and place, it is suspicion and
distrust (read paranoia), unreasonable moods, a lot of acting out,
and the power and chutzpah to ensure he is left to do as he pleases.
So when he orders an all-out defense of the capital of Nimm, while
the only known threat remains distant on the borders, his paranoid
whim once again sets city forces into action. But this time, perhaps,
he has gone a measure too far, and sown the seeds of his own
destruction. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Duchy of Nimm is the homeland of
the antagonists featured in <i>The Truthsayer's Apprentice</i>.  When
you read this, you might start to get the impression that Nimm is
full of bad guys....and that might not be far from the truth.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>4 “Li Wan's Revenge”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Halfway across the globe from Nimm is
the Asian-inspired island nation of Qua-lun.  In this land with a
samurai ethic, there are also deep superstitions and tales about
ghosts and the supernatural. The tale of Li Wan is a cautionary one
about the hazards presented by uneasy ghosts. The story is
beautifully illustrated by artist Emily Vitori (<a href=""http://www.syreenestudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.syreenestudios.com/</a>). 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a setting I was creating just
before I hooked up with TSR to do development in their Oriental
Adventures property, so my creative interests certainly aligned with
that rpg work. To read more about the connection between OA and my
own writing, check out <a href=""http://www.dragonsword.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this website</a>,
where you can also pick up a free novel of mine called <i>Dragonsword</i>
(the first half of an unfinished duology). 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>5 “Ridgerunner”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The culture of Qua-lun eventually
becomes dominant on its homeworld, and milennia later gives rise to
the star-faring Sa'adani Empire. But you don't need to know that to
appreciate what happens in Ridgerunner. This story focuses on an
up-close, alien-eye-view of an encounter with human xenologists from
the Empire.  This is a chilling “gotcha” tale, written originally
as a dramatic monologue, and still lends itself to reading out loud.
(Like that concept? Check out the Audiobook perk in the sidebar.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>6 “Live Fire”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast-forward to another place in the
Empire: a lonely demilitarized zone on the farthest reaches of the
Sa'adani border. Here, imperial ships keep vigilant patrol against
incursions from an age-old enemy. They test new weapons, and new
ships, and an aspiring young weapons officer thrills to her
assignment and the opportunity to make a name for herself. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until things go wrong, and she learns
that not all mortal dangers lie outside the ship. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This story and the anthology it first
appeared in (<i>No Man's Land</i>) were considered for the Tiptree
Award in 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>7 “Med Call, or How Zendo Worked
the System” (in progress)</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>My novel <i>Mainline</i> is set in the
Sa'adani Empire on the planet Lyndir. A minor character is mentioned
in passing: Zendo, a net runner who has mysteriously vanished, thus
opening the way for other, more important characters to engage with
the protagonist. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This story is about what happened to
Zendo to cause him to drop out of sight so suddenly, and remain
silent at least for the length of events covered in <i>Mainline</i>.
He was, shall we say, a little preoccupied, and getting to know
Lyndir in a way his native-born self had never intended, and never
plans to repeat. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>8 Elise's Gift</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>My WIP <i>Queen Victoria's
Transmogrifier</i> features Julia, headmistress of an esoteric secret
order who saves QV from an assassination attempt. But a decade before
the events in that novel, she was merely a senior member of her
order, tasked with instructing the aspiring not-so-talented ladies
who hoped to join her sisterhood.  It was business as usual until she
met Elise: an exceptional woman and exceptional talent whose gifts,
however, remained concealed until necessity and a succubus encounter
drew them out. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This story first appeared in <i><a href=""http://www.demonlovers.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Demon Lovers: Succubi</a></i> (2012),
and is a prequel to QVT. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>9 “Creative Visualization”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>A woman in prison can't get over the
strange habits of her Native American cell-mate, and she tells you
all about it—including the unbelievable event that convinces her
there might be something to this “creative visualization” notion
after all. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is fantasy. Perhaps it is
magical realism. It is certainly a variation from what I usually
write, but in any case, it is a Great Escape, however you frame it.
This story is also written as a monologue, and lends itself to
reading out loud.  This will be its first appearance in print. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>10 “Bread”</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>This one's a real departure from my norm, but it's a
story I have to share. 
</p>
<p>I once gave a neighbor a loaf of
homemade Christmas bread when I was living in Berlin in my early 20s,
and that opened the door to her sharing a life experience from World
War II that was much more than I bargained for. This partially
fictionalized memoir uses narrative to recount events in the 1940s as she related them to me, but aside from that artistic license, this encounter, and all the rest of the tale, are completely true.  If you are touched by poignant stories, keep your hanky handy for this one.  It's a real journey to another time and place, on many levels.</p><p><br/></p>

Tor Books, a professional role-playing game designer with roots in
the old-school D&D era, and founder of the World Building Academy. I'm crowdfunding a collection of my
short stories in this book called Journeys. The funding will
go to cover editing, artwork, ebook design and print-on-demand book
formatting.Here's why I'm excited about this
project, and hope you will be too.

Why Short Stories, and Why Now?

Because of a very serious health
crisis, I nearly died last year. I spent the next six months in
hospitals and rehab facilities, and when I finally returned home, I
realized that I wanted to bring several creative projects to
completion. (Put this under the header of, “Important Things to Do
Before I Croak.” Which now I don't expect will happen for decades
to come, but that was one serious wake-up call about getting on with
my creative work!)

I'm a novelist and don't often write
short stories – but the ones I have done are pretty cool. So, now:
I want to gather all my short stories together under one umbrella and
let them have a life of their own as a publication. 


That brings me to this book, Journeys.
I call it that because it offers you several journeys not only into
my imagination, but into many Great Escapes of your own. 


Journeys contains 10 tales. It
is a sampler of stories from my fantasy world, from my science
fiction setting, and a couple of oddments not easily categorized but
intriguing nonetheless. (Scroll down to see story details under the ""What Are the Stories?"" header below.)

The World Building Connection

Because
I am passionate about world building, I must note that my fiction
works are almost all set in role-playing game settings. Or put
another way, my game worlds have spawned stories. 


You wouldn't know this to read the
tales – after all, a good story is exactly that, and stands on its
own – but if you, like me, are both a writer and rpg designer, I
have some insights into this process that might be helpful to you. 


For this reason, I'll be sharing a
series of video tips during this campaign about how I created some of the stories in
this collection: what their relationship is to game worlds, and how
you too can tell excellent stories with that kind of genesis. Even if
you don't care about writing such things yourself, these videos will
give you insights into my process that went into the stories in this
collection.  The first video in this series will be posted online on
or shortly after Sunday, September 20th. (If you're a
campaign supporter, you'll get an update announcement, or you can
sign up to my projects list and get video updates as well:

Artwork

I love illustrated stories. Don't you?
And who says illustrated stories are not for adults? (I still swoon
over Howard Pyle's artwork in his King Arthur and Robin Hood novels.)
 And so I have resolved to have each and very story in this
collection illustrated. That is part of what the funding goal will
cover: appropriate compensation for the artists whose work will help
illuminate these intriguing stories. 


You can read more about the artists and
the stories below. 


For now let me just leave you with this
thought:  if you want to journey into the land of Imagination and
have a little Great Escape, this book is a great way to do it. Not
only are the tales entertaining, but I think some of them are
challenging to our perceptions and paradigms, and will give you some
interesting food for thought to engage with. 


I hope you'll engage with it. 


NOTE: If this project is fully
funded, it will also become a print-on-demand trade paperback (less
than full funding imposes some limitations; see Q&A notes below
for more details and caveats). So check out the sidebar, select the
perks you like, and please help me turn Journeys into the
rockin' exploration it can be for you and me.

Q&A

Why IndieGoGo? Why Not
Kickstarter?

Every time I
mentioned that I'm crowdfunding, without exception everyone assumed I
was doing a Kickstarter project. Obviously I am not, and that is for
one simple reason:  IndieGoGo permits flexible funding. That means
that even if I do not meet my full funding goal, I will still receive
whatever money is pledged. 


Essentially, this
means that even if project funding falls short, I will still have
something to invest in making this book a reality. In exchange for that, I
promise to produce an ebook version of Journeys
for supporters at the $10 level and higher as the minimum
guaranteed deliverable. The amount of artwork and print options will
be limited (if not fully funded) as discussed under “Risks”
below.


The Trade Paperback Perk

Related to the
above, please do not think of this perk as an automatic
“pre-order” system for a paperback copy of Journeys.
It is not. 


Rather, consider
this a commitment to help fund Journeys towards
the goal of becoming a paper book as well as an ebook. The
following conditions and rewards apply: 




IF funding
	falls short, your
	perk will be a discount coupon that will allow you to
	purchase the paper version at cost when it becomes available.
	Sadly, I cannot guarantee when this will be if we do not make our
	funding goal, because then I will have to dig into my own shallow
	pockets to make this come to pass. However, it is my intention
	to accomplish this within a month or two after release of the ebook
	format.


IF the funding
	goal is met, your perk will be a copy of the trade paperback
	version of Journeys (in addition to the ebook format, which
	you will receive automatically).  We will all be happy and have a
	big party and wear goofy hats. There will be cake.


If we do not
	make the funding goal, you will need to cover shipping yourself. If
	we DO make the funding goal, I will cover shipping within the United
	States. If you live elsewhere, you will need to pay for shipping and
	I will let you know how much that will be when we're at that point
	in time. 
	



Funding Priorities
Question: Why
do you not guarantee delivery of a paper book if I have paid for that
perk?

Answer: These funds must go to different aspects of this project in descending
order of priority. First priorities are editing; artwork; ebook
formatting. Then comes print-on-demand formatting costs, then a
varying scale of costs to set up with a PoD printer. (The variation
depends on final book length, print options, and whether or not this
project will be accepted by my ideal PoD printer, Booklocker, which
is notoriously picky about the projects they will accept. If we can't
go with them, setup costs will be considerably higher elsewhere.)


So it boils down
to a question of how much funding we achieve. If the pool is large
enough, it will cover everything up to and including PoD costs, and
make it possible to simply send you a book, if you've bought the Trade Paperback perk. 


If the money pool
is not that large, then your contribution has at least helped us get
closer to a complete project, and I will strive to find a way to give you
some tangible value in exchange for your investment. That applies
even if I cannot afford to offer the book completely free and clear
as it would be in a fully-funded situation. 



Risks

The story
collection itself: This book is 80% complete as of this
writing. I'll be writing the final stories over the next two months
after the campaign closes. After that, I am an experienced editor and
have seen seven ebooks through to publication. I foresee no
difficulties in creating the baseline minimum deliverable here of an
ebook version for supporters. 


Artwork:  If the funding falls short, I may not be able to have
all the stories in the book illustrated as planned. See priorities
discussion in “Trade Paperback Perk | Answer” above. The artists themselves are professionals and accustomed to meeting deadlines for publication. 

Deliverables
and caveats:  An ebook version is the minimum deliverable you
can expect if you are a basic level supporter. If we are short on funding, I would have to use my
own personal resources to achieve goals like having artwork done, or
getting this book to the print-on-demand stage of production. I
cannot guarantee if or when these higher levels of product polish
will happen if Journeys is not fully funded by
the end of the campaign.  I may not be able to overcome the gap
between my desire for a certain caliber of product and my means to
achieve that goal. That's rather the whole point of crowdfunding,
after all. 


So if you, too,
want to see an illustrated book in a dead tree version, please
support and share this project with your social network, and help Journeys reach or exceed its funding goal!








Why
Bother to Read My Work? 

I know there's a lot of stuff out there
to choose from, and you probably aren't familiar with my writing. So what's special about my work? 




My breakout novel Mainline
	(science fiction) was only the third book ever purchased from the
	slush pile at Tor; it made the Locus Top Ten List of Best First
	Novels in the year it was published. 
	





Kar Kalim (which I think of
	as my “sleeping with the enemy” novel) was so disturbingly
	memorable that the endorsing quote from Piers Anthony was edited to
	leave out the “disturbing” part, because they thought that would
	hinder book sales.  Also, this book grew out of a need to explain an
	anomaly in my rpg world that stemmed from poor design decisions, so
	it has some insights to offer for game designers as well (I'll get
	into that in one of my videos in this rpg/fiction series elsewhere
	on this page.)





The Truthsayer's Apprentice was
	praised not only by Lloyd Alexander (author of the classic The
	Black Cauldron) but also by a real-world runemaster who had
	helped consecrate Iceland's  parliament building when its
	foundations were laid. He told me in private correspondence that he
	thought I had an exceptional grasp of the esoterica of rune magic. A
	high compliment, indeed. 
	



That gives a quick sample of some
things that are unique about my writing. The titles mentioned here
are out of print right now (although you can find used copies
online). I am working to get the rights back so I can self-publish
these books. In the meanwhile, I am
refocusing on some novel projects, and of course, on this collection
of short stories. 



What
are the Stories?

Without giving spoilers, here's a
little about the tales that will appear in Journeys: 


1 “Small Benefits”

I am very fond of “gotcha” tales –
short things with a twist and an unexpected ending. This is the first
I ever wrote, when I was 19. It features a hapless mage and an
inscrutable gnome in a not-so-generic magic shop in the city of
Nimm-on-Witholl. This has stood up well to the test of time; I
wouldn't change a word of it if I wrote it today.  It also introduces
a story element that has resurfaced in my works across the years, and
features now in Queen Victoria's Transmogrifier,  one of my
novel-length works-in-progress.  “Small
Benefits” foreshadows my later rpg fantasy world
development, and sets the stage for a milieu that I am still writing
adventures for.  This is the first time this story appears in print. 


2 “The Transformation of Gerick
Bare-skin”

Set in the hinterland of the Duchy of
Nimm on the world of Àstareth—the
same land where “Small Benefits” takes place—this is a
coming-of-age tale of a youth from a clan of were-bears. Only problem
is, he can't make the change happen—and then his home is threatened
with war. 


Reviewer Andrew Knighton said of this
book, “[I]t let me relax for half an hour, feel things I wanted to
feel, enjoy a brief moment of transformation and adventure, and
emerge rejuvenated. Stories can and should surprise us. But they
should comfort and relax us too, give us the full range of human
experience. And The Transformation of Gerick Bare-Skin definitely has
a place in that range.”


3 “The Duke of Nimm” (in
progress)

Duke Arn of Nimm is called the Mad Duke
for a reason: this man is off his rocker. Today we would call it
schizophrenia, but in his time and place, it is suspicion and
distrust (read paranoia), unreasonable moods, a lot of acting out,
and the power and chutzpah to ensure he is left to do as he pleases.
So when he orders an all-out defense of the capital of Nimm, while
the only known threat remains distant on the borders, his paranoid
whim once again sets city forces into action. But this time, perhaps,
he has gone a measure too far, and sown the seeds of his own
destruction. 


The Duchy of Nimm is the homeland of
the antagonists featured in The Truthsayer's Apprentice.  When
you read this, you might start to get the impression that Nimm is
full of bad guys....and that might not be far from the truth.

4 “Li Wan's Revenge”

Halfway across the globe from Nimm is
the Asian-inspired island nation of Qua-lun.  In this land with a
samurai ethic, there are also deep superstitions and tales about
ghosts and the supernatural. The tale of Li Wan is a cautionary one
about the hazards presented by uneasy ghosts. The story is
beautifully illustrated by artist Emily Vitori (http://www.syreenestudios.com/). 


This is a setting I was creating just
before I hooked up with TSR to do development in their Oriental
Adventures property, so my creative interests certainly aligned with
that rpg work. To read more about the connection between OA and my
own writing, check out this website,
where you can also pick up a free novel of mine called Dragonsword
(the first half of an unfinished duology). 



5 “Ridgerunner”

The culture of Qua-lun eventually
becomes dominant on its homeworld, and milennia later gives rise to
the star-faring Sa'adani Empire. But you don't need to know that to
appreciate what happens in Ridgerunner. This story focuses on an
up-close, alien-eye-view of an encounter with human xenologists from
the Empire.  This is a chilling “gotcha” tale, written originally
as a dramatic monologue, and still lends itself to reading out loud.
(Like that concept? Check out the Audiobook perk in the sidebar.)


6 “Live Fire”

Fast-forward to another place in the
Empire: a lonely demilitarized zone on the farthest reaches of the
Sa'adani border. Here, imperial ships keep vigilant patrol against
incursions from an age-old enemy. They test new weapons, and new
ships, and an aspiring young weapons officer thrills to her
assignment and the opportunity to make a name for herself. 


Until things go wrong, and she learns
that not all mortal dangers lie outside the ship. 


This story and the anthology it first
appeared in (No Man's Land) were considered for the Tiptree
Award in 2011.

7 “Med Call, or How Zendo Worked
the System” (in progress)

My novel Mainline is set in the
Sa'adani Empire on the planet Lyndir. A minor character is mentioned
in passing: Zendo, a net runner who has mysteriously vanished, thus
opening the way for other, more important characters to engage with
the protagonist. 


This story is about what happened to
Zendo to cause him to drop out of sight so suddenly, and remain
silent at least for the length of events covered in Mainline.
He was, shall we say, a little preoccupied, and getting to know
Lyndir in a way his native-born self had never intended, and never
plans to repeat. 


8 Elise's Gift

My WIP Queen Victoria's
Transmogrifier features Julia, headmistress of an esoteric secret
order who saves QV from an assassination attempt. But a decade before
the events in that novel, she was merely a senior member of her
order, tasked with instructing the aspiring not-so-talented ladies
who hoped to join her sisterhood.  It was business as usual until she
met Elise: an exceptional woman and exceptional talent whose gifts,
however, remained concealed until necessity and a succubus encounter
drew them out. 


This story first appeared in Demon Lovers: Succubi (2012),
and is a prequel to QVT. 


9 “Creative Visualization”

A woman in prison can't get over the
strange habits of her Native American cell-mate, and she tells you
all about it—including the unbelievable event that convinces her
there might be something to this “creative visualization” notion
after all. 


Perhaps this is fantasy. Perhaps it is
magical realism. It is certainly a variation from what I usually
write, but in any case, it is a Great Escape, however you frame it.
This story is also written as a monologue, and lends itself to
reading out loud.  This will be its first appearance in print. 

10 “Bread”

This one's a real departure from my norm, but it's a
story I have to share. 

I once gave a neighbor a loaf of
homemade Christmas bread when I was living in Berlin in my early 20s,
and that opened the door to her sharing a life experience from World
War II that was much more than I bargained for. This partially
fictionalized memoir uses narrative to recount events in the 1940s as she related them to me, but aside from that artistic license, this encounter, and all the rest of the tale, are completely true.  If you are touched by poignant stories, keep your hanky handy for this one.  It's a real journey to another time and place, on many levels.
Who Are the Artists?I am working with some talented women
artists who, along with myself, will be illustrating the stories in
this book. They are:

teenagers studying at the same school. Distance separated us went she moved to
live in Mexico, but years later we found each other once again in the United
States.</span><br/></p>
<p>Nancy never grew tired of reading, writing, or studying. She was
a creative and curious person with an insatiable desire for knowledge.
Everything interested her: from literature and art to politics, finance and
astrology! Her friends adored her because she was very sweet, but also very
sincere.</p>
<p>Lately, she was teaching computer classes to elders at a
community educational center. At the same time, she was taking a Master’s
Degree in Hispanic Literature at Florida International University in Miami.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nancy grew gravely ill and died in 2014, after
a brave battle for her life. While organizing her papers, we found a collection
of poems titled <i>El instante que nos une, </i>or
“The Instant that Unites Us”, which she had written and never published due to
modesty. They are beautiful verses, filled with sincerity and emotion, written
in Spanish. It’s a book that’s very <i>hers</i>, very <i>Nancy.</i></p>
<p>My project consists of publishing this book and organizing an
event to present it to the reader’s community of Miami. To achieve this I count
with the support of various collaborators.</p>
<p>Nancy helped many people during her life. For us, her
friends, it would be a great joy to publish this book so her poems can be read
and shared. In this project, we have counted with the valuable support of Zaida
del Río, a painter of international prestige, who has created the drawings that
will be used to illustrate the book and to create a promotional poster. We
propose to have this ready by October.</p>
<p>Help us make this dream come true. Join us in this
celebration of life, friendship, and love. </p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>POESÍA PARA
CELEBRAR LA VIDA, LA AMISTAD Y EL AMOR</b></p>
<p><b>Si alguna vez has tenido una amiga incondicional, incansable,
divertida y llena de sueños, entonces entenderás mejor este proyecto. </b></p>
<p><b>Pero mejor te hago el cuento: </b></p>
<p>Conocí a Nancy García en La Habana, hace muchos años,
cuando éramos adolescentes y estudiábamos en la misma escuela. La distancia nos
separó cuando ella se fue a vivir a México; pero años después nos reencontramos
en Estados Unidos. </p>
<p>Nancy nunca se cansaba de leer, de escribir y de
estudiar, era una persona creativa, curiosa y con un insaciable deseo de conocimientos.
¡Todo le interesaba: desde la literatura y el arte hasta la política, las
finanzas y la astrología! Sus amigos la adorábamos porque era muy cariñosa,
pero también muy sincera. </p>
<p>En los últimos tiempos ella impartía clases de
computación para adultos de la tercera edad en un centro educacional
comunitario. Al mismo tiempo, cursaba una maestría en Literatura Hispana en la Florida
International University, en Miami. </p>
<p>Pero Nancy enfermó gravemente y murió en 2014, después
de una valiente batalla por la vida. Ordenando sus papeles, apareció una
colección de poemas titulada <i>El instante
que nos une</i>, que ella había escrito y que, por modestia, nunca intentó
publicar. Son versos hermosos, llenos de sinceridad y emoción, escritos en
español. Hablan de la vida, del amor, de la amistad. Es un libro muy suyo, <i>muy</i> Nancy. </p>
<p>Mi proyecto consiste en publicar ese libro y organizar
un evento para presentarlo a la comunidad de lectores de Miami. Para poder realizarlo
cuento con el apoyo de varios colaboradores.</p>
<p>Nancy ayudó a mucha gente a lo largo de su vida. Para nosotros,
sus amigos, será una gran alegría que este libro se publique y que sus poemas
sean leídos y compartidos. </p>
<p>En este proyecto he tenido el valioso apoyo de Zaida
del Río, pintora de prestigio internacional, quien hizo los dibujos que se
usarán para ilustrar el libro y para hacer un poster promocional. Nos

LIFE, FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE / POESÍA PARA CELEBRAR LA VIDA, LA AMISTAD Y EL AMOR(You can read this project in English or Spanish)If you have ever had a tireless, fun, and unconditional
friend that is full of dreams, then you will understand this project better.
However, I had better tell you the story first:
I met Nancy García at La Habana many years ago when we were
teenagers studying at the same school. Distance separated us went she moved to
live in Mexico, but years later we found each other once again in the United
States.
Nancy never grew tired of reading, writing, or studying. She was
a creative and curious person with an insatiable desire for knowledge.
Everything interested her: from literature and art to politics, finance and
astrology! Her friends adored her because she was very sweet, but also very
sincere.
Lately, she was teaching computer classes to elders at a
community educational center. At the same time, she was taking a Master’s
Degree in Hispanic Literature at Florida International University in Miami.
Nevertheless, Nancy grew gravely ill and died in 2014, after
a brave battle for her life. While organizing her papers, we found a collection
of poems titled El instante que nos une, or
“The Instant that Unites Us”, which she had written and never published due to
modesty. They are beautiful verses, filled with sincerity and emotion, written
in Spanish. It’s a book that’s very hers, very Nancy.
My project consists of publishing this book and organizing an
event to present it to the reader’s community of Miami. To achieve this I count
with the support of various collaborators.
Nancy helped many people during her life. For us, her
friends, it would be a great joy to publish this book so her poems can be read
and shared. In this project, we have counted with the valuable support of Zaida
del Río, a painter of international prestige, who has created the drawings that
will be used to illustrate the book and to create a promotional poster. We
propose to have this ready by October.
Help us make this dream come true. Join us in this
celebration of life, friendship, and love. POESÍA PARA
CELEBRAR LA VIDA, LA AMISTAD Y EL AMOR
Si alguna vez has tenido una amiga incondicional, incansable,
divertida y llena de sueños, entonces entenderás mejor este proyecto. 
Pero mejor te hago el cuento: 
Conocí a Nancy García en La Habana, hace muchos años,
cuando éramos adolescentes y estudiábamos en la misma escuela. La distancia nos
separó cuando ella se fue a vivir a México; pero años después nos reencontramos
en Estados Unidos. 
Nancy nunca se cansaba de leer, de escribir y de
estudiar, era una persona creativa, curiosa y con un insaciable deseo de conocimientos.
¡Todo le interesaba: desde la literatura y el arte hasta la política, las
finanzas y la astrología! Sus amigos la adorábamos porque era muy cariñosa,
pero también muy sincera. 
En los últimos tiempos ella impartía clases de
computación para adultos de la tercera edad en un centro educacional
comunitario. Al mismo tiempo, cursaba una maestría en Literatura Hispana en la Florida
International University, en Miami. 
Pero Nancy enfermó gravemente y murió en 2014, después
de una valiente batalla por la vida. Ordenando sus papeles, apareció una
colección de poemas titulada El instante
que nos une, que ella había escrito y que, por modestia, nunca intentó
publicar. Son versos hermosos, llenos de sinceridad y emoción, escritos en
español. Hablan de la vida, del amor, de la amistad. Es un libro muy suyo, muy Nancy. 
Mi proyecto consiste en publicar ese libro y organizar
un evento para presentarlo a la comunidad de lectores de Miami. Para poder realizarlo
cuento con el apoyo de varios colaboradores.
Nancy ayudó a mucha gente a lo largo de su vida. Para nosotros,
sus amigos, será una gran alegría que este libro se publique y que sus poemas
sean leídos y compartidos. 
En este proyecto he tenido el valioso apoyo de Zaida
del Río, pintora de prestigio internacional, quien hizo los dibujos que se
usarán para ilustrar el libro y para hacer un poster promocional. Nos
proponemos tener listo el libro para octubre. 
Ayúdanos a realizar este sueño. Súmate a esta
celebración de la vida, la amistad y el amor.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Tongue in cheek, humorous and philosophical, Monk Key is a candid look into the life of a young adult battling cancer, but with a strong Buddhist influence. It’s more like an adult children's book. It’s emotional, educational, heartfelt, and totally original.</p>
<p>Born in the year of the Monkey and with a strong Buddhism background
and Key connotes with the initial of my name Kyle and to unlock the mystery of life. Monk Key is conceived after
a year I’ve completed my cancer treatment. After the death of my father and recently, a friend of mine, Uncle Chan whom have the same cancer as me, discovered that the tumor has spread to the liver, that inspires me further to write this book . </p><p>This <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by BlockIt Ad remover"">book<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important;""/></a> talks a lot about

of black and white book filled with humour and tongue in cheek illustrations
that show a journey of me overcoming nasopharyngeal cancer. The fund raised will
help me to start upanti-cancer health supplement store and website
ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Tongue in cheek, humorous and philosophical, Monk Key is a candid look into the life of a young adult battling cancer, but with a strong Buddhist influence. It’s more like an adult children's book. It’s emotional, educational, heartfelt, and totally original.
Born in the year of the Monkey and with a strong Buddhism background
and Key connotes with the initial of my name Kyle and to unlock the mystery of life. Monk Key is conceived after
a year I’ve completed my cancer treatment. After the death of my father and recently, a friend of mine, Uncle Chan whom have the same cancer as me, discovered that the tumor has spread to the liver, that inspires me further to write this book . This book talks a lot about
the mental states I’ve gone through cancer. By using humour and creative
visualization (guided imagery) as a way to allows reader to comprehend Cancer
is no different from other kind of mental anguishes we suffered universally.
Hopefully this book will brings you laughter and others might find it inspiring.My goal is to publish this book and give it away to others who are
suffering from cancer or family and friends affected by cancer, and you can
help to make it happen!
FOR EVERY BOOK (HARD COPY) SOLD, I'LL GIVE ONE TO A CANCER PATIENT*.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3>
<ul> </ul> <p>My name is Rebecca and I have always been a writer. From a young age I started writing poems and within journals, diaries always handy. I wrote for school and church papers, and participated in writing role playing games to stretch both my skill and my imagination. I have previously written several novels, although this is the first worth mentioning.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help raise funds to publish my novel, ""Life's Defeat"". It is the first a series, outlining the trials of a young woman as she is tested both mentally and physically in a world that she never knew existed. I have included a synopsis below.</p>
<p>Publishing this novel will be quite the dream fulfilled, hopefully the first of many. The second book in the series is already written as well, and the third is around half done. I would love to be able to see all of them published by the end of 2016. </p>
<p>It had already made a huge impact in my family's life. My daughter (age 6) now attends my monthly writing meetings with me, eager to write herself. My husband looks at me with a new found awe that some may argue is hard to achieve after being married for nine years. My son, well, he is only 15 months old so I am just cool in his eyes regardless. </p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></h3>

<h3>Short Synopsis of Life's Defeat</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>A young girl is brought to a boarding school after tragedy strikes and her parents are killed. To the majority of the students ignorance, the school is run by a vigilante soldier, a genetically altered man who keeps a close eye on the girl, always watching. Years later she is given a choice to become one of the soldiers and seeing no better choice, agrees.</span></p>
<p>Time passes and the girl, now a young woman, fights with a tenacity rarely seen but she is changed, tired of the bloodshed and heartbreak of sending young people to their graves too soon. She leaves for a time but is destined to return.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But as she rejoins the school, the only home she has ever known, she is captured by a malicious criminal who intends to take over the nation. The young woman is put through trials to test her physical limits in a seemingly endless cycle testing her sanity.

  My name is Rebecca and I have always been a writer. From a young age I started writing poems and within journals, diaries always handy. I wrote for school and church papers, and participated in writing role playing games to stretch both my skill and my imagination. I have previously written several novels, although this is the first worth mentioning.
This campaign is to help raise funds to publish my novel, ""Life's Defeat"". It is the first a series, outlining the trials of a young woman as she is tested both mentally and physically in a world that she never knew existed. I have included a synopsis below.
Publishing this novel will be quite the dream fulfilled, hopefully the first of many. The second book in the series is already written as well, and the third is around half done. I would love to be able to see all of them published by the end of 2016. 
It had already made a huge impact in my family's life. My daughter (age 6) now attends my monthly writing meetings with me, eager to write herself. My husband looks at me with a new found awe that some may argue is hard to achieve after being married for nine years. My son, well, he is only 15 months old so I am just cool in his eyes regardless.    
Transparency is key

I have asked for $2500 which is broken down accordingly:

- $700 for editing through T.Morgan Editing
- $150 for Cover Design
- $600 for the printing and shipping of 100 softcover books
- $450 for producing and shipping rewards for sponsors
- $350 for website creation, promotions, etc
- $250 for indiegogo and paypal fees

These amounts are approximate, as the amount needed for editing may change slightly as I am doing one last edit before sending the manuscript to my editor and based on how much gets added/cut will affect the book printing costs.

If I exceed my goal the excess money will be going towards editing and publishing the next book in the series which is already written and awaiting me to edit it. 

If my goal is not reached I will focus on getting the novel ready step by step, editing first, then cover design, then printing last (as the printing is the last step in the process the physical books will rely on making the full funding goal).

My perks for my sponsors are things my own street team has suggested: physical books, bookmarks, tshirts, etc. All will be sent out once the novel has been edited and published - my goal is for the end of October; however, I hope to have it out sooner.
   
Short Synopsis of Life's Defeat

A young girl is brought to a boarding school after tragedy strikes and her parents are killed. To the majority of the students ignorance, the school is run by a vigilante soldier, a genetically altered man who keeps a close eye on the girl, always watching. Years later she is given a choice to become one of the soldiers and seeing no better choice, agrees.
Time passes and the girl, now a young woman, fights with a tenacity rarely seen but she is changed, tired of the bloodshed and heartbreak of sending young people to their graves too soon. She leaves for a time but is destined to return.
But as she rejoins the school, the only home she has ever known, she is captured by a malicious criminal who intends to take over the nation. The young woman is put through trials to test her physical limits in a seemingly endless cycle testing her sanity. Through murder, accidents and suicide she survives, gaining scars that will never heal. As time passes her fears grow; there is no escape, not even death.
At one of her lowest points she is rescued by those soldiers with whom she used to serve. Broken, beaten, mentally unstable and severely injured she finds herself without purpose as those around her try to fit her into life without the vigilantes at the school. A romance begins, and in him she finds a piece of home she had long forgotten.Unable to bear a life without purpose any longer, the woman steals away to remedy her physical condition under the watchful eye of a new ally. When she returns she successfully proves both her strength and emotional state are intact. She yearns to reap vengeance on the man who imprisoned her, but is she prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to defeat him?
(NOTE: This novel is not intended for children due to the violence of the fighting and graphic scenes. It is a little bit mystery, science fiction, fantasy and game of thrones-esque...)

Parole e Forme da Tokyo a Bologna è un progetto avviato nel 2011 in
collaborazione con la Scuola di Lingue e Letterature, Traduzione e
Interpretazione dell’Università di Bologna. L’iniziativa, cresciuta anno dopo
anno e avvicinatasi a un pubblico sempre più eterogeneo, si concentra in particolare
sul Giappone contemporaneo e sui diversi tipi di tendenze e prodotti culturali
che dai confini nipponici si diffondono a livello internazionale, raggiungendo
una molteplicità di paesi che comprende anche l’Italia.Letteratura,
arte, manga, musica, cinema sono solo alcune delle componenti che caratterizzano NipPop che, nell’arco delle
varie giornate, prevede solitamente un primo momento di riflessione critica,
nel quale si alternano gli interventi su diverse tematiche di studiosi e accademici provenienti da
importanti centri di ricerca internazionali e di artisti ospiti; un secondo momento, poi, è dedicato agli
appuntamenti che incentivano uno scambio
con il pubblico, come laboratori e incontri con gli autori, ma anche
attività ludiche come concerti, performances, proiezioni, cosplay e molto altro. 
Nel novembre 2013 da quest’esperienza si è
costituita a Bologna l’Associazione
Culturale NipPop, per la promozione delle culture del Giappone
contemporaneo.
Per la sua quinta edizione, NipPop segue il filo rosso della metamorfosi che si è affermata come
linea guida dell’arte contemporanea e della cultura “Asian power” del nuovo
millennio che guarda a est. Nello specifico, saranno presi in
esame artisti nella cui ispirazione il tema della metamorfosi si dispiega sullo
sfondo discorsivo delle nipposuggestioni:
personalità creative profondamente ricettive che dal Giappone si sono spostate
– e tuttora vivono – in Europa, nei cui lavori prepotente è la contaminazione.Tanti gli ospiti e gli appuntamenti di questa  edizione: dal Giappone l'autrice di Lady Oscar Riyoko Ikeda e lo scrittore, regista e cantante Jinsei Hitonari Tsuji,  protagonisti della sezione Incontri; le artiste Yumi Karasumaru e Tomoko Nagao, per la sezione NipPop Art; NipPop Music con  l'incredibile sound che mescola tradizione e pop di Keisho Ohno, con i SAGA e le BABYMETAL, con Eriko’s K-ble Jungle.  E poi ancora i workshop con Keiko Ichiguchi e Watanabe Yoshiko, Ivo De Palma, e tanti altri appuntamenti (anche in base al vostro supporto!).Per il programma completo visitate il nostro sito http://www.nippop.it/5-6-7-giugno/
NipPop:
Words and Forms from Tokyo to Bologna is an annual project, started in
2011 in collaboration with the School of Foreign Languages and Literatures, Interpreting
and Translation – Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna. The event, developed throughout the years towards a
broader audience, focuses on contemporary Japan and particularly on phenomena –
such as literature, cinema, manga, and
animation – playing a decisive role in spreading the Japanese culture in
Italy, and worldwide as well, now and during the last decades.


Every year, NipPop hosts a series of important
talks and workshops, including the participation of internationally well-known scholars, professionals and
artists. This aims to generate a multi-disciplinary, critical reflection on
important cultural topics and to reach the interest of an increasingly
heterogeneous audience. 
Alongside with cultural talks and academic debates, a
second aspect of NipPop has been growing during these years. Music concerts, art performances, film exhibitions
and cosplay events call on the
attention of many people and students in Bologna. On top of that, new and more
interesting activities come to life with every new edition of NipPop, assuring
a great visibility and affluence to the event.

<br/>
<h3>Why the Korup?</h3>Good question, and a slightly long story (bear with us): <br/>As well as being an author, Tom Moorhouse works as an ecologist at WildCRU. One of his colleagues, Christos (that's him in the middle), runs a conservation project in Korup, working with local collaborators to study and safeguard the region's precious, ancient forests and the wildlife therein.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462874963/IMG_0548_gck6nk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Christos and his team (Malenoh, Orume and the other amazing folks), knowing that the traditional folk stories were being lost, collected tales from all the region's elders and chiefs. Christos asked Tom to write the stories up, so they could be photocopied and handed out to the local children.<br/><br/>Rather than just doing that, Tom called up some amazingly talented and incredibly generous people who all said ""yes"" to writing a story, illustrating the stories or editing and publishing the book - and so the project began.<br/><br/><h3>Do these kids <i>really</i> have no books?</h3>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Are there any other benefits?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Yes. Like many places with a wealth of natural resources, but a relatively poor population, the Korup's forest is under threat. The main threats are rampant hunting of animals for bushmeat and massive conversions to oilpalm plantations.</p>
<p>Our book is full of tales of the forest and the animals that live there - and while they may just be stories, they are a connection to the forest, educating children about animals and habitats, and inspiring literacy.<br/></p>
<p>Of course one book can't solve all the problems facing the Korup's forests, but it can help: education is vital to empower people to protect their 
resources and way of life.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What happened to the Korup's stories? <br/>
</h3>
<p>Here's how it used to be: every month the whole of each village would gather and tell their stories - part of an oral tradition. But life has changed and these gatherings no longer happen. The oral tradition is being lost, but there are no written stories to replace it.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Can you really do it?</h3>Yes, absolutely - with your support. 
Christos' project has been established for a long time and works closely
 with the people in the Korup. We are perfectly placed to get these 
books quickly printed and delivered to the children who need them.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462874264/kids_school_zc10ua.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why the fundraising goal?
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Printing books gets
less expensive (per book) the larger the batch you print. We need enough to
cover the Cameroon printing and distribution costs for 2,000 copies -
thus supporting local Cameroonian businesses - as well as the costs
for printing and distributing a large enough batch of UK copies, on
the right paper, with colour illustrations, in a beautiful gift
format, to send to all <i>you</i> lovely people - remembering that
your books will fund the Cameroon printing.</p>
<h3>If you beat your funding target, what happens?</h3>
There's more to do. Our book is written in English, which is one of the main languages the three ethnic groups living in the Korup use to communicate. The other main language is French - with further funding we can translate the book into French, and distribute many more copies.<br/>
</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>How do I learn more?</h3><p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign is to fund the first year expenses for Cuil Press, a new publisher that will specialize in diverse and #ownvoices genre fiction. The publishing industry does not welcome non-mainstream work. Too many authors have been told their stories are ""too ethnic"" or ""unrelatable"" to mainstream readers or that a character could be part of only one minority group. We want to change that.</p>
<p>We are a small team, Jess, Michon and Michelle, with a lot of experience. We've written and published books, worked as editors and marketers, organized communities and gone to art school. Between the three of us we've done a bit of everything.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our first stretch goal is $5,000. This will cover going to a few conventions (transportation, hotel, and table fees) and some advertising expenses.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is not enough diverse and inclusive fiction out there. There is not enough own voices fiction out there. And there is <i>way</i> too much genre fiction that follows the well-worn tropes and cliches without bringing anything different and new to the table. We aim to change that.</p>

<li>We will be publishing inclusive and diverse fiction, much of it #ownvoices, so folks looking for good representative fiction can find it.</li>
<li>We will be publishing books that break genre tropes and conventions, so readers who are tired of the same-old, same-old, can find fresh, new fiction to enjoy.</li>
<li>Our team is new to publishing-as-a-business, but includes self-published authors, an editor, a marketer, and an artist. Our prior and current projects include the successful blog Polyamory on Purpose and building the Facebook community Intersectional Non-Monogamy (3,000+ members in one year and growing). We've taken on big projects before and know how to make plans come together.</li>
<li>We'll be starting small, and building as we go. But we believe we can bring real change to your bookshelves and to eventually to publishing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Publishing is pretty saturated right now. There are hundreds of new books coming out each month. So the big challenge for any new publisher is standing out and getting our books in front of people. Cuil Press has some specific challenges because we are small team of spoony folks and are starting on a shoestring budget. But we believe in what we are doing and have plans to how to make it work.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are very few genre publishers focusing on inclusive fiction, and the ones that are, are almost exclusively putting out LGBT romance. Many people are calling for more diverse books and more #ownvoices books. We believe we can stand out by filling this need.</li>
<li>Our belief is that once readers know they can find diverse and #ownvoices romance and SFF with Cuil Press, they will keep coming back to us. This way we make it easier for readers to find what they want and we don't need to constantly fight for visibility in a saturated marketplace.</li>
<li>We will deal with the low budget by doing all work in house. While our team is small, it is experienced. Two of our team members are self-published authors who have also worked as editors. They know the process of taking a book from manuscript to publication as well as the editing process and how to help an author make their book shine. Another team member is a skilled artist who will be creating the images for our book covers, as well as helping with the various steps of the publishing process.</li>
<li>However, as mentioned before, our team is all spoony. So we will be starting slow and releasing a new book every other month. Our goals are 1) by giving proper attention to creating and marketing each book, to bring in enough money we can begin contracting editors and cover designers (as most publishers do) and 2) to bring in new team members so we have more person-hours available and can gradually increase how often we release new books.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>So that's it, what we're doing, who we are, and all the little details. Thank you for taking the time to read and learn about us. Thank you for your interest. Most importantly...</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
This campaign is to fund the first year expenses for Cuil Press, a new publisher that will specialize in diverse and #ownvoices genre fiction. The publishing industry does not welcome non-mainstream work. Too many authors have been told their stories are ""too ethnic"" or ""unrelatable"" to mainstream readers or that a character could be part of only one minority group. We want to change that.
We are a small team, Jess, Michon and Michelle, with a lot of experience. We've written and published books, worked as editors and marketers, organized communities and gone to art school. Between the three of us we've done a bit of everything.

In time, we hope to release multiple books each month, in ebook and audio format.

What We Need & What You Get
What we need:
Our minimum goal is $1500. This will let us pay back the loan from friends for our legal incorporating fees, get a big batch of ISBNs (required to publish a book), pay for our webhosting, keep our cover artist in art supplies, and have a bit extra for unexpected expenses.


Our first stretch goal is $5,000. This will cover going to a few conventions (transportation, hotel, and table fees) and some advertising expenses.
Our final stretch goal is $10,000+. Currently our team is all volunteer, no one is getting paid until the Press starts making a profit. If we reach this goal, we can start paying ourselves for our work.
As long as we get enough money to get a stack of ISBNs, the Press is moving forward. But your help can make a big difference in whether or not we succeed.

What you get:
A new publisher putting out the kind of stories you want to read.
And as thanks, you'll get a few extra things as well ;-)
Of course since we're a publisher, we're offering books
 

Our Book Lovers Perk gets you our first ten ebook at ~20% below retail. If you're quick, you can grab the Early Bird Book Lovers Bundle for even less.
 
We're also offering:

Exclusive wallpapers based on our book covers
Original short stories

The Impact
There is not enough diverse and inclusive fiction out there. There is not enough own voices fiction out there. And there is way too much genre fiction that follows the well-worn tropes and cliches without bringing anything different and new to the table. We aim to change that.

We will be publishing inclusive and diverse fiction, much of it #ownvoices, so folks looking for good representative fiction can find it.
We will be publishing books that break genre tropes and conventions, so readers who are tired of the same-old, same-old, can find fresh, new fiction to enjoy.

I was a medical illustrator for the National Institute of Health for 18 years, and April works as a graphic designer for several local companies, and has illustrated several children’s books.  Besides art, we both act, play various instruments, April dances, and I write.  However, we are best known for the few films we made in the horror genre.  We were bestowed the title of “<i>First Family of Indi Horror</i>” which I felt was the best compliment we could ever receive at that time.  When we would go to fan conventions, our kids were there.  When we would create  and perform plays, our kids were there.  When we had anything going on at all, it was done as a family, to a great extent.

It was this sort of performance where I would meet my wife to be, April.  She and I, now married 18 years, have raised two incredible young women - one sharp, book wise, smart as a whip; the other whimsical, artsy, full of imagination.  These two personalities are the formula for our stories, Creepy and Boo.  Growing up is complicated.  It’s full of little traps, let downs, insecurities.  But also full of passion, discovery and joy.  Navigating the ups and downs of growing up are the basis of our stories.  </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>We are looking to self publish the Creepy and Boo Books and to get that ball rolling, we are looking to raise $5,000 for printing, ebooks, marketing, etc.  Without an agent, it is difficult to get into a large publishing house.  Our goal is to self-publish the first book, in hopes that the next of the series can get picked up by a larger house.  We have 4 books at this time.  two completed and two in process.  We are hoping to make Creepy and Boo, as well as whatever other quirky original stories we come up with, our full-time career.

She looks at her illness as a gift, because it has given her the ability to see the world with different glasses. With your support, Jenevieve will be able to print the first edition of her book and share her glasses with you and many others.In addition, Jenveive believes in giving back. Throughout her life she has been blessed with the support of some wonderful Mito organization. The phrase ""it takes a village.."" is applicable and a percentage of every campaign dollar raised will go to helping these organizations find a cure for Mitochondrial Disease.The BookPEACH, the book, is an inspiring account of courage, hope, and strength despite a rare life-altering disease that that is told with heart-wrenching pathos. Peach, the teenage author, aka Jenevieve Woods, relates with lyrical beauty how she feels while being ignored because she is 'different', and implores us all to celebrate our differences and be 'as one'. She explains that her affliction is a gift that enables her to focus on the unstoppable powers of hope, kindness, compassion, and gratitude for a life of meaning and discovery.Ms. Woods' book demonstrates wisdom, compassion, and insight into the human condition that is far beyond her eighteen years.  She praises her mom for being her hero, her stepfather for being her rock, and her brothers for being her soul mates. She accepts the life granted her with grace and even gratitude: ' HERE IS THE GREAT PART: I am glad I have this disease, mostly because I have come to understand and have discovered the meaning in my life. It is to help others. I have a unique set of glasses that I wear that gives me the power to see everybody’s soul and their truest self.Sneak Peek at the Table of Contents*This is an early edition, minor changes may still occur. Early ReviewsMedical ProfessionalsPeach has a unique set of glasses that gives her the power to see everybody's soul and their truest self.

Buy the book, read it, and feel its power working on your soul.- Dr. Eugene Myers, MD, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, University of Pittsburgh Medical CenterThis is a powerful story of hope and its unstoppable power.- Paul Spence, former Vice President, Highmark Health SystemI will recommend this book to my patients and others who are struggling with health and relationship issues, or who want to be moved by an exceptional story told with lyric beauty.- Dr. Jacqueline Meyers, Ph.D., Clinical Director, Meyers Professional GroupPeach displays communications and other talents that are rare and unexpected in a teenager struggling with a debilitating medical condition that is also life threatening. She has a story to inspire the world; her struggle is a compelling read.- Nancy Green,  Disability Services Director (Ret), ACHIEVA Academia & TeachersTruly a brilliant piece of literature… Peach is a gift who has given us a gripping story of a young woman’s courageous daily battle with a life-altering illness. I was captivated with her very first words in Chapter 1. Peach’s view of equality, a “feeling inside more than a reality.”- Rebecca A. Clemens, M.Ed. ,Professional School CounselorPeach has provided a glimpse into a world that not many people will experience.  Her account of MITO and its devastating effects on her life and the life of her family is both moving and encouraging... her story should give hope to the rest of us as we try to make sense of our lives. - Daniel K. Donnelly, Ph.D.,  Dean, School of Business, Aquinas CollegeYour book should be required reading...you have inspired me deeply and irrevocably...- David Zimomra,  Public School TeacherBusiness LeadersThank you, Peach, for giving me insight into myself and bettering the way I relate to exceptional people...and for sharing your deep and personal thoughts. You will enhance the behavior of many.- Jim Browne, President, and Founder, Allegheny Financial Group (Peach) has captured with her own words a significant concept that seems to be increasingly absent from human interactions - be kind to one another by truly celebrating others' differences. Peach's message of acceptance will teach all who listen that 'although things look different to the eyes, all souls are equal.' I am honored to have read her story.- Keri Cimarolli,  Environmental Biologist Peach is a gifted writer who silently shouts out an optimistic message of forgiveness of adversaries, and a celebration of differences, through her beautiful prose and poetry.- John Yasinsky, Former CEO, GenCorp. Peach's story is inspirational.  The thoughts and feelings of a young woman who faces adversity with an attitude that is far beyond courage - and includes wonder, awe and hope - is an inspiration to all of us.

<p><strong> About me:</strong></p>
<p>I am Alexandra Konstatýna Veliká, I come from the Czech Republic. I am a single mom who loves writing and wishes to publish her book, The Big Apple Strippers, very soon. It's a literary novel - provocative romance - for women. It's going to be a trilogy. I am currently working on the second book. I also already have a schedule for all three books.</p>
<p>Writing has been my passion and my hobby since childhood. At school, my literary works were always best in class. I believe it’s my destiny. I was born to write. I studied Public Relations at School of International and Public Relationships in Prague. I also go to Markéta Dočekalová’s School of Creative Writing and Scriptwriting. I finish the studies in June 2019. I am a member of Czech Writers Union. I write articles as an external editor but I am happiest whilst writing books and I want it to be my full-time job. I wrote three books which I did not try to publish just yet. I used them as a perfector of my writing skills. Now, I’d like to start my career with a trilogy: The Big Apple Strippers, The Big Apple Dreamers, and The Big Apple Crashers. I live by it, I work on it every day, and I can’t wait for the success.</p>

<p><strong>Your help: </strong></p>
<p>The money is needed especially for publishing of Czech and English version. 1.000pcs of the Czech version at Klika publishing would cost me 70.000CZK (3.082,4USD). 200pcs of the English version would cost me 41.000CZK (1.805,4USD). Of course I'd prefer to print more of the English version which would reduce the cost per book. If I manage to get the whole amount, I will gladly increase the number of English copies by more than a half. I would also like to send out a small part of the English copies to English - speaking literary agents together with a publication proposal, meaning that a small amount of the money would be used for correspondence. If I managed to get more money, I'd like to invest them into promotion and possible repring of more books.</p>
<p>Money I'll make off the book I'll use to pay for translations into other languages thereby securing the prompt dissemination of the book to other countries. Your financial help would make it easier for me to publish the book on my own and release it as soon as possible. I'd love to use as many marketing and advertising tools as possible so my book would have the release it deserves. I'll be eternally grateful for any support at all.</p>
<p>You don't have to be afraid of losing your investment. To each and every amount invested, apart from basic support, you'll get a gift.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p><strong>Potential: </strong></p>
<p>It would be a great loss if I didn't receive any support. I believe that my book has a potential to succeed and will lift lots of people's spirit. It's kind of similar to Sex and the City in that the main characters are also New York girlfriends that date men and wish to be loved, they just also happen to be strippers. Thanks to my book, people will have the opportunity to look inside the nightlife in New York and, I hope, will lose some prejudices regarding this infamous profession. Men and everyday life are the most common topic in the book which may also remind you of the 50 Shades series in that both books share common topic of sexual dominance and submissiveness. We also have the man of the dreams - James Black, who's even darker than Christian Grey. The book is about love, friendship, life in New York and Strippers. It would be a great shame if it didn't get to be published in a scale that it deserves. I will greatly appreaciate any support!</p>

Here is a link of My Personalized Manuscript Report from the authors of the Bestseller Code. I received four stars, meaning my book is likely to become a bestseller. Books that receive three or more stars already sell very well. You can find more information at

Book story: 
Ashley Cooper leaves for New York city to get a pause in her relationship with Dominik, the father of her daughter, and who had cheated on her. She travels to the big city with her daughter and brings along a nanny. She can't wait to see her three friends who have been living in New York and see how their lives are. It turns out all three of them work as strippers and not unlike Ashley. The three friends show Ashley around. Neither of the three wants to be strippers their entire lives. Their common themes are men, love, relationships, fashions and plans for the future. Ashley loves her job but often wonders if she should start thinking about doing something else in life. Her hope is to find her true love and passion. She succumbs to the seduction of James Black, who she wonders if she is opening herself too much to. Ashley's biological father, who doesn't yet know about her, lives somewhere in the Upper Westside. Ashley finds her love in New York and begins to believe that impossible can be possible. Dominik arrives in New York and replaces the nanny. This creates a dilemma; will she return to Dominik or would she succumb to the physical attraction she has with James. Will New York fulfill her dreams or will she hit rock bottom?

Your help: 
The money is needed especially for publishing of Czech and English version. 1.000pcs of the Czech version at Klika publishing would cost me 70.000CZK (3.082,4USD). 200pcs of the English version would cost me 41.000CZK (1.805,4USD). Of course I'd prefer to print more of the English version which would reduce the cost per book. If I manage to get the whole amount, I will gladly increase the number of English copies by more than a half. I would also like to send out a small part of the English copies to English - speaking literary agents together with a publication proposal, meaning that a small amount of the money would be used for correspondence. If I managed to get more money, I'd like to invest them into promotion and possible repring of more books.
Money I'll make off the book I'll use to pay for translations into other languages thereby securing the prompt dissemination of the book to other countries. Your financial help would make it easier for me to publish the book on my own and release it as soon as possible. I'd love to use as many marketing and advertising tools as possible so my book would have the release it deserves. I'll be eternally grateful for any support at all.
You don't have to be afraid of losing your investment. To each and every amount invested, apart from basic support, you'll get a gift.
 
Potential: 
It would be a great loss if I didn't receive any support. I believe that my book has a potential to succeed and will lift lots of people's spirit. It's kind of similar to Sex and the City in that the main characters are also New York girlfriends that date men and wish to be loved, they just also happen to be strippers. Thanks to my book, people will have the opportunity to look inside the nightlife in New York and, I hope, will lose some prejudices regarding this infamous profession. Men and everyday life are the most common topic in the book which may also remind you of the 50 Shades series in that both books share common topic of sexual dominance and submissiveness. We also have the man of the dreams - James Black, who's even darker than Christian Grey. The book is about love, friendship, life in New York and Strippers. It would be a great shame if it didn't get to be published in a scale that it deserves. I will greatly appreaciate any support!

<h3>What is The Regeneration?</h3>
<p>Published twice a year, The Regeneration Magazine highlights creatives, thinkers, artists, and entrepreneurs who are making waves in the environmental movement and changing the conversation about climate change. </p>
<p>The project was founded by Kyle Calian in November of 2016 as a response to the digitally oversaturated, polarized media climate that surrounded our most recent Presidential election. </p>
<p>Climate Change is becoming and already is the biggest and most complex problem humanity will ever face. <strong>There is not one solution – in fact, there are hundreds. </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509424744/hv0xdg3k86mtypkx2gyy.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Most mainstream journalism is focused on the problems caused by climate change – the impending natural disasters, the displacement of people and species loss. We become overwhelmed with a numbing cocktail of fear and empathy. We don't know what to do because the problem doesn't have a clear solution of action.</p>
<p><strong>The Regeneration aims to solve that.</strong></p>
<p>We've created a publication is to showcase writers, leaders, and entrepreneurs who are actually solving problems and equip readers with knowledge, inspiration and the ability to take action.</p>

<h3>What We Need Your Help With</h3>
<p>After a successful first round of crowdfunding this past May, we were able to distribute over 1k copies of our first issue.</p>
<p>We want to increase the number of copies to 2k – but we also want to plant a tree for every copy sold with TreeEra. The funding we're trying to raise will go towards printing, shipping, and other distribution costs.</p>
<p>To thank you for your help, depending on your level of support, we'll be distributing copies of the magazine,  invitations to our upcoming launch party, Back to the Roots home farming kits, and even publishing your name in the magazine. </p>

<p><strong>Short Summery</strong></p>
<p>Have you heard about an erasable story book?  Now you have!  Sydney.</p>
<p>Our aim is to encourage children to explore. Explore color as they color and erase and color again. Explore relationships as seen as when Sydney meets friends traveling through the work day. Explore and define their own definition of ""work”. Men and women are engaged in careers once thought to be “girl or boy jobs”. In accordance with this, Sydney is gender neutral.</p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Our perks are unique. Each of them a reminder of a moment shared with Sydney.</p>
<p>A CD that tells of a day in the life of Sydney, a placemat and markers for ongoing action and a playful magnet to greet you each time you open your refrigerator.</p>
<p>Then, of course, a copy of Sydney, the book, autographed by the author and illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>To get Sydney off the ground we need to raise $5250. This will mostly cover editing, design, production and manufacturing as well as perks and shipping. Because Sydney is a dry erase board book, we have found the production costs of Sydney are more than the traditional children’s book.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our first challenge is making sure everyone understands Sydney. Sydney is not a cookie cutter book. Sydney is a magic erasable book - a ""color and color again book"". Sydney has no gender because gender does not determine one’s station in life!</p>
<p>That being said, finding a supplier was difficult, after several ""no's"" we found a supplier right here in Michigan, enabling us to promote Sydney as a Made In America book.</p>
<p>Our plans to date include making Sydney into a series of books from Ricecheks Books. Marshall is up for this challenge - as he is our illustrator.</p>
<p>Seen and unforeseen costs are a big concern as this is our first book.</p>
<p>Marshall and I ran an online business for 12 years - Michiganmall.com.  During that time, many unforeseen problems emerged - BUT, we handled each one as they arose.  </p>
<p><strong>A Little About Us</strong></p>
<p>Marshall is a man of many talents engineer, entrepreneur, musician. substitute teacher and now author and illustrator. WOW, I'm his wife, but I am impressed!</p>
<p>Janis is a survivor. Her first challenge began in 1977 with her onset of Multiple Sclerosis.  Another of her challenges is keeping Marshall on task.  However, with several other challenges during her life - she has never lost her smile or her sense of humor.</p>
<p>Marshall and Janis Rice (we) are a husband and wife team and work together 24/7. Sydney has become part of our life and we look forward to the day that Sydney is brought to life!  We do need your help and support to make this happen.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h3>
<p>I've been a student of love all my life.</p>
<p>I believe the world is more loving when we care for the consciousness and heart in children and in ourselves.</p>
<p>When Cora asks, <strong>""What's the most loving thing to do?”</strong>, the answers show each of us how we too might be more loving in the world.</p>
<p>Books have always been a doorway into the world of my imagination and heart. I believe they can deeply touch our souls and cause us to reflect on our very foundation. That foundation for me is love.</p>
<p>As a professional actor, I was fascinated with what made people tick and what gave them joy.  The capacity to see patterns, and to love what makes others thrive, brought me to the world of intuitive coaching at <a href=""https://wisdomrx.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WisdomRx.com</a> with my beloved partner David.</p>
<p>In the gift of raising my two daughters, Shelley and Jessa, the spirit of 'Cora’ blossomed inside me once again.</p>
<p>I’ve always said I was going to write a 'children’s' book; at least a book for the inner child. And then one day, it just showed up. Now, I realize I’ve spent my lifetime preparing for it.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is Not So Little Cora</h3>
<p>A book for children ages 7-12 and young readers of <strong>all ages</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>“Love is bigger than Big and knows just what to do.”</strong> Cora is a pure soul, in a little body, that sees the world through the eyes of love.</p>
<p>Cora is friends with many beings, both seen and unseen, and hasn't lost the capacity to be friends with fairies, aliens or the spirit of her grandpa after he dies. For Cora, every being and everything is inside the world of love.</p>
<p>Not So Little Cora is a bright star. She acts as a reminder for each of us that we too have a true north star within us.</p>
<p>Can you imagine who you would be if the roots of your soul had been allowed to fully blossom and you could live free?</p>
<p>That is the world that Cora and I support.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ve decided to self-publish Not So Little Cora. I believe it's the best way to stay true to my creative vision for this book. To turn this project into a reality, <strong>I need to raise $5000.</strong></p>
<p>I currently live in Mexico. My wonderful team here is helping publish Cora in both English and Spanish. The English version will come first in the spring of 2019, with the second launch in Spanish happening in the fall of 2019.</p>
<p>Specifically, the money will go to the costs for <strong>Illustrations</strong>, <strong>Publishing costs, </strong><strong>website, translation into Spanish</strong>, and (the biggie) <strong>marketing</strong>. I want to raise enough to launch my book into the world at full steam with book-signing events, an online presence, and much more.</p>
<p>The English version is already edited and ready to print once the illustrations are complete at the end of October. The Spanish translator is onboard to begin work, once I've secure the funds.</p>
<p>My Web developer is also onboard, ready to create the website.</p>
<p>The special Cora canvas Tote bag is already being<strong> custom embroidered </strong>in Mexico.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, <i><strong>Not So Little Cora </strong></i>will still come to fruition--it's already written, edited and (almost) ready to roll. But with your support the book will soar.</p>
<ul><li>Although I've never published a book before, I've been writing my entire life. This book is a culmination of all my years of working with children and adults as an advocate for love.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Most of all, as you go through your day, consider asking yourself as Cora does,</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“What’s the most loving thing to do?”</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Who Am I?
I've been a student of love all my life.
I believe the world is more loving when we care for the consciousness and heart in children and in ourselves.
When Cora asks, ""What's the most loving thing to do?”, the answers show each of us how we too might be more loving in the world.
Books have always been a doorway into the world of my imagination and heart. I believe they can deeply touch our souls and cause us to reflect on our very foundation. That foundation for me is love.
As a professional actor, I was fascinated with what made people tick and what gave them joy.  The capacity to see patterns, and to love what makes others thrive, brought me to the world of intuitive coaching at WisdomRx.com with my beloved partner David.
In the gift of raising my two daughters, Shelley and Jessa, the spirit of 'Cora’ blossomed inside me once again.
I’ve always said I was going to write a 'children’s' book; at least a book for the inner child. And then one day, it just showed up. Now, I realize I’ve spent my lifetime preparing for it.
 
What is Not So Little Cora
A book for children ages 7-12 and young readers of all ages.
“Love is bigger than Big and knows just what to do.” Cora is a pure soul, in a little body, that sees the world through the eyes of love.
Cora is friends with many beings, both seen and unseen, and hasn't lost the capacity to be friends with fairies, aliens or the spirit of her grandpa after he dies. For Cora, every being and everything is inside the world of love.
Not So Little Cora is a bright star. She acts as a reminder for each of us that we too have a true north star within us.
Can you imagine who you would be if the roots of your soul had been allowed to fully blossom and you could live free?
That is the world that Cora and I support.

I received numerous emails from people asking for the show in book format, so, I said I'd have it ready in a year and three years later, here I am!</p>
<p>As a comic and creative talent there are many projects I could consider for crowdfunding, but this is the one that means the most.  This book will hopefully help some, make others laugh and gross a few men out.  By helping with this campaign you are helping tell the story of one crazy, horny feminist, helping not only myself and my family fulfill this dream and goal but also helping make a positive out of what was a trying and at times extremely painful life.  Maybe it will help others, maybe someone will read it and say ""you know, what, maybe kids isn't for me"" who knows, but we won't know until we get it in the hands of the masses!</p>
<br/>

I received numerous emails from people asking for the show in book format, so, I said I'd have it ready in a year and three years later, here I am!
As a comic and creative talent there are many projects I could consider for crowdfunding, but this is the one that means the most.  This book will hopefully help some, make others laugh and gross a few men out.  By helping with this campaign you are helping tell the story of one crazy, horny feminist, helping not only myself and my family fulfill this dream and goal but also helping make a positive out of what was a trying and at times extremely painful life.  Maybe it will help others, maybe someone will read it and say ""you know, what, maybe kids isn't for me"" who knows, but we won't know until we get it in the hands of the masses!

  What We Need & What You Get I chose $5000 as I didn't want to be greedy, but also wanted to get enough to get the book into the hands of a solid marketer.  I can tweet and post on facebook as good as anyone, but apparently launching a book takes more than my mom ""liking"" my status.  (also I can bet my mom won't read this book, there is a lot of sex in it)

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am Mara, Astrological Psychologist, Berlin, and
I'd like to present you Pluto. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Do you know
Pluto? No, not the adorable dog, I am referring to the other three
Pluto… the planet, which isn't a planet anymore… the god of the
underworld, who guards the souls and treasures… and the
astrological Pluto, which so often has to play as the bad guy.</p>
<h3><b>Why</b></h3>
<p><b> I wrote this book ? It´s time, to see Pluto as activator for the own private evolution.</b></p>
<p><b>And for this I need your help.</b><br/></p>
<p>In this book,
“Marginal  PLUTO  Facts and Opinions” you'll find astronomical
data as well as a history of the discovery of the planet Pluto, the
mythological background and references, and astrological 
interpretations. There are of course some additions and opinions of
my own, which I consider to be important. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In short, Pluto all around.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This book is
addressed to everyone who looks for new food for thought. Classical astrologer
and interested persons will find advanced methods of interpretation.
For astrological psychology it offers Pluto to see more
individually.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>You are not sure what astrology is good for?
</b></p>
<p>Astrology is
very distant from the silly levelling that is presented in the
newspapers, and it is no fortune telling either. Astrology can help
you understand the fundamental patterns of a persons life.
Astrological psychology is applied (spirited) self-help. The
constellation of planets is interpreted as a means to describe human
situations and conditions, like a thermometer is a means to describe
a weather condition.</p>
<p><b>Of the
planets, Pluto really is a special case</b>. It was discovered just about
85 years ago and is currently being explored by NASA and its
spacecraft “New Horizon”. Luckily, the probe started before
Pluto was degraded to a dwarf, and is now officially no longer a
planet of our solar system.                                    Astrologically,
Pluto has always been in an unfavourable situation, it was being
associated with evil powers and held responsible for all imaginable
misfortune. But a planet <u>does</u>
nothing more than to follow its course out there.                                       Or does it help to
blame the thermometer when the weather is cold and you are freezing!?                                                                                                                              </p>
<p>These
dark attributions have their root in mythology and the increasing
weight that was placed over time on things hidden from the mind.
Modern astrological psychology interprets Pluto as a representative
of the spiritual planets. That is, a symbol of those instances that
reach beyond the limited ego and drive humans and humankind to higher
achievements.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you are
interested in astronomy, you read books about astronomy. If you
are interested in mythology, you look for literature about
mythological lore. If you are interested in astrology, not only do
you have to learn the metaphorical language and the qualified
interpretation of a horoscope. You also have to know the astronomical
facts and mythological background of every planet, because that is
what enables their interpretation. 
</p>
<p><b>The book
title “marginal” means: Pluto, at the edge of our solar system
and Pluto, at the edge of our mind – beyond that is an abyss. Do we
ignore it? Do we fall into it?  Or do we explore its depth to
better understand the world and us?
</b></p>
<p>The
interpretation of Pluto in your own horoscope is to see as an indication for the power of your own evolution.</p>
<p>Let's see in
the abyss and identify the way of metamorphosis.</p>
<p><b>This book
could be motive and help to find the own way.</b></p>
<p>In order to give this
possibility to everyone,  I ask for your assistance  to accomplish
this goal. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The money
will be needed to cover the print cost, design, ISBN and promotion. The more
people participate, the  earlier the printed book will be ready and
you can read it.    </span></p>
<p>In case of getting more money then planned, I will write a second part including
examples of individual interpretation of Pluto in the method of
astrological psychology.
</p>
<p>In case of
missing the  goal, the designer will still have to wait longer for her fee.
The book will come.</p>

Astrological psychology is applied (spirited) self-help. The
constellation of planets is interpreted as a means to describe human
situations and conditions, like a thermometer is a means to describe
a weather condition.
Of the
planets, Pluto really is a special case. It was discovered just about
85 years ago and is currently being explored by NASA and its
spacecraft “New Horizon”. Luckily, the probe started before
Pluto was degraded to a dwarf, and is now officially no longer a
planet of our solar system.                                    Astrologically,
Pluto has always been in an unfavourable situation, it was being
associated with evil powers and held responsible for all imaginable
misfortune. But a planet does
nothing more than to follow its course out there.                                       Or does it help to
blame the thermometer when the weather is cold and you are freezing!?                                                                                                                              
These
dark attributions have their root in mythology and the increasing
weight that was placed over time on things hidden from the mind.
Modern astrological psychology interprets Pluto as a representative
of the spiritual planets. That is, a symbol of those instances that
reach beyond the limited ego and drive humans and humankind to higher
achievements.


If you are
interested in astronomy, you read books about astronomy. If you
are interested in mythology, you look for literature about
mythological lore. If you are interested in astrology, not only do
you have to learn the metaphorical language and the qualified
interpretation of a horoscope. You also have to know the astronomical
facts and mythological background of every planet, because that is
what enables their interpretation. 

The book
title “marginal” means: Pluto, at the edge of our solar system
and Pluto, at the edge of our mind – beyond that is an abyss. Do we
ignore it? Do we fall into it?  Or do we explore its depth to
better understand the world and us?

The
interpretation of Pluto in your own horoscope is to see as an indication for the power of your own evolution.
Let's see in
the abyss and identify the way of metamorphosis.
This book
could be motive and help to find the own way.
In order to give this
possibility to everyone,  I ask for your assistance  to accomplish
this goal. The money
will be needed to cover the print cost, design, ISBN and promotion. The more
people participate, the  earlier the printed book will be ready and
you can read it.    
In case of getting more money then planned, I will write a second part including
examples of individual interpretation of Pluto in the method of
astrological psychology.

In case of
missing the  goal, the designer will still have to wait longer for her fee.
The book will come.
What you get




this good feeling to have put new thoughts into the world
my happiness to have published an important book

a set of terms used by astrological psychology                                          


your
own horoscope as a triple (without interpretation)                                   


only
in german language: your own horoscope with short description of the position of
pluto (similar in the book)

<p></p>
<p>In <b><i>Conan Doyle and the Mysterious World of Light</i> </b>that's exactly what I've done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This book's publication will mark the centenary of the moment Sir Arthur Conan Doyle declared his Spiritualism to the world in 1916. </p>
<p>It covers the early period of his growth as a Spiritualist from 1887, and then shows how his faith exploded on to the world's stage between 1916 and 1920. I write a commentary to explain the background of his letters, give short biographies of different personalities in the Spiritualist world and even discuss the nature of Spiritualist Science and how some of the greatest scientific minds of the age were convinced by Spiritualism.</p>
<p>Along the way, you meet scientists, journalists, writers and clergy who either agree with him or argue against him. You meet the believers who held views similar to Doyle's, and the mediums who drove the vast movement of Spiritualism that expanded during the Great War  and led to a 7,000-strong Spiritualist Memorial Service at the Albert Hall in 1919 where Conan Doyle gave a stirring speech to the assembled masses - reproduced here, in full. </p>

Or the idea (which I admit, I started off with) that Conan Doyle came to his beliefs in contradiction to his scientific beliefs. Not so. Mistaken or not, the two beliefs were a continuity of his world view. In writing this book, I grew to understand his faith and why so many were (and some still are) dedicated to it.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time Doyle's writings in <i>Light </i>have been collected in this way. Many of these articles and letters are republished here for the first time. Doyle's story is surprising. Over the course of four years from 1916, Doyle became the world leader of the Spiritualist movement. In 1920, he left the shores of the UK to go to Australia and New Zealand, dedicating the rest of his life to Spiritualist missionary work. At the same time, he continued writing his Holmes stories.</p><p>It's a an extraordinary tale.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></p><p></p><div style=""text-align: center;"">Well... here it is...</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449791141/lgfu45errqj6gjwaax6e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

</div></div>","Hello!



My name is Matt Wingett - a writer who lives in Portsmouth, UK. That's important to my story because the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is my neighbour... or he was, give or take a hundred and thirty years...
I have to admit it, in the last few years, I've become a bit obsessed with Sir Arthur. He was a puzzle. A brilliant writer; the man who created Sherlock Holmes - yet he also believed in ghosts. I asked myself: ""How can that be?""
After all, Sir Arthur's great creation, Sherlock Holmes, once said:


""How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?""
So, how did Conan Doyle the man of science become Conan Doyle the believer in telepathy, ghosts, levitation, ectoplasm - and even fairies? To find out, I began sifting through the Arthur Conan Doyle Collection, a mass of archive material, letters, photos and books held in Portsmouth Library. One magazine in particular caught my attention.

   What We Need & What You Get We are seeking money for the publication of this book. Specifically, funds raised will be used to not only produce and market the book, but to provide each of the veterans interviewed with his or her own personal copy, free of charge.
We have  created a series of rewards in exchange for your support of this project, which include both print copies and audio copies of the book.
    The Impact 
According to statistics released by the Veteran's Administration, our World War II veterans are dying at a rate of approximately 492 a day. Of the 16 million men and women who served our nation in World War II, about 855,070 are still alive. As one veteran told us, “I’m 91 years old, and in five or six years there won’t be any more of us.” That is precisely why their stories have to be told now.
    Risks & Challenges
Because of the age of our veterans, time is of the essence. Our goal is to have this book available for veterans, their families, and their friends by Veterans' Day, 2016.    Other Ways You Can Help We realize not everyone can contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

I started writing while in my teens and have had many poems and short stories published, however, nothing prepared me for this novel.

It was not a want, not nearly as fleeting as a simple desire, but an actual NEED. My life hasn't been the easiest, as I am sure that most of us can attest to, and after a 10-year long abusive relationship this book was something inside of me that I just had to get out.

<p>I couldn't put it down.
The author uses impeccable writing to portray these characters so clearly it is
as if you were right there with them living through this novel. I liked the
fact that the author utilizes some guts to root the story in fact, such as the
backdrop of the Holocaust (a controversial subject). It is the PERFECT blend of
fact and fiction. The romance and sexual content is just enough without going
overboard. Intertwine that with the old style vampire element (which is
refreshing compared to the teen vampire genre btw); well...you have the best
novel I've read in a LONG time. I would suggest this novel to any adult looking
to step out of their everyday life and enjoy a bit of passion, excitement,
darkness, romance, and a refreshing take on the legend of the vampire. VERY
IMPRESSIVE!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Beautifully
Dark and Romantic</b> </p>
<p>I chose this book
 because I am a huge fan of The Vampire Diaries and True Blood. Each of
those shows have a really haunting, romantic and dark backbone. They don't show
vampires and glittery or beautiful creatures, they show them as dark creatures.
When I heard of this book, I knew it would be one that I would love. It has so
much more to offer than your typical vampire novels. It has romance, but not
the kind that seems destined to work, it shows instead the longing and
abandonment felt by love that doesn't come easy. As you read, it takes you
through twists and turns that keep you guessing. And right when you think you
know the characters, a twist comes that makes you question all you though you
knew. I would recommend this to anyone and I will warn that once you pick up
this book, you will not only want to keep reading, but you will find yourself
wanting more...even once it's done. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Extraordinary</b></p>
<p>This is not your typical
vampire romance. This dark romance is heartbreaking, emotional, and has an
ending that is unpredictable. The characters are so well developed. This story
is for anyone looking for dark paranormal romance. </p>

<p>The Blood

<p></p>
<p><b>A Fresh
New Take </b></p>

I found myself unable to
wait for the next sentence as the vivid descriptions pulled me in! The author
wipes clean the slate and resurrects the vampire of old. Paired with a rarely
touched subject of the Holocaust, Gypsies and just enough romance to soften the
darkness, the author brings a story that leaves you wanting more. Praise to the
author for restoring my interest in the writings of the immortal soul and
delivering a tale that keeps you from putting the book down in anticipation of
what will come next! <br/><p></p>
<p><b>Awesome
Writing</b></p>
<p>This author is able to
take you deep into the story so that you're engaged with the characters and

A Gypsy curse binds two souls for all eternity...

Demyan is thrust into a concentration camp - his Gypsy heritage a sin to the Aryan race.  Suffering greatly in his imprisonment he is caught unaware when a mystical light sparks within his soul, irrevocably drawing him towards Alhena - a child of the Sinti.


But as the light intensifies, darkness seduces.
For 329 years, The Blood Countess has roamed the earth, searching for the one that will release her from a never-ending loneliness when she comes upon the camp of death.  Vowing that Demyan will be hers, she tempts him with pleasures of the body he's never known and he loses himself in her icy caress. 

His body belonging to The Blood Countess, his heart to Alhena. 
The Gypsy legends of his past soon come to haunt him, warning him of the mulo and he withdraws from her poisoned embrace, the light within beckoning him back to Alhena.  But when Alhena perishes in the gas chamber, he light in his soul is severed and The Blood Countess damns him to an eternity of darkness.
Until he feels the glowing thread winding it's way into his dead black heart from his mortal life...The Blood of the Black Rose on Amazon

I'm Jodina Meehan, an artist in Southern Vermont who paints with sound waves, using a process known as ""Cymatics"" ...here's an image of the kind of art I make using salt, a violin bow and metal plates...
12x12 Steel plates, enamel, salt formed by sound waves.
Over the past few years I have been commissioned to do cymatics projects for Cirque Du Soleil, for the show TOTEM, and also for National Geographic, for the episode ""Patterns"" on their show ""Brain Games""...


Cymatics is fascinating because it shows something that is normally invisible - sound waves - in a visual way, such as in this video where I am playing a ""violin"" style plate-and-bow (the plate is brass, the powder on the surface is salt, and it is simply sound that is making the patterns)...


in november of 2014, the idea for a trilogy of fantasy books  with cymatics at the heart of it just ""fell into my head"" out of the blue one snowy day. I imagined this world would be called ""CYMATICA"" and that sound waves were the most powerful thing in this world, so powerful they were magic...and so powerful that sound has been outlawed...I started writing down ideas and in about two weeks I had all three books laid out in a notebook, with characters, plot, and settings complete...I hadn't planned to write a fantasy trilogy but there it was, staring me in the face, asking to be brought to life... So I began getting up at 3 am every morning to write, and write, and write...until...today. :-) At this point, I am happy to announce that Book One in the series is finished! It's about 400 pages long, and the magical world of CYMATICA now includes character sketches, instruments from the world that I am working on building, and even a ""secret alphabet"" called the CODEX that is made up of cymatic symbols created with sound waves...The heroine of Book One is ""Cambiare"" and as the story opens, sound has been outlawed in all of CYMATICA by the ruling class, because it is so powerful. Audible speech, singing and instruments are all illegal, and children wear boxes over their ears to show solidarity with The State. It will be Cambiare's task to defy the State and bring music - and magic - back to CYMATICA, along with the help of nine children from school who rally to her cause...Here's what is needed now to bring CYMATICA to print so that you can read it and share in this magical adventure...1. CYMATICA needs a professional edit. I have an amazing writing coach and agent who is working on the book with me to get it in shape for printing and publishing, Suzanne Kingsbury. I need about $5000 to get the manuscript ready to go to print. So that is what I am asking for in this initial launch. 2. CYMATICA needs the artwork, maps, music, & the CODEX (cymatic alphabet) of its world to be completed so that they can be included in the book. I have a good start on all of these but it will take money to hire a videographer, recording studio, and to complete the art for the book. ...So, as my STRETCH GOAL, once the original $5000 goal is hit, is $10,000. If we hit that, it will be used to create the music, art, and other elements above. This would be amazing to be able to do right away!!!But the first milestone I need to hit is the $5000 to polish the manuscript. We have 30 days to do it...Here's some of the REWARDS you can get when you pledge to this project and help me bring the world of CYMATICA to print: REWARD #1: Pledge $5 I'll email you the first chapter from CYMATICA, from the original manuscript so you can read it now!REWARD #2: Pledge $10I'll email you ALL of the chapters of CYMATICA, from the original manuscript, once a week as installments!

You will be able to read the whole book chapter by chapter, in it's pre-published version, right away. PLUS I'll include printable copies of original art, sketches and pages from my journal for Book I, and early releases of the CODEX. This is the only level where you can get the limited early edition (with art + CODEX letters) without waiting for it to be published later...REWARD #4: Pledge $50I'll send you a signed physical copy of the final version of CYMATICA Book One when it's published...in paperback...with the first card of the CODEX so you can start solving the secret messages! Plus you will also get one chapter a week of the original manuscript emailed to you as in the levels above.REWARD #5: Pledge $100I'll send you a signed physical copy of the final version of CYMATICA Book One when it's published...in hardcover...with the first card of the CODEX so you can start solving the secret messages!

<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Just in case you are the straight to the
point type of person, here's the short brief:</b></p>
<p>I've written a really funny children's book
about a pubescent girl who comes to terms with her bodily changes under unusual
circumstances. All of the book illustrations are finished and paid for out of
pocket. </p>
<p>I need your help getting this project
published, marketed and distributed plus IndieGoGo fees. The plan is to print
exactly what you see below, a 5.5 x 8 dust jacket hardcover edition.</p>
<p>I believe more than ever, this book will
give both girls and boys a new and profound perspective on the challenges of
puberty. By supporting this project, you will help offer children a comforting
and informative story about conquering pubescent fears and
self-consciousness. </p>
<p><b>... and for the,
""I'm all ears” type of person, here's a longer brief:</b></p>
<p>I'm a wife and mother of two precious
little girls, ages 7 and 13. They were the inspiration for this book and the
book series to come. Their character names are June and Ally. The story<b> </b>is a
narrative of Ally's diary entry about her experience of dealing with pubescent
underarm hair. She goes through a number of actions trying to figure out what's
happening to her body before consulting her mom. Finally, after somewhat of
""a talk"" with mom, Ally realizes she needs to find a way to get rid
of the unsightly bush of pit hair, thrusting a whole new line of events into
action.</p>
<p>This is one of the best stories I've ever
read about puberty and I'm not saying that because I wrote it, *wink* . On
another note, the real life ""Ally"" went through many different types
of emotions during this stage in her life. Although, I was there to helped her
through it, I went through many emotions about it as a child and again as a
""parent"" not knowing exactly how to help. Then, I had an epiphany.</p>
<p><b>What if there was a book
out there about this stage of puberty? One that children weren't afraid or
ashamed to read or even recommend to a friend? One with such a good story
line, they'd almost forget they were learning the do’s and don'ts to
pubescence underarm hair dilemmas. A book that would build confidence and
support systems amongst children, even parents, who read it.</b></p>
<p>So, I decided to become the author of the
book. I sat the girls down and told them of my plans. They said, it would be
too embarrassing, but after the first few pages they were all in. I hired
an amazing illustrator to help bring the story more to life and he did just
that! Now, this story needs to be published and distributed to reach children
near and afar. That's why I'm asking you to back Dear Diary—book 1.  I
need your help to reach, teach, and inspire a new perspective on this subject.</p>

</div></div>","Just in case you are the straight to the
point type of person, here's the short brief:
I've written a really funny children's book
about a pubescent girl who comes to terms with her bodily changes under unusual
circumstances. All of the book illustrations are finished and paid for out of
pocket. 
I need your help getting this project
published, marketed and distributed plus IndieGoGo fees. The plan is to print
exactly what you see below, a 5.5 x 8 dust jacket hardcover edition.
I believe more than ever, this book will
give both girls and boys a new and profound perspective on the challenges of
puberty. By supporting this project, you will help offer children a comforting
and informative story about conquering pubescent fears and
self-consciousness. 
... and for the,
""I'm all ears” type of person, here's a longer brief:
I'm a wife and mother of two precious
little girls, ages 7 and 13. They were the inspiration for this book and the
book series to come. Their character names are June and Ally. The story is a
narrative of Ally's diary entry about her experience of dealing with pubescent
underarm hair. She goes through a number of actions trying to figure out what's
happening to her body before consulting her mom. Finally, after somewhat of
""a talk"" with mom, Ally realizes she needs to find a way to get rid
of the unsightly bush of pit hair, thrusting a whole new line of events into
action.
This is one of the best stories I've ever
read about puberty and I'm not saying that because I wrote it, *wink* . On
another note, the real life ""Ally"" went through many different types
of emotions during this stage in her life. Although, I was there to helped her
through it, I went through many emotions about it as a child and again as a
""parent"" not knowing exactly how to help. Then, I had an epiphany.
What if there was a book
out there about this stage of puberty? One that children weren't afraid or
ashamed to read or even recommend to a friend? One with such a good story
line, they'd almost forget they were learning the do’s and don'ts to
pubescence underarm hair dilemmas. A book that would build confidence and
support systems amongst children, even parents, who read it.
So, I decided to become the author of the
book. I sat the girls down and told them of my plans. They said, it would be
too embarrassing, but after the first few pages they were all in. I hired
an amazing illustrator to help bring the story more to life and he did just
that! Now, this story needs to be published and distributed to reach children
near and afar. That's why I'm asking you to back Dear Diary—book 1.  I
need your help to reach, teach, and inspire a new perspective on this subject.

humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a
quality we owe to each other. And if we belong to each other, we participate in
our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, definitely I am. The
‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution...”—</i></b>Khafre
Kujichagulia Abif</p>
<p>Publishing suffers from a major diversity
problem. Statistics show that the vast majority of books published are by white
authors and about white characters. Part of the problem is that the majority of
the staff behind the scenes, including publishers’ employees and reviewers, is
also white. When almost all of the gatekeepers and decision-makers are white,
it is no wonder that on average only 10% of children’s books published each
year are by or about people of color.</p>
<p>For decades there has been overwhelming
agreement in the industry that there should be more diversity at all levels in
the book world, but the problem never seems to go away. Where do we even start?</p>
<p>If we are serious about trying to address the
lack of diversity in the publishing world, creating <b>Ubuntu Press</b> is but one first step we need to take. Sharing our
numbers as an industry will not only clue us in to important patterns that we
may be missing, it will also show that we are committed to change.</p>
<p>In the past, publishers have usually put the
responsibility on readers for the lack of diverse representation in books. The
extremely dated adage that “diverse books do not sell” has become a belief that
has reached mythical proportions. While it’s important for readers to support
diverse books with their dollars and voices, it’s equally important for
publishers to self-reflect on how they can do better on their end. We must
acknowledge that one factor contributing to the lack of diverse books is the
lack of diversity among the people who edit, market, review, and sell the
books.</p>
<p>The goal of <b>Ubuntu
Press</b> is to serve as editor, marketer, reviewer, and seller of books from
often marginalized communities which is inclusive of genre, gender,
race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability. To facilitate writer, poets,
and artist who would like to pursue publishing their work. Ultimately,
Ubuntu Press aims to increase diverse books in the children’s and adult book
world.</p>
<p>Through your support and participation in this
campaign we can work together to put in place sustainable programs that will
increase diversity among publishing staffs in the long-term. Together, we can
create a more inclusive book publishing industry.</p>
<p>“<b>Ubuntu </b>[...]
speaks of the very essence of being human. [We] say [...] ""Hey, so-and-so
has <b>ubuntu</b>."" Then you are
generous, you are hospitable, you are friendly and caring and compassionate.
You share what you have. It is to say, ""My humanity is caught up, is
inextricably bound up, in yours."" We belong in a bundle of life. We say,
""A person is a person through other persons.""</p>
<p>[...] A person with <b>ubuntu</b> is open and available to others, affirming of others, does
not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper
self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater
whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others
are tortured or oppressed, or treated as if they were less than who they are.”</p>
<p><b>Ubuntu
Press</b> will work in the spirit of Ubuntu seeking,
supporting and sharing the stories and works of the collective community voice
in an effort to build a greater human experience.</p>

subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my
person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon
the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each
other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each

Kujichagulia Abif
Publishing suffers from a major diversity
problem. Statistics show that the vast majority of books published are by white
authors and about white characters. Part of the problem is that the majority of
the staff behind the scenes, including publishers’ employees and reviewers, is
also white. When almost all of the gatekeepers and decision-makers are white,
it is no wonder that on average only 10% of children’s books published each
year are by or about people of color.
For decades there has been overwhelming
agreement in the industry that there should be more diversity at all levels in
the book world, but the problem never seems to go away. Where do we even start?
If we are serious about trying to address the
lack of diversity in the publishing world, creating Ubuntu Press is but one first step we need to take. Sharing our
numbers as an industry will not only clue us in to important patterns that we
may be missing, it will also show that we are committed to change.
In the past, publishers have usually put the
responsibility on readers for the lack of diverse representation in books. The
extremely dated adage that “diverse books do not sell” has become a belief that
has reached mythical proportions. While it’s important for readers to support
diverse books with their dollars and voices, it’s equally important for
publishers to self-reflect on how they can do better on their end. We must
acknowledge that one factor contributing to the lack of diverse books is the
lack of diversity among the people who edit, market, review, and sell the
books.
The goal of Ubuntu
Press is to serve as editor, marketer, reviewer, and seller of books from
often marginalized communities which is inclusive of genre, gender,
race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability. To facilitate writer, poets,
and artist who would like to pursue publishing their work. Ultimately,
Ubuntu Press aims to increase diverse books in the children’s and adult book
world.
Through your support and participation in this
campaign we can work together to put in place sustainable programs that will
increase diversity among publishing staffs in the long-term. Together, we can
create a more inclusive book publishing industry.
“Ubuntu [...]
speaks of the very essence of being human. [We] say [...] ""Hey, so-and-so
has ubuntu."" Then you are
generous, you are hospitable, you are friendly and caring and compassionate.
You share what you have. It is to say, ""My humanity is caught up, is
inextricably bound up, in yours."" We belong in a bundle of life. We say,
""A person is a person through other persons.""
[...] A person with ubuntu is open and available to others, affirming of others, does
not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper
self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater
whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others
are tortured or oppressed, or treated as if they were less than who they are.”
Ubuntu
Press will work in the spirit of Ubuntu seeking,
supporting and sharing the stories and works of the collective community voice
in an effort to build a greater human experience.

Creating a small business which is Ubuntu Press was the answer. Yours
support will allow Ubuntu Press to seek the voices and stories of those under-
represented in publishing. Together will be allow the stories and history of
our collective community to be told.
The impact of Ubuntu Press will be creating and building community through

<br/><h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>SoulEvents was founded by Lee-Ann Frances Bates in 2015 to uplift humanity and create a movement towards greater peace and abundance for all. During the creation of premier event, SoulTalks it became clear to her that her work over the years around living a love based life was influencing the conversations leading to the event, shaping the people lives involved in the event and allowing people to create radical and empowering change in their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451030382/dmatxfi65tlzumhnoj8n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 254.129px; height: 262px;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>During the event, each inspiring talk (a conscious conversation), wrapped back to the same simple foundational concepts Lee-Ann had been teaching and mentoring. As the day built in energy in was becoming clear that the 21 Days of Love Challenge that had been created on air only weeks prior and was to be issued at the event was more than just a simple challenge. It was life changing experience that allowed people to develop radical self awareness, empowerment, peace and freedom in their lives. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451033102/tonhumeqcerblzlxnd1j.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 588px;""/></p>As the time to issue the challenge grew near, one member of the team Cody Wicks, was so inspired by one the talks that he asked to step forward and issue the challenge himself. He shared his journey of making only love based decisions, starting in his work and spreading throughout his life for 21 days in the summer. As it would happen, within 24 hours of writing a paper on that experience, the idea of the challenge came up again in a radio interview, where Lee-Ann organically announced a 21 day challenge to listeners! After his story was shared people at the event and the challenge was issued, people began taking the challenge, creating their own events online for it (and we encourage you to do the same), sharing their stories and creating new life experiences filled with greater love and joy! <br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451034439/rscuz4egm7si4sztqcrm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 402.297px; height: 253px;""/></p>
In the most wondrous way two concepts Lee-Ann felt deeply about began to merge. The message: Living according to our Soul Led purpose meant living and creating from our Hearts. The Heart being the gateway to our Soul...that place of our loving and authentic, purposeful and complete selves. When we dare to take a leap and live without listening to fear...when we dare to live and love as our most authentic selves...honouring ourselves and the world through loving action and thought...following our passion and bliss and allowing the heart to led our minds...we find miracles and positive shifts happening in our lives with greater ease...we find ourselves more supported, peaceful, happy, content, abundant and fulfilled. We become free to live the life we desire and able to create it with more ease and harmony. Then the magic really happens because for each person that lives in peaceful abundance another person is so inspired and set free to also create this new kind of life. Our peaceful abundance grows into peaceful abundant relationships and those relationships into neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods into a peaceful abundance country and countries into a peaceful abundance world.<br/><br/><p></p>

<p></p>We feel the path to peace on this planet means helping others live a peaceful, passionate, empowered life of love and abundance so we want to take this world wide through a book and help as many people as possible live the life they dream of. We choose to live according to our hearts and follow our soul led purpose so that we can create a better world for all and through the campaign and the creation of this book, we'd like to share that journey with you. We want every person on this planet to live the life they dream...to feel connected...to know their power....to experience the freedom and peace of mind that comes with living a life of love. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451039278/ao8shcu1pw6b18yykydr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 243.087px; height: 214px;""/></p>

Our Story 
SoulEvents was founded by Lee-Ann Frances Bates in 2015 to uplift humanity and create a movement towards greater peace and abundance for all. During the creation of premier event, SoulTalks it became clear to her that her work over the years around living a love based life was influencing the conversations leading to the event, shaping the people lives involved in the event and allowing people to create radical and empowering change in their lives.








During the event, each inspiring talk (a conscious conversation), wrapped back to the same simple foundational concepts Lee-Ann had been teaching and mentoring. As the day built in energy in was becoming clear that the 21 Days of Love Challenge that had been created on air only weeks prior and was to be issued at the event was more than just a simple challenge. It was life changing experience that allowed people to develop radical self awareness, empowerment, peace and freedom in their lives. 

As the time to issue the challenge grew near, one member of the team Cody Wicks, was so inspired by one the talks that he asked to step forward and issue the challenge himself. He shared his journey of making only love based decisions, starting in his work and spreading throughout his life for 21 days in the summer. As it would happen, within 24 hours of writing a paper on that experience, the idea of the challenge came up again in a radio interview, where Lee-Ann organically announced a 21 day challenge to listeners! After his story was shared people at the event and the challenge was issued, people began taking the challenge, creating their own events online for it (and we encourage you to do the same), sharing their stories and creating new life experiences filled with greater love and joy! 

In the most wondrous way two concepts Lee-Ann felt deeply about began to merge. The message: Living according to our Soul Led purpose meant living and creating from our Hearts. The Heart being the gateway to our Soul...that place of our loving and authentic, purposeful and complete selves. When we dare to take a leap and live without listening to fear...when we dare to live and love as our most authentic selves...honouring ourselves and the world through loving action and thought...following our passion and bliss and allowing the heart to led our minds...we find miracles and positive shifts happening in our lives with greater ease...we find ourselves more supported, peaceful, happy, content, abundant and fulfilled. We become free to live the life we desire and able to create it with more ease and harmony. Then the magic really happens because for each person that lives in peaceful abundance another person is so inspired and set free to also create this new kind of life. Our peaceful abundance grows into peaceful abundant relationships and those relationships into neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods into a peaceful abundance country and countries into a peaceful abundance world.

We feel the path to peace on this planet means helping others live a peaceful, passionate, empowered life of love and abundance so we want to take this world wide through a book and help as many people as possible live the life they dream of. We choose to live according to our hearts and follow our soul led purpose so that we can create a better world for all and through the campaign and the creation of this book, we'd like to share that journey with you. We want every person on this planet to live the life they dream...to feel connected...to know their power....to experience the freedom and peace of mind that comes with living a life of love. 


Join us today, as we create together, a love based movement to shift humanity and inspire the world. Work with us to empower the world. starting with yourselves, one conscious conversation at a time, one person at a time and one love based decision at a time!  21 Days of Love has already begun to change lives and now it can change yours too.

<p>The influence
of Latin America is increasing daily in terms of economics, politics and

<p>Arenga\Digital
wants to become a place where journalists can also improve their reporting and
storytelling skills. Having been hired as a consultant to teach journalism in
Latin America, I have learned that professional development for journalists is
often an afterthought: The priority is to continuously break news – often
without the type of proper reporting and fact checking that should be held as a
standard. Too many outlets today rely on the element of surprise, the shock
factor, and sensationalism over depth and context. </p>

<li>Formatting: Each title needs to be formatted from a Word document to eBook and paperback. <strong>Total cost for three titles: $300.00</strong>.</li>

<p>Guys, absolutely don't feel pressured to do this, but if you wanna help me become an author who makes a living off their work, this would be a huge help to me.</p>
<p><i>PERKS</i> (aka what you get for donating):</p>
<p>I was first an editor before I became a writer, did you know? I fell in love with it, and know I'm going to college for writing, editing, graphic design, and art - everything you might need in the publishing business except for maybe marketing. I wanted to one day make my YouTube channel an outlet for my fans to ask me about writing and editing, and possible buy my editing services, too. It was one of my long time goals when I started my channel. Even now, I'm getting job offerings at my college and elsewhere to edit essays and novels, but I want to give back to you guys first, because you are the ones who got me here. Please, allow me to give back. I want my publishing project to be a group effort. I will of course have you guys help me pick cover art, titles, synopsis and so on when that time comes, but right now I'm in the writing/editing stages, and I want you to be a part of it!<br/><br/>Each perk will include all the other perks cheaper than it <i>except for the full novel edit</i>. For example: If you buy one of the signed book perks, you will get a signed copy of the book of your choice (make sure to choose the right one in the perks category) plus I'll compile all of the lower perks on top of that (12000 - 15000 total words edited + a shoutout on any social media). The reason some of the perks are limited is either because of time limitations or a limit in stock. Also, I ranged the amount of words for the edits because chapters don't usually fall into a perfect word count. I want to be able to edit your full chapters and not have to stop in the middle of one. The more you spend, the more words you get for your money!<br/><br/>Also, all of this is optional.

</div></div>","Guys, absolutely don't feel pressured to do this, but if you wanna help me become an author who makes a living off their work, this would be a huge help to me.
PERKS (aka what you get for donating):
I was first an editor before I became a writer, did you know? I fell in love with it, and know I'm going to college for writing, editing, graphic design, and art - everything you might need in the publishing business except for maybe marketing. I wanted to one day make my YouTube channel an outlet for my fans to ask me about writing and editing, and possible buy my editing services, too. It was one of my long time goals when I started my channel. Even now, I'm getting job offerings at my college and elsewhere to edit essays and novels, but I want to give back to you guys first, because you are the ones who got me here. Please, allow me to give back. I want my publishing project to be a group effort. I will of course have you guys help me pick cover art, titles, synopsis and so on when that time comes, but right now I'm in the writing/editing stages, and I want you to be a part of it!Each perk will include all the other perks cheaper than it except for the full novel edit. For example: If you buy one of the signed book perks, you will get a signed copy of the book of your choice (make sure to choose the right one in the perks category) plus I'll compile all of the lower perks on top of that (12000 - 15000 total words edited + a shoutout on any social media). The reason some of the perks are limited is either because of time limitations or a limit in stock. Also, I ranged the amount of words for the edits because chapters don't usually fall into a perfect word count. I want to be able to edit your full chapters and not have to stop in the middle of one. The more you spend, the more words you get for your money!Also, all of this is optional. I'll send out an email listing what you are accessible to, according to the reward you purchased, and you can decline whatever you want from there (you don't have to get the social media shout out for instance, if you don't have one or want privacy).
If you want to pay for any of these rewards once, then you're at the right place. You can donate as many times as you want here before the campaign is over.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Melanie Linn Gutowski, a local author and historian. In 2013, I published a book called <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Pittsburghs-Mansions-America-Melanie-Gutowski/dp/1467120154/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Pittsburgh's Mansions</i></a>, which you may have seen in local bookstores and gift shops. You  may also have seen my writing in the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>, <i>Pittsburgh Quarterly</i> or at NEXTpittsburgh.com. I'm now writing a new book, a history of Kaufmann's Department Store, to be published in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>This campaign will help offset the cost of image rights needed to be able to bring you the high-quality images you're used to seeing in Arcadia Publishing's Images of America Series. You know the books: sepia-toned covers with lots of black-and-white photos inside. Those photos aren't cheap; though they're owned by  non-profit organizations like libraries and historical societies, there is a cost to secure the rights to put the image into a book. Arcadia Publishing doesn't provide an advance or any other financial support to authors in securing those rights, so that's where you come in!</p>
<p>You've probably spent many years of your life shopping at Kaufmann's and were sad to see it go. By contributing to this campaign, you will be part of the next chapter of the store's legacy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm trying to raise at least $4,000 to offset the cost of image rights fees. These are fees charged by the institutions (libraries, historical societies, newspapers, etc.) that own the photographs I'd like to publish in my book. </p>
<p>Image rights run anywhere from $10-$90 per image for this type of project, and by contract I'm required to have at least 180 images in the book. As you can imagine, that adds up fast! Some images, like those published before 1923, can be published for free, but as we all know, Kaufmann's was around for a long time after that, and of course we'd like to see photos that were once in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p><strong>What do supporters get?</strong></p>
<p>There are some great perks, including having your name printed in the book's acknowledgements or receiving a signed copy before it's available in stores! </p>
<p><strong>What if I don't reach my goal?</strong></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, any money raised will still go toward the book and everyone will receive the promised perks. Not reaching my goal will just make it a little difficult for me to come up with the funds to complete it. Writing is how I make a living; it's not just a hobby, so I do rely on the money I make writing and selling books to help support my family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There's never been a pictorial history of Kaufmann's before, until now! You'll get to see how the store looked when your mother, grandmother and maybe even great-grandmother shopped there. You'll see downtown Pittsburgh change from dirt roads to cobblestones to streetcars and pavement. You'll relive your memories of browsing Christmas windows every winter and teenage afternoons spent cruising the Kaufmann's at your local mall.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks to backing this project. I'm under contract to write the book and deliver the manuscript early next year no matter what! Either way, you'll be able to buy the book in local stores in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>I've already written one book for the same publisher, so I am used to completing book projects in a timely manner.</p>

<p><b>The
Reprobate </b>is a grown-up (though not
necessarily <i>mature</i>) reading alternative for the reader who has put aside childish
things but who retains the elements of the rascal, the miscreant, the cad, the
bounder, the quaintrelle, the loafer… the reprobate. The person who may have
developed finer (or possible lower) tastes in all things, yet who has not yet
submitted to tedious conformity. The malcontent who knows that the good life
always needs a decidedly bad side.</p>

<p>So
we are aiming our magazine at the modern contrarian. The lady or gentlemen who
knows that style and fashion are very distinct things, with only the former
being important. The lover of the esoteric and the arcane. The nostalgist who
is not blindly tethered to the past. The admirer of beauty and grotesquery. The
sort of person who simply can’t resist tweaking the nose of convention and who
cares not one jot for perceived wisdom. The person who believes that physical
activity is to be avoided whenever possible, and who believes that too much is
never enough. The person who sees government drinking guidelines as a bare
minimum and health warnings as a recommendation. The person who likes to take
up a contrary opinion just for the hell of it. The sort of person who comes
with a trigger warning. The decadent, the freethinker, the rebel, the nuisance
and the iconoclast for whom a ‘safe space’ is anathema.</p>

yourselves, recognise a tattered paperback as an illuminated grimoire; an

We promise to keep you in touch with developments and changes, and we won't be spending any of your money without consulting you if things change significantly from the current plan.   Other Ways You Can Help Hey, times are hard. We know that. But if you can't help us out with pre-orders, you can still show your support for this project by plugging the hell out of us on social media, websites or while annoying people down the pub. The more publicity we can get, the better our chances.
And feel free to plug the website and point people towards issue 0. Thank you and goodnight.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>After a year of dreaming and five months (and continuing!) of putting a dream into action, I (Thu Nguyen) am super excited to share with you my biggest passion project yet. As a proud Houstonian and advocate for Asian American identity, I am pursuing to create a magazine that will showcase both. Rice Paper is currently a Houston based magazine focused on the local AAPI community. Everything in this magazine will have been produced by or be about an AAPI. It is a platform for AAPIs to showcase their work - be it writing, photography, art, design, etc - or to tell their story - experiences related to race and ethnicity, their start up business, or their struggle with mental health.</p>
<p>The name Rice Paper was given by a dear friend who taught me the importance of unity within the Asian communities. Rice is a food that is central to all of the Asian cultures, so just as rice is a uniting food for Asians, I hope Rice Paper can unite all of the AAPI communities by learning each others' stories and supporting each others' endeavors.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that Rice Paper should be a physical magazine because it will be a tangible form of the AAPI identity that can be passed around, studied, and discussed about. I am looking to raise $3,000 to pay for the printing and distribution of this first issue, and whatever is left will be used for the next issue. The official launch of our first issue is January 28th, 2017!</p>

<p>Thank you to OCA-Greater Houston and Debbie Chen for giving me the final push and a small donation to pay for some of the printing, thank you to Bo for naming the magazine and constantly inspiring and supporting me, thank you to Andy for saying yes every single time I ask you to photograph or video something, thank you to Cindy for being patient and always listening to my crazy ideas and almost always going along with them, thank you to MaiTHao for being the most bomb graphic designer ever and basically becoming my partner in this production, thank you all to Sophia and Kim of Montrose Shop, Trang, Sydney and the crew at Myth&amp;Symbol, Vico and Kevin at TOMO, and Christina of Sunchild for being warm, generous and inspiring people - gosh, I feel so cool to be able to thank you all like this. Thank you to Linh and Laura, my mentors from VSA, for encouraging me and giving me strength to do what I am doing now.

<p>For those of you who know tgl books, you know that I have been translating books on baguazhang and xingyi since before 2000. This is the first book that I have written extensively on my own, not simply translated. I want to get it right.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The crowd funding is to pay for plane to and from China and hotel costs in Shanghai and Beijing. I stay in pretty cheap hotels, but not in a bunk bed in a hostel (at the moment I am in a $35 room without a window).  If I don't get the complete goal in funds, every little bit helps, I'm already in Shanghai. In the old days I used to stay with my teachers and friends for training, but things have changed, so I need more cash when I go for extended visits. This time I will be there for five weeks, and the hotel cost alone is $1560.</p>
<p>The perk is a PDF of the complete translation of the 36 verses, pre-publication. I have set it up for teaching purposes with one verse per page in huge text, with Chinese, pinyin, and English. Once the book is published, this version will not be available any more. Another 'perk' is a pre-order of the final book, which I well mail once it is published. This perk included a hefty donation. If you want to get either of these without donating, you can order them from my website, no problem.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>FIRST EVER BOOK FOR EMPLOYEES!</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong> HR and ADA Facilitator Providing Practical Guidance to Employees Managing Health Conditions in the Workplace</strong></p>
<p>As a certified HR and ADA Coordinator, I facilitate and mediate ADA compliance issues between the employee and employer to help both parties through the ADA interactive and accommodation process to ensure the employee can effectively and safely perform his or her job. The best part of this book is that the employee can share the information contained in the book with the employer!</p>
<p>Working with employers and employees has given me a lot of insight on how important it is for the employee to understand the ADA interactive and accommodation process. The more the employee understand his or her rights and responsibilities under the ADA (and the employer's rights and responsibilities), the more effective the outcome is for both parties. Since an employee may not have an opportunity to work with an ADA Facilitator in the workplace, I want to provide an employee with the basic understanding and guidance as it relates to the ADA and employment so that an employee can create a better outcome when discussing and requesting a job accommodation with the employer.</p>
<p>This book will help an employee if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The employer is inexperienced in dealing with the ADA and request for accommodations;</li>
<li>The employer has some knowledge regarding the ADA but does not quite know how to effectively manage the process with him or her to come up with an effective accommodation(s); or</li>
<li>The  employer has an ADA Policy and procedure in place.</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal is to help employees with chronic health conditions feel more confident and more educated when discussing and requesting an accommodation from his or her employer. After reading the book, the employee may come to the following realization:</p>
<ol>
<li>The employee has a covered ADA <i>disability</i>, and there are possible accommodation options that the employee can discuss with his or her employer; </li>
<li>The employee realizes that they may need to discuss other possible job opportunities with his or her employer that they are qualified to perform because the employee can no longer perform the current job functions with or without an accommodation; </li>
<li>The employee needs to look for other job opportunities elsewhere in which he or she are qualified to perform;</li>
<li>The employee needs to get additional training in an area that better accommodates his or her <i>ADA disability </i>so the employee can successful and safely perform the job functions; or</li>
<li>The ADA law does not apply to the employee.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, understanding the law, the processes, and how it relates to the employee's specific <i>ADA disability</i>, will empower employees to be more effective in their discussions with their employer and help them make better decisions about their current job and career.</p>

Who in this case is not made up, and thats what differentiates this story from others stories. The fact that this story is so outrageous but true makes it so much more awesome, and I could make him into a household name. I want to give kids an awesome story that is unique and true. Emilio has the potential to become a series, and that is my ultimate goal. </p><p> </p><p>About six years ago i was on the road with a rock band from Massachusetts. We were out in Illinois and had met up with some of our Radio DJ friends at the time. They had a small cabin out in the middle of nowhere that we were going to stay at for the next week. Everything in this cabin....was pretty much dated back to the 80's.

<br/>SHORT SUMMARY</h3>
<p><i>Flowers for donald</i> is a series of digital collage works begun in the days following the 2016 U.S. election. The work borrows the symbolic potency of flowers to act as anchor points of protest, memorial, and reflexive connotations of enduring beauty within the traditions of art history.</p>
<p>Each <i>Flowers</i> image originates from a stock photograph of a vase of flowers, and undergoes a process of a stream-of-conscious re-authorship; engaging in digital mark-making, manipulation, and web appropriation. The resulting images convey frantic image-logics and blatant artifice as a strategy of visual criticism by attempting, and failing, to enact spectacle that exceeds the power of exhibitionism that defines the presidency, and existence, of Donald Trump.</p>

SHORT SUMMARY
Flowers for donald is a series of digital collage works begun in the days following the 2016 U.S. election. The work borrows the symbolic potency of flowers to act as anchor points of protest, memorial, and reflexive connotations of enduring beauty within the traditions of art history.
Each Flowers image originates from a stock photograph of a vase of flowers, and undergoes a process of a stream-of-conscious re-authorship; engaging in digital mark-making, manipulation, and web appropriation. The resulting images convey frantic image-logics and blatant artifice as a strategy of visual criticism by attempting, and failing, to enact spectacle that exceeds the power of exhibitionism that defines the presidency, and existence, of Donald Trump.



While the aesthetics and strategies of Flowers reflect the destabilization of contemporary political and media spheres, and the fast-shifting values of truth and integrity in a Trumpian America, the ultimate and self-guided failures of Flowers for donald point towards the limits of art as a force for cultural well-being.
Within the vein of Jones’ Dadist antecedents, Flowers for donald challenges the role and function of art itself in politically turbulent times. Ultimately, the deepest layers of Flowers exist as testament to the confines of art, and a realization that critical art work which seeks to mirror its social context is restricted to reflection; within which the visions cannot be touched, grasped, or altered; only witnessed.
Flowers for donald is comprised of 20 images and a poem entitled countries glorious, by Gregory Eddi Jones and Donald Trump.

<h3>
<i>FALSE CONFESSIONS</i> </h3>
<p>The true story of an ex-cop's crusade against the Orwellian polygraph industry.  This book tells the fascinating story of an ex-cop's crusade against the charlatans and thugs in the polygraph industry.  It takes you on Doug's dangerous journey from the White House to the police department and federal prison and stops along the way at CBS, 60 Minutes, the US Congress and to hundreds of radio, television, news and talk shows.  </p>
<p>This compelling story needs to be told.  For the first time in this crusade of four decades, I am asking for your help.  I believe that it is extremely important to let contributors know exactly what the donations will provide.  Let me point out that this is not just about publishing and promotional expenses for a remarkable book that tells the whole story of the dark world of the lie detection industry's collusion against American citizens.  It is a lot more the that...it is about a mission.  A mission that takes us anywhere someone has been victimized by this barbaric testing and directly to the U.S. Capitol where we will complete our historic legislation to protect people from becoming victims.</p>
<p>Because of the broad range of this effort there will be extensive costs.  These include editing, publishing and promoting the book.   Costs will include travel and lodging for promoting this project.  As we gather momentum there will be demands for personal appearances and additional publishing of books.  There will also be a need for legal representation.</p>
<p>I am not financially supported by any government agency or private organization.  I am as independent as the American spirit is meant to be.  This is why I am asking for all the independent thinkers for their support.</p>
<p>I am humbled by every prayer, every person, and every contribution.  I am truly sincere when I say, Thank You.</p>
<p><strong><i>WHERE ARE WE GOING FROM HERE</i></strong></p>
<p>In 1988 myself and others testified in front of Congress which led to the enactment of the EPPA (Employee Polygraph Protection Act).  This gave protection to employees and potential employees from having to submit to polygraph tests.  Unfortunately, this did not include any government employees (Federal, State or Local).  It also did not exempt anyone that was contracting with the government.  </p>
<p>Therefore, the crusade continues until <strong>no </strong>person is subjected to this test that has proven to be fallible.  Especially for those <strong>women</strong> that have reported being <strong>sexually assaulted</strong> and have been submitted to the indignity of having to prove their claim by taking a polygraph (in most all circumstances these tests are administered by a male).   The results of the test may challenge the veracity of the subject's statement thereby affecting whether or not charges will be brought against the accused.  Remember, these tests are <strong>FALLIBLE.</strong></p>

<p><i><strong>                                                                     PROLOGUE</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>     In 1982, the ""Green River Killer"" defied capture as his murderous rampage left numerous victims in his wake.  The community of King County near Seattle, Washington demanded capture of the predator, and the police responded by forming a special task force to ensure his capture.  They asked for assistance from anyone in the area who had possible information.  Melvin Wayne Foster, a 43-year old cab driver, responded to their request with suspicions he had about some of his fellow cab drivers.  But, it was Mr. Foster, himself, who caught their attention and fit their ""profile.""  Their evidence?  Without a doubt, the most damning evidence against him came from the results of a lie detector test administered by police to Foster.  He failed.  Bingo.  They had their man.  </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     Although he denied any involvement in the murders, Foster became the prime suspect in the Green River case.  Twice, the police searched his home.  They collected hair and blood samples from him.  No physical evidence was found.  They had an undecover officer purchase a car Foster had advertised for sale.  They dissected it and sent it off for testing.  This quest for evidence, too, provided nothing.  They placed him under twenty-four hour surveillance for several months.  Nothing.  But, the polygraph test results upon which they relied so heavily provided everything.  Absolutely everything...for the real murderer, Mr. Gary Ridgeway.....</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     .....Ample time, unfettered opportunity, and unobstructed movement as he continued his horrific labors as the Green River Killer.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     Although Gary Leon Ridgway confessed to seventy-one killings, he is presumed to be responsible for more than ninety.  Ultimately, he was convicted of forty-nine separate murders;  thus, making him the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     Tragically, nineteen of the murders committed by Ridgeway took place during the time that police officials intently focused their attention upon an innocent man, Melvin Foster.  And, why?  Because a simple polygraph test had told them that Foster had lied.  </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     Finally, in 1985, forensic science completely ruled out Melvin Foster as a suspect or person of interest with any connection to the Green River killings.  Ironically, the murderer, Gary Ridgeway, had actually passed an initial polygraph test;  however, the results were later overturned by the FBI.  Despite the fact that Ridgeway was ultimately convicted of forty-nine separate crimes, it provided no consolation for the victims.  Their lives were over.  </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>    This incredible incident is not so much about Melvin Foster failing the polygraph as it is about the failure of the polygraph, itself.  A fallable machine failed nineteen young women...all the way to their graves.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>     The horrific consequences in thousands of cases resulting from the use of the polygraph machine became the inspiration for Doug Williams to enter into his life-long Crusade to bring an end to the use of this insidious device.  His journey - and, each small step along the way - is an attempt to right a terrible wrong prevalent in our society today, and to prevent such egregious errors from continuing to ruin the lives of unsuspecting victims like Melvin Foster who fall prey to a machine that, quite simply, cannot tell right from wrong.</strong></i></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of the aims of the journal is to reward the people who really deserve it - the writers. Yes, there are other costs involved in producing and distributing any book or magazine, but it's our belief that these should be outweighed by the authors' right to get paid for their work. It's one of the reasons we're crowdfunding - to ensure that the authors of these wonderful stories receive reasonable payment. Paid markets are becoming increasingly rare and it's a trend that we'd like to see reversed.</p>
<p>We have factored in the costs involved in printing, layout, proofreading, distribution and the production of the other rewards, and already have those covered. The funds raised here will provide payment for the authors, and will also help build the journal for the future - ensuring that we manage to bring out Volume 3 later this year!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There shouldn't be many risks still associated with this project. The stories are already selected, and have all been handed in - so that lineup is final. The printing company is on standby. The design/layout team are ready to go. We just need the money to make it work.</p>
<p>As has already been said, most of the money raised here will go to the authors, so you know that you're helping support the people who deserve it most. The rest of the money will go towards Volume 3, due later this year.</p>
<p>Delivery for Vol. 2 is expected to be June 2018.</p>

<h3>About the project:</h3>
<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p>Movement is Life—Dance our birthright.</p>
<p>In 1986 Leslie Zehr returned to Egypt, the ancient motherland, to be fed and seeded from the Source. There she encountered the mysterious Serpent Goddess who taught her the ancient Sacred Dance.</p>
<p>In this book, the author takes us on that archetypal journey through the Tarot to the Universal Dancer, the Gold—accessing, through the Dance, the power held in ‘the field’. She has taught hundreds of women how to Dance the primordial Dance of the Serpent Goddess by reconnecting the sexual/spiritual aspects within themselves.</p>
<p>Let <i>The Alchemy of Dance: Sacred Dance as a Path to the Universal Dancer</i> open the door to the mystical Dance of the Serpent Goddess.</p>
<p><strong>El Libro:</strong></p>
<p>El Movimiento es Vida – El Baile es nuestro derecho.</p>
<p>En 1986 Leslie Zehr regreso a Egipto, la patria antigua, para recibir de la Fuente el alimento y la semilla.  Ahí ella se encontró con la misteriosa Diosa Serpiente quien le enseño a ella el antiguo Baile Sagrado.</p>
<p>En este libro, la autora nos lleva en un viaje arquetípico del Tarot a la Bailarina Universal, el Oro – accediendo, a través del Baile, el poder contenido en el “campo”. Ella ha enseñado a cientos de mujeres como Bailar el Baile primordial de la Diosa Serpiente reconectando los aspectos sexuales / espirituales en ellas.</p>
<p>Permite que <i>La Alquimia del Baile: El Baile Sagrado como un Camino hacia la Bailarina Universal</i> habrá la puerta hacia el Baile místico de la Diosa Serpiente.</p>
<p><strong>The Author:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leslie Zehr</strong> is a sacred arts teacher, mentor and ‘mid-wife’ to those on a spiritual path.

<p><strong>El Viaje de Alexandra Sánchez</strong></p>
<p>Mi don por la traducción empezó a una muy temprana edad.  Recuerdo uno de los juegos de mi niñez era practicar hablar en inglés y en francés.  Siendo aún una niña, yo traducía del inglés al español tarjetas de cumpleaños o de días festivos para que mi madre las enviase a sus parientes en Sud América.   Esta pasión por la fluidez, ya sea de idioma a idioma o de cultura a cultura incorpora muchas formas de expresión.</p>
<p>La primera vez que conocí a Leslie Zehr fue en la ciudad de Nueva York.  Tomé sus clases y leí varias veces su libro <i>The Alchemy of Dance</i>.  Yo he tenido el placer de Bailar con Leslie en Nueva York y en el Cairo.</p>
<p>En el Cairo, Leslie fue testigo de como yo me rendí a la fluidez de la vida. Yo tuve la experiencia como la que Leslie describe en su libro, “¡Si quieres tener la experiencia de la Bailarina Universal ven a Egipto! Todo cambia segundo a segundo.”</p>
<p>Yo tuve maravillosas aventuras en mi viaje a través de Egipto.  Algunas de mis experiencias en este país de piedras y desierto, invocaron en mí, los recuerdos de mi niñez, de los volcanes y montañas Andinas, del origen de mi país.  La amplia vida palpitante de ambos países, con sus contrastadas topografías, culturas e historia, se sentían unificados en mí.</p>
<p>Instintivamente yo quise traducir el libro de Leslie. Quise traducirlo para mi madre y para todas las personas como ella.  Sabía que ella disfrutaría y se beneficiaria de leer <i>The Alchemy of Dance</i> en español.  Es mi deseo que los lectores de todos los rincones del mundo que leen en español se unan a nuestro viaje.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""After reading this book I felt inspired to dance around the room, encouraged by the book’s message to reclaim this ancient art form. It is quite a liberating experience, to play some favourite music and dance with yourself, connect with your inner being. Leslie Zehr writes about dance in an original way, showing us that dance can reconnect us with the universe, as we move to higher energy forms—this experience she calls Sacred Dance. Leslie Zehr runs the Centre for Sacred Arts in Cairo , where she teaches her unique method of dance to young and old. Dance is shown to be a mystical experience as we learn to dance from within, channeling movement, positive energies and discharging negativity. Leslie gives examples of how to achieve this: see yourself connected to the earth, moving through the four elements, in four directions through space; your feet grounded in the earth, your crown reaching to the heavens. I love the way the book links this journey with the chakras, tarot cards and alchemy—dance as a form of transmutation, an awakening. I began to see my body as a mini universe, transmitting energy, rhythmic waves, and channeling it outwards. Through her in-depth knowledge, the author calls us back to our ancient ancestors, when we used to dance ourselves into a trance, feeling a sense of oneness. The book reminds us of our dance heritage, especially women, who once danced for the Goddess, celebrating the divine feminine. You don’t have to be a ‘dancer’ to experience this, you just have to allow your body to find its own rhythm and let yourself go, allow the energy to flow through you like water. The Alchemy of Dance shows us how to regain our deeper selves and feel a greater connection with the life-force, moving in harmony with the universe.""—Yvonne Harlech author of <i>Mistress of the Temple</i> and <i>Harp of Joy</i></p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello, all! My name is Kayla, and I'm a young, multitalented artist. I'm best known for my pet portraits and cartoony illustrations on my <strong>Instagram page, @cirylxd</strong>, and elsewhere on social media.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p><strong><u>The Turtle who Wanted to Fly</u> is about a highly-ambitious turtle, Tiptoe, as he experiences frustration and longing while trying to make his latest dream a reality.</strong> I wrote the first draft in a high school creative writing class, but it was always more than a grade to me. In a lot of ways, I do see myself and my friends in Tiptoe: eagerly rushing through his work, failing, drawing inspiration from his friend Dusty, learning to be patient with his progress, and trying again. It was the type of story I needed as a kid, and, I hope, the type of story that other children might need. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578946936/ytmevwhvs2hf7vr1wgun.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A very old cover concept, drawn back in high school when I was writing the first draft. Look at that improvement!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My classmates encouraged me to continue the project, and ever since- between jobs and higher education and life events- I have been working on it so quietly. Along the way I realized that the book is, in a way, a story about itself. Its completion is like my set of turtle wings.</p>
<p><strong> It's about 90% finished now, with approximately 34 pages completely written and beautifully illustrated in mixed media. The last 10% is the hardest: getting it published and noticed, and that's where I need you.</strong></p>
<h3>The Funding Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>In the most beautiful, perfect world, I would hope to raise $800 for this project.</strong> Here's how I came up with that number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately $300 to purchase the ISBNs (basically unique ""social security numbers"" that every book needs in order to be discovered and sold) for the paperback, hardcover, and digital versions.</li>
<li>$100 to apply for entry into the Library of Congress and libraries around the US.</li>
<li>$35 to apply for a copyright, so my work and characters are protected.</li>
<li>$100 as the base fee for the publishing service I am using.</li>
<li>Then, the rest of the budget would go to the creation and shipping of perks for backers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If We Don't Reach My Funding Goal:</h3>
<p>In the event that we fall short of what I need, I plan to fund the rest with earnings from my art booth, online print shop, and pet portrait commissions. I'm intensely dedicated to this project and won't let a little pitfall end it. However, yes, it will surely take longer to finish this way. </p>

<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<p>If we raise money beyond the initial goal, I would like to develop a website and more merch specific to the book. At $1000, I can work on getting you new poster and sticker designs. Pillows, pins, and even plushies may become options at around $1500.</p>
<p>Another thing I might like to do if resources and backers allow is to redraw a couple of my older pages. I think they're great already, but an artist is never satisfied, are they?</p>
<p>Also considering adding a couple pages featuring the journey of the book, like early sketches, character designs, and storyboards. Perhaps a page thanking my backers by putting their names in the book, if that interests anybody.</p>

<p>About a year ago, we moved from the city to an off grid homestead in the middle of the desert. I also decided that I didn’t need to be on my anti-depressants any longer.

<h2>Café Pyt har brug for din hjælp - ellers lukker vi!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Café Pyt</strong> &amp; De Uafhængige Forlags Boghandel er hårdt ramt af Corona - og desværre kan vi ikke få dækket vores faste udgifter fra kompensationspuljerne. Derfor må vi lukke, hvis ikke vi kan rejse penge på en anden måde. <strong>Vil du hjælpe?</strong></p>
<h3>
<br/>Hvad er Café Pyt &amp; De Uafhængige Forlags Boghandel?</h3>
<p>Cafe Pyt er en lokal café i <strong>Sydhavnen</strong> startet af forfatter og forlægger Bjørn Themsen og hans kæreste Melanie Baumann  i 2019.</p>
<p>Udover økologisk kaffe, tjekkisk øl og koldt køkken huser caféen Danmarks største udvalg af udgivelser fra uafhængige skønlitterære danske kvalitetsforlag. </p>
<p>Ved siden af vores daglige Café- og boghandelvirksomhed holder vi <strong>mange arrangementer</strong>.</p>
<p>Hver måned har vi fx haft Jazz &amp; Tapas med P8 vært Jens Rasmussen, som har trukket folk til fra et stort opland.</p>
<p>Hver måned har vi haft oplæsningsaftner, forlagspræsentationer eller debataftner med forfattere og kunstnere som Morten Søndergaard, Asger Schnack og Anders Bonnesen.</p>
<p>Vi har også huset sammenkomster for Dansk/Svensk Forfattersammenslutning, dannet ramme om møder for de uafhængige forlags netboghandel, Mikrofest, og Poesiens Hus og andre. Café Pyt er også mange mindre forlags foretrukne sted at holde reception i forbindelse med bogudgivelser.</p>
<p>Under Corona-lukningen var vi de første til at lave Litterære Livestreams, og i halvanden måned havde vi en lang perlerække af forfattere inde og læse op hver dag kl. 15.</p>
<h3>
<br/>HVORFOR HAR PYT BRUG FOR PENGE?</h3>
<p><strong>Kort fortalt:</strong> Corona-udbruddet knækkede en i forvejen skrøbelig økonomi. Café Pyt er, og har fra begyndelsen været, en idealistisk humlebi, som ikke burde kunne flyve. Det er ikke nemt at drive kulturel virksomhed i Danmark, og det er ikke nemt at starte en lille café op i et “nyt” kvarter, men før Corona var Pyt langsomt vej til at nå en nulpunktsomsætning, hvor selve driften hvilede i sig selv.  </p>
<p><strong>Så kom Corona</strong>, og desværre kan Pyt kun få dækket ca. en tredjedel af de faste omkostninger fra Corona-kompensationspuljerne. Årsagen er, at vi har haft underskud i 2019. Café Pyt åbnede i et eksisterende selskab, hvor der tidligere kun har været forlagsdrift, nemlig forlaget Fuglekøjen, som aldrig har givet eller skullet give, overskud, og det betyder, at de 4 første måneder af 2019 var der intet overskud. Dernæst har der været store opstartsomkostninger, og der er også begået fodfejl, mens vi lærte at drive café og boghandel. Summa summarum: Vi har et samlet underskud i 2019, og derfor kan vi ikke få dækket vores faste omkostninger af Corona Puljerne. </p>
<h3>HVAD SKAL PENGENE BRUGES TIL?</h3>
<p>I skrivende stund er Pyt Lukket helt ned; køleskabe og frysere er tømt og slukket for at spare på strømmen. Hvis vi når kampagnemålet skal vi derfor bruge 20.000 blot til at fylde vores lager op igen. Dernæst skal vi betale husleje og leasing bagud og forud, som vi ikke har fået dækket af Corona-kompensationsordningerne. Og så skal kassekreditten nedbringes, så vi har lidt luft at arbejde med -<strong> 200.000 kr. </strong> er altså absolut minimum for at åbne lokalerne igen.</p>
<h3>HVAD ER DET LANGSIGTEDE MÅL?</h3>
<p>Vi har hele tiden haft blikket stift rettet mod 2024, hvor metroen åbner 50 meter væk fra Café Pyt. Når Metrohegnet bliver fjernet forventer vi en massiv stigning i den gående trafik forbi Pyt - og meget lettere adgang til fx vores arrangementer. Og i 2020 er det (eller var det - lige nu er det uafklaret) meningen, at hele Borgbjergsvej skulle have et løft med nye træer, omlægning af vejen mm., som bl.a. vil give Caféen større og bedre udeserveringsplads. Sydhavnen er et kvarter i rivende udvikling, og der vil være brug for gode caféer og kultursteder.</p>

</div></div>","Café Pyt har brug for din hjælp - ellers lukker vi!
 
Café Pyt & De Uafhængige Forlags Boghandel er hårdt ramt af Corona - og desværre kan vi ikke få dækket vores faste udgifter fra kompensationspuljerne. Derfor må vi lukke, hvis ikke vi kan rejse penge på en anden måde. Vil du hjælpe?

Hvad er Café Pyt & De Uafhængige Forlags Boghandel?
Cafe Pyt er en lokal café i Sydhavnen startet af forfatter og forlægger Bjørn Themsen og hans kæreste Melanie Baumann  i 2019.
Udover økologisk kaffe, tjekkisk øl og koldt køkken huser caféen Danmarks største udvalg af udgivelser fra uafhængige skønlitterære danske kvalitetsforlag. 
Ved siden af vores daglige Café- og boghandelvirksomhed holder vi mange arrangementer.
Hver måned har vi fx haft Jazz & Tapas med P8 vært Jens Rasmussen, som har trukket folk til fra et stort opland.
Hver måned har vi haft oplæsningsaftner, forlagspræsentationer eller debataftner med forfattere og kunstnere som Morten Søndergaard, Asger Schnack og Anders Bonnesen.
Vi har også huset sammenkomster for Dansk/Svensk Forfattersammenslutning, dannet ramme om møder for de uafhængige forlags netboghandel, Mikrofest, og Poesiens Hus og andre. Café Pyt er også mange mindre forlags foretrukne sted at holde reception i forbindelse med bogudgivelser.
Under Corona-lukningen var vi de første til at lave Litterære Livestreams, og i halvanden måned havde vi en lang perlerække af forfattere inde og læse op hver dag kl. 15.

HVORFOR HAR PYT BRUG FOR PENGE?
Kort fortalt: Corona-udbruddet knækkede en i forvejen skrøbelig økonomi. Café Pyt er, og har fra begyndelsen været, en idealistisk humlebi, som ikke burde kunne flyve. Det er ikke nemt at drive kulturel virksomhed i Danmark, og det er ikke nemt at starte en lille café op i et “nyt” kvarter, men før Corona var Pyt langsomt vej til at nå en nulpunktsomsætning, hvor selve driften hvilede i sig selv.  
Så kom Corona, og desværre kan Pyt kun få dækket ca. en tredjedel af de faste omkostninger fra Corona-kompensationspuljerne. Årsagen er, at vi har haft underskud i 2019. Café Pyt åbnede i et eksisterende selskab, hvor der tidligere kun har været forlagsdrift, nemlig forlaget Fuglekøjen, som aldrig har givet eller skullet give, overskud, og det betyder, at de 4 første måneder af 2019 var der intet overskud. Dernæst har der været store opstartsomkostninger, og der er også begået fodfejl, mens vi lærte at drive café og boghandel. Summa summarum: Vi har et samlet underskud i 2019, og derfor kan vi ikke få dækket vores faste omkostninger af Corona Puljerne. 
HVAD SKAL PENGENE BRUGES TIL?
I skrivende stund er Pyt Lukket helt ned; køleskabe og frysere er tømt og slukket for at spare på strømmen. Hvis vi når kampagnemålet skal vi derfor bruge 20.000 blot til at fylde vores lager op igen. Dernæst skal vi betale husleje og leasing bagud og forud, som vi ikke har fået dækket af Corona-kompensationsordningerne. Og så skal kassekreditten nedbringes, så vi har lidt luft at arbejde med - 200.000 kr.  er altså absolut minimum for at åbne lokalerne igen.
HVAD ER DET LANGSIGTEDE MÅL?
Vi har hele tiden haft blikket stift rettet mod 2024, hvor metroen åbner 50 meter væk fra Café Pyt. Når Metrohegnet bliver fjernet forventer vi en massiv stigning i den gående trafik forbi Pyt - og meget lettere adgang til fx vores arrangementer. Og i 2020 er det (eller var det - lige nu er det uafklaret) meningen, at hele Borgbjergsvej skulle have et løft med nye træer, omlægning af vejen mm., som bl.a. vil give Caféen større og bedre udeserveringsplads. Sydhavnen er et kvarter i rivende udvikling, og der vil være brug for gode caféer og kultursteder.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Marie Sumnicht's daughter, Julia Sumnicht was an ambitious 21-year-old at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse when her lofty dreams and life would end abruptly on March 15, 2010. Julia's mysterious death during her spring break in Miami Beach, Florida, left unanswered questions and her family devastated.</p>
<p>Investigative findings would point circumstantial evidence to two suspects who were with Julia in her last hours.</p>
<p>Faced with injustice and one challenge after another, Julia's mother, Marie Sumnicht, would not be deterred in her search for resolution. A soul-searching journey would lead Marie through the depths of despair and toward a place of healing she never thought possible.</p>
<p>Marie's mission was solidified after constant disappointment and overcoming her own depression. </p>
<p>Her personal growth was a catalyst for authoring ""Beyond Broken"" and creating a guide for others like her who were lost and in need of hope.</p>
<p>And that is why she created the ""100 Day Journey to Living Beyond Broken"" journal.</p>

<h3><strong>100 Day Journey to Living Beyond Broken Mission</strong></h3>
<p>• To empower those affected by the aftermath of loss and provide a roadmap of life truths.</p>
<p>• To transform through daily journal activities that create stability and purpose despite loss.</p>
<p>• To provide additional support channels through direct coaching from Marie who has thrived beyond issues affecting the bereaved.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Marie's Message</h3>
<p>Too many of us are stuck in a life we weren't meant to live. I know because I experienced a tragedy that tried to hold me back from the breakthrough towards to a better life.</p>
<p>For over five years, I lived with the chains of despair and negativity holding me back from experiencing joy and peace. I was at the ""bottom of the bottom"", feeling like I had no place to turn.  In an unexpected turn of events, I discovered a process that ultimately gave me freedom. I invite you today to experience this same freedom with my journal.</p>
<p>I am a person of faith that had always believed things happen in life for a reason. When a crisis came along that shattered my faith, I felt like a child learning to walk or speak for the first time. I had trouble connecting the life-shattering situation with my faith. Even though I knew logically that other people had experienced such tragedies in their lives, searing pain and feelings of guilt took over every part of my being. </p>
<p>Once I started experiencing peace and hope, I wanted to share it with others. I did so first with a book called <i>Beyond Broken: Surviving and Thriving Beyond the Death of a Child. </i> </p>
<p>Even though my book is a powerful story of hope, I realized that people stuck in hopelessness needed to know the path I took to freedom and how they could experience change. With this in mind, I created a <i>100 Days to Living Beyond Broken </i>journal. </p>
<p>What I have shared has changed lives, just as my life was changed. With your donation and support or with your purchase of a journal and bonus packages, you will be helping impact 1000's of lives.</p>

Faced with injustice and one challenge after another, Julia's mother, Marie Sumnicht, would not be deterred in her search for resolution. A soul-searching journey would lead Marie through the depths of despair and toward a place of healing she never thought possible.
Marie's mission was solidified after constant disappointment and overcoming her own depression. 
Her personal growth was a catalyst for authoring ""Beyond Broken"" and creating a guide for others like her who were lost and in need of hope.
And that is why she created the ""100 Day Journey to Living Beyond Broken"" journal.

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>Stan Grozniak, director of a ’90s cult action trilogy and gay art films, almost self-sabotages a prestigious directing gig with his writer-producer ex-boyfriend, after casting his rediscovered teenage summer stock crush. His tale of cinematic success and failure captures the passion and heartache of making love, making movies, and the occasional riot.</p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Advance praise for Finding Tulsa</h3>
<p>“Everything’s coming up roses in<i> Finding Tulsa</i>, Jim Provenzano’s intoxicating portrait of an artist as young to middle-aged man, from a high school musical techie in torn shorts to a semi jaded independent gay filmmaker. It’s a well-told yarn, full of humor and panache about a Hollywood player torn between his boyhood crush and a porn star. Spin the bottle, ride the Rolodex, and fasten your seat belt for Provenzano’s sweet roller coaster ride.”</p>
<p>– <strong>Marc Huestis</strong>, film director (<i>Sex Is</i> …) and author of <i>Impresario of Castro Street: an Intimate Showbiz Memoir</i></p>
<p>“Finding Tulsa reminds you what a good friend a novel can be.  It’s about friendship, about “losing men and then finding them,” about brotherly love and conflict, and the possibility of resolution.  It’s sexy, funny, astute, panoramic – it knows about suburban Ohio basement rec rooms and glam parties in the Hollywood hills.  I felt like I had met a charming guy at a cocktail party who seemed to get me, understood my past, confided his own, and then disappeared to another better party before I was ready for him to leave.  And it’s wrapped around a fearless, wrenching narrative about facing your childhood demons, raising the question of whether or not one of the demons might have been you. There’s so much to savor, to argue with, reflect upon, learn from, enjoy.”­</p>
<p>– <strong>John Weir</strong>, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of <i>The Irreversible Decline of Eddie Socket</i></p>
<p>“Jim Provenzano must have been spying on me from my adolescence (making short films with my brother) to my adulthood (making gay movies and TV series). I identified with every twist, turn, and blow by blow of this sexy show biz saga!” </p>
<p>– <strong>Sam Irvin</strong>, Director of <i>Dante’s Cove</i>; Co-Producer of <i>Gods And Monsters</i> and <i>The Broken Hearts Club</i></p>
<p>“<i>Finding Tulsa </i>is sexy, romantic, witty, engaging, both cleverly current yet sweetly retrospective. It's Jim Provenzano's most complex and accomplished novel. He gets so much right and so evocatively about show business, from those school plays we all remember to Hollywood made-for-television movies, with delicious stops at boyhood Super-8 movies and out of town gay porn shoots.”<br/>– <strong>Felice Picano</strong>, author of <i>Justify My Sins: A Hollywood Novel in Three Acts,</i><br/>and the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Like People in History</i></p>
<p>“Jim Provenzano's sexy, funny and soulful new novel <i>Finding Tulsa</i> is a beautiful deep-end dive into the memory of desire, the thumping bass note that drives life and art. The novel gorgeously explores how our hearts and cocks are woven with our theatre and films as we figure out how to be the star of our own queer story.” <br/>– <strong>Tim Miller</strong>, Performer and author of <i>A Body in the O</i>  </p>
<p>“Lights! Camera!

</div><p> </p></div>","The story
Stan Grozniak, director of a ’90s cult action trilogy and gay art films, almost self-sabotages a prestigious directing gig with his writer-producer ex-boyfriend, after casting his rediscovered teenage summer stock crush. His tale of cinematic success and failure captures the passion and heartache of making love, making movies, and the occasional riot.

Advance praise for Finding Tulsa
“Everything’s coming up roses in Finding Tulsa, Jim Provenzano’s intoxicating portrait of an artist as young to middle-aged man, from a high school musical techie in torn shorts to a semi jaded independent gay filmmaker. It’s a well-told yarn, full of humor and panache about a Hollywood player torn between his boyhood crush and a porn star. Spin the bottle, ride the Rolodex, and fasten your seat belt for Provenzano’s sweet roller coaster ride.”
– Marc Huestis, film director (Sex Is …) and author of Impresario of Castro Street: an Intimate Showbiz Memoir
“Finding Tulsa reminds you what a good friend a novel can be.  It’s about friendship, about “losing men and then finding them,” about brotherly love and conflict, and the possibility of resolution.  It’s sexy, funny, astute, panoramic – it knows about suburban Ohio basement rec rooms and glam parties in the Hollywood hills.  I felt like I had met a charming guy at a cocktail party who seemed to get me, understood my past, confided his own, and then disappeared to another better party before I was ready for him to leave.  And it’s wrapped around a fearless, wrenching narrative about facing your childhood demons, raising the question of whether or not one of the demons might have been you. There’s so much to savor, to argue with, reflect upon, learn from, enjoy.”­
– John Weir, Lambda Literary Award-winning author of The Irreversible Decline of Eddie Socket
“Jim Provenzano must have been spying on me from my adolescence (making short films with my brother) to my adulthood (making gay movies and TV series). I identified with every twist, turn, and blow by blow of this sexy show biz saga!” 
– Sam Irvin, Director of Dante’s Cove; Co-Producer of Gods And Monsters and The Broken Hearts Club
“Finding Tulsa is sexy, romantic, witty, engaging, both cleverly current yet sweetly retrospective. It's Jim Provenzano's most complex and accomplished novel. He gets so much right and so evocatively about show business, from those school plays we all remember to Hollywood made-for-television movies, with delicious stops at boyhood Super-8 movies and out of town gay porn shoots.”– Felice Picano, author of Justify My Sins: A Hollywood Novel in Three Acts,and the New York Times best-seller Like People in History
“Jim Provenzano's sexy, funny and soulful new novel Finding Tulsa is a beautiful deep-end dive into the memory of desire, the thumping bass note that drives life and art. The novel gorgeously explores how our hearts and cocks are woven with our theatre and films as we figure out how to be the star of our own queer story.” – Tim Miller, Performer and author of A Body in the O  
“Lights! Camera! Action! Finding Tulsa is a show-biz comedy told by a witty industry insider divulging how plays and movies and characters like “Tulsa” help gay boys survive adolescence, create identity, and worship beauty. What better icons could Provenzano have picked than Sondheim and Gypsy on which to fly his vivid characters, backstage intrigues, and dialogue sure to thrill the theater and movie queen in all of us. Writing at the top of his powers, with his striped tie and hopes high, he’s got rhythm. All he needs is you to go with ’im. A splendid romp! Let him entertain you!”
– Jack Fritscher, author of Mapplethorpe: Assault with a Deadly Camera and the Lammy Finalist, Some Dance to Remember: A Memoir-Novel of San Francisco 1970-1982

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My desert story begins before I was born.  Before I was even in the womb, actually.  But in 2000, I came to live and work in the Mojave.  A tumultuous, surreal, and often dreamlike 20 years followed.</p>
<p>Desert Dreams: 20 Years in the Mojave is those two decades retold, as a photojournalist, spouse, parent, local businessman, musician, TV producer and host, and historian, through my photos and writing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm creating an 11"" x 8.5"" full color, soft cover, coffee table book, printed in the U.S.  I'm seeking funding to publish the initial print run of 100+ copies.</li>
<li>The best perk, of course, is a signed copy of the first edition of the book, but there are other ways to support this project.  My thanks go out to all who help support Desert Dreams!</li>
<li>I need to publish a minimum of 50 copies of the book.  If for some reason I don't raise the amount needed to do so within this campaign's time frame of 60 days, I will run a subsequent campaign until I do.  All supporters should receive their selected reward, but it is possible it may take longer to receive it.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There have been an increasing number of books being written about the desert.  There's a lot of philosophizing and romanticizing and using the desert as the backdrop for plots.  That's not what this particular book is about.  This is a photo chronicle of two decades of experiences shaped by, and gleaned from, the desert, from my time as a ""pornographer,"" to how the desert saved my life.  It, in many ways, is a logical conclusion to my time publishing The Sun Runner magazine, and draws from my 15 years with the magazine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Desert Dreams will be (more or less) true stories from the desert.  There will be tales of intrigue, drama, celebrities (from Huell Howser to Oliver Stone), UFOs (of course), mystery, and backstories to news you may have thought you knew.  There will be lots of photos, and lots of fun.  </li>
<li>I'll be drawing from my 40+ years as a photojournalist  - half spent in the Mojave - to bring Desert Dreams to life.</li>
<li>This is a collection of stories, history, and images you won't find anywhere else.  Ever.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Barring overwhelming natural disasters or myself catching COVID-19 from one of the desert's maskless wonders, this project should go as planned.  I do need to raise the funds necessary to publish a minimum of 50 copies within 60 days for this campaign.  However, should that not happen, I will continue to pre-sell copies until I do, and I should be able to fulfill my part of this bargain.</p>
<p>Part of the motivation for deciding to publish Desert Dreams is to provide some sort of resolution to my 15 years of running The Sun Runner magazine, and to have something to show for it (other than debt).  Another motivating factor is while other plans are delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this is a project I can create solo, from my home office, with the full support of my Mojave Sand Leopard, and the tolerance and support of my wife.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Perhaps this pandemic has knocked you head over heels, or you are facing other challenges and cannot financially support this project at this time.  There are other ways you can help make Desert Dreams come true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with folks interested in the desert, independent books, and photojournalism.</li>

<h3>Early Praise for <i>Dancing A Dizzy Holiness</i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Stuart Dybek</strong>, writer of prose and poetry, MacArthur Fellow</i></p>
<p>In Larry Janowski’s new collection, <i>Dancing A Dizzy Holiness</i>, a poem titled “Confessional Poem,” opens: “Ever wonder what it’s like on the priest’s side of the screen?” The witty title and the intimate voice that will answer this question typifies the complex, compassionate, and accessible down to earth beauty of this book. Down to earth—a stand-in phrase for wise. Down to earth in a way that is critical for Janowski’s credible reach toward the divine.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><i><strong>From the Introduction to the book written by Judith Valente</strong>, </i><i>award-winning author, poet and Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist.​</i></p>
<p>Much of contemporary poetry lurks within the shadow side of human nature, or somersaults in clever word play, or else aims to reveal as little as possible of the poet’s meaning. But poems don’t need to be “fancy,” as Mary Oliver famously said. Janowski’s poems aren’t fancy. Think of them as the kind of unpretentious work shirts you might see proud men wearing in Chicago’s Southside Polish neighborhoods, places so familiar to Janowski. That doesn’t mean these poems are facile. They each carry their own beauty.</p>
<p>I finished this collection wanting for more. More time with this prophet of the quotidian. More time with the flawed and fascinating people who populate this collection. These are poems that will make you want to dance out of gratitude. That will fill your head with a dizzy holiness. And isn’t that the best kind of holiness?</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><i><strong>Fr. Jim Gannon ofm</strong>, Provincial Minister of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Province</i></p>
<p>I was most fortunate to have attended a grade school, way back in the 1960’s, when the arts were part of the curriculum.  Friday afternoons were special!  One Friday of each month was dedicated to art, and another Friday was dedicated to poetry.  As a child, I did not fully appreciate the great gift of the arts.  Now, as an older adult, I have come to value, even more, the gift of poetry.  Poetry has helped me to understand the significance of speaking and writing. The study of poetry has also provided me with the insight to better understand people, as well as to better understand myself. Larry Janowski comes alive when he shares his poetry after years of deep, personal, hard reflections.  I love the title of Larry’s new book, <i>Dancing A Dizzy Hioliness</i>.  Please allow yourself to become “<i>Dizzy” </i>from the wide spectrum of emotions: diminishment of physical life and religious life, coming up on the “short end” of life, parents and family life, a scarred church, a tall and loving God.  Larry, you come alive in your poetry.  Keep on making us “Dizzy” with life. May we always emerge “dancing and holy.”</p>

<p>My name is Adam Jonathan Kaat and I am the author of Life on The Grocery Line: A Coronavirus Novel (title pending). I wrote this book after working as an upscale grocery store cashier during the initial months of the pandemic. In those early weeks of the global crisis, I started a blog to deal with the immense stress that I and other essential workers were dealing with. My book is a fictional summation of the stories I both heard and endured myself.</p>
<p>Through my experience, I discovered the story of Daniel, a young man in his first week as a cashier in an affluent grocery store when the pandemic hits American shores. He is thrust into a situation where his job has gone from inconsequential to “essential” nearly overnight. The store’s upper-middle class clientele that consists of ""Lindas"" and ""Daves"" are no help to calm his nerves with their pampered and myopic views of the world.

<p>After a few months of serious writing, the small sum of money ran out and I started a job as a part-time cashier at a high-end grocery store located in the wealthy area of town. I continued to work on the draft of my first novel, but in just over a month and a half of work, I was on the front lines of a pandemic. Every priority, idea of how I thought life would turn out, and my opinions about the world around me changed. Despite all the uncertainty, my desire to write and tell stories never faltered.</p>
<p>I found myself writing tales of what my coworkers and I were going through during the early pandemic on a blog that connected with essential workers and the people in their lives. We all leaned on each other and shared our trials and tribulations. I found an unexpected family of sorts.

</div></div>","My name is Adam Jonathan Kaat and I am the author of Life on The Grocery Line: A Coronavirus Novel (title pending). I wrote this book after working as an upscale grocery store cashier during the initial months of the pandemic. In those early weeks of the global crisis, I started a blog to deal with the immense stress that I and other essential workers were dealing with. My book is a fictional summation of the stories I both heard and endured myself.
Through my experience, I discovered the story of Daniel, a young man in his first week as a cashier in an affluent grocery store when the pandemic hits American shores. He is thrust into a situation where his job has gone from inconsequential to “essential” nearly overnight. The store’s upper-middle class clientele that consists of ""Lindas"" and ""Daves"" are no help to calm his nerves with their pampered and myopic views of the world. Daniel’s experience evolves from a fun and simple part time gig to one where he is forced to give sage advice to customers while being called a hero for just going to work. His optimism turns dark as he grapples with his new found roll all-the-while society crumbles around him.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>My name is Uliana and I am here to ask for your support. It was not easy for me to find courage and accept the fact that I need help - and, what is more important, this story needs help. </p>
<p>I published my first book at the age of 15, and I have always been passionate about writing. But this time, <strong>my passion does not seem to be enough</strong>. </p>
<p>I was writing Hearts of Cotton for around 4 years, on and off, of course. Today, it is the most beautiful synthesis of all the<strong> feelings</strong>, <strong>emotions</strong> and <strong>experiences</strong> I collected on my journey in the past years - amazing friendships from Lithuania, struggles of early adulthood in Germany, and breathtaking adventures from all around the world. </p>
<p>Now, this is the time for this story to see the world, and for the world to get to know the story.</p>
<p><strong>I am looking for support to publish this book</strong>: as simple as that, none of the existing publishing houses would accept a manuscript without any editing done before submission. And editing, to be frank, costs from 1500 to 5000 EUR for 200 pages manuscript, depending on thoroughness. </p>
<p>I believe that the story uncovers something that can be deeply personal for all of us in a way that is easy and relatable: our emotional responsiveness in the days of uncertainty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is what my first reader, Linja Fraenz from Germany, thought of this book:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>'The story touched me deeply - I guess it just found me at the right time. All the main characters are very different, yet so relatable! The way they grow and develop is so unexpected, but this is what truly makes them so close to us. A character that you might have disliked in the very beginning shows up as a beautiful soul by the end of the story, and someone who you thought is nice and kind to their roots demonstrates the worst of their character - but isn’t it what makes us human, after all? </i></p>
<p><i>I finished reading the story within a week— just couldn’t stop reading, wondering where the journey will take those characters. And after saving so many photos on my phone of all my favorite passages, I hope this story will find more readers from around the world, because it truly made an impact for me. Looking forward to the second part!'</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To kick off the publishing process, I need professional help in editing the book. </p>
<p>I am already searching for an editor with whom we could be on the same page about how to edit the story in a way that will not harm my own voice and narrative, but only strengthen the messages I want to share. </p>
<p>The costs of such editing services vary from <strong>1500 EUR to 5000EUR+</strong>, depending on the size of the manuscript and the effort required. As English is not my native language, I believe that the required effort will be rather big :) </p>
<p>In case if you support me and Heart of Cotton, I will gladly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Thank you</strong> <strong>over the social media</strong> for any donations - be prepared, and let me know if you would not like that :)</li>
<li>For donations more than 20 EUR I will send a <strong>postcard</strong> designed by me with a random quote from the book - they are really nice, I must say</li>
<li>For donations more than 50 EUR I will be happy to send you the <strong>book</strong> once it is edited - in a digital format, or as a printout (and of course as a paperback whenever it is published)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once this story gets a touch of a professional editor, it gets wings: it can be published on Amazon Publishing, it can participate in the international writing competitions and it can be submitted to various publishing houses in the US.</p>
<p>But what is even more important, it gets a chance to impact lives of people all around the world, supporting them in the challenging times, bringing hope and helping them to reinvent themselves, no matter in which period of their life they stumble upon this story. </p>
<p>I truly believe that this book can make the world a little bit better, in its own way. </p>
<p>And you never know - maybe your support today will turn this story into your favourite Netflix show in a couple of years :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Editing is a long process, and so is publishing. Even with your immense support it can take years until Hearts of Cotton get to the bookshelves of the stores in your city (as well as in mine), so we need to stay patient together. </p>
<p>However, every donation is a little step forward, and I am positive that this story is worth to be shared with the whole world, when it is the right time.</p>
<p>In case if I do not collect the full amount needed for hiring professional editor, I won't leave this cause and most likely will invest in it anyway. But I sincerely believe in that old African saying:<i> if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. </i></p>

<p><br/><br/><strong><i>""JACLYN CREATIONS GLUTEN-FREE SAVORY &amp; SWEET VEGAN RECIPES""</i></strong></p>
<p>Each creation was simply inspired by healthy plant-based meals that are naturally gluten-free, wholesome, with a hearty essence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Built from scratch - Each one of my creations is built from scratch, simple to make, and easy on digestion. Because I used healing foods to correct my gut health, I wanted to share my creations to help others restore and repair their bodies as well.<br/> </li>
<li>Plant proteins are in all of my dishes - I found a significant way to include healthy sources of protein, which are 100% from plants. Throughout my healing journey, I have discovered which food combinations provide the proper nutrients and macronutrient ratios that the body needs for a healthy and holistic wellness lifestyle.<br/> </li>
<li>No artificial sweeteners or fillers - Not only do my creations offer health benefits to the body, but they also taste delectable! Also, I have strategically removed sugar from my creations, only to replace it with natural plant-based vegan sweeteners when a recipe calls for it.

<h3><strong>PRODUCTION IN PROGRESS</strong></h3>
<p>About a year ago was the infancy of the production phases, of publishing hard copies of my 1st edition recipe book. Fast forward to June of 2021, a hallmark and 1 year anniversary of my 1st edition recipe ebook, and my 2nd edition ebook launch date.<br/><br/>After doing research, I realize how much it costs to convert a single book into a print book. I noticed that many publishers offer bulk runs, of around 50 units in volume at a minimum. This would also be considered a bundle of products, which would give a significant discount when trying the keep print costs down. <br/><br/>In the meantime, I am looking for ways to reduce the costs associated with editing, publishing, and printing.  One of my primary goals in this campaign to able to come up with the costs associated with the printing in high volume, manufacturing, and helping me with cost analysis of the future print book sales. For now, I have been generating all of my book sales locally from Portland and around the world virtually.  <br/><br/>On this very occasion, was when I  became self-published in many electronic publications. The many electronic publications that I am currently using are Amazon, Kindle, B&amp;N Press, Google Play, and also carrying copies on my website. Using many of these electronic platforms has resulted in a wonderful avenue to gain as much exposure as possible, through a lens worldwide, and the results are booming, as I continue to make book sales across seas. <br/><br/>Last year's printing decisions were heavily impressed upon because of the pandemic, and production phases were put on a halt. However, one day soon, I know I will be able to share my personalized recipes to help others explore the creations I have made and truly bring them to life.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>FUNDING &amp; NEXT STEPS</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/>With my funding, this will expedite the next production phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Printing costs - $1500</strong>  <br/>Printed 1st and 2nd edition recipe books (prints of each version, in English, binding in perfect bound, softcover, color ink, 80 lb - white paper, 12 pt white - Glossy covers, set up fees, etc.)<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Gain more exposure</strong><ul>
<li>In-person sales opportunity</li>
<li>Wholesale or vending opportunities</li>
<li>When hard copies of both of my recipe books make it to print, I plan on housing several copies at local coffee shops in the Portland neighborhood!</li>
<li>Hosting a professional tabled book signing, where my local community can have the chance to pick up hard copies of both of my books and meet with me.</li>
</ul>

2ND EDITION RELEASE 
""JACLYN CREATIONS GLUTEN-FREE SAVORY & SWEET VEGAN RECIPES""
Each creation was simply inspired by healthy plant-based meals that are naturally gluten-free, wholesome, with a hearty essence.

Built from scratch - Each one of my creations is built from scratch, simple to make, and easy on digestion. Because I used healing foods to correct my gut health, I wanted to share my creations to help others restore and repair their bodies as well. 
Plant proteins are in all of my dishes - I found a significant way to include healthy sources of protein, which are 100% from plants. Throughout my healing journey, I have discovered which food combinations provide the proper nutrients and macronutrient ratios that the body needs for a healthy and holistic wellness lifestyle. 
No artificial sweeteners or fillers - Not only do my creations offer health benefits to the body, but they also taste delectable! Also, I have strategically removed sugar from my creations, only to replace it with natural plant-based vegan sweeteners when a recipe calls for it. Otherwise, no additives or crazy fillers are found inside of my dishes.


WHAT'S INSIDE THIS BOOK?

​

PRODUCTION IN PROGRESS
About a year ago was the infancy of the production phases, of publishing hard copies of my 1st edition recipe book. Fast forward to June of 2021, a hallmark and 1 year anniversary of my 1st edition recipe ebook, and my 2nd edition ebook launch date.After doing research, I realize how much it costs to convert a single book into a print book. I noticed that many publishers offer bulk runs, of around 50 units in volume at a minimum. This would also be considered a bundle of products, which would give a significant discount when trying the keep print costs down. In the meantime, I am looking for ways to reduce the costs associated with editing, publishing, and printing.  One of my primary goals in this campaign to able to come up with the costs associated with the printing in high volume, manufacturing, and helping me with cost analysis of the future print book sales. For now, I have been generating all of my book sales locally from Portland and around the world virtually.  On this very occasion, was when I  became self-published in many electronic publications. The many electronic publications that I am currently using are Amazon, Kindle, B&N Press, Google Play, and also carrying copies on my website. Using many of these electronic platforms has resulted in a wonderful avenue to gain as much exposure as possible, through a lens worldwide, and the results are booming, as I continue to make book sales across seas. Last year's printing decisions were heavily impressed upon because of the pandemic, and production phases were put on a halt. However, one day soon, I know I will be able to share my personalized recipes to help others explore the creations I have made and truly bring them to life.

FUNDING & NEXT STEPS

With my funding, this will expedite the next production phases:


Printing costs - $1500  Printed 1st and 2nd edition recipe books (prints of each version, in English, binding in perfect bound, softcover, color ink, 80 lb - white paper, 12 pt white - Glossy covers, set up fees, etc.) 

Gain more exposure
In-person sales opportunity
Wholesale or vending opportunities
When hard copies of both of my recipe books make it to print, I plan on housing several copies at local coffee shops in the Portland neighborhood!
Hosting a professional tabled book signing, where my local community can have the chance to pick up hard copies of both of my books and meet with me.

<p>Hi, I'm Janis, and I've published 3 award-winning books and more than 50 articles and essays. I created Creative Caffeine Daily to help motivate, inspire, and connect an unlimited number of writers at all stages of their careers, in all corners of the globe, and from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Creative Caffeine Daily is based on 3 core writing principles I absolutely believe in--and practice myself.</p>
<p>1) The more you write, the better you write.</p>
<p>2) There's a creative alchemy that comes from free writing first thing in the morning--close to the dream state.</p>
<p>3) Writers thrive in community--when they have other writers to read and comment on their work.</p>
<p>For three years, I ran Creative Caffeine as a manual subscription service. And it was an amazing resource for writers! Creative Caffeine members finished novels and essays--and they got published. More importantly, they wrote. Because writing every day--even if it's only for 10 minutes every morning--helps you develop a really strong writing practice.</p>
<p>But because I ran Creative Caffeine manually, I had to limit the number of writers who could take advantage of it. </p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to create an online version of Creative Caffeine. Creative Caffeine Daily will be an automated platform that brings all the benefits of the manual version--the daily writing prompt (delivered fresh each morning!), the weekly writing partner, and the online magazine--to an unlimited number of writers, at all stages in their careers, in all locations. It will give writers what they need most. Community. Inspiration. Motivation. Feedback. And the pleasure of seeing their work out in the world. All for less than the cost of a daily latté.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>The bulk of the money raised will be used to create the Creative Caffeine Daily online platform. This will be a responsive website on which our members will write (we'll be building our own visually compelling, easy-to-use word processor), review their work, and the work of their partners. In addition, each member will maintain his or her own dashboard and avatar on the site. We will also be creating a beautiful online magazine to showcase our members' work.</p>
<p>The three key features we will be building first are:</p>
<p>1) The daily writing prompt</p>
<p>2) The assignment of a weekly writing partner</p>
<p>3) The online magazine</p>
<p>We will also be building in a rating system--one to five coffee cups--so partners can rate each other on quality of feedback and reliability. As we move forward, partners with similar ratings will be matched.</p>
<p>Additional funds will be used for server storage for the online magazine, as well as for all the writing created by our members.</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes at least $100 will be given a 4-week membership at launch and become a founding member of the Creative Caffeine Daily community. The site will identify founding members, each of whom will be eligible for discounts in the Creative Caffeine Daily store and editing suite. Memberships are transferable at launch, so you can give one to a deserving writer who may be unable to contribute to this fundraiser.</p>
<p>We require a minimum of $30,000 to build a basic version of Creative Caffeine Daily. It's our hope we will raise more so we can begin building additional useful features for writers--the editing suite, a mechanism for our members to interact outside of the Creative Caffeine environment, a newsletter with writing advice, and an interface to connect our members with industry professionals such as agents and editors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There exist dozens of apps that will send writers daily prompts. What makes Creative Caffeine Daily unique is the weekly partner piece of the equation. Feedback, and the knowledge that someone is waiting to read your work, is a huge motivator. Writing is, at its heart, solitary work. Yet to thrive, to be inspired--to feel as if they are not so alone in the creative world--writers need readers. Every step of the way, Creative Caffeine Daily will fill that need.</p>

<p>Creative Caffeine Daily will also be giving back. Once we launch, 10% of all profits will be donated to Dave Eggers' <a href=""https://scholarmatch.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ScholarMatch</a>.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While you might not personally be able to help, you may know someone--or many people who can. Please share our story (and the link to this campaign). Your friends and family don't need to be writers. They only need to care about books and reading--and who doesn't care about that?</p>

This book uses the alphabets, rhyming sentences, and colorful illustrations to introduce readers to the rhythm of life in the Giant of Africa. Your child might know what a bus or a train is, but do they know what a Keke is? They might know about winter, spring, summer, and fall, but have they ever heard about Harmattan? Do they know about the Super Eagles? From A is for Agbada to Z is for Zuma, this book will broaden your child’s imagination and knowledge in a fun and exciting way. They will be introduced to Nigeria’s diverse people, places, and traditions, while reinforcing early learning concepts like the alphabets, counting, and rhyming. The colorful and vibrant illustrations will make this a book that your child will return to over and over again!  As an added resource, we included a detailed ""Did You Know"" section at the back of the book with a pronunciation guide and fun facts for each alphabet that will surely delight you and your child as you read this book. The process of exploring and learning together will give your family memories that will last through the years. This book was designed with durability and quality in mind. Our illustrations are colorful and child friendly, and the hard cover design will ensure that the book withstands wear and tear from toddler hands and frequent reading.    This book is important for children who need to learn about their cultural heritage. As parents with young children who live outside our home country of Nigeria, instilling a love for Nigerian heritage and culture in our children is so important to us. Pride and knowledge of one’s history and background are key to giving our kids the gift of confidence and self-esteem; gifts that will build their resilience as they navigate the world around them.  Additionally, this book is important for all children because it is essential to expose them to a variety of cultures and people from an early age, and to teach them the importance of respect, knowledge, and appreciation of cultures other than their own. Lastly, this book is a key addition to the collection of books written by Africans about Africa. Stories about Africa are full of life lessons that children can apply in their lives, and children’s books about Africa by Africans provide an opportunity to add more depth and variety to the information and perceptions of Africa that exist in our children’s books and influence their young minds.    Self-publishing has been such a time consuming and expensive project! Phew! We have invested over $12,000 of our own funds to pay for illustration, buy ISBNs, file for copyrights, editing, website design, and other behind the scenes, but very important tasks required to make this book a reality. As mothers with very young children, we know that books can go from mint condition to ripped-to-shreds in the twinkle of an eye, and that is why we are printing hardcover books. Funds raised from this campaign will be primarily used to fund our first print run of books in China, and to ship them to the U.S.  We are Ufuoma & Udhedhe, two sisters who were born and raised in Nigeria but found ourselves raising our young children away from home.

<p>is a project that will
tell magical stories that remind us the sense of live and </p>
<p>dreams. You will probably feel
identify, because we all go through difficult </p>
<p>situations in our lives, but are the
decisions or some situations that sometimes </p>
<p>looks like miracles that take us out of
that empty place that we could be going </p>
<p>through.</p>
<p><b>WHY TO DO A TRANSMEDIA
PROJECT? </b>: To start, transmedia: is the technic of </p>
<p>telling the universe of a story using
multiple digital or traditional platforms. The </p>
<p>central message is complemented or is
extended through the different platforms  </p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441900870/ct2k4lhy5ujcib0lozkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p> for more information about the transmedia narratives you can visit our </p>
<p>web page <a href=""transmedia.shaktistore.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">transmedia.shaktistore.com</a>, there you can find the investigation that I did about the topic.</p>

<p> the initial idea of Crisálida (chrysalis) was to create a short film. At the end </p>
<p>of the writing of the script, I visualize more stories and I found different anecdotes </p>
<p>of people who have overcome sicknesses, disappointments, love, frustrations </p>
<p>etc… and I want to expand the universe of the story to visualize and know more </p>
<p>tales. That´s how the idea of taking the short film into a transmedia project was </p>
<p>born. </p>
<p>In this order of ideas, the central story would be tell through a short film of 12 </p>
<p>minutes, filmed in the Caribbean Colombian coast. That we will send to festivals, </p>
<p>and disseminate in different media.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442366710/hb204kgggloqcj3wtg3g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> the great connector with people would be the WEB PAGE. There you </p>
<p>would fine the sub stories, told through documentaries, reports and videos that </p>
<p>people can upload to the web page, telling us the stories and anecdotes of their </p>
<p>lives. All of this with the purpose of generate HOPE in those who feel alone o sad.</p>

<p>in addition we will create an DIARY, which will have the characters </p>

<p>with this campaign we want to get the initial part of the project, to officially </p>

<p>With this 20% we will develop:</p>

<p> Print of 200 agendas</p>

DESCRIPTION TEXT:



Crisálida (chrysalis) is a transmedia project, that born from the following American  Indian legend. 





                                                               

is a project that will
tell magical stories that remind us the sense of live and 
dreams. You will probably feel
identify, because we all go through difficult 
situations in our lives, but are the
decisions or some situations that sometimes 
looks like miracles that take us out of
that empty place that we could be going 
through.
WHY TO DO A TRANSMEDIA
PROJECT? : To start, transmedia: is the technic of 
telling the universe of a story using
multiple digital or traditional platforms. The 
central message is complemented or is
extended through the different platforms  

                                                               
 for more information about the transmedia narratives you can visit our 
web page transmedia.shaktistore.com, there you can find the investigation that I did about the topic.
                                                            
 the initial idea of Crisálida (chrysalis) was to create a short film. At the end 
of the writing of the script, I visualize more stories and I found different anecdotes 
of people who have overcome sicknesses, disappointments, love, frustrations 
etc… and I want to expand the universe of the story to visualize and know more 
tales. That´s how the idea of taking the short film into a transmedia project was 
born. 
In this order of ideas, the central story would be tell through a short film of 12 
minutes, filmed in the Caribbean Colombian coast. That we will send to festivals, 
and disseminate in different media.

                                                      
 the great connector with people would be the WEB PAGE. There you 
would fine the sub stories, told through documentaries, reports and videos that 
people can upload to the web page, telling us the stories and anecdotes of their 
lives. All of this with the purpose of generate HOPE in those who feel alone o sad.
                                                     
in addition we will create an DIARY, which will have the characters 
tales, you can write the diary activities, translate thoughts, personal ideas 
accompanied of reflexive phrases and tips to be happy.
DATA SHEET OF THE DIARY

Size: 15x15 cm
Hard cover
You can use it any day and any yearStickers page
We also will create the “Resilient kit”  that will have: tips, phrases, challenges; 
capture in images and videos to recover the sense of live and realize that we are 
not alone.
                                                             
with this campaign we want to get the initial part of the project, to officially 
start; we look to gather the 20% of the total project.
With this 20% we will develop:
 Design, creation and layout of one agenda that will have the tales of the 
characters and would be accompanied by reflexives phrases.
 Print of 200 agendas
 Design of the web page
 to find and manage the short film locations (scouting)
 We will make the casting to find the characters of the short film
 Teaser of the short film
 Ending of the stage of pre-production of the short film
 Scenery props for the short
 Release of the diary
 Creation of the “Resilient kit”
                                                         
 our principal objective is to make and complete the project, and in 
2016, Crisálida (chrysalis) tour the world liven up hearts, changing thoughts, 
generating conscience that live is short and it must be lived achieving dreams.
We hope that you join this transmedia metamorphosis and that together we 
perform this dream.

<p>This is Takara's Legacy: Angela's Hope </p>
<p>  The
young woman Setsuko can't wait to be free. Free from tradition, free to follow her
dreams, but most of all, freedom from her father. Her father's status affords
her a life that many could only dream of, 
but this life comes with certain expectations that force her down a path
she does not want to go. Dreaming of something more, she chooses to do things
her way. Little does she realize how her rash behaviour will forever change her
life, and those around her. </p>
<p>  Jonathan
and Angela meet one another for the first time during a class at the local
university. Enamored by the young student, Jonathan, a teachers aid, falls in
love and marries her. The two of them enjoy their first year together as
husband and wife, but are caught un-prepared for the trials ahead. After losing
his job, Jonathan seeks employment elsewhere. Angela is forced to give up on
her dream of becoming a doctor because of finances and decides to follow her
husband overseas so he can pursue his own career. This is an exciting time for
Jonathan, but a struggle for Angela, as she tries to adjust to a new culture
and a life, far from home. </p>
<p>  Journey
with us and find how God is faithful through the anguished prayers of a barren
women, the fervent prayers of a mother and the sweet birth of little Takara.</p>
<p>   I started this first book about two years
back, inspired by a show I had watched with my brother in law. This show
touched on a subject that struck a chord with me and was the catalyst for this
series. Taking parts of my own life, I began to create an outline for these
books that reflected many of my life's struggles, joys, and experiences. </p>
<p>  From
my own struggles with faith, to the tragedy of losing our unborn child. These
things both good and bad helped to shape me into the man I am today. There are
even stories that stem from family members, such as my own parents and my
beloved wife.  In one way or another, I
have included many of these in my writing, making this series of books very important
to me. </p>
<p>  Most
importantly, I show how God changes the lives of these characters, just as he
has changed mine. Through people like my wife, He was able to soften my heart
and bring me back to him and give us the strength to endure the loss of our
first child and our ever present fertility problems. </p>
<p>  Please
join me, as we journey through the life of Takara and her family, through the
pain of loss, to their victory through Christ.  </p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Meet the EuroBRICS Young Leaders</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After the tremendous success of our first
meeting last year in Helsinki, Finland, we — the Euro-BRICS’ Young Leaders —
are proud to announce the second EuroBRICS Young Leader’s Summit in New Delhi,
India, in March 2016! </p>
<p>2016 will be the year of Sustainability. If
today’s world leaders fail to implement the promises of the Sustainable
Development Goals and Climate negotiations of late 2015, it will be our
generation who pays the price for their shortcomings. Therefore we will come
together in New Delhi to discuss the prospects of a sustainable way to live in
the newly arising multipolar world, which the EuroBRICS initiative
incorporates. </p>
<p>We are not just
another Youth Conference. Our aim is to bring together the brightest and most
promising young leaders from four continents and stay independent, so we can
discuss what matters to us, instead of copying the agenda of donors, as it
happens all too often. But it doesn't stop here. We firmly believe that ones
ability to shape the future should be determined by knowledge and passion, not
by the size of one’s wallet. Therefore we want to enable every young change
maker to come together and discuss our issues, no matter his or her financial
background. This is the only right thing to do, but it also an expensive prospect.
</p>
<p>With your support we
will be able to cover the airfares of at least 50% of our delegates to come all
the way from Europe and the BRICS to New Delhi. We want to build on the
momentum created by our first summit and hold a gathering unlike any other, where
we can deepen our transnational friendships and work on the intercultural
understanding that is so important for our future. </p>
<p>Let's make this happen
together, let's occupy the future! :)</p>

</div><div> <p>To be able to cover the airfares of half of our delegates and convene to what is most likely the only inclusive youth event there is on this scale, we need to raise another 15.450€ in addition to what we already have. </p>
<p>We got our venue, the food and local transport already sorted for our entire delegation. On top, we even already have contributions summing up to more than 10.000€. The 15.450€ we want to raise with this campaign are going to be used for the biggest cost factor: the airfares to bring people from more than 20 countries and 4 continents all the way down to India's capital New Delhi. Our ambitious aim is to cover at least 50% of our delegations, so nobody gets excluded. </p>
<p>But every little helps! The more money we raise the more delegates we can fly in at not costs for our delegates, who might - as most students and young professionals - be short on cash. In our opinion that is an exclusion criteria on already to many youth events. You can help us to overcome this and enable us to shape the future we want, you can literally fund the change you want to see in the world! Once we reached our goal, the next aim is 30.000€, which would mean we can allow every single one of our 100  delegates to attend our summit for free. </p>
<p>You can even be part of this change!</p>
<p>For supporting our ambitious endeavour, we prepared a lot of interesting perks for you. You will get a live newsfeed from the delegate of your choice and you can even adopt individual leaders or entire delegations, so you don't only know exactly what your money is used for, but get first hand informations in your language from your delegate or delegation.

You have the chance to actually meet us and the high-profile guest we invited in person next year in Delhi!</p>
<p>If we wouldn't manage to raise the entire amount we need, your money is not wasted. We already got enough money to make this summit happen and cover a very limited number of airfares. With every Euro you spend, however, we will be able to cover more airfares, every Euro you spend makes our summit fairer, more inclusive, and hence more like the future we are working on.</p>

Now its a question of how many books we get to Paris!<br/><br/>Note: For Finnish-speakers, you can also get the book in Finnish:<br/><b>Suomea</b> paremmin lukevat voivat pyytää kirjan suomenkielisen version (paperiversioita rajattu määrä, sähköisiä rajaton). Lähetä osallistuttuasi sähköpostia: climategamble@gmail.com ja kerro toiveesi.</p><p><b>What is this Climate Gamble about?</b></p>
<p>We are two independent authors and researchers on energy and climate change
from Finland. We have been following and participating in the debate on
mitigating climate change for years. What we have found out has been alarming.
The utter failure of humankind to respond to the growing emergency of
decarbonizing our energy systems has been striking. And it does not end there.
Many people still seem to think that we should not use all of the tools available to mitigate climate change. This
simply does not make any sense.</p>
<p>So we wrote a book about it. It’s called “<i>Climate Gamble – Is Anti-Nuclear Activism Endangering Our Future?</i>” </p>
<p>In the book, we go through the climate realities and present all the main arguments
against and for nuclear, in a hundred pages or so. We do it in an easy to read
manner, applying logic, latest research and evidence based data. The book has
already been published in Finnish (March 2015), and it also became available in
English, from Amazon worldwide (August 2015). </p>
<p><b>Then we had a great idea</b>. At least we think it’s great. Why not have a
non-profit campaign to supply as many books as possible to the climate
negotiations held in Paris this December? The sad thing is, many
of the negotiators get their information on climate change mitigation
and nuclear power mainly from the prevailing environmental organizations. Many of
the negotiators even have a background there. This information is – as we found
out when we did background research for our book – horribly biased, based
largely on fallacious argumentation and cherry-picked, even falsified, evidence.
It’s no wonder that the negotiations have all but ignored what is – based on
real world evidence – one of our most effective ways to decarbonize energy
production: nuclear power. </p>
<p>We will try to get hundreds, and with your active help and contribution,
thousands of books printed and delivered to Paris. We will go there and
distribute them to the thousands of negotiators and tens of thousands of other
participants. Some of them will read it, others will have a glance at it, and
some may just check out the key takeaways of each chapter which we will be
inserting to this edition. The book will give them an
evidence-based view on how we can overcome what is probably our biggest
challenge so far. We are in it – for our own part – to save the world. And we
need your help.</p>
<p><b>Help us to help the climate!</b></p>
<p>Our
goal is to give at least 500 and preferably 10,000 books to the delegates and
negotiators at the COP21 climate summit. For this we need to raise 5,000 to 50,000
euros. Most of that will go to printing the books. Smaller portion will go to
expenses in getting us to Paris to distribute the books (the amount of people
going is dependent on the amount we raise). We will also plan to use 5 – 10
percent of the budget to market the campaign, both to raise more money as to
raise more interest to the climate negotiations in Paris in general and nuclear
energy as an evidence-based mitigation tool in particular. </p>
<p>We
do have families to feed, and planning and running the campaign – let alone
writing and self-publishing the book – has not been without expenses and lost
income. If the campaign goes well, us, the authors, earn for our troubles a
commission that is at most 50 cents per book per author (1 euro in total). This
is the maximum, and we will be the last ones to get paid. </p>
<p>With
this included, and depending on the final level of funding we get, the total
price, including taxes and such, per book delivered to Paris is estimated to be between 5 and 10 euros.
The more funding we get, the lower the price will be per book: fixed costs will
be about the same, irrespective of the size of the print run.</p>
<p>We
are based in Finland, and the law on accepting donations here is a bit tricky.
In practice, we have to sell something in order to accept money. That’s why we
are offering you, our dear prospective funder, something concrete for your
money. You can get anything from a pdf version of the book, to a paperback
signed by the authors to having
your name on our website or even the book itself as a key supporter. If you have or work in an organization
(or if you have a bit more money) you can also get a full box of the books to do as you like
with. It’s a great Christmas present for family, friends and the businesses
that your organization works with! Imagine: “This present is a part of a
campaign that is trying to save the world.” </p>
<p>As
the top-level perk, you get one (or even both) of us to give a presentation on
the subject in a forum and location of your choosing. Of course there will be
traveling expenses added, but otherwise than that, this will be something we
are prepared to do on our own time to support the campaign, without pay. Both
of us are experienced and entertaining presenters who are not afraid to say
things like they are. </p><p>If Paypal is not a good way for you or your organization to pay, please contact us directly at climategamble@gmail.com. Other ways to fund the campaign are also possible, and we will try to get funding everywhere we can. It will all be added up when the campaign ends.</p>
<p>We
have divided the goals between 5,000 and 50,000 euros, and 500 and 10,000 books,
respectively (these are rough estimates). We are confident that we will reach
the lowest level, and anything above that, whether it meets the next level or
not, will be used for getting more books to Paris and raising awareness on the
message. If we don’t get to the lowest level, we will try to find ways to get
at least some books to Paris with the money we have raised.</p><ul>
</ul>
<p><b>What we plan to achieve</b></p>
<p>We
already have some great people on board and supporting the campaign in their
own various ways. These include:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><a href=""http://energyforhumanity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Energy for Humanity</a>, an
environmental NGO</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><a href=""http://ekomodernismi.fi/in-english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ecomodernist Society of Finland</a>, an environmental NGO</p><p></p><p>-  Tom Blees, the author of the excellent book Prescription for the
Planet (<a href=""http://www.thesciencecouncil.com/pdfs/P4TP4U.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link to free pdf</a>) and the President of the <a href=""http://www.thesciencecouncil.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Science Council for
Global Initiatives</a>.</p><p>If you'd like to support us and see your organization or name listed here, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:climategamble@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">climategamble@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>With
help from you andother supporters, we believe that we can spread
information on this campaign and the message of the book far and wide. Like our
good friend, now the executive director of the Finnish chapter of World Energy Council, said:
“I think that amongst all the different campaigns and initiatives going to
Paris this December, this is one of those that might actually have some impact”.</p>
<p>The
facts are clear: without nuclear power we <b>simply do not have a fighting chance
at stopping</b> climate change in time. This is the message coming from
basically every major institution, including IPCC, IEA and others. Stopping
climate change will be extremely hard even with nuclear power. Yet there are
people who openly oppose nuclear power and campaign that its use as a
decarbonization tool should not be allowed. They are even campaigning in
Paris. To support their cases, they have flashy and catchy slogans, and use
rhetorical tricks that would make any climate denial veteran proud. Some of the
arguments seem legit, and some are even true, at least from a very narrow point
of view in a world where no comparisons or cost/benefit analysis need to be
made. </p>
<p>The
thing is, there is nothing new. Every argument used has been discussed in
Climate Gamble and in various other works. Yet they pop up again and again, going in endless circles not unlike the ""discussion"" about climate change and humanity's role in it does, just to ""keep the debate alive"" and the public unsure about the science and evidence. </p><p><b>There is no rational base</b> to claim
that mitigating climate change – which is, and should be, the ultimate goal –
will be easier, faster and cheaper if we limit our tools and options
arbitrarily. Logic and numerous scientific studies support the inclusion of
nuclear power. Many of those studies are referred in our book. We, as environmentalists, have accepted
the scientific consensus on climate change. Now we have to accept the
scientific consensus that nuclear needs to be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>We
have run some similar, if an order of magnitude smaller, campaigns. We
crowdfunded 300 free books (the Finnish version of Climate Gamble) to be
distributed in a big Energy Debate last spring, which was held as a part of our
parliamentary elections. The debate was organized by the big environmental
organizations in Finland. Incidentally, they were not that happy to see us
there. They did not permit us to distribute the books inside the event, and
even moved us and the books farther from the entrance to the building. </p><p>When the 200 members of
the parliament were elected, we crowdfunded another campaign that got a copy of
our book delivered to each of them. In June, we managed to get funding to get
250 copies of our book, along with us authors, to Paris as part of ENYGF 2015 (European Nuclear Young Generation Forum).
There, we distributed the books to the participants and gave a presentation,
telling the participants of this upcoming campaign we have now launched. We
have also managed to get funding for smaller patches of the book to be
delivered to various audiences from young political activists to employees and managers in
the energy industries. </p>
<p><b>And now, we aim for COP21 in
Paris. </b></p>
<p>This
campaign will come to an end near the end of November. That gives us a good
month to print the necessary amount of books and send them to Paris.</p><ul>
</ul>
<p><b>What are the
biggest risks &amp; challenges?</b></p>
<p>Obviously, if the campaign
falls flat then it falls flat. As a result, ignorance about the importance of
nuclear power might become even more widespread, as anti-nuclear activists with
their signs and chants will definitely be in Paris. We are not saying that this
project will save the world. It is just a small piece in a big puzzle. However, we are confident that we can have at least some impact. And we need to
try. If enough people and enough good pieces get put together, things start changing. </p>
<p>How we will get and store
the books in Paris, to be distributed? We know some people there, and we will
map out their willingness to take the boxes as they arrive. Some have already agreed. We will also go
there ourselves, with hopefully a few assistants in tow, to distribute them. We
also know people from other like-minded campaigns and organizations, one being
Nuclear for Climate and another being Energy for Humanity, that we will likely co-operate with.</p><ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Getting excited? Here are some other ways to help</b></p>
<p>If you don’t have the means to
participate directly, but want to help us – or if you want to help us in
addition to getting one of the perks available – here are some things you can
do. These are important stuff.</p>
<p><b>1.<span>  </span>Spread the word</b></p>
<p>Obviously, our campaign can
succeed only if people know about it. Every tweet with a quote and a link,
Facebook posting or recommendation at the coffee table helps. Any one of them
could be the step that helps this campaign to break through to a wider audience
still. Indiegogo has some wonderful sharing tools as well. Use them. </p>
<p><b>2.<span>  </span>Write a review of the book /
campaign</b></p>
<p>Do you have a blog? Do you have an Amazon account? <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Have you
written something to a local paper? Are you an actual journalist with thousands,
or millions, of readers? We would certainly
appreciate any reviews, be they for a personal blog, Amazon’s page of our book,
or a paper.

<p>If you are a local or a global
person of interest (a journalist, a climate/energy researcher, a celebrity, a
famous activist or a mover/shaker in the energy or climate mitigation
business), we would love to add your name to the list of people who are supporting
this campaign. </p>
<p><b>4.<span>  </span>Give us good ideas</b></p>
<p>If you get a great idea that
we could do, please, please let us know. We spend most of our time “inside the
Box”, and we realise that. Any ideas that come “outside the Box” are greatly
appreciated. Let us know at <a href=""mailto:climategamble@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">climategamble@gmail.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>5.<span>  </span>Help us realise those ideas</b></p>

Now its a question of how many books we get to Paris!Note: For Finnish-speakers, you can also get the book in Finnish:Suomea paremmin lukevat voivat pyytää kirjan suomenkielisen version (paperiversioita rajattu määrä, sähköisiä rajaton). Lähetä osallistuttuasi sähköpostia: climategamble@gmail.com ja kerro toiveesi.What is this Climate Gamble about?
We are two independent authors and researchers on energy and climate change
from Finland. We have been following and participating in the debate on
mitigating climate change for years. What we have found out has been alarming.
The utter failure of humankind to respond to the growing emergency of
decarbonizing our energy systems has been striking. And it does not end there.
Many people still seem to think that we should not use all of the tools available to mitigate climate change. This
simply does not make any sense.
So we wrote a book about it. It’s called “Climate Gamble – Is Anti-Nuclear Activism Endangering Our Future?” 
In the book, we go through the climate realities and present all the main arguments
against and for nuclear, in a hundred pages or so. We do it in an easy to read
manner, applying logic, latest research and evidence based data. The book has
already been published in Finnish (March 2015), and it also became available in
English, from Amazon worldwide (August 2015). 
Then we had a great idea. At least we think it’s great. Why not have a
non-profit campaign to supply as many books as possible to the climate
negotiations held in Paris this December? The sad thing is, many
of the negotiators get their information on climate change mitigation
and nuclear power mainly from the prevailing environmental organizations. Many of
the negotiators even have a background there. This information is – as we found
out when we did background research for our book – horribly biased, based
largely on fallacious argumentation and cherry-picked, even falsified, evidence.
It’s no wonder that the negotiations have all but ignored what is – based on
real world evidence – one of our most effective ways to decarbonize energy
production: nuclear power. 
We will try to get hundreds, and with your active help and contribution,
thousands of books printed and delivered to Paris. We will go there and
distribute them to the thousands of negotiators and tens of thousands of other
participants. Some of them will read it, others will have a glance at it, and
some may just check out the key takeaways of each chapter which we will be
inserting to this edition. The book will give them an
evidence-based view on how we can overcome what is probably our biggest
challenge so far. We are in it – for our own part – to save the world. And we
need your help.
Help us to help the climate!
Our
goal is to give at least 500 and preferably 10,000 books to the delegates and
negotiators at the COP21 climate summit. For this we need to raise 5,000 to 50,000
euros. Most of that will go to printing the books. Smaller portion will go to
expenses in getting us to Paris to distribute the books (the amount of people
going is dependent on the amount we raise). We will also plan to use 5 – 10
percent of the budget to market the campaign, both to raise more money as to
raise more interest to the climate negotiations in Paris in general and nuclear
energy as an evidence-based mitigation tool in particular. 
We
do have families to feed, and planning and running the campaign – let alone
writing and self-publishing the book – has not been without expenses and lost
income. If the campaign goes well, us, the authors, earn for our troubles a
commission that is at most 50 cents per book per author (1 euro in total). This
is the maximum, and we will be the last ones to get paid. 
With
this included, and depending on the final level of funding we get, the total
price, including taxes and such, per book delivered to Paris is estimated to be between 5 and 10 euros.
The more funding we get, the lower the price will be per book: fixed costs will
be about the same, irrespective of the size of the print run.
We
are based in Finland, and the law on accepting donations here is a bit tricky.
In practice, we have to sell something in order to accept money. That’s why we
are offering you, our dear prospective funder, something concrete for your
money. You can get anything from a pdf version of the book, to a paperback
signed by the authors to having
your name on our website or even the book itself as a key supporter. If you have or work in an organization
(or if you have a bit more money) you can also get a full box of the books to do as you like
with. It’s a great Christmas present for family, friends and the businesses
that your organization works with! Imagine: “This present is a part of a
campaign that is trying to save the world.” 
As
the top-level perk, you get one (or even both) of us to give a presentation on
the subject in a forum and location of your choosing. Of course there will be
traveling expenses added, but otherwise than that, this will be something we
are prepared to do on our own time to support the campaign, without pay. Both
of us are experienced and entertaining presenters who are not afraid to say
things like they are. If Paypal is not a good way for you or your organization to pay, please contact us directly at climategamble@gmail.com. Other ways to fund the campaign are also possible, and we will try to get funding everywhere we can. It will all be added up when the campaign ends.
We
have divided the goals between 5,000 and 50,000 euros, and 500 and 10,000 books,
respectively (these are rough estimates). We are confident that we will reach
the lowest level, and anything above that, whether it meets the next level or
not, will be used for getting more books to Paris and raising awareness on the
message. If we don’t get to the lowest level, we will try to find ways to get
at least some books to Paris with the money we have raised.

What we plan to achieve
We
already have some great people on board and supporting the campaign in their
own various ways. These include:
- 
Energy for Humanity, an
environmental NGO
- 
Ecomodernist Society of Finland, an environmental NGO-  Tom Blees, the author of the excellent book Prescription for the
Planet (link to free pdf) and the President of the Science Council for
Global Initiatives.If you'd like to support us and see your organization or name listed here, please contact us at climategamble@gmail.com.
With
help from you andother supporters, we believe that we can spread
information on this campaign and the message of the book far and wide. Like our
good friend, now the executive director of the Finnish chapter of World Energy Council, said:
“I think that amongst all the different campaigns and initiatives going to
Paris this December, this is one of those that might actually have some impact”.
The
facts are clear: without nuclear power we simply do not have a fighting chance
at stopping climate change in time. This is the message coming from
basically every major institution, including IPCC, IEA and others. Stopping
climate change will be extremely hard even with nuclear power. Yet there are
people who openly oppose nuclear power and campaign that its use as a
decarbonization tool should not be allowed. They are even campaigning in
Paris. To support their cases, they have flashy and catchy slogans, and use
rhetorical tricks that would make any climate denial veteran proud. Some of the
arguments seem legit, and some are even true, at least from a very narrow point
of view in a world where no comparisons or cost/benefit analysis need to be
made. 
The
thing is, there is nothing new. Every argument used has been discussed in
Climate Gamble and in various other works. Yet they pop up again and again, going in endless circles not unlike the ""discussion"" about climate change and humanity's role in it does, just to ""keep the debate alive"" and the public unsure about the science and evidence. There is no rational base to claim
that mitigating climate change – which is, and should be, the ultimate goal –
will be easier, faster and cheaper if we limit our tools and options
arbitrarily. Logic and numerous scientific studies support the inclusion of
nuclear power. Many of those studies are referred in our book. We, as environmentalists, have accepted
the scientific consensus on climate change. Now we have to accept the
scientific consensus that nuclear needs to be a part of the solution.
We
have run some similar, if an order of magnitude smaller, campaigns. We
crowdfunded 300 free books (the Finnish version of Climate Gamble) to be
distributed in a big Energy Debate last spring, which was held as a part of our
parliamentary elections. The debate was organized by the big environmental
organizations in Finland. Incidentally, they were not that happy to see us
there. They did not permit us to distribute the books inside the event, and
even moved us and the books farther from the entrance to the building. When the 200 members of
the parliament were elected, we crowdfunded another campaign that got a copy of
our book delivered to each of them. In June, we managed to get funding to get
250 copies of our book, along with us authors, to Paris as part of ENYGF 2015 (European Nuclear Young Generation Forum).
There, we distributed the books to the participants and gave a presentation,
telling the participants of this upcoming campaign we have now launched. We
have also managed to get funding for smaller patches of the book to be
delivered to various audiences from young political activists to employees and managers in
the energy industries. 
And now, we aim for COP21 in
Paris. 
This
campaign will come to an end near the end of November. That gives us a good
month to print the necessary amount of books and send them to Paris.

What are the
biggest risks & challenges?
Obviously, if the campaign
falls flat then it falls flat. As a result, ignorance about the importance of
nuclear power might become even more widespread, as anti-nuclear activists with
their signs and chants will definitely be in Paris. We are not saying that this
project will save the world. It is just a small piece in a big puzzle. However, we are confident that we can have at least some impact. And we need to
try. If enough people and enough good pieces get put together, things start changing. 
How we will get and store
the books in Paris, to be distributed? We know some people there, and we will
map out their willingness to take the boxes as they arrive. Some have already agreed. We will also go
there ourselves, with hopefully a few assistants in tow, to distribute them. We
also know people from other like-minded campaigns and organizations, one being
Nuclear for Climate and another being Energy for Humanity, that we will likely co-operate with.

Getting excited? Here are some other ways to help
If you don’t have the means to
participate directly, but want to help us – or if you want to help us in
addition to getting one of the perks available – here are some things you can
do. These are important stuff.
1.  Spread the word
Obviously, our campaign can
succeed only if people know about it. Every tweet with a quote and a link,
Facebook posting or recommendation at the coffee table helps. Any one of them
could be the step that helps this campaign to break through to a wider audience
still. Indiegogo has some wonderful sharing tools as well. Use them. 
2.  Write a review of the book /
campaign
Do you have a blog? Do you have an Amazon account? Have you
written something to a local paper? Are you an actual journalist with thousands,
or millions, of readers? We would certainly
appreciate any reviews, be they for a personal blog, Amazon’s page of our book,
or a paper. If you want to have a free review-copy, let us know at climategamble@gmail.com and we will send you one to your email.
3.  Become a supporter
If you are a local or a global
person of interest (a journalist, a climate/energy researcher, a celebrity, a
famous activist or a mover/shaker in the energy or climate mitigation
business), we would love to add your name to the list of people who are supporting
this campaign. 
4.  Give us good ideas
If you get a great idea that
we could do, please, please let us know. We spend most of our time “inside the
Box”, and we realise that. Any ideas that come “outside the Box” are greatly
appreciated. Let us know at climategamble@gmail.com. 
5.  Help us realise those ideas
Even better than giving us an
idea, which we may or may not have the time to put in to action, is to offer to
help us see it done. Become a part of the team and earn a big, heartfelt thank
you. 
And now you have earned a big thank you for reading all the way down here: Thanks

Over the thirty years since its founding, Spuyten
Duyvil Press has gained appreciation and recognition as a
place to encounter vital and lively new and established poetry and prose. SD helps
integrate distinct, compelling voices into vibrant discussions of culture and
literature at home and abroad. In order for these indispensible voices to
continue their essential reach, we need your help!
We are
seeking seed contributions to establish the Roots & Branches Series.
Roots and Branches will reflect the skyey reach SD's writers
seek, affirm, and transform as they create and compose the next avant and post
avant garde. Alongside brand new titles, out of print as well as public domain
works will be planted into a scintillating new contemporary title-base.
In
addition to creating this exciting new series, your contribution will also help
Spuyten Duyvil broaden its distribution channels and increase its already
considerable output of titles. Help us spread our
seed wide and far!

<p>6/09/15 –UPDATE: WE HIT OUR MID-POST GOAL OF $1300! <br/></p>
<p>We're halfway to our full goal! Today the announcement was made and the Open Call page on EMP's website was updated informing all authors that the Creepy Campfire Anthology will be paying PRO RATES of 6¢ per word, with a max payout of $360 per story! Obviously, the 13 authors who have already been accepted into the antho are very excited; they just got a raise!</p>
<p>The next 50% of our funding goals will go towards raising the word count of the anthology from 65,000 to 75,000 words. However, the antho is currently almost FULL. Realistically, there are only about FOUR more spots left before we'll hit the 65,000 word limit. We've got another $1300 to go before we reach 100% funding. Doing the calculations at 6¢ per word, for every 25% further funding raised, we can add another 5000 words onto the antho, and accept another 1-2 authors (depending on their story lengths). <br/></p>
<p>If, on the off-chance, we actually go beyond 100% funding, any further funds raised would then be used to determine the flat rate fee (if any) per story that EMP Publishing can afford to pay authors on the launch of either the second annual Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups), 2016, OR the Creepy Campfire Stories Quarterly Digest, depending on how far over 100% we can reach.<br/></p>
<p>THANK YOU so much to everyone who has contributed so far, and ordered a copy of the anthology, or a book and SWAG!! We are so excited to send those contributors their fun Creepy goodies in October!!</p>

<p>Greetings from EMP Publishing and Managing Editor Jennifer Word. To view the Open Call for this anthology project, please visit the EMP website <a href=""http://www.emppublishing.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. <br/></p>
<p>EMP is a new, independently owned publishing company, based in Los Angeles County, Los Angeles, California, USA. Our team is growing, and we'd like to begin offering publishing opportunities to writers of modern day horror. Being new to the game, EMP has little start-up capital, but big dreams. We have just launched our first Open Call for submissions for the Anthology collection 'Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups)', but we're new, so we can only pay our authors 4¢ per word. We'd love to up our pay to the true professional rate of 6¢ per word. This would also allow horror writers who are published in the anthology to count their publishing credit towards acceptance into the HWA (Horror Writer's Association).<br/></p>If we could raise enough funding, we'd also love to raise the word count of the book from 65,000 to 85,000 at 6¢ per word, to accept and showcase even more writers in the anthology. You can help us make struggling horror writers' dreams come true.<br/><br/>
<p>We are currently slated and funded to publish a book of 65,000 words in length, at 4¢ per word. We need to raise a mid-post goal total of $1,300, in order to increase the writers' pay the extra 2¢ per word to reach professional rates. Increasing the book's length by an additional 20,000 words accounts for the secondary goal post of $2,600. That is where the goal amount we've chosen stems directly from. There is no profit for EMP in this campaign. All the money raised will go directly to the authors themselves, to reward them for their talent and hard work.<br/></p>
<p>If you are a supporter of the writing community, or simply the creative arts, we hope that you will support this campaign and make it possible for EMP Publishing to pay talented horror writers today what they truly deserve. We'd appreciate your help in supporting the hardworking and talented, yet under-appreciated horror writers out there who are struggling and mostly being paid nothing, many times, not even a contributor's copy. We'd like to change that.<br/></p>
<p>Thank you so much for considering support of this project. If you are a horror reader and book fan, consider supporting this campaign (and the future selected authors of the anthology) by ordering a paperback copy, or Kindle e-version of this title. <br/></p>

Avete presente quelle serate tra amici di puri ragionamenti esistenziali? Tra una birra ed un amaro raccontandosi progetti e prospettive future?
Saranno stati i fumi dell'alcol o più semplicemente  un'insieme di idee che insieme hanno preso senso, nell'arco di una serata è nata un'idea. Una bozza di trama.. e la voglia di farla diventare una storia.
In 2 per giunta, perchè scrivere a 4 mani non è una cosa da tutti i giorni.
I due in questione sono Simone Bellucci, che sembra abbia preso una laurea in Ingegneria e per evitare di farsi sommergere dai numeri ha ben pensato di scrivere un libro, e Luca Marinangeli, che invece scrittore e poeta lo è ormai da un po', anche se il libretto universitario lo etichetta come laureando in Economia.
   Perchè una campagna su IndieGoGo Abbiamo scelto di toglierci dalle logiche del mercato dell'editoria.
Vogliamo che il nostro libro sia apprezzato (o criticato) dai lettori prima che dai singoli editori che si affidano sui nomi forti. Per questo motivo chiediamo a te, lettore, di darci un piccolo contributo, per riuscire a dimostrare che è il pubblico stesso a scegliere cosa va e cosa non va. Non deve essere indirizzato verso un genere o un altro.
    L'importanza del Crowfunding Riuscire a finanziare totalmente questa campagna significherebbe autopubblicare per la prima volta (in Italia) non un book fotografico, un fumetto o un docu-libro, ma un romanzo. La rilevanza su base nazionale e internazionale sarebbe incredibile, così come il forte messaggio verso chi si affida ancora a logiche vecchie.
Aiutereste noi , si, ma tutti i novelli scrittori si affaccerebbero a queste nuove possiblità.
    La logica dell'insuccesso In questa ""avventura"" noi ci mettiamo in gioco. Voi, credendo in noi, fate altrettanto.
Il libro non è lungo, può essere letto con facilità durante un bel viaggio in treno (di quelli Roma - Milano senza il Frecciarossa 1000 ovviamente) e così è stato pensato. Un compagno di viaggio che proprio di viaggio parla.
Se (vi) piacerà, non diventeremo famosi o  ricchi, ma saremo realizzati... e voi ci avrete aiutato a non lasciare un piccolo sogno (e letteralmente un libro) nel cassetto.
Se non (vi) piacerà... poco male! Forse non è questa la nostra strada, ma almeno avremo aperto la via a scrittori più talentuosi di noi.

    Come altro ci potete aiutare?
Sia che decidiate di aiutarci economicamente (grazie già da ora) sia che non vi vada o  non possiate diventare ""cofondatori"" di questa opera, vi chiediamo di condividere il progetto.
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram o qualsiasi altro social vogliate utilizzare (anche Tinder... perchè no?) ci permetterà di raggiungere una platea più ampia e far si che più persone possano aiutarci.




N.B.Questa è una campagna Flessibile. Cosa significa? Che è possibile finanziarla anche se non raggiungerà la quota finale. Tuttavia, se non dovessimo raggiungere la quota di 1500 € entro i 60 giorni, restituiremo a ogni funder il quantitativo versato.

Through all of my investigations into spiritual ideas and philosophy, it became apparent that there was always a similar theme towards all of the varying books that were already out there, and that maybe there was a place for a more relaxed and disarming approach to the same ideas. Through the use of pop-culture, humour (and for this particular theme), a few gaming references. I feel that metaphysical &amp; spiritual philosophy could be explained without seeming to ‘un-approachable’ to those who have an interest in these ideas, but may become deterred from a title or book cover that seems too ‘enlightened’ for them at that time. I feel that by using less of a mystical/fluffy feel and replacing that with more of a sci-fi and grounded approach, the same ideas can be shared. Really, it is just one of many different roads to the same destination. </span></p><br/><p>I have always felt that any person can learn or understand anything, yet there are different approaches that work better for different people. There is no guaranteed method of relaying any kind of ideas or information that works for everyone. There are many books incorporated under the ‘New Age’ banner that talk about this subject through the use of Angels, Spirits, Understanding Your Own Power, Laws of Attraction, The Secrets to Life, and so on… but i feel that the option to approach a way into such ideas should be available to all, and i hope to fill an opening that has been around for a while.</p><br/><p>Gods are Gamers  is a look at life from a different tangent of the ‘Metaphysical/Spiritual’’ point of view. The book starts from a pre-birth idea and moves through different stages of life and sharing a humorous, yet insightful look at this crazy house we call Earth.

Through all of my investigations into spiritual ideas and philosophy, it became apparent that there was always a similar theme towards all of the varying books that were already out there, and that maybe there was a place for a more relaxed and disarming approach to the same ideas. Through the use of pop-culture, humour (and for this particular theme), a few gaming references. I feel that metaphysical & spiritual philosophy could be explained without seeming to ‘un-approachable’ to those who have an interest in these ideas, but may become deterred from a title or book cover that seems too ‘enlightened’ for them at that time. I feel that by using less of a mystical/fluffy feel and replacing that with more of a sci-fi and grounded approach, the same ideas can be shared. Really, it is just one of many different roads to the same destination. I have always felt that any person can learn or understand anything, yet there are different approaches that work better for different people. There is no guaranteed method of relaying any kind of ideas or information that works for everyone. There are many books incorporated under the ‘New Age’ banner that talk about this subject through the use of Angels, Spirits, Understanding Your Own Power, Laws of Attraction, The Secrets to Life, and so on… but i feel that the option to approach a way into such ideas should be available to all, and i hope to fill an opening that has been around for a while.Gods are Gamers  is a look at life from a different tangent of the ‘Metaphysical/Spiritual’’ point of view. The book starts from a pre-birth idea and moves through different stages of life and sharing a humorous, yet insightful look at this crazy house we call Earth. Even though this book is written in fun and disarming manner, there are actual Spiritual teachings that could certainly be of use if trying to understand the meaning of life. This book is written with wisdom and life affirming issues, but these things can easily be described in a way that appeals to Teenagers and Adults alike, if you are into Gaming, Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Pop-Culture whilst not minding a little splattering of adult language, yet have an interest in matters of a contemporary philosophy regarding thoughts of a Spiritual/Metaphysical/New Age nature, then this should appeal to those who are open to these ideas, yet may not have taken up other options... However it can also appeal to those who already have an interest in such matters, but like to investigate different perspectives.Example chapter titles include:Why The Game Exists, Creating Your Character Fear Not My Friend The Games Great Players Welcome To The Neighbourhood, and many more.The types of thoughts and questions that i aim to share some are based around aspects of life. Why are we here? Is this planet the only experience open to us?Is there a reason to why Earth is so difficult?Are we the only species in the Universe?What choices do we actually have?I would like to say something about the cover design for this book.

No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.” – Ralph Ellison, <u>Invisible Man</u>, p. 3</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>SUMMARY OF THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p><p>In 1952, famed author Ralph Ellison penned the fictional classic, <i><u>Invisible Man</u></i>, chronicling the challenges of early twentieth century life in America for her citizens of color. In its gripping and often gritty depiction of the travails of a college educated, young black man who often felt himself unnoticed from the rest of society, this literary masterpiece helped to shed light on the harsh realities that most black males face each and every day—from the womb, to the tomb—as they are forced to swim against the tide of negative public perception, institutional disadvantage, and creative disenfranchisement, further stacking the odds of success against them.</p><p>Trapped in the alternate reality of being “seen, but not seen,"" present but unaccounted—and in many aspects unaccountable—Ellison’s work shined a spotlight to the plight of blacks in America. Today, however, more than sixty years since the book’s release marked a watershed moment for a slowly evolving society, many argue that very little has changed for the plight of America’s black males. And, in many instances, the reversal of fortunes has occurred as black men continue to lose ground and get left behind in today’s changing global marketplace.</p><p>In fact, for many years now, America has known that the oftentimes overwhelming challenges facing black men have consequences that affect us all. One of these problems, unfortunately, is the disappearance of productive black men from the communities that need them most. For example, the ratio of black men to black women is shockingly out of balance. Some of the leading reasons for this glaring absence include unusually high death and incarceration rates, among others.</p><p>In 1965, the United States Department of Labor released a report entitled: <strong>“The Negro Family: <i>The Case for National Action.</i>”</strong> In it, the federal government argued that the U.S. was underestimating the damage done to black families by <i>“three centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment” as well as a “racist virus in the American blood stream,”</i> which would continue to plague blacks in the future.</p><p>Today, some fifty-plus years since this report was released, the predictions laid bare in the ""Moynihan Report""(as it is commonly known) continue to serve as a harbinger of things to come for the public at large if changes aren't made quickly. From an economic perspective, one of the biggest problems facing black males, which also has a  direct impact on the pocketbooks and purse strings of ALL Americans, is the issue of mass incarceration and the overpopulation ofAfrican American males in the criminal justice system. In fact, U.S. taxpayers spend $39 billion per year for prison operations, further reducing our collective capacity to arrest this problem through greater investments in education, job creation and economic development.  Furthermore, an unintended consequence of the cradle to  prison pipeline that exists for African American men, is the lingering economic impact on their immediate families and, by extension, all families, further exacerbating this uniquely American crisis. Moreover, with the declining number of marriageable men in the African American community, along with high rates of homicide, AIDS-related deaths and other factors, the substantial imbalance in the male-female ratio, the disappearance of these men has far-reaching implications.</p><p>Something must be done, and it is important that each of us, regardless of race, do our part to eliminate the problem!</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT MAKES THE BOOK DIFFERENT</strong></p><p>Each chapter of <u><i>Still Invisible?</i></u> will not only feature the shared experiences of African American males struggling simply survive from day to day, it will also provide the reader with the tools and resources they need to accurately and factually contextualize the issues facing black men, while taking into account the attitudes and perspectives of those who may not have a complete understanding of their daily reality.</p><p>Special sections at the end of each chapter include:<br/> </p><p><u><i><strong>EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE</strong></i></u><br/>In this section, we will examine the opinions and widely held beliefs and assumptions of many in society, as it pertains to their overall views of black males in America.

We rarely notice when it’s peaceful – we always notice when it’s not.27 Steps, a walk for peace, is a deliberate attempt to slow our pace down. 27 years in prison made the Nelson Mandela we know as a leader. As you take one step for each year – you break the cycle of your own life, and allow the old baggage of intolerance, discrimination and racism to melt away.The 27 Steps monument –  two pyramidal forms with a void down the middle through which visitors walk – will become a traveling peace pavilion, going to a number of cities around the world, and hopefully residing in the Apartheid Museum in South Africa.At a time when the world is witnessing violence of all sorts and not enough people are talking about it, Mandela's message rings true. We ask that you take these 27 steps with us, listen with your heart, and feel the steps as music, as presence. First Stop - San Francisco, Market Street Prototyping Festival http://marketstreetprototyping.org/2016-festiva... OUR PROCESS Walk the 27 Steps to peace with us. The idea starts here, we start building. Fail, Fail Fast. The devil is in the details. The connection points between the rods for the frame need to be good, real good. We learn. $1 stainless steel shaft as a connector's for the frame?

</h3> <p>Hi!<br/><br/>So my name is João Fernandes (you can learn <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fOndVOl5SE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> </b>how to pronounce my name) and I am a Portuguese writer. Maybe we met before, maybe you have no idea who I am... which is fair, I am not that famous after all (for now muahahah).<br/><br/>Guess what this campaign is for? Yes, I wrote a book. In fact during the entire year of 2014 I locked myself at home, or at cafés and I wrote and wrote and wrote until I could no longer read my own words and started sounding like a retard whenever I met new people. Writing is a very lonely and hard working task, the months added to one another and I kept fully dedicated just to make my dream of publishing a book to be true. The catch was: I HAD NO GUARANTEES THAT A PUBLISHING HOUSE WANTED TO PUBLISH MY BOOK. </p>
<p>Yeah, I know... I am quite insane.<br/><span><br/></span>Still I did not care, I would do it and I would make it. And in the last days of October, actually few seconds before I purchased a one way ticket to Thailand, I read an email that said: <i>""We are interested in..."" </i>You get the idea. I literally fell to my knees and started crying, this was everything I wished for during 10 months of intensive work.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>What happened next? <span><br/></span></b><br/>Nowadays publishing houses don't invest any money in unknown authors and I was no exception, so what happened was that I was obliged to buy 200 of the value of my own books, - that literally covers for the all expenses that they have with the publishing of it. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span><i>The not so funny but extremely challenging part?  </i>I did not have that money. I grabbed every cent that I had prepared for Thailand, I moved back to my childhood bedroom in my parents home, I sold clothes, every piece of gadgetry that was not essential, sold my laptop and so forth... So as you can predict I have zero to no funds at all. Another plot twist: <b>I will only receive the funds in a year from now, so no money in my pocket from sold books till 2016!</b> :(<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And this is why I need your help.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I will break it down for you:</p> <ul> <li>I need those 4500€ to get back the money invested in the publishing of the book. Plus whatever money I get I will invest in facebook ads, in the traveling expenses of the book tour, in designing more merchandising, in the money I owe to the photographers and designers and in getting the book translated to english.</li> <li>If I don't reach my goals (knocking three times on wood) I will still invest the funds in marketing, book touring expenses and making this book as far and wide known as possible.</li> </ul>
<div>But now the funny part, what do you get if you help me? Get ready and make your choice:<span><br/></span>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A badass shirt related to the topic of the book (an American RoadTrip), the design will be announced shortly</li>
<li>A signed poster with a beatnik and adventurous photo</li>
<li>Signed postcards with an actual picture of the REAL Road Trip</li>
<li>A signed book, 2 signed books or even 3 signed books, you choose!</li>
<li>A personal writing course and a <i>""how to get your book published""</i> course</li>
<li>My assurance that we will write and publish a book together</li>
</ul>
<div>Not bad ah?!</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I don't need to say that you will have my eternal gratitude. Do I? For me the Road Trip was not only a trip or a journey, was one hell of an adventure, a legendary piece of living history... And I felt that the only way I could make it honorable was to write a great book based on it.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>I essentially gave up everything that dragged me down. I dropped out of a masters just to pursue my writing aspirations. I lived by myself without a fixed wage and essentially on tuna cans and eggs. I dropped everything again to cross a continent from coast to coast without any assurance of success, earning money or anything else besides for the adventure and the greatness of it.<span><br/></span></span>
</div>
<div>And when I came back I wrote until I got this bad boy alive. Failure for me was not an option and so when you help me you are making this story reach other people who might be yearning for following their dreams and dedicate their life to what really matters: <b>what makes you happy and aligned with yourself.</b>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p> The greatest challenge for me is to get this book translated to English. I will be honest, it won't be easy, I have to sell either 3000 books or find myself an English audience that commits to buy the book. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So when you select any perk with a book I can do one of these:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Send you the first twenty five translated pages that I can distribute freely OR</li>
<li>You can wait for the book to be translated. Once this happens I will send them ASAP.</li>
</ol>
<div>So yeah... I cannot promise you that. But what we can do is to make our voices heard. Below I leave a petition for you to sign if you want the book translated to english (which you will want if you selected that perk, I am assuming). Heck, even I want my book translated in english, check out my signature:<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><a href=""http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/10-thousand-miles-in-english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/10-thousand-miles-in-english</a></span>

<div>Consegues adivinhar sobre o que é esta campanha? Sim, eu escrevi um livro. Na verdade durante todo o ano de 2014 fechei-me em casa, ou acorrentei-me a mesas de café e escrevi, escrevi e escrevi até não conseguir ler mais as minhas próprias palavras e começar a parecer um atrasado sempre que conhecia novas pessoas. Escrever é uma actividade difícil e solitária, os meses somaram-se uns aos outros e dediquei um ano inteiro apenas a concretizar o sonho de escrever um livro.

 Hi!So my name is João Fernandes (you can learn here how to pronounce my name) and I am a Portuguese writer. Maybe we met before, maybe you have no idea who I am... which is fair, I am not that famous after all (for now muahahah).Guess what this campaign is for? Yes, I wrote a book. In fact during the entire year of 2014 I locked myself at home, or at cafés and I wrote and wrote and wrote until I could no longer read my own words and started sounding like a retard whenever I met new people. Writing is a very lonely and hard working task, the months added to one another and I kept fully dedicated just to make my dream of publishing a book to be true. The catch was: I HAD NO GUARANTEES THAT A PUBLISHING HOUSE WANTED TO PUBLISH MY BOOK. 
Yeah, I know... I am quite insane.Still I did not care, I would do it and I would make it. And in the last days of October, actually few seconds before I purchased a one way ticket to Thailand, I read an email that said: ""We are interested in..."" You get the idea. I literally fell to my knees and started crying, this was everything I wished for during 10 months of intensive work.What happened next? Nowadays publishing houses don't invest any money in unknown authors and I was no exception, so what happened was that I was obliged to buy 200 of the value of my own books, - that literally covers for the all expenses that they have with the publishing of it. The not so funny but extremely challenging part?  I did not have that money. I grabbed every cent that I had prepared for Thailand, I moved back to my childhood bedroom in my parents home, I sold clothes, every piece of gadgetry that was not essential, sold my laptop and so forth... So as you can predict I have zero to no funds at all. Another plot twist: I will only receive the funds in a year from now, so no money in my pocket from sold books till 2016! :(And this is why I need your help.
   What I Need & What You Get I will break it down for you:  I need those 4500€ to get back the money invested in the publishing of the book. Plus whatever money I get I will invest in facebook ads, in the traveling expenses of the book tour, in designing more merchandising, in the money I owe to the photographers and designers and in getting the book translated to english. If I don't reach my goals (knocking three times on wood) I will still invest the funds in marketing, book touring expenses and making this book as far and wide known as possible. 
But now the funny part, what do you get if you help me? Get ready and make your choice:



A badass shirt related to the topic of the book (an American RoadTrip), the design will be announced shortly
A signed poster with a beatnik and adventurous photo
Signed postcards with an actual picture of the REAL Road Trip
A signed book, 2 signed books or even 3 signed books, you choose!
A personal writing course and a ""how to get your book published"" course
My assurance that we will write and publish a book together

Not bad ah?!
   
The Impact
I don't need to say that you will have my eternal gratitude. Do I? For me the Road Trip was not only a trip or a journey, was one hell of an adventure, a legendary piece of living history... And I felt that the only way I could make it honorable was to write a great book based on it.I essentially gave up everything that dragged me down. I dropped out of a masters just to pursue my writing aspirations. I lived by myself without a fixed wage and essentially on tuna cans and eggs. I dropped everything again to cross a continent from coast to coast without any assurance of success, earning money or anything else besides for the adventure and the greatness of it.

And when I came back I wrote until I got this bad boy alive. Failure for me was not an option and so when you help me you are making this story reach other people who might be yearning for following their dreams and dedicate their life to what really matters: what makes you happy and aligned with yourself.

    Challenges  The greatest challenge for me is to get this book translated to English. I will be honest, it won't be easy, I have to sell either 3000 books or find myself an English audience that commits to buy the book. 
So when you select any perk with a book I can do one of these:


Send you the first twenty five translated pages that I can distribute freely OR
You can wait for the book to be translated. Once this happens I will send them ASAP.

So yeah... I cannot promise you that. But what we can do is to make our voices heard. Below I leave a petition for you to sign if you want the book translated to english (which you will want if you selected that perk, I am assuming). Heck, even I want my book translated in english, check out my signature:http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/10-thousand-miles-in-english


   And that's all there is to it.Thank you for helping me. All the love.João Fernandes***************************************************
10 Mil Milhas
 Olá!


O meu nome é João M. Fernandes e sou um escritor português. Se calhar já nos conhecemos, se calhar não fazes ideia de quem sou... o que é justo, afinal não sou assim tão famoso (por enquanto muahaha).
Consegues adivinhar sobre o que é esta campanha? Sim, eu escrevi um livro. Na verdade durante todo o ano de 2014 fechei-me em casa, ou acorrentei-me a mesas de café e escrevi, escrevi e escrevi até não conseguir ler mais as minhas próprias palavras e começar a parecer um atrasado sempre que conhecia novas pessoas. Escrever é uma actividade difícil e solitária, os meses somaram-se uns aos outros e dediquei um ano inteiro apenas a concretizar o sonho de escrever um livro. A parte surpreendente é: EU NÃO TINHA GARANTIAS DE QUALQUER EDITORA EM COMO PUBLICARIAM O MEU LIVRO.
Mesmo assim eu não quis saber, eu ia escrever e ia conseguir ter o meu livro publicado... Já ouviste falar em auto-profecias? Foi assim que nos últimos dias de Outubro, na verdade alguns segundos antes de comprar um bilhete de ida para a Tailândia em que recebi um email com o título: ""Nós estamos interessados..."" Dá para perceber o que se seguiu, não dá? Eu caí literalmente de joelhos e chorei de alegria como uma criança, era tudo o que tinha desejado durante 11 meses de trabalho intensivo.



O que Aconteceu a Seguir?

Hoje em dia as editoras não investem o seu dinheiro em autores desconhecidos sem garantias de retorno e claro, eu não fui excepção. Assim fui obrigado a comprar 200 exemplares dos meus livros. A parte não muito engraçada mas altamente desafiante? Eu não tinha o dinheiro que me era pedido. Agarrei em todos os cêntimos do porco mealheiro, em todos os euros preparados para a viagem à Tailândia, vendi roupas, aparelhos antigos e voltei à estaca zero... e mesmo assim ainda não tinha todo o dinheiro que precisava. A minha família ajudou-me (a eles a minha eterna gratidão) e como podes calcular neste momento tenho zero euros em meu nome. Outra plot twist, como dizemos na escrita: Eu só irei receber a comissão da venda dos meus livros daqui a um ano, por isso não irá entrar dinheiro no meu bolso até 2016 :( 
E isto é o porquê de precisar da tua ajuda.


O que Preciso & o Que Recebes


Vou partir isto em pequenas partes para ser mais fácil de digerir:

Eu preciso de 4500€ para recuperar o dinheiro investido por mim na publicação do livro. Ou seja para saldar dívidas importantes. Para além disso há uma série de trabalho que tem que ser feito que necessita de fundos: anúncios no faceboook, design de merchandising, alojamento do site, a tour do livro e deslocações e por fim no caso de ter que pagar do meu bolso para traduzir o livro para inglês.
Se não atingir o meu objectivo (a bater três vezes na madeira) acabarei por investir os fundos em publicidade, na tour portuguesa do livro e a fazer que este livro seja o mais conhecido e lido possível.

Mas agora vem a parte engraçada, o que recebes se me ajudares? Prepara-te e faz as tuas escolhas:

Uma tshirt relacionada com o tópico do livro (uma viagem continental pela América do Norte), com o design a ser anunciado em breve
Um poster autografado com um tema aventureiro e beatnik
Postais autografados com fotografias da VERDADEIRA Road Trip
Um livro autografado, 2 livros autografados... até 3 livros autografados!
Um curso de escrita pessoal e um curso de ""como ter o teu livro publicado""
A minha garantia pessoal em como vamos escrever e publicar um livro juntos

Nada mau ah?




O Impacto
Não preciso de dizer que vais ter a minha gratitude eterna, pois não? Para mim a Road Trip não foi apenas uma viagem ou uma etapa, foi uma aventura incrível, uma lenda viva, um pedaço de história que trouxemos à vida... E senti que a única forma honrada de fazer jus a tal aventura era escrever um livro baseado nessa viagem.
Essencialmente eu deixei ficar para trás tudo aquilo que não estava de acordo com aquilo que queria. Desisti de um mestrado para perseguir o sonho de ser escritor.
