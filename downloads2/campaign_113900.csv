A Taste of Rust


Rust is a city that sits at the center of the world of dreams; ruled by a malevolent empress (The Red Queen) and three godling princes. The dreamworld is a harsh, unforgiving place and citizens of Rust cower beneath the oppressive rule of their cruel overlords. Led by a mysterious figure known only as the Shackled Man, some of the disenfranchised are fighting back, pitting their will against gods and demons alike. 
In recent times the boundary between the the waking and dream worlds has begun to thin. More and more people are slipping into the world of dreams, finding themselves lost in the red city, desperate and alone. Rust Chronicles Vol 1 traces the paths of some of these souls, beginning with stories that focus on the waking world and moving to those that take place in the dream world.


Rust Chronicles 1 begins with stories that focus on the waking world, gradually unraveling the mystery of the red city as it impinges on our reality. The second phase of the book focuses on characters within the world of dreams and nightmares and on the city Rust; a city in the throes of rebellion.

GENRE
While Rust Chronicles could be described as fantasy/steampunk epic with dark fantasy elements, the short stories within this volume represent a range of genres; from noir detective to paranormal, through first person diary to scholarly treatise. Some stories take place in the waking world and others in the world of dreams, written from a range of character perspectives and in different styles.

CHARACTERS
Rust is populated with a large array of characters, from Hawaiian shirt wearing detectives to renegade outlaws, shadow-clad assassins to psychotic biomechanical fleshmancers. Below are just a few of the key actors in this epic narrative.






The Rebellion Needs You!
We of the Rust collective have already laid out funds for the production of the first Rust Chronicles volume, engaging indie artists, illustrators, musicians and creatives to bring Rust to life. Money raised through this campaign will help us recoup some of those costs and support indie creatives from around the globe.
In the coming months we'll be looking to launch a series of Rust spin-off novels, novellas, illustrations, short story collections and possibly even a dedicated comic. Anything we can raise above and beyond our target will allow us to create more Rust Chronicles artifacts (we really, really want to produce a comic!).

How to get involved
 Rust Chronicles is all about building a community of readers, artists and creatives who want to explore the Rust universe and engage with the discovery process. If you're an illustrator or comic artist and you'd like to contribute to the Rust universe, drop us a line and we'll chat! If you've got an idea burning a hole in your head, or you'd just like to get in touch and share your thoughts on our work, get in touch, we'd love to talk with you.
We'll be posting updates to Facebook and our web site over the coming months to let readers know about upcoming projects, freebies and competitions. Make sure you sign up to our newsletter to keep up to date with what's coming.

<p>The need for ""perks"" inspired the idea to write personal river reports for people and send them off on postcards. I like the idea of the river reports being circulated by post. I will make an official River Report ink stamp and hand stamp each postcard to reference its origin. I plan to print one or two postcards from photographs I have taken at the river. (depending on the amount raised)<br/></p>
<p>In addition, I will make an audio book by reading all the reports myself. One of my geeky friends can record me. Most people will probably be happy with an MP3 but I will also offer old style CD and tape cassette versions in limited editions. <br/></p>
<p>The book will be printed through Lightning Source which is owned by Ingram. It will be a small run but high quality print and have a bar code and be available on Amazon. The number of books I order will be determined in part by the number of orders I receive. I will do all the design work myself. <br/></p>
<p>I have designed other books. Three of which can be found online, including the inside of the book pictured below which was published by Future Tense and Scout Books. I also have books out published by Container Corps and Publication Studio. <br/></p>

<p>In 2011, I funded a successful project on Kickstarter; a calendar representing the signs of the zodiac, each one depicted by a collage. I printed them myself, and used the proﬁt to buy a laptop for future projects; the very one I am writing on now!<br/></p>
<p>I live on a shoestring budget, so when my computer died, my crowd absolutely saved me by funding that project (thank you, crowd!) and they all got calendars. This is the collage for Libra:<br/></p>

<p>I've tried to make the rewards both affordable and interesting with many options. I feel and hope the goal of $1,800 is achievable. In which case, The printing costs for the the books and postcards will be covered. The rest of the funds will go to postage for print orders received and for shipping orders out, Indiegogo 4%, credit card processing 3%, and a margin of error and/or profit. It is possible I will add perks.<br/></p>
<p>For the sake of keeping it easy for people to pledge, I have left it as ""flexible funding."" This means that I would get the money even if the project is not entirely funded. It is the only way to keep the option of using a credit card to pledge. You can also use Paypal. <br/></p>
<p>In the case that I get only partial funding, I will still be able to make enough books and/or postcards to fulfill the pledges. I have budgeted the perks so that I will be able to make 100 books if 50 are ordered. This allows me the possibility to make some profit. If my math is correct, it also means that even if I fall short of my goal of 100 books, I will still be able to fulfill the awards I have promised. <br/></p>

Everyone who orders a book, cd or postcard report, is invited to the party. Come see the river for yourself. Winter party.

In 2011, I funded a successful project on Kickstarter; a calendar representing the signs of the zodiac, each one depicted by a collage. I printed them myself, and used the proﬁt to buy a laptop for future projects; the very one I am writing on now!
I live on a shoestring budget, so when my computer died, my crowd absolutely saved me by funding that project (thank you, crowd!) and they all got calendars. This is the collage for Libra:

I've tried to make the rewards both affordable and interesting with many options. I feel and hope the goal of $1,800 is achievable. In which case, The printing costs for the the books and postcards will be covered. The rest of the funds will go to postage for print orders received and for shipping orders out, Indiegogo 4%, credit card processing 3%, and a margin of error and/or profit. It is possible I will add perks.
For the sake of keeping it easy for people to pledge, I have left it as ""flexible funding."" This means that I would get the money even if the project is not entirely funded. It is the only way to keep the option of using a credit card to pledge. You can also use Paypal. 
In the case that I get only partial funding, I will still be able to make enough books and/or postcards to fulfill the pledges. I have budgeted the perks so that I will be able to make 100 books if 50 are ordered. This allows me the possibility to make some profit. If my math is correct, it also means that even if I fall short of my goal of 100 books, I will still be able to fulfill the awards I have promised. 
I will have a book release party at the Boat House when it has been printed and delivered to me. Everyone who orders a book, cd or postcard report, is invited to the party. Come see the river for yourself. Winter party. We'll fire up the wood stove on the porch and make some mulled wine. I am setting January 31 as the NEW deadline for delivery. Because of unforeseen circumstances, my work load has recently doubled until December 15. This means, it will take a little longer than I originally thought for the design process.I see this as a wonderful opportunity to simultaneously print and distribute this book. I consider you my co-publishers.  If the project piques your interest, please help by sharing it with your people. If you have any questions, feel free to write me. Thank you!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About project</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Attila ""Pumukli"" Vegh - Recently I have achieved the title of MMA  world champion, but my way to the top wasn't always easy and straight. So I have decided to write a book about my unusual journey.</p>
<p>I believe that my story could be motivating and interesting for everybody. I'm describing how I started with wrestling at the age of 6 years just like any average boy in central Europe, how I  trained hard, won my first competition, than continued fighting like a wrestler and later like a Kenpo Karate fighter. Twice I became the world champion in Kenpo karate and finally I engaged myself in <strong>MMA fighting</strong>. In many moments of this book, I describe the difficulties of life and fighting sports, but also many of them portray the funnier moments in my life, and all this I would like to share with you via my book, which I'm preparing in cooperation with writer Pavol Sipkovsky.</p>
<p><img alt=""Book example"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i41.tinypic.com/35hpdhi.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Not only do I wish to tell you my story, but I also add two additional chapters to my book. First is about <strong>psychology of MMA</strong> fighting from my point of view. I describe how fighters feel before each combat or while they are waiting backstage for their fight and of course what they are thinking during the fight itself. Second part is about <strong>my training </strong>and preparation before the competition. What kind of trainings I apply and what's my schedule when I'm in the pre-fight phase. In this part, I would also like to describe <strong>how I rest</strong> after tough fights and <strong>what kind of supplements I use</strong>. I hope all of this will inspire you and be interesting for all of you guys who do MMA fighting.</p>
<p><strong>The Book is almost finished</strong>. So far in Slovak language. We want to start translating the book into English, add pictures, print it out and advertise it. And for all this we need help from you guys.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned, we need your help with publishing my book. Our goal is to make 10 000$, because we think that this is the minimum amount necessary for successful publishing. We are expecting following expenses:</p>
<p><strong>Translating</strong> book from Slovak to English by professional 2 000$</p>
<p><strong>Pictures</strong> - we need to buy rights for photos from Bellator organization and other photographers. Expecting cost: <em>Unknown yet.</em></p>
<p><strong>Printing</strong> - more money we get, more pieces we will be able to print. Price for printing the book in full color and sending it to the customer is around 15$/piece (for example 300 books costs 4 500$).</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong> - Our wish is make this book successful and well known. To achieve this, we need to make advertising campaign at the beginning. Especially through famous webpages dedicated to MMA. Expected cost is 2 000$. But the rule ""more money, more advertising"" applies here as well.</p>
<p>We are thankful for any help, so we prepared plenty of unique perks for you. You can choose which one is the most interesting for you. Of course, we offer you the book in both electronical and printed version; also you can get original MMA gloves signed by ""Pumukli"". ...and much, much more including a special chance to train with the world champion!</p>
<p>Maybe you are wondering now, where will all your contributions go if we don't reach our goal. No worries, if we don't reach our goal, we will use funds for translation and for photos to finish the project in order to send perks to all our contributors.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we reach our goal we will do all the best to make book perfect.</p>

<h2><span lang=""EN-CA"">Bettering Mankind Through Medieval Play</span></h2>
<p>As a member of the Society for Creative Anachronisms I have been researching medieval ages for several years. My particular area of interest is one that has not been widely researched by many in academia or, in fact, by many others.</p>
<p>Sports and games in Medieval Europe is a topic often overlooked, the first book in the series Past Times will delve into this area listing a variety of games, their history, and how to play the games. With the Past Times series I intend to shed light on toys, games, sports and the general pastimes of history.  The first book in the series, already in progress will be an overview of a variety of games that would have been known to the Medieval European and how to play them, future books will cover other time periods, specific detailed histories on individual games or family of games, toys, and the list will continue to grow.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why Self Publish?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a common question I am asked. The fact is this book series is a very niche market and appeals to a limited group of readers. Most large publishing houses avoid such books like the plague. Many small houses do publish niche market books, but they usually have their own speciality. If I find a publisher who fits the series I am certainly willing to approach them, however there are costs still involved in marketing the book and as such funds raised through this campaign are still very much needed. If no publishing house is interested traditional publishing can still be approached at a later date if the first book, or subsequent books are successful. Publishing houses are much more willing to take a risk on authors with a proven track record. Self-publishing will most likely to be the best route for at least the first few books.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What happens if we don’t meet our goal?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The book will still be published, but not as much funding will be able to go into the production of the book. We may have to cut corners on cover art editing and marketing, but the things will still go forward, so any amount you can put forward is appreciated. You will still get the perk you were pledged to recieve, our project will still go forward it may just take longer to launch.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What happens if we collect more than our goal?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Then we are able to increase the budget on things like marketing, provide for the creation of more books in the series and generally improve the quality of the end products, this would also speed up the launch by date and possibly shorten the time between volumes.</p>

</div>
<p>I absorbed all the editing, design, marketing and promotion costs for <em>Ripple</em>, but I need help bringing <em>I Run</em> to market. I am looking at the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,200 for editing costs. This covers everything from developmental editing, to line editing, copy editing, and finally, proofs.</li>
<li>$500 in cover design. In order to garner a place in a very crowded market place, it's absolutely essential that an independent author invest sufficiently in graphic design in order to make her book stand out.</li>
<li>$125 for an ISBN number--for the soft cover book I will be creating via Ligthning Source.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>$75 to pay Lightning Source for set-up fees. It's necessary to self-publish through LS in order to get I Run into the Ingram and the Baker &amp; Taylor catalogs, respectively, which is what bookstores and libraries order from.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>The Impact of your help:</strong></h2>
<p>I can write more books that help women heal!</p>
<p>I am already 25,000 words into drafting <em>Wave</em>, the sequel to <em>Ripple.</em> The story picks up five years from when the first book ended, and it will show Phoebe's struggle to overcome her anger and her need for vengeance against her abusers, one of whom has just been released from jail. It will also show Phoebe finally letting go of her father's memory, which wracks her with shame and guilt and pain.</p>
<p><em>Wave</em> will show Phoebe's friendship with the Christ-like Jamie (the head of the therapeutic riding program at the Bryson House), who has found a way to forgive her own attackers, and the reader will meet Jim John McMahon, a mechanic who has recently left the Army. Jim John loves his mama, his country, God, and from the moment he meets her, Phoebe. <br/><br/>Like Phoebe, he also suffers from PTSD. He and Phoebe meet in class, where they're both studying literature. In her arms, he feels safe, and in his arms, Phoebe finds a release from the angry tides that churn inside her.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wave</em> takes the healing in <em>Ripple</em> much further. It will really help abuse survivors and it will gently wake people up from the nightmare of abuse and PTSD. It will, I hope, also wake people up to God.</strong></p>
<p>But like an old-fashioned artist in need of a patron, I need help creating. I need a small investment from you in me.</p>

My Experience
In January, I self-published Ripple. An Amazon #1 Bestseller, Ripple has received 71 reviews, and sales are increasing each month due to good word of mouth. More than 2,300 readers have bought or downloaded Ripple and Ripple YA. Ripple has been described as a must-read book for survivors because it helps people heal.
I Run will help people in much the same way. And it will touch those who feel spiritually lost.
What I Need

I absorbed all the editing, design, marketing and promotion costs for Ripple, but I need help bringing I Run to market. I am looking at the following costs:

$2,200 for editing costs. This covers everything from developmental editing, to line editing, copy editing, and finally, proofs.
$500 in cover design. In order to garner a place in a very crowded market place, it's absolutely essential that an independent author invest sufficiently in graphic design in order to make her book stand out.
$125 for an ISBN number--for the soft cover book I will be creating via Ligthning Source.

$75 to pay Lightning Source for set-up fees. It's necessary to self-publish through LS in order to get I Run into the Ingram and the Baker & Taylor catalogs, respectively, which is what bookstores and libraries order from.
The Impact of your help:
I can write more books that help women heal!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our educational retreat centre is fantastic. When people come out to Wintergeen Studios they relax, eat well, sleep better, and they are able to focus and create fantastic poetry and short stories. But we have a problem. We are remote! Not everyone can afford to drive out here, and because we get the very best Canadian authors, not everyone can afford our tuition fees. We are passionate about making our writing workshops more accessible, and giving young writers in particular a ""leg up"" in their initial investigations. Please help us provide a free workshop to three students for our Lawrence Hill writing workshop (Book of Negroes, Any Known Blood), and three students for our Helen Humphreys (Leaving Earth, Coventry) workshop with Kelly Aitken.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Each workshop fee is approximately $800 for three days of accommodation, meals, and tuition fees. We also want to pay someone to pick up our participants at their homes and deliver them to our retreat centre. We are located between Westport and Verona, Ontario, on 200 acres of land. Our space includes woods, private cabins and a lake, so our participants have a truly wonderful stay with us! We also have a literary press, so in exchange for your donation of $100 or more ($150 if you are in the States), you get a book called ""Writing at Wintergreen"" that is an anthology of writing about the land and our participants' relationships to it. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We wish we could afford to subsize tuition fees ourselves, but we are a very small organization. We have only 3 part-time employees and we are a not-for-profit, charitable organization. Your donation will help us do more in our community. We advertise locally and word is spreading about our activities, but our remote location and our fees are prohibitive for many low-income families and students. We want to change that. We feel everyone should have access to our incredible writers and artists. And we feel everyone should have a chance to leave the city for a weekend and enjoy the outstanding Ontario countryside. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate yourself, we would be so grateful if you would email this to another person you know who might be able to donate, or who is connected to a wide group of book lovers, writers, or patrons of the arts. Thank you so much!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Meet Our Candidates</h3>
<p>Our first candidate, Hannah Ellsworth, is a confirmed participant at Lawrence Hill's workshop in late April at Wintergreen Studios.

<h3>""House of Lies""</h3>
<p>          People across the globe are beginning to feel as though an unseen world of lies and deceit exists behind every corner. “House of Lies” blows the lid off this hidden world and details the manipulation and dark agendas perpetrated against us by the global elite. There are underlying truths behind many world events, religious doctrines and widely-held beliefs that are quite simply unknown to most people. Within the pages of this book is a detailed examination of these truths, breaking down each idea and showing how they are all well crafted lies created and used to control us.</p>
<p>          Numerous books have been written on the subjects of conspiracy theories, religious history, secret societies, philosophy and social commentary; but few put them all together in one easy-to-understand book. My book presents new information that hasn’t been seen before, as well as giving a completely different perspective on how the world really works. Broken down into three main sections, I prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that conspiracies do indeed exist, and that there is a dark force behind all of it. The first section covers the philosophical issues concerning the intangible aspects of life. These include the different theories on the origin of mankind, how the universe was created, what the reality is behind quantum theory, the role extraterrestrials play in our world, the effect television has on society and the dark side of the Hollywood industry.</p>
<p>          The second section focuses primarily on our five-sense reality and the conspiracies taking place within it. These include a critical look at America’s drug culture, an examination of the major forms of government, and an investigation into the hazardous and dangerous activities of corporations, banking institutions, schools and the prison system. The third and final section of this book looks at a secret world hiding right in front of us. It begins with the history, practices and beliefs of the primary secret societies in operation today, followed by a detailed explanation on how religions are connected to these same <em>mystery schools</em>. The next chapter discusses international pedophile rings and their connection to organized crime, government and worldwide intelligence agencies. This section concludes with a chapter on the occult symbols and symbolism that is frequently used all around us, examining each symbol’s multiple interpretations and usage.</p>
<p>          ""House of Lies” has approximately 450 pages with 160,000 words; using quotes, references, and almost 150 pictures to properly explain each subject. I uploaded two sample chapters to this page in pdf format for those who would like to check out my work. ""Sample Chapter 4: The Box"" is also available on my blog at:</p>

<h3>Your Contributions</h3>
<p>          Trying to get a book published for the first time reminds me of looking for work in today's times. Read nearly every career advertisement and they all want the applicant to have two-three years of experience before they will even consider hiring them. The problem comes in that if you have no experience then you won't be hired, and if you have experience then you probably already have a job. So how does anyone go into a new field in this situation?</p>
<p>          Nearly every advertisment for a book agent or publishing company says the same thing; they want the potential author to already have a ""foundation,"" i.e., a large number of people who have already read their work. Essentially, if the potential author has no audience then they can't get published, but in order to get an audience they need to be published. Does this make sense? Well this is the situation myself and other authors are in when trying to get this important information into the public arena. It leaves us with only one choice, self-publishing.</p>
<p>          In order to publish a book on my own, I need the startup funds to do so, which is where you excellent people come in :) My stated goal is nothing extravagant, just what I need to get a jump start on this process. I am asking for $12,000 which will be broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 1/2 of the money will go towards online advertising. As I have not utilized ""social media"" to grow an audience, I will have to do things the old fashioned way. This includes using software like Google Ads, and paying fees to various website owners to place links and information about my work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 1/4 of the money will help to pay for the book to be printed on paperback. It might be cheaper and easier to strictly go the 'e-book' route, but I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who prefer reading physical books. It is for this reason that I will need paperback copies available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The last 1/4 of the money will go towards any problems or issues that arise in this long process. It is always important to have the money there if any obstacles present themselves opposed to leaving out any unforeseen circumstances that could potentially hinder the release of my book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I don't reach the full goal, the money will still be divided in the same manner. $12,000 is what I need, but if I have to make do with less then so be it. Either way it is my mission to get this information out to as many people as possible despite anything that stands in my way. Some things are just too important and I feel my book is one of them.</p>
<br/><h3>How Can One More Book Make a Difference?</h3>
<p>          My answer is simple, the more people who are reached with this type of information (and there is a lot of original research and new material in my book), the less people there are who believe the manufactured reality being force-fed to them on a daily basis. When people understand what is really happening in the world, they no longer believe the lies, and therefore no longer go along with the elite's agenda. One of the more important aspects of this book is that it explains to the reader that they don't need any other person in charge of their life; telling them what they can or can't do, and telling them what they can or can't think. If such an easy concept could be understood by the majority then they wouldn't continue handing over their lives, minds and souls to people who couldn't care less about them. The underlying theme of this book is to ultimately regain control over ourselves and stop repeating history.</p>
<p>          Looking throughout our past I have noticed a vicious cycle that doesn't seem to end. At some point a government or leader becomes tyrannical and begins abusing and stealing from the populace. As time progresses a smaller group of ""revolutionaries"" take form and eventually gain enough momentum to take down the tyrannical government and replace it with a new one based on their values. This works fine for a while until another power-hungry person, or group of people, take control and become tyrannical. At that point another group of revolutionaries is formed, takes them down, and installs another  government that will once again become tyrannical. This has been happening throughout our known history and unfortunately I can see the beginnings of it occuring right now. This is not the answer, as it will only lead a future generation into the same situation we're in now. The real solution lies within each and every one of us. We need to attain the ability to think, act and live for ourselves; never again handing another person the power to control us. Only then can mankind live in harmony. As I stated this is the underlying theme of the book, which goes into far more detail on this philosophy, and how it might actually be possible.</p>
<p>          For those who contribute, you will be helping to make a dent in the power structure of the world elite, along with helping the masses learn how to take back their power through knowledge and awareness.</p>

</div></div>","""House of Lies""
          People across the globe are beginning to feel as though an unseen world of lies and deceit exists behind every corner. “House of Lies” blows the lid off this hidden world and details the manipulation and dark agendas perpetrated against us by the global elite. There are underlying truths behind many world events, religious doctrines and widely-held beliefs that are quite simply unknown to most people. Within the pages of this book is a detailed examination of these truths, breaking down each idea and showing how they are all well crafted lies created and used to control us.
          Numerous books have been written on the subjects of conspiracy theories, religious history, secret societies, philosophy and social commentary; but few put them all together in one easy-to-understand book. My book presents new information that hasn’t been seen before, as well as giving a completely different perspective on how the world really works. Broken down into three main sections, I prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that conspiracies do indeed exist, and that there is a dark force behind all of it. The first section covers the philosophical issues concerning the intangible aspects of life. These include the different theories on the origin of mankind, how the universe was created, what the reality is behind quantum theory, the role extraterrestrials play in our world, the effect television has on society and the dark side of the Hollywood industry.
          The second section focuses primarily on our five-sense reality and the conspiracies taking place within it. These include a critical look at America’s drug culture, an examination of the major forms of government, and an investigation into the hazardous and dangerous activities of corporations, banking institutions, schools and the prison system. The third and final section of this book looks at a secret world hiding right in front of us. It begins with the history, practices and beliefs of the primary secret societies in operation today, followed by a detailed explanation on how religions are connected to these same mystery schools. The next chapter discusses international pedophile rings and their connection to organized crime, government and worldwide intelligence agencies. This section concludes with a chapter on the occult symbols and symbolism that is frequently used all around us, examining each symbol’s multiple interpretations and usage.
          ""House of Lies” has approximately 450 pages with 160,000 words; using quotes, references, and almost 150 pictures to properly explain each subject. I uploaded two sample chapters to this page in pdf format for those who would like to check out my work. ""Sample Chapter 4: The Box"" is also available on my blog at:

Your Contributions
          Trying to get a book published for the first time reminds me of looking for work in today's times. Read nearly every career advertisement and they all want the applicant to have two-three years of experience before they will even consider hiring them. The problem comes in that if you have no experience then you won't be hired, and if you have experience then you probably already have a job. So how does anyone go into a new field in this situation?
          Nearly every advertisment for a book agent or publishing company says the same thing; they want the potential author to already have a ""foundation,"" i.e., a large number of people who have already read their work. Essentially, if the potential author has no audience then they can't get published, but in order to get an audience they need to be published. Does this make sense? Well this is the situation myself and other authors are in when trying to get this important information into the public arena. It leaves us with only one choice, self-publishing.
          In order to publish a book on my own, I need the startup funds to do so, which is where you excellent people come in :) My stated goal is nothing extravagant, just what I need to get a jump start on this process. I am asking for $12,000 which will be broken down as follows:

Approximately 1/4 of the money will help to pay for the book to be printed on paperback. It might be cheaper and easier to strictly go the 'e-book' route, but I know there are a lot of people out there like myself who prefer reading physical books. It is for this reason that I will need paperback copies available.


The last 1/4 of the money will go towards any problems or issues that arise in this long process. It is always important to have the money there if any obstacles present themselves opposed to leaving out any unforeseen circumstances that could potentially hinder the release of my book.

Even if I don't reach the full goal, the money will still be divided in the same manner. $12,000 is what I need, but if I have to make do with less then so be it.

My name is Matt Wade, a campus pastor at Cross Point Church, Nashville, TN. 
The purpose of this campaign is to help fund my first writing project. 
By helping me fund Leader Lies, you are investing in the lives of church leaders around the globe. You are also making a local impact by helping fund our church building expansion at our local church.
What We Need & What You Get
$4500 is my goal. This allows me to fund the entire book project and obtain 500 advanced copies of Leader Lies.

There are three giving tiers: $25, $100, & $250. 
All contributors will receive an advanced, autographed copy. Based on the contribution amount, your perks just get better!

100% of the funds go for two purposes: 1. Fund the entire book project. 2. Once the project is funded, HALF the sales from the books go to fund our church building expansion.
The ImpactIf you know me, you know that I am passionate about church leaders, particularly pastors. 

Leader Lies will help foster a new level of freedom in leaders and pastors by causing a desire in them to be 100% vulnerable and honest with God, people around them, and themselves. Who wouldn't like to help with that?

I have been writing about subjects like this for 4 years and have seen tremendous feedback from leaders around the country. So many people are impacted by my raw approach to church and leadership. 
Not only are you helping me make Leader Lies a reality, you are also helping our local church grow into a new building! 
Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

I, for the purposes of this book, defined a dynasty as any team that won at least three championships in a five year period. Only eight iterations of teams have accomplished that feat (Jordan’s Bulls did it twice but its counted as one dynasty). Every chapter is a look at a different one of these eight dynasties: how they were built, how they sustained their success, and how they eventually fell. From there, I’ll be taking a look at the similarities between these eight great teams, and using those comparisons to evaluate all 30 teams (with a cute little formula I made) today in the NBA.<br/><br/>My name is Agu Ibanez-Baldor and I am the author of <i>DYNASTY</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to see who could be the next NBA dynasty now that it looks like the Golden State Warriors are wrapping up their run (also, the NBA season as a whole might be cancelled, so, there's that). I also wanted to take a look at all of NBA history, specifically its greatest teams. I wanted to see what, if anything, these teams had in common.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way to look at NBA history and teams today. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for basketball in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you get into twice as many fights on Twitter about who the GOAT is.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>La guerrera drager</strong> ofrece una nueva visión de la eterna lucha entre el Bien y el Mal...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Los guerreros dragers han combatido a sus enemigos desde su creación dos siglos atrás por un mago. Su destrucción total parecía algo imposible hasta que nació Ran, una hexen, cuyo poder podría resultar la solución definitiva para eliminar a los dragers. Cuando Ran se gradúa como guerrera drager su aventura para eliminar a estos terribles seres comienza.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos <strong>Elena Siles</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida el 7 de agosto de 1992 en Rota, Cádiz, es directora de <a href=""http://www.youarewriter.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youarewriter.es</a> desde 2013 y del Rincón Literario de Gente de Rota desde 2015. En 2014 publicó su primera novela de suspense llamada <i>La prueba</i>. Dirigió una revista, <i>Er Bisho</i> en el instituto IES Castillo Luna durante 2008-10. Ganó varios premios en 2013, 2016 y 2017.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«—Gracias —dijo Jorell a sus discípulos—. Así pues, demos la bienvenida a la alumna más brillante que he conocido y que será la primera marcada como guerrera drager de esta noche. Por favor un aplauso para Ran.<br/>          Ran subió hasta el atril donde se encontraba Jorell y le sonrió algo colorada, aún estaba nerviosa.<br/>          —Maestro Jorell. —Le tendió el brazo derecho—. Es un honor recibir la marca de uno de los guerreros dragers más grandes de nuestra historia.<br/>          —Yo como maestro drager, líder y comandante de nuestros guerreros te marco a ti Ran, hija de Ainara y Yannik. —Jorell cogió el hierro que tenía a su lado, lo calentó hasta tenerlo candente, después marcó a Ran en el antebrazo derecho—. ¿Aceptas jurar lealtad a Yaevdhal y respetar nuestras leyes; y servir y proteger Yaevdhal como guerrero drager?<br/>          —Sí —dijo con convicción Ran.<br/>          —Te proclamo pues guerrera drager.

La guerrera drager ofrece una nueva visión de la eterna lucha entre el Bien y el Mal...
Los guerreros dragers han combatido a sus enemigos desde su creación dos siglos atrás por un mago. Su destrucción total parecía algo imposible hasta que nació Ran, una hexen, cuyo poder podría resultar la solución definitiva para eliminar a los dragers. Cuando Ran se gradúa como guerrera drager su aventura para eliminar a estos terribles seres comienza.

¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«—Gracias —dijo Jorell a sus discípulos—. Así pues, demos la bienvenida a la alumna más brillante que he conocido y que será la primera marcada como guerrera drager de esta noche. Por favor un aplauso para Ran.          Ran subió hasta el atril donde se encontraba Jorell y le sonrió algo colorada, aún estaba nerviosa.          —Maestro Jorell. —Le tendió el brazo derecho—. Es un honor recibir la marca de uno de los guerreros dragers más grandes de nuestra historia.          —Yo como maestro drager, líder y comandante de nuestros guerreros te marco a ti Ran, hija de Ainara y Yannik. —Jorell cogió el hierro que tenía a su lado, lo calentó hasta tenerlo candente, después marcó a Ran en el antebrazo derecho—. ¿Aceptas jurar lealtad a Yaevdhal y respetar nuestras leyes; y servir y proteger Yaevdhal como guerrero drager?          —Sí —dijo con convicción Ran.          —Te proclamo pues guerrera drager. Enhorabuena.          Al ser una marca mágica permanecería en su cuerpo hasta el día de su muerte, así que Ran alzó orgullosa el brazo y todos los discípulos aplaudieron.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Ron Cohen and I am the author of Working With Robots.<br/><br/>As artificial intelligence invades more and more aspects of our lives, the big questions on everyone’s mind is how it will affect our jobs.

</p><p>
</p><p><b>(* The initial goal was reached -- however please read the ""Stretch Goal,"" information below.)</b></p><p>The genesis of this project came out of my
experience during the Viet Nam War as a combat medic and conscientious objector
(Charlie Company, Company C 1/52 198 LIB, Americal Division), when I witnessed
a number of deeply disturbing incidents and ended up being shot several times
during an ambush. The soldiers in my company helped save my life. In the years
following the war, I struggled with severe PTSD and flashbacks, which were
always in the background as I trained to become a fine art photographer, but
never addressed in my images. Finally, between 2000 and 2005, with the support
of a VA granting program for disabled veterans, I took a series of extended
trips to Vietnam in order to revisit the battle site where I was wounded, take
portraits of Vietnamese war veterans, and document the beauties and
complexities of post-war Vietnam. This was an attempt to reconcile my traumatic
memories through art. I left Vietnam with a small body of work that I plan to
develop into a book-length photo essay (“Bearing Witness:  A Combat
Medic’s Photographic Journey Back to the Present.”)</p>
<p>While working on this project, I unexpectedly
uncovered another facet of my journey:  the stories and recollections of
the men who were in my company. Over the past year, in researching my own project,
I’ve been able to reconnect with a number of my fellow vets through phone
calls, get-togethers, and email. In the process of helping me to put together
the sequence of events on the day of the ambush, they ended up sharing with me
details that I had not known before. </p>
<p>And, as they helped fill in the blanks in my
memory, their own stories began to emerge as well. In Vietnam, most of us were
in our teens or twenties and had never even been outside the US. In the ensuing
years, many found they, like me, had troubling or mysterious gaps in their
recollections. Many of my brothers in Charlie Company went through horrific
experiences that they have never spoken about. Since the Vietnam War itself was
at the center of protests and demonstrations during the 1960’s, many of us were
given a less than warm welcome when we returned. We retreated into silence.</p>
<p>Elements of shame and secrecy have continued to
linger through the ensuing four decades, to the present day. To a man, none of
us have ever forgotten our experiences of that war, but for most those memories
had remained in a locked box of the past. </p>
<p>But, in trying to help me reconstruct my own
experiences, with a bit of gentle persuasion some of my brothers began to open
up about their own. Poetry; prose; diaries; recollections, and experiences that
long been committed to memory have been shared.  </p>
<p>Importantly, because we served together and
there is complete unquestioned trust, as well as genuine love for one other, we
are able to share openly some our most traumatic memories. As I heard or read
their amazing and touching recollections, I knew that this material needed to
be recorded and documented. Together, we have been able to stitch together a
more complete picture of many of the incidents – some horrific, others strange
and even funny – that we went through. This project will not only help us to
remember together; the stories will also vividly convey to a new audience the
chaos and complexity of incidents that happen on the battlefield. These
accounts are all too often never heard beyond their immediate families – if
even. And, while my view is undeniably biased, I also truly believe that the
collection of characters and personalities in Charlie Company is exceptionally
interesting, and their individual accounts together convey aspects of the war
that I have not seen recounted elsewhere in quite the same way.</p>
<p>There is also the real issue of time passing.
Rather than letting Vietnam fade into the distant past, the voices of these
combat veterans need to be preserved, because we are all getting older now –
many of us are in our sixties. This brings an additional sense of urgency to
this project. </p>
<p>My goal is to interview up to 10 veterans at
this year's Charlie Company reunion, which will be held over a 3-day period,
this July in St. Louis. I plan on other interviews (up to 10 or 15) by phone or
Skype and hope to personally visit those within driving distance of me here in
Arizona. The edited audio, email exchanges, and other materials gathered will
be contributed to our company's website (<a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/mo2/CharlieCoScarf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.angelfire.com/mo2/CharlieCoScarf/</span></a>
website), circulated as widely as possible via email and word of mouth, and
available as a downloads to vets and their families. If possible, I hope to
have the accounts featured on a dedicated website.</p>
<p>We should, of course never ever forget the
incredible sacrifice that these men, women, and their families have made. But
it is in hearing their personal, authentic accounts that their sacrifices
become more real.  I count myself as one of the lucky ones – one of the
fortunate ones that came home. Tragically for the families whose sons and
daughters weren’t as fortunate – their pain is never ending. That sacrifice needs
to be honored and never stricken from our collective memory; and this project
is a small contribution to this end.</p>
<p>I've spent significant funds out of my own
pocket in helping give this project form, from the photographic aspect to the
oral history component, and am now turning to friends, family and their
networks to continue this journey. The funds raised through INDIEGOGO will
help support travel expenses and basic recording equipment needed to make
high-quality recordings of these stories.</p>
<p>The working title of this project is “Cascading
Voices,” which reflects the overlapping voices of soldiers from my company and
their various perspectives and backgrounds, brought together by our experiences
in Vietnam. I envision the impact of these stories – cascading over and with
each other– will be like a waterfall that tumbles over itself and into a single
pool.</p>
<p>I’ve had many years to reflect, suffer, and get to the other side of
my fears regarding this war. I feel that I'm finally able to articulate that
experience with more openness and with a sense of humility, and would like to
share the process with my brothers, by providing a vehicle and outlet for them
to do the same. Instead of remaining a dark and painful mystery, this project
hopes to bring clarity by allowing us to speak to each other, witness to
witness.</p><p><b>Stretch Goal: $5,000</b><br/><br/>I deeply appreciate and am touched by the support this project has received so far. Based on the enthusiastic feedback and suggestions I've received, I was encouraged to set out the full vision and needs of the project. The additional funds raised by reaching the ""stretch goal"" would enable me to greatly enhance the impact of the project by supporting video and personnel needs. This would include:<br/><br/>- Having a production assistant to work with me at the Charlie Company reunion in July. Rather than having to deal with all the logistics and technical details by myself at this large event, a locally based, experienced assistant could help with set-ups, organizing, overseeing equipment, and countless other details.<br/><br/>- Incorporate videotaping, which would greatly add to the power of the interviews and dialogues. Video was something I considered when this idea came about, but it seemed out of reach. I have some equipment for recording HD video, but having someone to help with filming and sound would be essential.<br/><br/>- Working with experienced video and sound editors to organize the raw footage and distill the interviews that I collect. (I expect it will be many hours of audio and/or video material.) The additional funds could cover honoraria for AV professionals willing to contribute much of their time pro bono. It would be ideal to locate Vietnam-era veterans who are experienced in these areas.<br/><br/>I never anticipated that I could actually raise enough funds to realize my full vision for this project, but with additional funding that is now within reach. Thank you for any support you can give.<br/></p>

pocket in helping give this project form, from the photographic aspect to the
oral history component, and am now turning to friends, family and their
networks to continue this journey. The funds raised through INDIEGOGO will
help support travel expenses and basic recording equipment needed to make
high-quality recordings of these stories.
The working title of this project is “Cascading
Voices,” which reflects the overlapping voices of soldiers from my company and
their various perspectives and backgrounds, brought together by our experiences
in Vietnam. I envision the impact of these stories – cascading over and with
each other– will be like a waterfall that tumbles over itself and into a single
pool.
I’ve had many years to reflect, suffer, and get to the other side of
my fears regarding this war. I feel that I'm finally able to articulate that
experience with more openness and with a sense of humility, and would like to
share the process with my brothers, by providing a vehicle and outlet for them
to do the same. Instead of remaining a dark and painful mystery, this project
hopes to bring clarity by allowing us to speak to each other, witness to
witness.Stretch Goal: $5,000I deeply appreciate and am touched by the support this project has received so far. Based on the enthusiastic feedback and suggestions I've received, I was encouraged to set out the full vision and needs of the project. The additional funds raised by reaching the ""stretch goal"" would enable me to greatly enhance the impact of the project by supporting video and personnel needs. This would include:- Having a production assistant to work with me at the Charlie Company reunion in July. Rather than having to deal with all the logistics and technical details by myself at this large event, a locally based, experienced assistant could help with set-ups, organizing, overseeing equipment, and countless other details.- Incorporate videotaping, which would greatly add to the power of the interviews and dialogues. Video was something I considered when this idea came about, but it seemed out of reach. I have some equipment for recording HD video, but having someone to help with filming and sound would be essential.- Working with experienced video and sound editors to organize the raw footage and distill the interviews that I collect. (I expect it will be many hours of audio and/or video material.) The additional funds could cover honoraria for AV professionals willing to contribute much of their time pro bono. It would be ideal to locate Vietnam-era veterans who are experienced in these areas.I never anticipated that I could actually raise enough funds to realize my full vision for this project, but with additional funding that is now within reach. Thank you for any support you can give.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I
am a Genuine Initiated Hindu Vaishnava Priest (GIHVP.) No, seriously! Not only
that, I have written a book. Yes, seriously! How many people do you know who
are Genuine Initiated Hindu Vaishnava Priests Who Have Written a Book
(GIHVPWHWAB)? I’m betting none! </p>
<p>My
writing: I worked as Editor for a regional newspaper in Colorado for thirteen years,
as Business Page editor (not that it helped my finances!) for a publication in
Canada, and have been published in newspapers and magazines including the
Denver Post and the Himalayan News. I wrote a play that was presented at the Brooks Center Arts Play Showcase Festival, in Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p>I
have organized several conferences on Science and Spirituality, have spoken at
churches, Interfaith meetings and diversity conferences. I also published an
electronic newsletter on Science and Spirituality for several years.</p>
<p>I’m
also a genuine, self-realized yogi (GSRY.) Actually not! I have to admit, that
despite attempts at yoga sadhana (practice,) I still breathe like a horse,
can’t get my joints to bend and can’t sing a note of kirtan!</p>
<p><b>2)</b><span> 
</span><b>The
Novel</b></p>
<p>A)<span>  </span><i>The
Background:
</i></p>
<p>In
1933 James Hilton, in his novel <i>Lost
Horizon</i>, wrote about the legend
<span>of Shangri-La (a variant of the original Shambala,) a valley
hidden deep in the Himalayas, whose inhabitants lead extremely long lives. The
book was instrumental in introducing the mysticism of the East to Western
readers; yet Hilton had knowledge of only a small part of the entire </span>narrative.</p>
<p>The
story of this hidden place, a
narrative sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus, is in fact <span>well known in
India, China </span>and
<span>other Oriental countries. In my studies as a Hindu Vaishnava
priest, I learnt </span>of
this narrative in a scripture named the Srimad Bhagavatam (also known as the
Bhagavat purana,) which mentions Shambala in connection with a much larger
story: that of the degradation of humanity at the end of time, the appearance
of the tenth Avatar of Vishnu named Kalki and his role in defeating the forces of evil at that time.</p>
<p>The
idea of presenting this engaging story to the everyday reader, especially to
those in the yoga community, immediately came to mind. The key was not just to
recite the ancient legend, but to let it be seen through the eyes of modern
protagonists who would not only have their own engaging stories to tell, but
also act as guides for the western audience.</p><p><i>The Story:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The Yoga Zapper </i>is the tale of two young
American brothers, who, thrust into strange worlds, find within themselves the
courage and faith to grow, change and discover their unimagined destinies. </p>
<p>While trekking in the Himalayas,
Steve and Jack encounter a dying priest who thrusts into their hands a Sanskrit
scripture which Jack names the Yoga Zapper. </p>
<p>“You do not understand,” cries
the old man. “Your lives, no, the future of the entire world depends on it!”</p>
<p>Little do the brothers know that
the text is a prescription for time-travel. In the midst of a deep conflict
with each other, they discover its powers. Steve, who has an intellectual
approach to life, is transported to a peaceful village at the beginning of
time. He falls in love with the beautiful Shanti and finally connects with his
heart. In search of his brother, Steve and Shanti join a group of yogis in a
pilgrimage to Shambala. There, they learn how to live in an ethereal state for
thousands of years.</p>
<p>Jack, irresponsible and immature,
finds himself in a society ruled by an evil despot. Sucked into the intrigue
and treachery of a civilization unravelling at the end of time, he is at last
forced to become accountable for his actions. He is imprisoned, but escapes to
Shambala. When the dictator attacks this valley, Kalki Avatar descends and a
world-consuming battle between good and evil erupts. The dictator who
orchestrates the destruction is killed and the earth, abused for so long,
blooms anew, the wheel of time turns again, and the brothers reunite.</p><p></p><p>C) <i>The Science Fiction:</i></p><p>What would the world look like at the end of time? The Srimad Bhagavatam describes it as a cannibalistic society with a wicked world ruler, environmental degradation and oppressive taxation. It addition, I imagined it to be a place where society is divided into three classes: a genetically pure Elite, a larger group called the Functionals who perform many societal tasks and finally, a vast underclass of inherently deformed humans called Rakshshas (Raks.)</p><p></p><p>D)<span> 
</span><i>The Genre:</i></p>
<p><i>The
Yoga Zapper </i> is ""<i>Little Buddha"" </i>meets ""<i>Lord of the Rings""</i> with a bit of ""<i>Gulliver’s
Travels""</i> thrown in for good measure. 
It contains a strong environmental theme as well as darkly humorous
social commentary. A complete, full-length novel, it is written in a clear style,
making it available to all readers, including young adults. While Norse and Old
English mythologies are staples of the fantasy genre, ancient Buddhist and
Hindu mythologies are yet to be truly explored. </p>
<p>Based on the authentic narratives
of these traditions, which I studied for many years, <i>The Yoga Zapper</i>  features yogis meditating for thousands of years,
Avatars descending from spiritual realms, ancient flying craft known as <i>vimanas</i> and a world-consuming battle
between good and evil at the end of time. </p>

<h3>The Last Hurrah</h3>
<p>You'd be amazed at how many World War 2 veterans are still with us, and still spry in their early nineties. Don Knapp, a veteran of the 712th Tank Battalion who you may have seen on ""Patton 360,"" recently scored a hole-in-one on his 94th birthday. You'd also be amazed at how many of their stories still haven't been preserved. I've been interviewing World War 2 veterans for 25 years. I still have many to interview, and could use some help before it's too late.</p>
<p>I first attended a reunion of the 712th in 1987 looking for veterans who remembered my dad, who died of a heart attack seven years earlier. I found three, and all the stories he told when I was young came back to life. At the same time, I realized that the stories I heard in the hospitality room, the hotel lobby, the parking lot, were an important part of history that needed to be preserved. Since then I've recorded 600 hours of interviews, written six books, launched a popular web site, and produced a series of oral history audiobooks. In 2008 I became a part of history myself, joining more than 600,000 Americans who were laid off from their jobs that month in the early stages of the Great Recession.</p>
<p>I defied the odds and found a job after two years and five months, but now I've voluntarily cut back to part time work so I can continue my passion for oral history. Your donation, however small, will not only help record and preserve the stories of more members of the fading Greatest Generation, but will assist in putting those stories in front of the public as I exhibit at air shows and other military and history-related events.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>The stories of our fathers and grandfathers (and great-grandfathers)</h3>
<p>""These are the stories of our fathers and grandfathers."" A reviewer wrote that at Amazon for my first book. ""These guys are a hoot!"" This was the reaction of a listener who left eBay feedback for one of my audiobooks.</p>
<p>What I need is: a) office space b) travel expenses c) blank CDs</p>
<p>So please check out my perks. I think you'll find them attractive, while at the same time helping to preserve a small but important piece of American history.</p>
<div>
<h3>Reality</h3>
<p>The veterans I've interviewed, the stories they've told, these are real people and real events. I once posted a story on my web site that was sent to me by a woman who helped her father-in-law write down his experiences. I then received an e-mail from a person in Tennessee who was named after an officer mentioned in the story. This officer was going from foxhole to foxhole checking on his men. The woman's father-in-law said he was cold. The officer removed his trenchcoat and gave it to the two men to keep them warm. The officer was later killed. I thought what an amazing thing it must be to learn that you were named after so compassionate a person. This is just one of many stories that have been generated by my work.</p>

<p>Hi, we're Jemmell'z Washington &amp; Jess McPherson. We've recently produced our first children's ebook,  Enzi and the Broken Bandage, for families with preschoolers ages 3-7 years old.</p>
<p>Enzi --whose name means “power” in Swahili--enables parents, grandparents and teachers to share the joy of reading while enhancing their future global citizens' libraries. Inspired by countless service projects uniting and benefiting friends and neighbors of diverse perspectives, I decided to create the character of a little boy named Enzi. He’s a nod to my socially responsible feature stories for <em>The Philadelphia Tribune</em>, the nation’s oldest African-American newspaper.</p>
<p>Award-winning fine artist and former YorkArts gallery director Jess McPherson's charcoal interpretation of Enzi pays homage to our combined Diaspora, tribal Creek, Irish, French, Pennsylvania Dutch and American Indian ancestry, while mirroring children’s’ realities on the school bus, at the playground, in the doctor’s office, and perhaps even at home.</p>
<p>Our shared interest in building a stronger community through the arts is also what compels us to get Enzi and the Broken Bandage into print and e-book formats. <strong>Watch the video</strong> to see us in action!</p>
<h2>What We Need…</h2>
<p><strong>Our goal of $17,500 covers</strong>:</p>
<p>• <strong>$2500:</strong> initial print run of 500 copies of Enzi and the Broken Bandage (soft cover)</p>
<p>• <strong>$7500:</strong> graphic design services for bookmarks and other promotional items, plus illustrator services for Enzi and the Broken Bandage and Enzi book #2</p>
<p>• <strong>$1000</strong>: travel/food expenses for Jemmell’z &amp; Jess to co-present 4 free workshops (up to 15 children per workshop) within a day’s drive of Philadelphia</p>
<p>• <strong>$1400:</strong> vendor/exhibitor fees, plus travel expenses for 1-2 family-and educator-friendly conferences, conventions or festivals with at least 5,000+ attendees (as projected by organizers) within a day’s drive of Philadelphia. Any surplus in this category will be invested in advertising channels.</p>
<p>• <strong>$2500</strong>: secondary print run 250-300 copies of Enzi and the Broken Bandage, or initial print run of 250-500 copies of Enzi book #2**</p>
<p>• <strong>$2600</strong>: percentage due to Indiegogo in support of their role in making our venture a reality</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>...&amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><strong>Perks that will help create tender memories</strong> of time spent with the special people in your life:</p>
<p>• Pass travel time by drawing together in the activity pages of an advance copy of Enzi and the Broken Bandage!</p>
<p>• Bake &amp; savor my great-great-grandmother’s recipe for Wet Coconut Cake!</p>
<p>• Frame an autographed illustration from Enzi and the Broken Bandage as a birthday or shower gift! Or double-laminate it for a personal placemat at the dinner table!</p>
<p>• Rejuvenate your family’s bedtime routine with a personal storytime phone call!</p>
<p>&amp; more! Check them out!</p>
<p><em>Plus, you can take added pleasure in supporting the revival of the U.S. economy with your contribution. We’re proud to award our business to a printer whose facilities are located in the contiguous 48 states.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>You're enabling more children and families to enjoy Enzi, and encouraging them to discover more about the world we all share, and how their talents and interests impact us all.</strong> The discussion questions in Enzi and the Broken Bandage nurture a curiosity about other languages and geography while speaking to the intrinsic values of helping others and seeking help ourselves.</p>
<p>While this is our first children’s book, it isn’t Jess’ or my first time working with children:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve created and led such workshops as “Writing from the Sole” and “Postcards from Space” for Spells Writing Lab, the Philadelphia children’s creative writing program based on the acclaimed 826 Valencia model.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Jess is a Culture Class Arts Instructor &amp; Community Mentor at Native American Lifelines of Baltimore. She’s also teaching grass, leather and roundbraided cable cordage workshops in conjunction with her featured works in lowercase gallery’s “Apocalypse Island” exhibition. (closes 8/18/12)</li>

<p>My name is Crystal Carter and I am a journalist residing in the Bay Area.  I graduated with a Bachelor’s of Arts degree in Journalism from San Francisco State University in 2008.  Since then I have interned at Colorlines.com, the North County Times and New America Media.  Before I graduated my work was featured on the front page of the Oakland Tribune, which highlighted a protest that took place around the Jena 6.  I found myself covering a lot of protests focusing on public affairs. I like protests because they project human emotion at its highest state in an organized fashion.  Since then I have been very interested in politics and social justice issues.  I was also awarded a fellowship from The Center for Crime, Media and Justice where I wrote an investigative report on California’s Three Strikes Law.  I am currently a Media Relations Fellow at The Commonwealth Club.</p>
<p><strong>How it all started...                                                                                                            </strong></p>
<p>I began Pops Campaign in 2008 during the presidential campaign for Barack Obama. I was definitely inspired by the way that people my age were the deciding factor in Obama becoming president.  I knew that Obama was going to need a lot of input and I felt that the millennial generation’s voice was very important.  Pops Campaign began as a blog in the form of a letter to the president.  After a lot of motivation and encouragement from friends and family I have decided to make Pops Campaign a full-fledged magazine.  It amplifies the voices of young professionals my age who are doing great things in their community.  In respect to the blog there will be a section called Letters to the President where Pops Campaign readers will get to voice their concerns to the president in an attempt to interact with the president and the white house to let them know about our concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Where the funding goes </strong></p>
<p>The people that contribute to this campaign will help Pops Campaign compensate its very talented writers, producers and photographers.  It will also help make Pops Campaign a print magazine that can be distributed to an international audience.  The magazine will be a beautiful showcase of the millennial generation’s talent through art, music, and political and cultural commentary.  Contributors will also help fund a documentary called “Superfund City” that survey’s Bayview Hunter’s Point District’s plight of environmental racism.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde once said: ""My advice to aspiring writers? Marry money.""</p>
<p>As practical and funny as this advice may be, I'm sure many of you know what it's like to try and find a long-term artistic project and live as an artist in New York City.</p>
<p>As you may already be aware, I have been working on a book proposal and manuscript for a work of creative non-fiction, largely centered around my experience as a person with an ""invisible disability.""</p>
<p>I was born with mild cerebral palsy which mainly affects my gait and balance. I have had multiple corrective surgeries in my life and have developed a consistent yoga practice.</p>
<p>Moving to NYC has been one of the great formative decisions of my life. I ride the NYC subway every day and navigate around without injury, largely invisible as a disabled person.</p>
<p>My project will also focus on my experience as a member of the LGBT community as a feminine-presenting individual. Stereotypes are a reality and so I am largely ""invisible"" as a member of this community as well.</p>
<p>We all have rich, multi-faceted stories that are not always visible at first glance. My goal is to compile an edited book proposal by Winter 2012. I believe that this work has the power to be greatly inspirational both as a tool for raising awareness to these issues, and helping all of us feel a little less alone.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for any and all support.</p>

I was born with mild cerebral palsy which mainly affects my gait and balance. I have had multiple corrective surgeries in my life and have developed a consistent yoga practice.
Moving to NYC has been one of the great formative decisions of my life. I ride the NYC subway every day and navigate around without injury, largely invisible as a disabled person.
My project will also focus on my experience as a member of the LGBT community as a feminine-presenting individual. Stereotypes are a reality and so I am largely ""invisible"" as a member of this community as well.
We all have rich, multi-faceted stories that are not always visible at first glance. My goal is to compile an edited book proposal by Winter 2012. I believe that this work has the power to be greatly inspirational both as a tool for raising awareness to these issues, and helping all of us feel a little less alone.
Thank you so much for any and all support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>A Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Jennifer Derilo. I’m a writer who has been given a second opportunity to participate in the Voices of Our Nations Art (VONA) workshop, held on the UC Berkeley campus (June 24 to June 30), to work on a piece of memoir that I’ve struggled to write for almost a year now—ironically, since my first (last) attendance at VONA in June 2011. </p>
<p>The total cost of the workshop is $800, and I anticipate public transportation to be $100. Fortunately, I have friends in the Bay to help with housing, and I had a travel voucher from Southwest to cover airfare. At this point, I hope to offset any part of the trip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>
<br/>About VONA</h2>
<p>Founded in 1999 by Elmaz Abinader, Junot Díaz, Victor Diaz and Diem Jones, it is “only multi-genre workshop for writers of color in the nation,” providing support, community, and guidance to its participants by way of craft-focused classes taught by esteemed faculty. It is competitive to get in, and the workshops are small. (Mine has 11 participants.) But once a writer is accepted, the VONA environment is anything but competitive—it’s intensively supportive and heart-wrenchingly inspiring. </p>
<h2>
<br/>About the Writing Project</h2>
<p>In 2008, during my second year at the MFA program at Mills College, I began writing about my paternal grandfather, who was a survivor of the Bataan Death March, which took place in the Philippines during WWII. However, my advisor thought that the story was too big for me at the time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to April 2010. I experienced 21 days of low-grade fevers and night sweats. Months prior, I lost a lot of weight, my appetite, and energy. The lymph nodes in my neck and clavicle area were so enlarged.</p>
<p>At the end of April, I was officially diagnosed with Stage 2b Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and my grandfather’s ghost slipped back into my life. The start of the Bataan Death March was April 9, 1942. I started to see convergences. How could I map our traumas? How did he survive? How could I tap into that strength?</p>
<p>I started writing about him again. I tried writing about my experience with cancer, even though I kept very few written records. Really, I had to write about <em>us</em>. </p>
<p>This is an experimental creative nonfiction project tentatively titled, ""and to calm the waves of mismapping"". The project attempts to address living with and writing about historical and personal traumas, which accounts for its experimental structure, form, and content. The selection is non-traditional, making links among poetry, photos, imagined episodes, shifting points of view, and family stories.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Why this Matters</h2>
<p>I haven't written seriously since 2008 when I finished my Master's thesis. I certainly didn't write seriously when I became sick in 2009 and was diagnosed in 2010.</p>
<p>I was afraid.</p>
<p>This is the first <em>real </em>writing project that I’ve undertaken since getting sick and finishing treatments in January 2011.</p>
<p>I'm no longer afraid but <em>excited. </em>I want to share and finish this story at VONA. I want to make my second chance there count. </p>

Brenda intends on spending up to 30 days as a volunteer law professor and researcher in Ethiopia. For background, last spring Brenda and Matt lived and taught law in rural Ethiopia among large birds, insects, feral cats and dogs, hyenas, and camels. Among many things Brenda learned, she discovered one of her passions is being an educator. Now she would like to return in a volunteer capacity, following up on teaching and research/writing. Her work is intended to help strengthen the culture of reading and writing in Ethiopia. (More detail below.)</p>
<div>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important;"">
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000099; font-size: medium;"">The Need &amp; What You Get: </span></strong>All of the funds will go directly to travel costs, volunteer work, and research for up to one month in Ethiopia. Any excess money will assist with living expenses during the time Brenda takes off work to write her paper. </p>
<p>The rough <strong>budget</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip travel &amp; transportation $1,550</li>
<li>Accommodation (while in transit) $100 </li>

<p><strong><span style=""color: #000099; font-size: medium;"">The Impact:</span> </strong>This travel, teaching, learning, research, and essay will not only impact Brenda on a professional and personal level, but it will also help at least <strong>69 students and 5 faculty members</strong>. The impact will likely reach beyond those numbers because Brenda hopes to work with additional students (such as the first year legal research methods class) and with other faculty and staff. The students will benefit from continuity and further expertise. The faculty will gain additional writing and leadership skills.</p>
<p>Brenda hopes to pursue a teaching and research career in higher education, so this project will help her realize that goal. (Both Brenda and Matthew have been searching for employment since Nov. 2011, and Brenda started consulting in late Feb. 2012. They are currently unable to fund this trip on their own accord, although they will contribute to this campaign from their own funds.)  </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #000099; font-size: medium;"">Other Ways You Can Help:</span> </strong>Please <strong>share</strong> this campaign with friends, colleagues, anybody interested in education, research, writing, Ethiopia, and/or Africa. Also, we would appreciate receiving any <strong>feedback, information or tips</strong> on this campaign and/or useful resources.</p>
<p><strong>MORE INFO:</strong> The <strong>volunteer work</strong> is proposed to center on Brenda <strong>teaching </strong>her first year legal research students who are now in their second year of law school. She will help them with further research and polish the papers they wrote for her course last year. Brenda's desire to volunteer stems from observations that the university's resources are limited. Also, she's received requests from students to return. Local teaching staff receive a small salary, and often must take second jobs. Ex-pat staff have recently tended to teach on a short-term basis. So, it is challenging for the College of Law to recruit and retain qualified teachers. The students, consequently, have a revolving door of instructors who may or may not be invested in the students' education. </p>
<p>Brenda hopes to also <strong>train </strong>the local editors of the nascent <em>Haramaya Law Review,</em> which she helped get off the ground last year. The culture of publication within the Ethiopian academic community is slowly growing. The current Editor of the <em>HLR, </em>Brooke Glass-O'Shea, has asked Brenda to train the local editors on topics such as clear academic writing. This will hopefully assist the local editors in taking over and ownership of the <em>HLR</em>. </p>
<p>Brenda's other purpose is to conduct <strong>independent research</strong>. The goal is to examine legal education and produce an <strong>introspective paper</strong>. She intends on comparing her experiences. She will ask and write about questions like: How do the students interact with me? How do I engage them and teach differently? What is the change in my perception of Ethiopian culture and education? Brenda hopes to make the essay personal and creative, appealing to a general audience. The paper will be available online at no cost once she has finished it. We are currently looking for publishers. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have landed a coveted contributor’s spot in this summer's Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, located in Ripton, Vermont. This year’s conference is from August 15 through August 25. The opportunity allows me to study with celebrated authors and the chance to speak with agents, editors, and publishers.  I now must find a way to fund my tuition, room, and board, which is $2,725. Of course, this is not including travel. I have some money, but not all. Any amount--small or large--will help! I would have the needed amount if 250 people gave $10 each. </p>
<p>I am a recent graduate of the creative writing program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For my dissertation, I completed a novel which many established writers believe is promising. I also hold an MFA from Southampton College.</p>
<p>I lecture in the English Program and the Women’s Studies Program at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville.  I have published some short fiction and poetry in small journals.</p>
<p>Bread Loaf is a wonderful opportunity for me! I believe that it will enhance my education as a writer and as a teacher of writing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Tuition for Bread Loaf this year is $1,790. The room and board is $935. I have some money, but I need more for the conference cost and travel (about $400 for travel). The total overall cost is $3,125.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will still use the money to go to Bread Loaf. I will beg everyone I know, and everyone I don't know (hence, this campaign), in order to go. I will get to Bread Loaf!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a student in Nebraska and in Southampton, NY, I have had my share of workshops, but I excel in workshops. My work in classes have turned into polished, published pieces. My attendance in a master class at the Nebraska Summer Writers’ Conference in 2011 has helped me produce a novel draft that impressed not only the other attendees, but the workshop teacher who encouraged me to apply to Bread Loaf!</p>
<p> I really believe that I will come out of Bread Loaf with the means to revise my novel into a publishable manuscript.</p>

<p><span><strong>I’ve written two books that I want to get into your hands<br/></strong></span><span>This project will fund the first two books in <strong>The 52 Series</strong>, a collection of six books that helps you understand, grow, and practice the Christian faith. The first two books are</span></p>
<p><span><em>52 Ways to Grow Your Faith      </em></span><em>52 Reasons to Believe</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>""If faith is supposed to be exciting and life changing . . .</strong><br/>. . . why does mine feel dull and insignificant?"" Many ask that question, but few get an answer. <strong>The</strong> <strong>52 Series</strong> responds in a bold, practical, and strategic way. Since God loves us and is for us, faith can be a fun adventure, one we’re free to enjoy, not one requiring us to perform. This series interacts with common questions, offers next steps, and simplifies complex ideas.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>Who are these books for?<br/></strong></span>Many want a rich, active faith, but feel ill-equipped to achieve that goal. <strong>The 52 Series</strong> is the perfect resource for new Christians, spiritual seekers, or seasoned believers. Whether you’re taking your first steps, gaining a big-picture overview of Christianity,  or looking to refresh your faith, this series will help. They’re great books to read on your own, but they're even better when read and discussed in a group.</p>
<p><span>About <strong><em>52 Ways to Grow Your Faith</em></strong> (Connect With God in a Busy, Noisy World)<br/></span><em><img alt=""52 Ways to grow Your Faith cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gpfarah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/52WaystoGrowYourFaith_cover.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>52 Ways to Grow Your Faith </em>will<em> </em>liberate you from thinking the only way to grow spiritually requires reading and praying. Instead, learn to grow spiritually while walking, driving, or working out. <em>52 Ways to Grow Your Faith</em> will jump-start a stalled faith, provide a road map for a new faith, and energize an active faith. Use this resource with friends in a weekly study group or on your own--but get ready to try new ways to grow your faith.</p>
<p><span>About<strong> <em>52 Reasons to Believe</em></strong> (Concise thoughts on the Christian faith)<br/></span><em><img alt=""52 Reasons to Believe cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gpfarah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/52ReasonstoBelieve_cover.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>52 Reasons to Believe </em>is a devotional theology book, offering biblical teaching on foundational truths of the Christian faith. Not only will you learn what the Bible says about itself and God, but you’ll discover how they relate to contemporary life. Learn on your own or with a group, but expect to develop a stronger faith with <em>52 Reasons to Believe.</em></p>
<p><span><strong>Why self publish?<br/></strong></span>As the changing economy forces the publishing industry to morph, first-time authors face a growing challenge. If you’re not already well-known (i.e., have a significant ‘platform’), publishers are less likely to invest in you. It’s more economically feasible for them to publish a known commodity than the little guy. Well this little guy refuses to give up. That’s where you come in.</p>
<p><span><strong>How are you using the money?<br/></strong></span>All funds will pay for professional editing, proofreading, layout, design, and printing for <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">both</span> books. Any money raised over the goal amount will be seed money to publish books 3 &amp; 4 in the series and fund some marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Anything else we should know?<br/></strong>I believe in these books! I love the series and am excited to present the first two books, but I need your help. I can write the books, and I’ve got people ready to edit, design, and print the books. But none of this happens without your financial support and your willingness to spread the word about this project. You’re free to support at any dollar amount, but don’t miss the fun incentives for specific dollar amounts.</p>

52 Ways to Grow Your Faith      52 Reasons to Believe


""If faith is supposed to be exciting and life changing . . .. . . why does mine feel dull and insignificant?"" Many ask that question, but few get an answer. The 52 Series responds in a bold, practical, and strategic way. Since God loves us and is for us, faith can be a fun adventure, one we’re free to enjoy, not one requiring us to perform. This series interacts with common questions, offers next steps, and simplifies complex ideas.


Who are these books for?Many want a rich, active faith, but feel ill-equipped to achieve that goal. The 52 Series is the perfect resource for new Christians, spiritual seekers, or seasoned believers. Whether you’re taking your first steps, gaining a big-picture overview of Christianity,  or looking to refresh your faith, this series will help. They’re great books to read on your own, but they're even better when read and discussed in a group.
About 52 Ways to Grow Your Faith (Connect With God in a Busy, Noisy World)52 Ways to Grow Your Faith will liberate you from thinking the only way to grow spiritually requires reading and praying. Instead, learn to grow spiritually while walking, driving, or working out. 52 Ways to Grow Your Faith will jump-start a stalled faith, provide a road map for a new faith, and energize an active faith. Use this resource with friends in a weekly study group or on your own--but get ready to try new ways to grow your faith.
About 52 Reasons to Believe (Concise thoughts on the Christian faith)52 Reasons to Believe is a devotional theology book, offering biblical teaching on foundational truths of the Christian faith. Not only will you learn what the Bible says about itself and God, but you’ll discover how they relate to contemporary life. Learn on your own or with a group, but expect to develop a stronger faith with 52 Reasons to Believe.
Why self publish?As the changing economy forces the publishing industry to morph, first-time authors face a growing challenge. If you’re not already well-known (i.e., have a significant ‘platform’), publishers are less likely to invest in you. It’s more economically feasible for them to publish a known commodity than the little guy. Well this little guy refuses to give up. That’s where you come in.
How are you using the money?All funds will pay for professional editing, proofreading, layout, design, and printing for both books. Any money raised over the goal amount will be seed money to publish books 3 & 4 in the series and fund some marketing.
Anything else we should know?I believe in these books! I love the series and am excited to present the first two books, but I need your help. I can write the books, and I’ve got people ready to edit, design, and print the books. But none of this happens without your financial support and your willingness to spread the word about this project. You’re free to support at any dollar amount, but don’t miss the fun incentives for specific dollar amounts.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>My name is Isabel Lederman and I am a recent graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz. My studies of creative writing have lead me to my passion of bookarts and self-publishing.I received my B.A in creative writing with a concentration in poetry. I also graduated with Univeristy Honors and Department Honors. In order to graduate with my major I had to create a handmade book with my own poetry as my final thesis project. My passion is bookarts and typography.A year ago I was accepted to study at Trinity College in Dublin through an exchange program. While abroad my poetry was published in Icarus and Wordlegs. </p>
<p>Although I had been living in Santa Cruz before my departure to study at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, I was born and grew up in Los Angeles, California. Coming from a post-pedestrian culture, where the means of transportation is the automobile, arriving in Dublin became a sensation of a freedom I had never before experienced. I experienced what it felt like to enter newness, and my mind began to break down my new surroundings into plans, determined excursions of how to traverse the city streets. At first I paid no attention to my surroundings, for I was more invested in how to get from place to place. Eventually moving through the city became more challenging, certain streets were not listed, and the struggle to find my way around the city exploded a wave of nostalgia and homesickness within me. Yet these thoughts of home were forced to pass because I had to keep re-entering the world by getting around on foot. </p>
<p>Traversing the streets activated a movement of empowerment and liberation. When I stopped thinking of Los Angeles and nostalgic aspects of home, my walking throughout the city became my way to read Dublin’s history and observe the culture and current political affairs. Walking the city streets as a way to experience the city, as well as encountering a double consciousness, attained through a tactile and psychic knowing of urban identity extends itself to the notion of what it means to be a woman in a country such as Ireland. My creative project re-claims the streets by re-envisioning the woman flâneur, highlighting important streets such as Moore Street. The situationist psychogeography recognizes the emotional and behavioural effects of the physical environment on the people that interact with it, thus further complicating the definition of geography by stating that geographical environment is constructed beyond the natural environment as geography is gendered and produces genders. The best way for me to re-claim the streets of Dublin is to return and continue my research so I can self-publish this story.</p>
<p>The book I am working on titled ""My Only Love, My City Street"" is a mixed genres project called “Walking Through Dublin: Urban Poetics and Psychogeography” that creatively assembles nonlinear narratives in Dublin, Ireland by rewriting the nation’s historical and urban identity. Each particular narrative explores a specific city street within Dublin, allowing the characters to reveal the urban expansion as well as the sociological and cultural exchanges that shape Ireland’s traditions. The narratives walk through time, outlining the wanderings of marginalized migrants, and revealing issues of religion, philosophy, landscape, and urban planning. </p>
<p>City streets become palimpsests: repositories of history as well as the sites of self-understanding. The result of public contexts delivers the broad cultural and historical information of Dublin, Ireland through different time periods. The private context can hopefully address the reader directly through the thoughts of the multiple narrators, and my own personal attitude on the subject. Through a blending of these contexts, this project encourages travel and understandings of worldwide cultural and economic policies.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I want to make this self-publishing venture a success and I need your help! My goal is to raise $12,000 in order to contribute to my travel, research and living expenses for the next twelve months in Dublin, Ireland. My goal to raise the money will also help me fund the first edition of 50 handbound, self illustrated and designed books. </p>
<p>Basic self publishing costs include editing, various website registration costs and legal fees. Other costs will go for materials, campaign fees and printing fees. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal I will continue to work on the project and supplement required funds in other ways such as part-time work. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My intention with this project is to contribute and connect with other campaigns such as Save Moore Street, going on currently to protect and preserve a historic street in Dublin. My hopes with focusing on cities and reclaiming the situationist mentality will inspire other authors and activists to create similar campaigns and projects. My book ""My Only Love, My City Street"" invites pedestrians to reconnect with their cultural and historical surroundings.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I had this idea to create a cleanse business <a href=""http://www.luminositycleanse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Luminosity Cleanse"">(www.luminositycleanse.com)</a>. It was based loosely on a cleanse I had been making for myself periodically over the past few years. I didn't have a concrete plan, but it felt like a good idea. So I contacted a bunch of local friends and asked if they'd be willing to let me test out my idea on them. To my surprise, 10 of them said yes! And, they LOVED it! About 1/2 way through the ""test"" week, other people started contacting me, wondering when the next cleanse would be. So I planned another one and 10 more people signed up! About 1/2 way through that week, more people were contacting me... and that's pretty much the way it's been these last few months. </p>
<p>I started this business out of my home, with my trusty Vitamix and a borrowed juicer. Within a week, I had my own juicer and within a month, I began sub-leasing commercial kitchen space to accommodate the demand for this growing business. </p>
<p>Luminosity Cleanse blossomed out of my passion for helping and encouraging people to live a healthier, more full life. Nothing is more rewarding to me than seeing and hearing from people who feel alive and vibrant after a week of nurturing themselves on a cleanse. I am ready to share this cleanse on a much larger scale!</p>
<p>What I Need in Order to Grow</p>
<p>I have reached a point where my business will not be able to keep up with the momemtum it has generated until I open my own kitchen. I have outgrown the shared kitchen space, and I am in the process of putting a team in place to help me keep up with the local demand, and also to reach a broader audience. </p>

<h3>What it is!<br/>
</h3> <p>The potty training age is now an average of 3 years old in the US! Help 
me reverse this trend back to the average of 18 months (what it was in 
1957, before disposable diapers) by communicating to our kiddos that 
they were BORN READY, are fully CAPABLE of using the potty, and that it 
can be fun to have a potty routine in their home.</p>
<p><b>The world has been waiting for a potty training board book that actually helps solidify the process! (And one that spans ages as early as 6 months and up.)</b><br/></p>
<p>I'm Andrea Olson and I've taught infant potty training (EC) and non-coercive potty training for the past 5 years at Go Diaper Free through my books and podcast...and throughout this and ECing two of my own babies from birth <b>I have NEVER found a potty training board book that provides ALL of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>gives the message that children are capable of going to the potty, from an early age<br/>
</li>
<li>doesn't include pictures of diapers, or the question of ""should I pee in my diaper or not?""</li>
<li>doesn't teach children it's okay to pee on the floor or in their pants<br/>
</li>
<li>doesn't give the message that children should ""wait til they're ready"" (a message created by a Pampers advocate and pediatrician just two years after disposable diapers hit the market - and has doubled our potty training age!)<br/>
</li>
<li>teaches the actual steps of going to the potty</li>

Thanks to all our backers!!!!
xx Andrea, author

What it is!
 The potty training age is now an average of 3 years old in the US! Help 
me reverse this trend back to the average of 18 months (what it was in 
1957, before disposable diapers) by communicating to our kiddos that 
they were BORN READY, are fully CAPABLE of using the potty, and that it 
can be fun to have a potty routine in their home.
The world has been waiting for a potty training board book that actually helps solidify the process! (And one that spans ages as early as 6 months and up.)
I'm Andrea Olson and I've taught infant potty training (EC) and non-coercive potty training for the past 5 years at Go Diaper Free through my books and podcast...and throughout this and ECing two of my own babies from birth I have NEVER found a potty training board book that provides ALL of the following:

gives the message that children are capable of going to the potty, from an early age

doesn't include pictures of diapers, or the question of ""should I pee in my diaper or not?""
doesn't teach children it's okay to pee on the floor or in their pants

doesn't give the message that children should ""wait til they're ready"" (a message created by a Pampers advocate and pediatrician just two years after disposable diapers hit the market - and has doubled our potty training age!)

teaches the actual steps of going to the potty
has humor appropriate for the ages of 6 month-3 years old
makes pottying ""normal"" from 6 months to 3 years old (or older, gasp!).
This campaign will raise funds to get my board book (which is already *fully illustrated* by a professional artist, written by me, edited, and completely ready to print) printed, shipped, and distributed for sale in major bookstores, on Amazon, and on my own websites.By supporting this campaign YOU will not only get a great potty training board book, but you will also help 1,000s of other moms and dads give their children a tool that is fun, engaging and educational about making potty a normal part of everyday life, whether they practice Elimination Communication or are potty training their toddler.   What I Need & What You Get I need a total of $8,000 to complete the production of this book. Again, it is already fully illustrated and written/edited (which has cost over $500 of my own money) and is fully ready to go to print.
The $8,000 needed will pay for:

$5,000 printing costs, ISBN #, barcode, shipping, and duties
$2,000 distribution, PR, and book events
$1,000 marketing, advertising, and promotion.

If I surpass my goal, I will produce more books and use them to supply 
our nation's libraries and low income parents with this resource as an outreach project.
What YOU will get!The perks involved in this campaign are fun and practical. You will, at the very least, get a beautifully-illustrated, 20 page, 6""x6"" board book (or multiple books, depending on the perk), and some of you will get original artwork, bookmarks...and other exciting perks may be added toward the end of the campaign as well.
  The impact this book will have on the WORLD...
I have successfully brought two books on infant and toddler potty training into the world, organically and over time, and have helped over 5,000 families reduce or elimination their dependence upon diapers.With this book, I want to support our babies and children in reaching this core competency at appropriate ages (my goal is for children to feel confident finishing potty training at around 18-20 months, after knowing the potty since the child's first 6 months of life) with gentle, clear modeling through the character and the character's friend, Bear.The impact on the WORLD is unlimited! Once we change the status quo, more babies and parents will avoid the struggles and medical issues associated with late or difficult potty training, and we can get on with what really matters, more quickly, such as instilling self-esteem, pride in oneself, and an increase in confidence, mobility, and self-care...all results of early potty training!

</h3> <p></p>Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, and Brooklyn, <b><a href=""http://www.theculuturalgutter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Cultural Gutter</a></b>
 was founded in May, 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide thoughtful and
 provocative writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had ten 
editors in two countries and five cities write on comics, romance, genre
 movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, video games, and porn. And 
in all that time we paid our writers, both editors and Guest Stars. 
Then we lost our operations funding grant in 2013, but a small, rag-tag band of 
donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our 
commitment to paying writers for their work. <br/><br/>The Gutter offers something unusual.

disreputable art and media. If you donate or support the campaign by

particular take on disreputable art; and help support paying writers for

out all our perks, and, thanks to everyone's help, we kept going.  With 
your help, we can do it again. The Cultural Gutter's survival does 
depend on Gutterthon.   Risks & Challenges We recognize that it's a difficult time for creators of all kinds, that platforms are valued more than content. But we believe with your help, we can do our little part to keep the Gutter flowing with quality writing.

<p><span>It is known that massage and bodywork is good for the <em>body</em>, that it can alleviate physical stress and tension, decrease physical discomforts, aches and pains.

A Dual Path calls us to Awaken the Spirit, to experience life as both meaningful and sacred.
I've been writing my book for 3 years and I'm currently working on integrating a sense of the sacred into the design of the book. This challenge mirrors the challenge we are all faced with: the integration of the sacred into our life. 
In both cases, it can be done:



What shapes us? What is it that creates our patterns of physical holding, and patterns of behavior, thought and emotion? We are shaped by our life experiences, our memories and our daily responsibilities. These give shape to, and create disturbances in, our energetic matrix, and those of us who move forward into life with disruptions in our energetic matrix often feel lost and as if our life lacks meaning.
This book is groundbreaking because it offers a means to clear our energetic matrix and in so doing, experience ourselves and our daily life as sacred. 

My name is Monique Illona and I'm the developer of Sacred Bodywork™ and author of A Dual Path: Sacred Practices and Bodywork. I'm an award winning and Nationally Certified massage & bodywork professionals. Along with my husband, Blane, I have owned my business, Hand in Hand Massage, since 1991.
The Book
The book is almost 200 pages. I'm working with my designer, Nancy Wolinski, on the interior design so that every aspect of this project is beautiful, meaningful and sacred.

The book is the training manual for Sacred Bodywork™. 

It is also a book for any one who has ever asked...
Is this it, or is there more to life?
and for any one who has ever felt...
Tired of old habits and patterns you can neither shake nor break.
A Dual Path is intended for anyone ready for transformation, including bodywork professionals who want to elevate their profession to a true art and their clients who want to experience massage as a feast for the soul.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to you so that I can get funds to hire an editor for my first debut novel - <b><i>The Third Sign</i></b>.  It is an <i>apocalyptic techno-thriller</i> with a Native American twist.  It's going to be a really cool book to read and also will open your eyes to the scary stuff out there that could happen to us in America and around the world, with great morals in the stories.  </p>
<p>You are funding the ""<i><b>Book 1: The Day of the Red Skies</b>""</i> of what I intend to be a <i>Trilogy </i>for The Third Sign.</p>
<p>I am about 75% done with this book before editing, and my goal is to finish the book by the end of October and send it to an editor.  </p>
<p>I will be publishing my book independently, and I am choosing to go the 'crowd-funding' route so that I can get more people involved and allow people to own a piece of my work.  So, my work gets published, and you as a contributor will have a sense of ownership of my work, and your name will be acknowledged in my book for as little as $10 in contribution (Please look at the perks).</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Please contribute as generously as you can, and own a piece of a future bestselling novel!  Thank you!</span><br/></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Allistaire Myaing (<i>Author</i>)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>Here is the breakdown of what I will need the money for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>A good editor costs anywhere between $2,500 to $5,000 for a novel of about 75,000 words or roughly about 250 pages long, and will also need to put in additional funds for publishing and advertising and marketing.  My goal is to raise $2,700 or more, which will translate to roughly $2,500 after paying fundraising fees to Indiegogo.  This will allow me to get a decent editor, and I will get a chance to publish it on time.  I feel that this book needs to be in people's hands so that they can get the lessons I am trying to point out in the book.</li>
<li>All of the funds I collect will go towards getting this book published on time.<br/><br/><b>What you will get (The Perks):</b>
</li>
<li>You will get to read the first 8 chapters of my book (unedited version) in PDF eBook format for as little as $5 in contributions, and your name will get acknowledged in my book for as little as $10.  For $25, you will get a signed copy of my book in paperback as soon as it gets published (ETA is February 2014).</li>

Hi Folks,
I'm reaching out to you so that I can get funds to hire an editor for my first debut novel - The Third Sign.  It is an apocalyptic techno-thriller with a Native American twist.  It's going to be a really cool book to read and also will open your eyes to the scary stuff out there that could happen to us in America and around the world, with great morals in the stories.  
You are funding the ""Book 1: The Day of the Red Skies"" of what I intend to be a Trilogy for The Third Sign.
I am about 75% done with this book before editing, and my goal is to finish the book by the end of October and send it to an editor.  
I will be publishing my book independently, and I am choosing to go the 'crowd-funding' route so that I can get more people involved and allow people to own a piece of my work.  So, my work gets published, and you as a contributor will have a sense of ownership of my work, and your name will be acknowledged in my book for as little as $10 in contribution (Please look at the perks).
Please contribute as generously as you can, and own a piece of a future bestselling novel!  Thank you!
Sincerely,
Allistaire Myaing (Author)




What I Need & What You Get
Here is the breakdown of what I will need the money for:

A good editor costs anywhere between $2,500 to $5,000 for a novel of about 75,000 words or roughly about 250 pages long, and will also need to put in additional funds for publishing and advertising and marketing.  My goal is to raise $2,700 or more, which will translate to roughly $2,500 after paying fundraising fees to Indiegogo.  This will allow me to get a decent editor, and I will get a chance to publish it on time.  I feel that this book needs to be in people's hands so that they can get the lessons I am trying to point out in the book.
All of the funds I collect will go towards getting this book published on time.What you will get (The Perks):

You will get to read the first 8 chapters of my book (unedited version) in PDF eBook format for as little as $5 in contributions, and your name will get acknowledged in my book for as little as $10.  For $25, you will get a signed copy of my book in paperback as soon as it gets published (ETA is February 2014).
You have my commitment to get the book out, even if I don't reach my goal.  I will get whatever level of editing I can get, and still get the book out by February 2014.  If I run into any delays, I will keep you posted.

1)
While in residence at the week long workshop, I will continue the writing on
my current poetry manuscript, “Anchoring the Compass” as well as producing new
poems. This manuscript furthers the artistic exploration I began in my solo
performance play, “Ungrateful Daughter: One Black Girls Story of being Adopted
into a White Family . . . that aren’t Celebrities.” (awarded Zellerbach
Foundation, James Irvine Foundation grants).  This play examined my
relationship to my Black and Filipino ancestry and the many historical secrets
as a result of being adopted by white parents. “Anchoring the Compass”
manuscript extends many of the themes I began to explore in my play, including
the complexity of a hybrid, diasporic identity when one does not know one’s
birth family history nor has any visible, mirrored link to a particular
ancestral homeland. Many of the pieces in “Anchoring” explore how searching,
speculation, story-making, mythology and invention all play a part in the
development of the constantly moving, changing identities of adopted bodies.
Reproductive justice, family preservation and the resistance to human
trafficking are strong threads in this work.<br/><br/><strong>Post workshop – I play to extend my
trip for one week: </strong><br/>
2) to
continue my research on diasporic black adoptee communities. This research is a
major part of the work that is informing my new play in development, “Side
Effects”.  “Side Effects” is a theater/ dance / visual art project that
explores the personal and geopolitical impacts of inter-country and domestic
transracial adoption on Black, Asian and multi-racial bodies of color. This
multidisciplinary theater project speaks to the phenomenon of global adoption,
and adds to conversations around concepts of multiple diasporas and the
dispersal of bodies of color for white consumption, under the guise of
multiculturalism and philanthropy.<br/><br/>
3) to
make connections to other adoptee artists working, writing and performing in London for potential
transnational artistic collaboration.<br/><br/><strong> WHY THIS MATTERS:</strong><br/>
This
work is an act of resistance. The act of voicing back to the decades of having
our narratives written by other people is a critical step in these fields. This
manuscript adds to the short lineage of black diasporic women who have been
adopted across race and are producing poetic / theatrical / creative work. The
work of Adoptee poetics / adoptee pedagogy speak directly to the phenomenon of
global adoption, and the dispersal of bodies of color for white labor and

If you are interested in why I switched sites - Please read this.WHY
I’M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP:I’m
honored to have been invited to attend the CALLALOO Literary Journal’s 2014
Writing Workshop hosted by the Black Cultural Archives, in collaboration with
The Equiano Centre at University College London, England. I have a chance to
work with esteemed poet Gregory Pardlo and be in residence with fiction writers Maaza Mengiste and Jackson Brown, as well as 20 other multi-genre writers selected from
an international pool!CALLALOO is unable to provide
funding support for the writers who are attending, so we are asked to pay our
own transportation, room and board. Your individual support ensures my ability
to attend this workshop, to further my artistic development and to collaborate
with other artists from across the globe. WHAT I WILL BE WORKING ON:
1)
While in residence at the week long workshop, I will continue the writing on
my current poetry manuscript, “Anchoring the Compass” as well as producing new
poems. This manuscript furthers the artistic exploration I began in my solo
performance play, “Ungrateful Daughter: One Black Girls Story of being Adopted
into a White Family . . . that aren’t Celebrities.” (awarded Zellerbach
Foundation, James Irvine Foundation grants).  This play examined my
relationship to my Black and Filipino ancestry and the many historical secrets
as a result of being adopted by white parents. “Anchoring the Compass”
manuscript extends many of the themes I began to explore in my play, including
the complexity of a hybrid, diasporic identity when one does not know one’s
birth family history nor has any visible, mirrored link to a particular
ancestral homeland. Many of the pieces in “Anchoring” explore how searching,
speculation, story-making, mythology and invention all play a part in the
development of the constantly moving, changing identities of adopted bodies.
Reproductive justice, family preservation and the resistance to human
trafficking are strong threads in this work.Post workshop – I play to extend my
trip for one week: 
2) to
continue my research on diasporic black adoptee communities. This research is a
major part of the work that is informing my new play in development, “Side
Effects”.  “Side Effects” is a theater/ dance / visual art project that
explores the personal and geopolitical impacts of inter-country and domestic
transracial adoption on Black, Asian and multi-racial bodies of color. This
multidisciplinary theater project speaks to the phenomenon of global adoption,
and adds to conversations around concepts of multiple diasporas and the
dispersal of bodies of color for white consumption, under the guise of
multiculturalism and philanthropy.
3) to
make connections to other adoptee artists working, writing and performing in London for potential
transnational artistic collaboration. WHY THIS MATTERS:

<p><strong>Run Amok Books: Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Run Amok Books is a small independent press located in Princeton, New Jersey. We published our first book in the fall of 2016, and two more in 2017. In 2018 and 2019, we published 11 books in all. In a word, we are growing! And that is great news!</p>
<p>As we grow, so does our reputation. Each month, we find an increasing number of worthy submissions in our submissions in-box. True to our mandate, we strive to publish books that deserve to be published and that are routinely overlooked by the mainstream book industry.</p>
<p><strong><i>Lying Bastard </i>by Clint Margrave</strong></p>
<p>For an acquisitions editor, there is nothing quite as exciting as opening an e-mail and reading an intriguing book pitch, that one-sentence elevator pitch which, ideally, hooks the reader immediately. Intrigued and hooked is exactly how we felt at the Run Amok office the morning we opened the e-mail from Clint Margrave and read his pitch for <i>Lying Bastard</i>. Admittedly, the title caught our eye right away. So we read on to the short paragraph summary that followed. Needless to say, we loved the idea of the book, and after reading the first few pages, we were hooked. We snapped it up. Now 13 months later, here we are preparing for a rapidly approaching publication day.</p>
<p><strong>Our Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The challenge for us at Run Amok Books is that while our publication list has expanded with great books like Stealing The Scream, our budget has not. This has left us to find new and innovative ways to find funding, ways like crowdfunding and Indiegogo. So why do we need more funds? The truth is making books in this day and age can be done quite inexpensively with the right software and a little bit of know-how. At Run Amok Books, all the editing, formatting, and much of the design is done in-house by dedicated Run Amok staff, who volunteer countless hours to projects they passionately believe in. So in a word, book production can be done relatively inexpensively (not to be confused with effortlessly) when the right folks are involved. Marketing the book, on the other hand, requires specialized skills and money to pull it off. Oh, we can and do send out countless emails to newspaper and magazine reviewers, and to bloggers and book lovers. But in the end, placing a print or a digital ad costs money. Having our books listed at places like Net Galley costs a lot of money, but it's money well spent, as a listing on Net Galley virtually guarantees that a book will be reviewed/discussed/buzzed by book bloggers, an essential part of the promotional equation. Just to give you a sense of the costs involved, below is a list of the fees involved in a book promotion campaign similar to the one we have planned for <i>Lying Bastard</i>.</p>
<p>- print ad in book review magazines like Foreword Reviews and Broken Pencil: $475 - $1000</p>
<p>- listing on Net Galley book review site: $400</p>
<p>- social media campaign (twitter, facebook): $100 - $150</p>
<p>Total = $975 - $1,500</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise a portion of the marketing/promotional costs for <i>Lying Bastard</i> through crowdfunding. In order to give books like Clint's the exposure they deserve, we are asking for public support, for your help. Keep in mind that there are many deserving books, just like Clint's, out there, written by many talented people: it could be a friend, a family member, the girl that sits beside you in Lit Theory 101, or the guy clicking away on his laptop in your local coffee shop. We'd like to publish and promote as many of these books as possible. In order to do that, we're going to need additional funding. And that is where you come in.

<p><strong>Well-being is available to all and integrating it in modern life is essential for humanity.</strong><br/><br/>Most of us live in a fast-paced, constantly changing environment with a focus on surviving everyday stresses. The culture is largely one that often dismisses wellness when challenges arise and attaches guilt when it is prioritized.</p>
<p>The integrated nature of different dimensions of wellness is largely ignored so root causes of illness are not identified, often causing a life time of needless suffering for millions of people. Systems created with great intentions to support us, instead hold us prisoner. This is the real global pandemic of our time.</p>
<p><i>The Whole Human: Integrating wellness in modern life</i> is here to illuminate how it is all connected at an individual and societal level, how to integrate meaningful changes easily into your own modern life, and how together we can enact meaningful changes; integrating well-being directly into society.<br/><br/>My name is Luna Gladman and I am the author of <i>The Whole Human: Integrating Wellness in Modern Life</i>.</p>
<p>I wrote this book following an awakening time studying and practicing the ancient Indian holistic wellness medicine Ayurveda. It began an exciting and scary journey exploring aspects of wellness often ignored in today’s society. Believing that one’s well-being is for all, not just hippies in the Himalayas, I examined the current perceptions of wellness in our modern life, especially in healthcare, business, and education. Seeing that there are many pioneers leading the way to integrate wellness into modern life yet few integrating it in a holistic sense, I set out to build an integrated vision, combining ancient wisdom, modern trends, expert insights and of course my own perspective.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will remember and recognize the importance of acknowledging all aspects of yourself; in an individual and collective sense. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for shameless, intuitive, and natural well-being. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you experience for yourself what well-being means and reflect on what is really happening in today’s society that limits this potential we all already have.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about all dimensions of well-being and the impact this has for you as an individual and also for us as a society. You'll hear stories on what holistic well-being really means through lived experiences from a range of well-being advocates. Such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Roslyn Snyder</i>, a psychologist for 25 years who works directly with the, some of the most challenging cases in society, such as murderers, rapists and suicidal patients. I examine what accounts for her success and where society and systems are not working.</li>
<li>
<i>Ayu Puspita Dewi</i> broke through from years of mental and physical ill health to reconnect with herself and resolve challenging conflicts in her relationships that could have torn apart her family for life. We look at her perspective on the real root causes of ill-health and its connection with conflicts, highlighting the connected nature of living.</li>
<li>
<i>Dr Sundara Raman</i>, an experienced Ayurveda Doctor successfully treating patients from all over the world by applying ancient wisdom to some of the most complex and chronic diseases, challenging commonly held beliefs on what can and can not be treated.</li>
<li>
<i>Shikha Verma</i> sharing some of her knowledge on what it is like to weave genuine wellness directly into workforces in global companies.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>They and others are embracing different ways to bringing us back to our true nature, either in or outside current systems. You'll hear how this is impacting business and what we even think of as healthcare and education today.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to understand the connectivity of well-being within ourselves in a practical way and crucially with each other. We are not independent entities, our wellness is linked together as one collective wellness.<br/><br/><i>The Whole Human: Integrating Wellness in Modern Life</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to those ready to embrace well-being in their life and the visionaries in wellness who already know that wellness needs to be further integrated into our daily lives. I look at the way we do business, provide healthcare, and instill education in a new way; the wellness way.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The book is written into 3 parts:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>encompasses chapters 1-4.</p>
<p>This section re-connects and goes inward in a simple way, exploring who we really are and what well-being is actually all about. We’ll discuss how it’s all connected, simplify well-being, and learn about coming back to our natural state of well-being through the opposite of what we’re used to: less doing and more listening.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>encompasses chapters 5-7.</p>
<p>You’ve got to breakdown to breakthrough! This section challenges beliefs, cultures and values at the societal level; to look at ourselves and connections with others from a radically altered perspective, allowing us to truly humanize globally.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> encompasses chapters 8-11.</p>
<p>Re-align and get into flow! So we’re connected and humanized - what happens now? This section explores key areas of society impacted most by this altered perspective: healthcare, business and education. Finally, I bring it all together and establish next steps beyond reading this book.<br/> </p>

The culture is largely one that often dismisses wellness when challenges arise and attaches guilt when it is prioritized.
The integrated nature of different dimensions of wellness is largely ignored so root causes of illness are not identified, often causing a life time of needless suffering for millions of people. Systems created with great intentions to support us, instead hold us prisoner. This is the real global pandemic of our time.
The Whole Human: Integrating wellness in modern life is here to illuminate how it is all connected at an individual and societal level, how to integrate meaningful changes easily into your own modern life, and how together we can enact meaningful changes; integrating well-being directly into society.My name is Luna Gladman and I am the author of The Whole Human: Integrating Wellness in Modern Life.
I wrote this book following an awakening time studying and practicing the ancient Indian holistic wellness medicine Ayurveda. It began an exciting and scary journey exploring aspects of wellness often ignored in today’s society. Believing that one’s well-being is for all, not just hippies in the Himalayas, I examined the current perceptions of wellness in our modern life, especially in healthcare, business, and education. Seeing that there are many pioneers leading the way to integrate wellness into modern life yet few integrating it in a holistic sense, I set out to build an integrated vision, combining ancient wisdom, modern trends, expert insights and of course my own perspective.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will remember and recognize the importance of acknowledging all aspects of yourself; in an individual and collective sense. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for shameless, intuitive, and natural well-being. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you experience for yourself what well-being means and reflect on what is really happening in today’s society that limits this potential we all already have.In this book, you'll learn about all dimensions of well-being and the impact this has for you as an individual and also for us as a society. You'll hear stories on what holistic well-being really means through lived experiences from a range of well-being advocates. Such as...


Roslyn Snyder, a psychologist for 25 years who works directly with the, some of the most challenging cases in society, such as murderers, rapists and suicidal patients. I examine what accounts for her success and where society and systems are not working.

Ayu Puspita Dewi broke through from years of mental and physical ill health to reconnect with herself and resolve challenging conflicts in her relationships that could have torn apart her family for life. We look at her perspective on the real root causes of ill-health and its connection with conflicts, highlighting the connected nature of living.

Dr Sundara Raman, an experienced Ayurveda Doctor successfully treating patients from all over the world by applying ancient wisdom to some of the most complex and chronic diseases, challenging commonly held beliefs on what can and can not be treated.

Shikha Verma sharing some of her knowledge on what it is like to weave genuine wellness directly into workforces in global companies.

 
They and others are embracing different ways to bringing us back to our true nature, either in or outside current systems. You'll hear how this is impacting business and what we even think of as healthcare and education today.You will love this book if you want to understand the connectivity of well-being within ourselves in a practical way and crucially with each other. We are not independent entities, our wellness is linked together as one collective wellness.The Whole Human: Integrating Wellness in Modern Life is a nonfiction book that speaks to those ready to embrace well-being in their life and the visionaries in wellness who already know that wellness needs to be further integrated into our daily lives. I look at the way we do business, provide healthcare, and instill education in a new way; the wellness way.
The book is written into 3 parts:Part 1 encompasses chapters 1-4.
This section re-connects and goes inward in a simple way, exploring who we really are and what well-being is actually all about. We’ll discuss how it’s all connected, simplify well-being, and learn about coming back to our natural state of well-being through the opposite of what we’re used to: less doing and more listening.Part 2 encompasses chapters 5-7.
You’ve got to breakdown to breakthrough! This section challenges beliefs, cultures and values at the societal level; to look at ourselves and connections with others from a radically altered perspective, allowing us to truly humanize globally.Part 3 encompasses chapters 8-11.
Re-align and get into flow! So we’re connected and humanized - what happens now? This section explores key areas of society impacted most by this altered perspective: healthcare, business and education. Finally, I bring it all together and establish next steps beyond reading this book.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>At 3 p.m. on June 17, 1997, my Dad was shot and killed outside of the Roadhouse Pub in Peabody, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>He was 30, and I was six.<br/><br/>This May, I will turn 30. Instead of letting the weight of that fact bring me down, I want to take the opportunity to do some good.<br/><br/>So, this year I introduce my debut book, 30.<br/><br/>30 is not necessarily about the age. It’s about this moment in time that has been precluded, motivated, and made possible by every bit of life. The good, bad, and ugly.<br/><br/>Though the murder of my Dad was traumatic, I am not broken, and I am also not alone. That is what this book is about—not my Dad’s life and death, though you will come to learn as you read just how much I want to honor both. It’s about post-traumatic growth, mine and others, and the extreme potential that I’ve found within humans who have gone through shit.<br/><br/>Maybe in sharing these experiences and stories with you—of loss, tragedy, missteps, and even better yet, growth—you’ll find resonance and a little inspiration. Maybe it will simply offer you some comfort as you navigate a life all your own. And maybe, if you’ve been as moved as I have by the need to end gun violence in this country, you’ll learn about some of the best and most immediate ways you can get involved.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll read stories of mine and others I interviewed—from our traumas and hardships, to our baby steps, leaps, and bounds. You'll hear stories such as:<ul>
<li>The three very different ways my mother, sister, and I have been affected by, and grown from, the death of my father.</li>
<li>The moment that sparked one of America’s largest grassroots movement, led by Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.</li>
<li>The devastatingly random knifepoint attack and robbery of a dear old friend, and her path through post-traumatic growth.</li>
</ul> //<br/><br/>30 is a nonfiction book that speaks to those who have or continue to grow through something difficult in their life. It’s also for anyone who is or wants to get involved in gun sense efforts nationwide.<br/><br/>Following the successful funding of my presale campaign, I will make a personal donation to Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.<p> </p>

Her burning desire to use her story to create change, combined with her affinity for writing, turned into this passion project focused on real human stories.<br/><br/>Years ago, Breezy was too often intimidated by the gun sense movement and its (very real and necessary) focus on political change and activism. Without the financial means to support fundraising and campaign efforts, and with a fear of phone banks and picketing, she was left wondering if and how she could get involved.<br/><br/>Then, she met Greg Gibson who used his book and the story of his son’s murder as his platform.

<h3>Hocking Hills Day Hikes</h3>
<p>Some 2 million people visit southeast Ohio's Hocking Hills region every year, mostly to hike on the area's beautiful and varied trails. Yet no hiking guidebook exists -- until now. I'm proud to debut Hocking Hills Day Hikes (HHDH).</p>
<p>I'm Mary Reed; I'm the author of Hiking Ohio and Hiking West Virginia, as well as other books and magazine articles about outdoor adventure in the region. I'm also the owner of a small Athens, Ohio-based publishing company, Get Out! Publishing. With your help, you can find yourself holding a copy of Hocking Hills Day Hikes in summer 2019. The book, both eBook and print book, will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>25 trails in the Hocking Hills, from classics like Old Man's Cave, Rock House, and Cedar Falls, to some lesser-known trails on preserves like Christmas Rocks, Boch Hollow, and Butterfly Ridge.</li>
<li>Basic info on each hike, including trailhead directions, trail length, facilities, and more.</li>
<li>A brief description of what to expect from each hike.</li>
<li>A descriptive photo for each hike.</li>
<li>Easy-to-read trail maps for each trail, plus an overview map of trails in the region.</li>
<li>Basic info about other nearby hikes.</li>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
The Truth About Music is about how the music industry is evolving into a more artist-focused industry. With new music technology and ways to connect with people around the world, artists have more freedom than ever before and can build a successful career in music from the ground-up by staying ahead of new trends. 
My name is Kaitlyn Fox and I am the author of The Truth About Music. I wrote this book because I love music and am excited about the ways the music industry is changing and putting artists at its center.
My hope is that, in reading The Truth About Music, you will discover the ways in which the music industry is becoming more artist-focused. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for music, especially the 99 percent of artists who are working hard to build a career in music. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you break into the music industry and help the 99 percent of artists make their dreams come true.
In this book, you'll learn about what trends are in store for the music industry and how those trends are changing the industry. You'll hear stories such as...

How Steve Bogard helped pass the Music Modernization Act by performing a song in the courtroom. 
How the Music Fund is opening new opportunities for investment in artists. 
How Sarah Tudzin, a producer in LA, went from scrubbing toilets to producing the Hamilton musical soundtrack. 

You will love this book if you want to break into the music industry and don’t know how, want to know how the music industry is changing for both artists and songwriters, or if you’re a music consumer who wants to know how to best support the artists you love.
The Truth About Music is a nonfiction book that speaks to small artists and music consumers who want to look at the music industry and the future of music in a new way. 
The Book - The Truth About Music
The book is written in 3 parts.


Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. This section will walk readers through the history of the music industry as well as why this moment is setting up a major artist revolution.

Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. This section is all about what’s going on in the music industry today, including how artists are currently engaging with their audiences and what the gender climate looks like in the music industry on stage and behind the scenes. 

Part 3 contains chapters 7-10. This section proposes new ways the music industry may evolve in the coming years by highlighting how artists can more effectively own their rights and what new strategies are being developed to better serve new, low-tier artists.

<h2>My story</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Lori. I’ve been a storyteller all my life.  I began writing stories when I was 3 or 4, before I knew the alphabet by scribbling drawings in my journal.  Since then, I’ve been telling stories to millions of people to build iconic brands like Gap, Old Navy, and Google. Marketing is a form of storytelling that I fell in love with, but it’s always been a way to get closer to doing something that I’ve known I wanted to do - to write a book.  Stories have the power to bring together families and inspire others, which is what I hope my story does for you, a child, or your family in some way.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/138160/files/20131017054359-Little_headers_for_LUTW__TJ_Lubrano_2013.jpg?1382013839"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Why write this book?</h2>
<p>Fear often leads people to live comfortable lives instead of pushing them to pursue what they really love.  Working a 9-5 job was comfortable and gave me everything I needed in life. Writing this book however, scared me, and that’s how I knew I had to do it.  If what you’re doing doesn’t scare you, this may be a good place to reevaluate whether you’re pushing yourself enough and if there is true passion there. And so I hope in the process of creating this book, I give the message that it’s okay to dream, to be scared, and to possibly fail.</p>
<p>Growing up, my parents had to work long hours to provide for the basic necessities.  Financial problems became the root of many hostile arguments, and slowly tore at the fabric of our lives.  My dad worked  twelve hour shifts during the night and would sleep throughout the day until he had to go back to work.  He missed out on my life to provide me with one.  Eventually, things collapsed and we lost the home we grew up in as my parents struggled to pay the bills.  Reading became a sort of refuge and way to learn about the world, and to understand what it looked like to have a family full of love and open communication.  I saw images on TV and in books of parents reading to their children, and secretly longed to have this kind of relationship with my own parents.  The image of a child curled up on his or her father or mother’s lap while hearing an exciting and inspiring story is a symbol of the kind of family life that wasn’t possible for me growing up.  Thinking that my book might not only inspire others but possibly bring together families is what motivates me to bring this idea to life.  And one day, when I have a child of my own, I can’t wait to curl up with them and read this story.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;"">What is the book about?</span><br/></p>
<p>In a kingdom far away, lived people who use to be stars.  After hundreds of years, these people of the stars still have stardust in them which lights them up whenever they do something they love.  The story’s protagonist, a curious princess, discovers that in the process of doing what she loves, she not only lights up, but the world around her does too.  </p>
<p>I’ve read this story to hundreds of kids ages 4-11 years old.  Although children as young as 4 can understand the story, I believe it has a timeless message that can be read by all ages.  When I read the Giving Tree as a very young child, I loved it.  When I read it as an adolescent, I loved it.  And when I read it again as an adult, I still loved it.  In fact, each time I read it, it meant something new to me.  I believe “Lighting up the World” will have the same effect.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;"">How is this book unique?</span></h2>
<p>There are a few different reasons that explain why this book is unique including the inspirational nature, the illustrations, and the social aspect in the development process.</p>
<h4>Inspirational</h4>
<p>Ironically, in the process of making this book, I realized that doing something that lit me up helped reawaken old passions in others as well!  Artists who have been too busy with their day job started drawing again, others were inspired to quit their jobs to pursue something more meaningful, and hopefully the readers who read this will be inspired to do what they love throughout their lives.</p>
<h4>Passionate Artist and Art</h4>
<p>The illustrations and passion behind the art also make this book unique.  I knew I had found the right illustrator, not only when I saw her beautiful drawings but also when she told me her story.  TJ started her career in HR, but always had a love for art.  Eventually, she was worn down with her job to the point where she was getting sick.  TJ left her comfortable job to pursue a life she loves and has never looked back since.  Today she has garnered <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tjlubranosillustrations"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">over 900 followers of her work</a> and sold hundreds of her paintings some valued at over several hundred dollars!</p>
<h4>Socially Created by Kids</h4>
<p>This book was developed with the community of readers that I hope to inspire.  While doing the readings to children, I observed what worked and what didn’t (for you tech nerds who are many of my good friends, it’s similar to a product beta).  Unfortunately, many books don’t go through this process but like Guy Kawasaki, I wanted to involve the community that this was created for.  I also even engaged the kids further by having them choose the name of the princess and the color of the dress.  They even contributed illustrations of their own (a few that I will choose to publish)!  The kids that were involved in the making of this book were ages 4-6 and 7-11 and come from disadvantaged homes in San Francisco.  They belong to <a href=""http://www.portolafc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Family Connections</a>, a non-profit that creates amazing programs for individual development and foster better connections between a parent and child. If you choose, you will be able to donate a book to a child at <a href=""http://www.portolafc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Family Connections</a>, which I’ll personally deliver when I go back to read the published story to them.</p>
<p>More than just a book, Lighting up the World is about creating a community of people who are doing that - lighting up the world!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/138166/files/20131017054925-little_headers_for_LUTW__2_TJ_Lubrano_2013.jpg?1382014165"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Why do we need $4,500?</h2>
<p>While writing a book is free, actually publishing a book is rather expensive.  I'm paying artists and experts at professional rates to make sure this book is the highest quality it can be, and to ensure as many people as possible end up reading it. Contributing to this project goes directly towards my estimated production costs which include, developmental editing and copy editing ($500), cover art, book design and illustrations ($2,500), book marketing and incentives ($1,000), ebook distribution and formatting ($500).  TJ will have put in at least 5-6 months of work for this book once it's complete (and already has put in 3 months) and I want to be able to compensate her fairly.  </p>
<p>Check out the great perks for contributors including the e-Book, the Dusty the Dragon plush, and even custom art by TJ!</p>
<h2>Why do we need a stretch goal of $6,100?</h2>
<p>It is my and TJ’s hope that you all will be able to have a physical hardcover book in your hands and this can only be possible if we raise the stretch goal of $6,100!  </p>
<h4>Your contribution will go towards:</h4>
<p>Printing costs for the first run of the hardcover book ($1,300), Campaign shipping and fulfillment of orders ($300).</p>
<p>10% of all proceeds over our stretch goal will go directly to supporting the programs at <a href=""http://www.portolafc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Family Connections! </a></p>
<h2>When will I get the book?</h2>
<p>I’ve made great progress on Lighting up the World so far; I am in the process of having the book professionally edited, and TJ is well on her way with completing the illustrations for the story.  My goal is to be finished with the book and e-Book before Christmas and have the hardcover shipped to you by January 2014. This date may be pushed back due to the nature of the publishing process, but my promise is that I will update contributors on my progress and the anticipated ship date.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for reading this far and being part of the creation of this book and community.  When a child and parent sit down together or someone is inspired, it is due to your contribution.  To my family and friends, I cannot thank you enough for your support throughout this process.  All of the amazing things that have already manifested and will result from this simple idea could not have been possible without each and every one of you.  </p>

My story
Hi, I'm Lori. I’ve been a storyteller all my life.  I began writing stories when I was 3 or 4, before I knew the alphabet by scribbling drawings in my journal.  Since then, I’ve been telling stories to millions of people to build iconic brands like Gap, Old Navy, and Google. Marketing is a form of storytelling that I fell in love with, but it’s always been a way to get closer to doing something that I’ve known I wanted to do - to write a book.  Stories have the power to bring together families and inspire others, which is what I hope my story does for you, a child, or your family in some way.


Why write this book?
Fear often leads people to live comfortable lives instead of pushing them to pursue what they really love.  Working a 9-5 job was comfortable and gave me everything I needed in life. Writing this book however, scared me, and that’s how I knew I had to do it.  If what you’re doing doesn’t scare you, this may be a good place to reevaluate whether you’re pushing yourself enough and if there is true passion there. And so I hope in the process of creating this book, I give the message that it’s okay to dream, to be scared, and to possibly fail.
Growing up, my parents had to work long hours to provide for the basic necessities.  Financial problems became the root of many hostile arguments, and slowly tore at the fabric of our lives.  My dad worked  twelve hour shifts during the night and would sleep throughout the day until he had to go back to work.  He missed out on my life to provide me with one.  Eventually, things collapsed and we lost the home we grew up in as my parents struggled to pay the bills.  Reading became a sort of refuge and way to learn about the world, and to understand what it looked like to have a family full of love and open communication.  I saw images on TV and in books of parents reading to their children, and secretly longed to have this kind of relationship with my own parents.  The image of a child curled up on his or her father or mother’s lap while hearing an exciting and inspiring story is a symbol of the kind of family life that wasn’t possible for me growing up.  Thinking that my book might not only inspire others but possibly bring together families is what motivates me to bring this idea to life.  And one day, when I have a child of my own, I can’t wait to curl up with them and read this story.
What is the book about?

This book was developed with the community of readers that I hope to inspire.  While doing the readings to children, I observed what worked and what didn’t (for you tech nerds who are many of my good friends, it’s similar to a product beta).  Unfortunately, many books don’t go through this process but like Guy Kawasaki, I wanted to involve the community that this was created for.  I also even engaged the kids further by having them choose the name of the princess and the color of the dress.  They even contributed illustrations of their own (a few that I will choose to publish)!  The kids that were involved in the making of this book were ages 4-6 and 7-11 and come from disadvantaged homes in San Francisco.  They belong to Family Connections, a non-profit that creates amazing programs for individual development and foster better connections between a parent and child. If you choose, you will be able to donate a book to a child at Family Connections, which I’ll personally deliver when I go back to read the published story to them.
More than just a book, Lighting up the World is about creating a community of people who are doing that - lighting up the world!

Why do we need $4,500?
While writing a book is free, actually publishing a book is rather expensive.  I'm paying artists and experts at professional rates to make sure this book is the highest quality it can be, and to ensure as many people as possible end up reading it. Contributing to this project goes directly towards my estimated production costs which include, developmental editing and copy editing ($500), cover art, book design and illustrations ($2,500), book marketing and incentives ($1,000), ebook distribution and formatting ($500).  TJ will have put in at least 5-6 months of work for this book once it's complete (and already has put in 3 months) and I want to be able to compensate her fairly.  
Check out the great perks for contributors including the e-Book, the Dusty the Dragon plush, and even custom art by TJ!
Why do we need a stretch goal of $6,100?
It is my and TJ’s hope that you all will be able to have a physical hardcover book in your hands and this can only be possible if we raise the stretch goal of $6,100!  
Your contribution will go towards:
Printing costs for the first run of the hardcover book ($1,300), Campaign shipping and fulfillment of orders ($300).
10% of all proceeds over our stretch goal will go directly to supporting the programs at Family Connections! 
When will I get the book?
I’ve made great progress on Lighting up the World so far; I am in the process of having the book professionally edited, and TJ is well on her way with completing the illustrations for the story.  My goal is to be finished with the book and e-Book before Christmas and have the hardcover shipped to you by January 2014. This date may be pushed back due to the nature of the publishing process, but my promise is that I will update contributors on my progress and the anticipated ship date.



Gratitude
Thank you so much for reading this far and being part of the creation of this book and community.  When a child and parent sit down together or someone is inspired, it is due to your contribution.  To my family and friends, I cannot thank you enough for your support throughout this process.  All of the amazing things that have already manifested and will result from this simple idea could not have been possible without each and every one of you.  
I would also like to personally acknowledge the incredibly talented artists and changemakers who have worked hard to make this project come to life. These people include: TJ Lubrano (positively wonderful illustrator and person), Professor Holly Brady (Stanford professor on Self Publishing, developmental editor and consultant), Jori Pearsall (video producer, advisor, project motivator, all-around awesome guy), Pat Lugo (layout designer), Tina Tam (Education Director, Family Connections), MaryAnne Fleming (Head of the Board of Directors, Family Connections), as well as Vlasta Komorous-King and Adam Skaates (Toy Wonder Engineers!, IDEO), John Kokko (project advisor), Marcus St. Marcus (children’s book storywriter advisor), Amy Bender(amazing friend, motivator, editor), the adorable kids at Family Connections (my inspiration), Knox/Happy(indiegogo stars and cuties), and all my friends at SELP who have been inspiring and supportive. Thank you.

<h3><strong>Run Amok Books: Our Story</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.runamokbooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Run Amok Books</a> is a small independent press located in Princeton, New Jersey. We published our first book in the fall of 2016, and two more in 2017. This year, we are slated to publish 6 books. In a word, we are growing! And that is great news!</p>
<p>As we grow, so does our reputation. Each month, we find an increasing number of worthy submissions in our submissions in-box. True to our mandate, we strive to publish books that deserve to be published and that are routinely overlooked by the mainstream book industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<i>Stealing The Scream</i> by Theodore Carter</h3>
<p>For an acquisitions editor, there is nothing quite as exciting as opening and e-mail and reading an intriguing book pitch, that one-sentence elevator pitch which, ideally, hooks the reader immediately. Intrigued and hooked is exactly how we felt at the Run Amok office the morning we opened the e-mail from Theodore Carter and read his pitch for <i>Stealing The Scream</i>. So we read on to the short paragraph summary that followed. Who doesn't love an art heist story? A true, unsolved one no less. By this point, we had to read the book for ourselves, which we did in the weeks that followed. Needless to say, we loved it and we snapped it up. Now 10 months later, here we are preparing for a rapidly approaching publication day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Challenge</h3>
<p>The challenge for us at Run Amok Books is that while our publication list has expanded with great books like <i>Stealing The Scream</i>, our budget has not. This has left us to find new and innovative ways to find funding, ways like crowdfunding and Indiegogo. So why do we need more funds? The truth is making books in this day and age can be done quite inexpensively with the right software and a little bit of know-how. At Run Amok Books, all the editing, formatting, and much of the design is done in-house by dedicated Run Amok staff, who volunteer countless hours to projects they passionately believe in. In the case of <i>Stealing The Scream</i>, we even enlisted some outside help. We are indebted to Courtney Granner, who graciously and generously donated his time to creating a brilliant cover for the book. So in a word, book production can be done relatively inexpensively (not to be confused with effortlessly) when the right folks are involved. Marketing the book, on the other hand, requires specialized skills and money to pull it off. Oh, we can and do send out countless emails to newspaper and magazine reviewers, and to bloggers and book lovers. But in the end, placing a print or a digital ad costs money. Having our books listed at places like Net Galley costs a lot of money, but it's money well spent, as a listing on Net Galley virtually guarantees that a book will be reviewed/discussed/buzzed by book bloggers, an essential part of the promotional equation. Just to give you a sense of the costs involved, below is a list of the fees involved in a book promotion campaign similar to the one we have planned for <i>Stealing The Scream</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li>print ad in <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Foreword-Reviews/dp/B00HQ4C6RS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foreword Reviews Magazine</a></u>: $475 - $1000</li>
<li>digital ad in literary e-zines (such as <u><a href=""https://bookpage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BookPage</a></u>): $300 - $450</li>
<li>Listing on <u><a href=""https://www.netgalley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Net Galley</a></u> book review site: $450 - $700</li>
<li>Social media campaign (twitter, facebook): $100 - $150</li>
</ul>
<p>Total = $1,325 - 2,300</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise a portion of the marketing/promotional costs for <i>Stealing The Scream</i> through crowdfunding. In order to give books like Theodore's the exposure they deserve, we are asking for public support, for your help. Keep in mind that there are many deserving books, just like Theodore's, out there, written by many talented people: it could be a friend, a family member, the girl that sits beside you in Lit Theory 101, or the guy clicking away on his laptop in your local coffee shop. We'd like to publish and promote as many of these books as possible. In order to do that, we're going to need additional funding. And that is where you come in. Please consider supporting this promotional campaign, and when you do, choose a perk, our way of saying ""Thank You"" for your support.</p>

<p>After the campaign ends, Grant will be releasing a special thank you video on his YouTube Channel that includes the names of every backer in the credits.</p>

<h2>Stories of Queer Diaspora:</h2>
<h3>In March 2012, ten local LGBTQQ youth of color (ages 14-22) applied to take part in an 8-week series of writing workshops. The workshop series, as facilitated by <a href=""http://www.brownstargirl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha</strong></a>, takes place once a week from April–June in order to cultivate a welcoming space for local im/migrant and 1<sup>st</sup>generation youth to write, reclaim, and proudly articulate their experiences.</h3>
<p>I initially created this project as apart of the <a href=""http://queerculturalcenter.org/NQAF/panel/creating-queer-community/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creating Queer Community</a> Program in July 2011. That program involved a 3 month grant writing workshop and application process. As a result, 'Stories of Queer Diaspora' was selected in the Fall of 2011 to be apart The 15th Annual National Queer Arts Festival and was awarded $500 by the Queer Cultural Center. That entire $500 award covered the cost of booking our showcase venue, The Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts. </p>
<p>Since then, I have dedicated the last six months to additional fundraising efforts. I conducted a letter writing campaign (which allowed me to raise $200 to pay for the video editor and flyer design), successfully completed a 4 month <a href=""http://www.genv.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youth Venture</a> program, and have also tried applying to numerous arts grants. I have engaged in all of these efforts while simultaneously organizing logistics for the workshop series, outreaching to youth programs, interviewing and also selecting the youth participants. This, on top of working full time, acting as a mentor to a Oakland migrant youth collective, and also taking community college classes part time has kept me actively engaged throughout the past year.</p>
<p>Overall, I have invested energy into this project because I believe young people deserve mentorship and compensation for their time, development, and artistic growth. So far, I have been paying for the workshop costs out of my own pocket which has included: food, bart tickets for all the youth, and printing costs. Although I have not been successful in receiving too many additional funds since that first grant, I am still optimistic that I will raise the remaining money needed to pay the youth and artists. <strong>It is at this point, that I am reaching out, with the hopes that the community can help me cover the rest of the costs of this important series. My initial vision was to be able to compensate these young people and facilitators for their time and art, and I am committed to keeping that promise.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why I Started This Project </h3>
<p>As a 24 year old youth mentor and Queer first generation Colombian arts and cultural worker, I have found there is a major lack of accessible mental and emotional health services for low income youth in the Bay Area. This is especially true for youth of color who, like me, do not have a lot of family support or resources. By creating and inviting other youth to take part in this storytelling project, we center holistic healing and wellness, self-determination, and collective based organizing through art.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I find it is politically, psychologically, and professionally necessary for youth to develop and apply language based on empowerment rather then internalized shame and silence. This writing workshop series strategically acts as a two month long arts education and paid training program for queer youth of color who have been historically denied access to these types of essential arts, health, and job development services. </p>

The Impact
I find it is politically, psychologically, and professionally necessary for youth to develop and apply language based on empowerment rather then internalized shame and silence. This writing workshop series strategically acts as a two month long arts education and paid training program for queer youth of color who have been historically denied access to these types of essential arts, health, and job development services.

<p>This project is about creating and finishing the novel, The Murders of Lillian Ross.  The book has been researched, outlined, and the beginning chapters have been written and critiqued up to about a 1/3 of the book.  The first third has been edited and critiqued by several professionals.  Those who have critiqued the pages at this point have left feedback that it is one of the most powerful pieces they have ever read and it is a book that needs to be finished.</p>
<h1>Why This Book?</h1>
<p>My goal with The Murders of Lillian Ross is to create a piece of literature that will inspire, challenge and have a lasting impact on the readers. My goal is to create a book that is worth reading a second time.</p>
<h1>What Will the Money be Used For?</h1>
<p>The money will be used for several things including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The completion of the book</li>
<li>The process of finding an agent and publishing the book. </li>
<li>In the event that a publisher will not pick up the book, the funds will also go towards self publishing.</li>
</ul><h1>What is the Novel About?</h1>
<p>The project is a realistic fiction that explores the world of similar pasts and the choices that are made, which affect who we are in the present.  The story takes you through the interviews of Lillian Ross, which are done by Allison McKinnen, a true crime writer.  Allison's past is filled with a dark secret and while she believes that she has overcome the demons that have plagued her, she quickly realizes that she has not come to terms with the events of her past.</p>
<p>This realization comes after spending considerable time with Lillian Ross, who is a woman convicted of murdering two men, her father William Ross and lover, Adam Lorent.  The majority of the story takes place on death row, where Lillian awaits her execution for murder, and is the story of Lillian’s life from her earliest memories of growing up in an affluent household.  But like many, her story is filled with dark secrets that force her to seek her own escape.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her escapes leads her into a darker world than the one she left behind and by the final conclusion, Lillian succumbs to the grief and pain of both her past and her present. As Lillian recounts her history, Allison’s own story plays out amongst the vibrant detailing of Lillian’s; she realizes that Lillian may not be guilty of the murders she’s been convicted of.  Allison tries to fight her own demons while trying to save Lillian. She becomes convinced that Lillian does not deserve the death penalty for her crime and begins to fight for her freedom.</p>
<p>The book follows three story arcs to explore the two main characters.  Each chapter begins with a look at the trial of Lillian Ross and explores her past and who she was as it is spun by both the defence and the prosecution.  The second is the story between Allison and Lillian. The friendship that builds as they realize they share a similar history and of the struggle that Allison has when she tries to save Lillian.</p>
<p>The final arc is the story that Lillian weaves about her past.  It shows the many different choices that she made and how she allowed her past to control her life. </p>
<p>The three stories come together to explore how  different choices one makes can greatly affect the outcome. It addresses hard subjects such as abuse and suicide and it looks at how  experiences with tragedy and suffering shape the victim.  It looks at how our own choices in life determine whether we succumb to our own grief, or survive our darkest hours.  </p>
<h1>Will We Receive Updates?</h1>
<p>Yes, updates will come throughout the writing process and also through the funding process. I will also share some pages with you as we get into the fundraising.</p>
<h1>Thank you to everyone who contributes or gets the word out</h1>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributes to the book or shares my project with others to get the word out about it.  Just knowing that people are interested in seeing this book finished will be a wonderful.</p></div>","What Is This Project About?

<p>Tyler’s family is has to raise money for Tyler to get a service dog.  Tyler is Autistic, and because of his Autism, he is more than a handful at home and at school.  It is nearly impossible to keep an eye on him 24/7.  Tyler is, what we call in the Autism community, a 'runner'.  He has, on many occasions, ran off and hid from  both his family and his teachers at school. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Autism is a severe developmental disorder that affects the way a child sees and interacts with the rest of the world. It effects sensory, memory, motor and postural control. Social and communication skills may be compromised leading to social isolation both within the family and with other people. Many autistic children, including Tyler, display a tendency to bolt in open spaces making going to a mall or a restaurant almost impossible. Many autistic children also experience difficulty sleeping.</p>
<p>Service dogs have been proven to be an asset for children diagnosed with autism and their families. These dogs provide a social ""bridge"" for children who are often secluded by others because of their behavior or lack of social interaction. These well-trained dogs can also provide comfort as well as calm children who suffer from autism. Autistic children who run away and hide can also be quickly and easily found by assistance dogs that are trained to locate them.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am a journalist, which means I need information. My imagination (though this may not be true of all journalists) is not great. I like to have hard facts on which to base a story, and a solid picture to describe.</p>
<p>I am also someone who is well acquainted with grief. When I was 13, my dad died unexpectedly. Less than a decade later, my 30-year-old sister died unexpectedly. For the vast majority of my life, but primarily as a young adult, I have grappled with grief, walking right up to the edge of the cliff before finding my way back.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I am a mom to a 1-year-old girl and planning to have more kids in the future.</p>
<p><i>The Last Sunset</i> follows a college-age woman named Grace who blames herself for her sister’s death. The two planned a trip to Alaska, but Grace falls asleep at the wheel and her sister is killed in the crash. Later, she goes on the trip they had planned, but intends to take her own life at the end of it. </p>
<p>Grace marks each sunset as one closer to the end of her story – but every day that goes by shakes her conviction a little more. Through every interaction with the beauty of nature and the trust and love of other people, she learns life isn’t just about what happens to you. </p>
<p>I have tried to make progress on this half-completed novel, but I am blocked in part by incomplete information. I went to Alaska in 2014, a year after my sister’s death, and it was healing to me in a way I never anticipated. I want to capture that feeling. But I wasn’t able to explore much, and I want to be able to take my time and soak in the details.</p>
<p>But I'm running out of time to be able to do this trip as my family grows, and I need help getting there.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fall in Anchorage</h3>
<p>The novel takes place in and around Anchorage, so that's where I'll head. I'm planning on mid- to late September, when fall colors are vibrant. In the book, Grace takes a week-long guided trip through national parks and several towns, but uh, she saved for that for a long time I guess because that ish is <strong>pricey. </strong></p>
<p>Here's more of what I would like to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fly into Anchorage ($350-$400)</li>
<li>Stay at an Airbnb or hotel ($700-$1,300)</li>
<li>Rent a car ($400-$450)</li>
<li>Guided kayaking day trip ($250-$300)</li>
<li>Hiking and culture vibing (Free, theoretically)</li>
<li>Eat sometimes (?)</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to raise $1,500. I can't offer a whole lot in return, but I will offer these for fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate $50: I will send a personal thank you card and your very own personalized poem.</li>
<li>Donate $100: I will name a character after you. First name only to protect the innocent.</li>
<li>Donate $250 or more: I will include you in the dedication at the beginning of the book. <br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>My Goal</h3>
<p>I’ve spent many years writing, mostly in the nonfiction space of journalism. I have found comfort in telling other people’s stories and identifying problems to be solved in the world. But what I’ve yet to do is tell my own story through fiction, and convey the lessons I’ve learned about life, love, grief, and how terrible and wonderful the world can be all at once. I want to write the novel I wanted to read as a struggling young adult. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Pledge</h3>
<p>I've lived under deadlines my entire career, and I work best under pressure to deliver something people are expecting of me. Your contribution = guilt for every day that passes by that my novel isn't finished, which is my best motivator.</p>
<p>As a leap of faith, I'm including <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nX-DLqqLsSCMQqpPrv6j9dd9I5eFv_OlpnXXZtwaHVM/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a link to the 60 typed pages</a> I have of this novel so far for you to read.

<h2>The Story Behind My Book</h2>
<p>Erin is an engineer who experiences a strange glitch in the machine that runs her optimized reality. This error sets her off on a journey of many questions and few answers.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>My name is Grace Kwak and I am the author of <i>The Glitch</i>. I wrote this book because as an engineering student and Silicon Valley native, I'd subconsciously tried to “engineer” my entire life in a way that wasn't serving me. What freed me from this mindset was reading non-fiction books such as Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino and How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell, which floored me with their insight. The writing in these books is superbly on-the-nose, but it’s also not super accessible to people who aren’t big readers and who aren’t already interested in these kinds of ideas. I wrote this sci-fi novel in order to fill this need for an emotionally moving reading experience that welcomes any reader.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that sometimes, something has value not in spite of how difficult it is or how much time it takes, but because of it. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with twenty-first century tech culture, late-stage American capitalism, and everyday internalized misogyny.<br/><br/>The Glitch follows an engineer named Erin who lives in a hyper-optimized ""Silicon Valley on steroids"" world. Every day, a voice in her head tells her the best decisions to make, based on advanced data-driven algorithms. This system runs everyone’s lives by collecting, storing, and processing information. It assigns each person a career path where their passions and skills perfectly align, creates fulfilling relationships with their friends and family, and even builds their optimal day-to-day schedule so that they can reach their full potential.<br/><br/>Erin is an intensely cerebral person who is as perceptive and innovative as she is idiosyncratic and whimsical. She is afraid of what she does not know because her knowledge is what makes her valuable and what justifies her existence in this world. So when the system mysteriously begins glitching, she is the first to rush to the scene.<br/><br/>When people fall under a glitch, they become unpredictable and self-sabotaging dangers to society. Erin finds that the new, random nature of people is making the glitch impossible to fix. But then, she glitches herself and wakes up in the present-day world, where she leads a very different life. Now, she attempts to connect the pieces of her former reality with this new one and reckons with its implications regarding meaning, identity, and purpose. It’s not long before she realizes that what she's so desperately searching for, she already has.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to learn about the human side of technology, find your place on the spectrum from technophobe to techno-utopian, and grapple with existential dread.<br/><br/>The Glitch speaks to college students studying engineering and professionals in the tech industry who want to question the idea that moving faster, doing more, and constantly striving to improve is always better; maybe the randomness and messiness of the universe can render reality beautiful.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Glitch</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into big questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has technology transformed the way that you perceive your identity?</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What happens when you try to systematize and streamline emotional connections?</span></li>
<li><font>What defines ""progress"" in human history?</font></li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p>

<p>Grace Kwak is a second-year student at UCLA, studying electrical engineering. Her day-to-day consists of grinding away at circuits and code but even throughout the hustle and bustle, her mind has always stayed with one of her biggest passions, which is writing. She finds that by putting words on paper, she’s able to free herself from the strict schedule of an engineering student and is able to live a different version of herself. When Grace isn’t writing, you can find her listening to angsty music and staring into space.<br/>For more information, you can connect with Grace at <a href=""mailto:gracekwak@ucla.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gracekwak@ucla.edu</a> and on Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gracekwak.writes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@gracekwak.writes</a>.</p>
<h3>International Preorders</h3>For international preorders, please do the following:<ul>
<li>Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks</li>
<li>Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)</li>
<li>Use <a href=""https://forms.gle/9Axa9kXijdHRPK2C8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this form</a> to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by <strong>building into the campaign </strong>the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.</p>

Erin is an engineer who experiences a strange glitch in the machine that runs her optimized reality. This error sets her off on a journey of many questions and few answers.
-----
My name is Grace Kwak and I am the author of The Glitch. I wrote this book because as an engineering student and Silicon Valley native, I'd subconsciously tried to “engineer” my entire life in a way that wasn't serving me. What freed me from this mindset was reading non-fiction books such as Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino and How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell, which floored me with their insight. The writing in these books is superbly on-the-nose, but it’s also not super accessible to people who aren’t big readers and who aren’t already interested in these kinds of ideas. I wrote this sci-fi novel in order to fill this need for an emotionally moving reading experience that welcomes any reader.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that sometimes, something has value not in spite of how difficult it is or how much time it takes, but because of it. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with twenty-first century tech culture, late-stage American capitalism, and everyday internalized misogyny.The Glitch follows an engineer named Erin who lives in a hyper-optimized ""Silicon Valley on steroids"" world. Every day, a voice in her head tells her the best decisions to make, based on advanced data-driven algorithms. This system runs everyone’s lives by collecting, storing, and processing information. It assigns each person a career path where their passions and skills perfectly align, creates fulfilling relationships with their friends and family, and even builds their optimal day-to-day schedule so that they can reach their full potential.Erin is an intensely cerebral person who is as perceptive and innovative as she is idiosyncratic and whimsical. She is afraid of what she does not know because her knowledge is what makes her valuable and what justifies her existence in this world. So when the system mysteriously begins glitching, she is the first to rush to the scene.When people fall under a glitch, they become unpredictable and self-sabotaging dangers to society. Erin finds that the new, random nature of people is making the glitch impossible to fix. But then, she glitches herself and wakes up in the present-day world, where she leads a very different life. Now, she attempts to connect the pieces of her former reality with this new one and reckons with its implications regarding meaning, identity, and purpose. It’s not long before she realizes that what she's so desperately searching for, she already has.You will love this book if you want to learn about the human side of technology, find your place on the spectrum from technophobe to techno-utopian, and grapple with existential dread.The Glitch speaks to college students studying engineering and professionals in the tech industry who want to question the idea that moving faster, doing more, and constantly striving to improve is always better; maybe the randomness and messiness of the universe can render reality beautiful.
Ultimately, I hope that The Glitch inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into big questions like:

How has technology transformed the way that you perceive your identity?
What happens when you try to systematize and streamline emotional connections?
What defines ""progress"" in human history?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

About the Author

Grace Kwak is a second-year student at UCLA, studying electrical engineering. Her day-to-day consists of grinding away at circuits and code but even throughout the hustle and bustle, her mind has always stayed with one of her biggest passions, which is writing. She finds that by putting words on paper, she’s able to free herself from the strict schedule of an engineering student and is able to live a different version of herself. When Grace isn’t writing, you can find her listening to angsty music and staring into space.For more information, you can connect with Grace at gracekwak@ucla.edu and on Instagram @gracekwak.writes.
International PreordersFor international preorders, please do the following:
Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this form to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.
The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

En 15 ans, La Gaillarde est parvenue à s’autofinancer à 94 %, mais elle dépend toujours en partie de subventions et de bourses. À cause des mesures d’austérité du gouvernement actuel, La Gaillarde perd cette année une subvention importante qui lui aurait permis de poursuivre ses activités. La survie de La Gaillarde est donc maintenant en péril.
C’est pourquoi nous faisons appel à vous aujourd’hui! Avec un don, vous pouvez contribuer concrètement à sauver La Gaillarde et sa mission. Ainsi, nous pourrons continuer à sensibiliser les consommateurs et tenter de changer le monde de la mode… un vêtement à la fois!

Ce n’est plus un secret pour
personne : l’industrie de la mode québécoise traverse actuellement une période
de crise. Il est difficile de survivre dans ce domaine très compétitif avec la concurrence grandissante de la mode rapide (fast
fashion). La situation économique actuelle a causé la disparition
de marques comme Jacob et la fermeture d’une trentaine de boutiques de
mode québécoise, risquant l’avenir de nombreux créateurs d’ici. Il est donc
plus essentiel que jamais de soutenir les créateurs locaux et de revoir les
façons de faire. C’est la mission que s’est donnée l'équipe de La Gaillarde. Par ses activités de promotion, vente et représentation, La Gaillarde s’est positionnée comme un acteur incontournable dans le domaine de la mode éthique et locale. Défilé Marque Gaillarde, 2014, Photo: Jon Brooks

La Gaillarde, plus qu’une simple
boutique
La Gaillarde
offre en boutique les collections de vêtements, bijoux et accessoires de plus
de 50 écodesigners québécois en plus d’une grande sélection de vêtements
seconde main et rétro pour homme, femmes et enfants. Notre équipe a pour
mission de promouvoir la réduction et la réutilisation des matières textiles,
en plus de soutenir les écodesigners québécois et d’encourager les passionnés
de mode à repenser leurs habitudes de consommation. www.lagaillarde.ca
« La Gaillarde a toujours su insuffler à son équipe
une vive passion pour leur travail, pour qui la mission de l’organisme est
devenue un véritable mode de vie. La Gaillarde est un incubateur de projets et
d’idées qui priorise le rapport humain plutôt que le profit à tout prix. La
Gaillarde se fait un point d’honneur d’impliquer la participation de son
équipe, des créateurs et des consommateurs dans le développement de sa mission
– tous a son mot à dire! »
 - Annie
 de Grandmont, directrice, et Elsa Girard, styliste à La
Gaillarde
 « La Gaillarde a été pour moi le début
d'une grande passion pour le ‘fait-main’. C'est en partie grâce à La Gaillarde
que j'ai pu faire grandir mon entreprise et apprendre à évoluer dans mon
processus créatif. Quand peu de boutiques étaient prêtes à embarquer dans mon
aventure, La Gaillarde a été là pour m'aider à valoriser mes produits. J'espère
que plusieurs autres créateurs profiteront aussi de cette chance. »
 - Patricia
 Jodoin, designer pour Création Encore





La Gaillarde au festival Mode et Design en 2007 




Une prise de conscience
Gaspillage
massif de matières textiles, mauvaises conditions des travailleurs, méthodes de
productions néfastes pour l’environnement : l’industrie de la mode est
l’une des plus polluantes dans le monde et la popularité grandissante du fast fashion ne fait qu’empirer la situation. Au Québec,
chaque personne consomme environ 27
 kg de vêtements annuellement et, dans son ensemble, la
population jette plus de 100 000 tonnes de matières textiles.
L’équipe
dévouée de La Gaillarde travaille sans relâche afin de sensibiliser les
consommateurs quant aux nombreux impacts environnementaux et sociaux reliés à
l’industrie de la mode.
Quelques-unes de nos réalisations 


Boutique pionnière
     en mode éthique au Québec et une référence reconnue dans le domaine;
Plus de huit tonnes de vêtements recyclés chaque année;
Sept événements « Mode de vie », des défilés-conférences
     qui visent à promouvoir l’achat écologique et local;
Premier défilé de mode éthique 100 % pour hommes au Québec, en
     septembre 2010;
Plus de 50 défilés de mode écologique afin de promouvoir les
     écodesigners québécois;
Promotion de la diversité corporelle lors de ces nombreux défilés;
Soutien à plus de 120 écodesigners au cours des 15 dernières
     années;
Lancement du concours Marque Gaillarde, en 2014, qui vise à contribuer à l’émergence
     d’une relève en mode éthique;
Accueil d’une centaine de bénévoles, stagiaires et jeunes en
     réinsertion à l’emploi;
Lauréate
     de quatre prix en développement durable.




« La Gaillarde, c’est le foyer de ma famille
d’éco-designer. C’est LA place de référence pas seulement à Montréal, mais au
Québec. C’est surtout, depuis 15 ans, une équipe géniale, généreuse et
particulièrement à son affaire. Pourquoi donc pensez-vous que j’y fais mes
défilés depuis 7 ans ? »
- Musky, designer pour Musky Création
« Ce qui rend La Gaillarde si unique, c’est
l’ambiance chaleureuse et la passion de l’équipe que l’on ressent dès que l’on
met les pieds en boutique. J’aime magasiner ici car j’ai confiance et je sais
que je pourrai obtenir de bons conseils et un avis honnête. C’est rare que je
repart les mains vides !!»

For a number of years people have asked about follow up RPG adventures that were created for other companies. The answer was ""I hope so"" or ""my publisher plans to"", nothing was ever published.

<p>We only need $250 to pay for the cover artwork and interior black and white art. Accordingly a partial funding level has been selected in the event that this campaign does not meet the minimum $500 funding level required by Indegogo.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Why Listen? The Value of Intergenerational Storytelling in Today’s Changing World</i><br/><br/>The world is changing in big ways — from technological advancements, to new concepts of cryptocurrencies, to drastically shifting ideals and beliefs with the rise of Millenials and Gen Z. With all these things going on, what do older generations have to offer? What value do their experiences have? Why do we continue to tell stories, and why do we listen?<br/><br/>My name is Andy Kelleher and I am the author of <i>Why Listen?</i> I wrote this book because I wanted to share my grandfather’s stories in a way that is relevant to modern issues. My aim is to make the case for the value of intergenerational storytelling in today’s changing world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why we as humans tell stories in the first place, and why we feel the need to listen. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for opening conversations with people of different backgrounds than ourselves. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you facilitate these conversations in your own lives and help build bridges between generational gaps.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll explore the connections between modern issues and my own personal quest to investigate my grandfather's past:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>What does a Harlem neighborhood involved in a high-stakes hostage situation have to do with the debates raging over the memorialization of Confederate monuments?</li>
<li>How does the story of my grandfather saving a woman from attempted suicide relate to the Anti-Vaxx movement?</li>
<li>How can we use the story of my grandmother’s passing to talk about grief in the age of social media?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a storyteller yourself, are an avid listener to the stories of others, or are curious about how and why we tell stories from a biological, sociological, and psychological perspective.<br/><br/><i>Why Listen?</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to both younger and older audiences who are looking at the idea of storytelling in an in-depth way for the first time.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - <i>Why Listen?</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part I contains the Introduction + Chapters I-IV. This part explores the concept of storytelling by considering the value of the content of stories themselves. Here, I explore how stories give new meanings to old events, update our understanding of the world around us, and can even shape social norms. For example, I explore how hearing the story of my grandfather responding to a hostage situation in a particular apartment complex gives new context to that same neighborhood for me half a decade later. I then explore this idea in the context of a modern issue: the fight to remove Confederate statues in light of new historical understandings.<br/><br/>Part II contains Chapters V-VIII. This part examines stories, not by their content, but by the interactions through which these stories are told. Here, I explore storytelling as a way to connect people together. By sharing our memories and experiences with others, we develop connections through shared understandings of events. I use the example of my grandfather saving a woman who jumped in front of a train to talk about how we judge not only the characters in stories, but the storytellers themselves. So how does this concept relate to how we form judgments of others in the internet age? Of our celebrities and politicians today?<br/><br/>Part III contains Chapters IX-XII. The final part of this book explores how stories define our legacies. This section examines storytelling as a vehicle of transmitting our own experiences onto others. By using our experiences to impact others, we can use stories to live on. This is essential to how we understand our own stories and connect them to the stories of human history. We explore this idea through the tragic death of my grandmother, Kay, and how her story continues to affect my grandfather’s behavior decades after she has passed.</p>

<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2019</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Why Listen? The Value of Intergenerational Storytelling in Today’s Changing WorldThe world is changing in big ways — from technological advancements, to new concepts of cryptocurrencies, to drastically shifting ideals and beliefs with the rise of Millenials and Gen Z. With all these things going on, what do older generations have to offer? What value do their experiences have? Why do we continue to tell stories, and why do we listen?My name is Andy Kelleher and I am the author of Why Listen? I wrote this book because I wanted to share my grandfather’s stories in a way that is relevant to modern issues. My aim is to make the case for the value of intergenerational storytelling in today’s changing world.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why we as humans tell stories in the first place, and why we feel the need to listen. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for opening conversations with people of different backgrounds than ourselves. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you facilitate these conversations in your own lives and help build bridges between generational gaps.
In this book, you'll explore the connections between modern issues and my own personal quest to investigate my grandfather's past:
 

What does a Harlem neighborhood involved in a high-stakes hostage situation have to do with the debates raging over the memorialization of Confederate monuments?
How does the story of my grandfather saving a woman from attempted suicide relate to the Anti-Vaxx movement?
How can we use the story of my grandmother’s passing to talk about grief in the age of social media?

 
You will love this book if you are a storyteller yourself, are an avid listener to the stories of others, or are curious about how and why we tell stories from a biological, sociological, and psychological perspective.Why Listen? is a non-fiction book that speaks to both younger and older audiences who are looking at the idea of storytelling in an in-depth way for the first time.
 
The Book - Why Listen?

The book is written in 3 Parts....Part I contains the Introduction + Chapters I-IV. This part explores the concept of storytelling by considering the value of the content of stories themselves. Here, I explore how stories give new meanings to old events, update our understanding of the world around us, and can even shape social norms. For example, I explore how hearing the story of my grandfather responding to a hostage situation in a particular apartment complex gives new context to that same neighborhood for me half a decade later. I then explore this idea in the context of a modern issue: the fight to remove Confederate statues in light of new historical understandings.Part II contains Chapters V-VIII. This part examines stories, not by their content, but by the interactions through which these stories are told. Here, I explore storytelling as a way to connect people together. By sharing our memories and experiences with others, we develop connections through shared understandings of events. I use the example of my grandfather saving a woman who jumped in front of a train to talk about how we judge not only the characters in stories, but the storytellers themselves. So how does this concept relate to how we form judgments of others in the internet age? Of our celebrities and politicians today?Part III contains Chapters IX-XII. The final part of this book explores how stories define our legacies. This section examines storytelling as a vehicle of transmitting our own experiences onto others. By using our experiences to impact others, we can use stories to live on. This is essential to how we understand our own stories and connect them to the stories of human history. We explore this idea through the tragic death of my grandmother, Kay, and how her story continues to affect my grandfather’s behavior decades after she has passed.

Carmelo, no sabemos por qué fue y a Serafín nadie lo invitó. Irene solo buscaba una noche de desahogo. Lorenzo, bueno, ese es un tío con suerte y Yago iba con él.

<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Perseus Roig</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Las historias aún no narradas están ocultas en el absurdo de la vida cotidiana. Cuando se las encuentra, el impulso de interpretarlas y después, contárselas a otros, surge no tanto del deseo, como de la necesidad. Así lo cree Perseus Roig, zaragozano nacido en los convulsos años setenta cuya semilla literaria germinó entre la fantasía, el terror, el humor más irreverente y la ciencia ficción, abonados todos con interminables horas de juegos de rol y muchos cómics. Bascula entre esos géneros y suspira por el día en que sea capaz de terminar una novela policíaca, su meta más preciada y, hasta ahora, más inalcanzable. No obstante, su trabajo como educador de menores, le ha hecho entender que la vida es un camino adoquinado con decisiones erróneas y, si se tiene suerte, con rectificaciones. Y, como padre, sabe que nada hay más fascinante que la creatividad de una niña que va creciendo: una fábula para dormir que sueña con ser novela.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p>«―Resulta difícil encontrar algo que contar ―siguió ella―. Creo que fue el principal problema. Mi vida tampoco ha sido demasiado interesante, ¿sabes?<br/>     ―Eso lo dudo mucho ―contestó Julián.<br/>     ―¿Lo dudas?<br/>     ―Lo dudo ―confirmó, cerrando los ojos mientras hablaba―. Eres una tía de veintitantos años que acude sola a un concierto de unos tíos que casi le triplican la edad y que se pone a bailar pogo en solitario al fondo del concierto... Desde que te vi, supe que había una historia interesante detrás de eso.<br/>     Ahora fue Nadia quien se quedó sin saber qué decir. Solo giró la cabeza y, en plena oscuridad, miró hacia donde él estaba. Era una sombra indistinguible del resto de las sombras, pero aun así, su mente lo dibujó a la perfección. La silueta del tipo gordito, de cabellos desordenados y rasposa barba, la silueta del tipo que ha cumplido los cuarenta preguntándose adónde había ido todo su tiempo»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>BolaBlanca</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Perseus Roig</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>

<p>I can <i>feel </i>that many young adults and women today struggle to find their voice.

Through the publishing of my first poetry book ""ONE"" , I've come in contact with a staggering amount of lovely human beings who have had their rights violated in small or big ways. I can think of no better way to give people a voice, than to use this platform to SCREAM in their place. 
In honor of all people who are discriminated against today (and with a certain focus on women for this particular issue) - I have created ""the printpoetics chapbook series"" which as of today, is ready to publish three poetry chapbook volumes. The titles of these chapbooks are;
""SIT. STAY."" - Vol. I
""ROLL OVER."" - Vol. II
""PLAY DEAD."" - Vol. III
My hopes for the printpoetics chapbook series is to condense thought provoking material into a series of tiny reads, with a very low retail price; basically quickies with a theme that can be read on a single train ride/ for the duration of sipping a coffee.

<p>From April 27 to May 1 I have the opportunity, along with 4-5 other writers, to work with the amazing Linda Sivertsen (a.k.a. <a href=""http://bookmama.com/retreats/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Book Mama</a>) at her Carmel-by-the-Sea writing retreat. Linda is a writer - a New York times bestselling author - a teacher, and a ""seasoned midwife of best-selling books and 6 &amp; 7 figure book deals"". </p>
<p>Basically I have dreamed of working with her for years because I know, deep down, working with Linda will bring <a href=""http://bookmama.com/retreats/dreamy-testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RESULTS</a>, both personal and (hopefully) professional, and by some universal kismet 1 spot has opened up at her upcoming retreat (this is rare). </p>
<p>As a young writer (and soon-to-be-mama) NOW is the time for me to make this leap, but I truly need your help to make it. If you contribute to my campaign, you aren't just helping me reach a dream - <b>you are supporting art</b>, and <b>you are allowing me to eventually give back to my community through my work</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>About the Book</h3>The title of my novel-in-progress is LIES WE TELL. <p>4 characters. 4 choices. 1 day. Lives forever altered.</p>
<p><b><i>It has been described by a fellow writer as ""Crash meets 24!"" </i></b></p>
<p>The novel follows four 20-something individuals, in a small, isolated northern town, who have each come to a crossroad in their lives and must make a choice. Their choices will impact not only themselves, but all those around them, and for some the irreversible consequences of their actions will reverberate for years to come. </p>
<p>The title references not only the lies we tell others, but more importantly, the lies we tell ourselves. </p>
<p>It is about loss and regret, but also hope and redemption. It is a deeply personal story that grew from my own life experiences in the small, northern Alberta town I grew up in, but it has turned into a living, breathing piece that stands alone, apart from me. </p>
<p>It has been my dream to share this story, and hopefully many others in the years to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What It Will Take</h3> <p>The hard truth of the matter is this retreat is not cheap at $8,000 and we can't do it alone right now. </p>
<p>Here is a general view of the cost broken down:</p> <ul> <li>This covers ALL expenses except for travel (which I will provide on my own). That's lodging, food and all instruction. </li>
<li>Instruction includes: daily private 45-minute sessions with Linda and hours of group sessions; hours and hours of quiet writing time; delicious chef-prepared meals and snacks; group activities such as hiking (and if you've ever been to Carmel you know how inspiring the landscape can be), etc. </li>
<li>a private two-hour editorial session with Linda when I'm ready, and after we've returned from the retreat. </li>
<li>And on top of all of that, connections will be made between myself and the other writers, and I can't begin to tell you how much it means to be part of an amazing community of like-minded artists.</li>
<li>As a participant I would also receive a copy of <a href=""http://yourbigbeautifulbookplan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Your Big Beautiful Book Plan</a>, which will be insanely helpful for me when I get to the book proposal stage (the ""business plan"" needed when approaching publishers). </li>
<li>Check out the perks section to see what I can offer in return for your help - hopefully they offer a bit of an incentive, but please note that for certain perks (copies of novel/Character name, etc.) the timeline is TBD since the timing of publication and method of publishing (traditional or self-publish) is still to be determined. </li>

<p>Attending this retreat would have a greater impact on me than I can even put into words. Life-changing results and relationships. I feel very vulnerable admitting how much this experience would mean for me. </p>

<p>139 firefighters died in the last two
years. They died by their own hand. I know how they felt because  I
was a firefighter for 31 years and I narrowly missed being a member
of this group. It is estimated that fully 30% of firefighters suffer
from alcoholic drinking and the numbers grow larger when you add in
the use of drugs. By writing this book I hope to break down the walls
within our secret society and reach firefighters before they drink
themselves to death.</p>
<p> I am compelled to write this book because firefighters,
	true American heroes are killing themselves in record numbers rather
	than seek treatment, they are hanging themselves in fire stations,
	shooting themselves in the cab of a firetruck, and leaving behind so
	many grieving people with out reason. They are being treated like
	criminals by their departments and are viewed as a liability rather
	than as a human being that is suffering greatly. It is more cost
	effective to fire them than it is to rehabilitate them. 
	Firefighters are trapped in a catch 22 life, admit you are suffering
	and be ostracized by your fellows or keep it quiet and kill yourself
	rather than be thought of as weak.People will read my book for two reasons. The first reason is
	because of the macabre nature of voyeurism. That will draw readers
	in to see what life is like for firefighters and what that life does
	to our minds and souls. The second reason I hope is because
	firefighters don't really want to kill themselves and need to accept
	that a seismic change needs to occur in our business to help them.
	Our own culture of being so heroic, so tough, is the leading cause
	of theses suicides 
	</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the specific benefits of
	your book? The benefits of my book are contained in my intimate
	knowledge of this world and that I have been there, done that and
	survived. I bore witness to suicides and nearly drank myself to
	death twice. I have been to rehabilitation four times and am grossly
	aware of the shortcomings that the treatment system has to offer
	firefighters. Firefighters need therapy and treatment that
	recognizes we don't work Monday through Friday 8-5. We live and
	exist in a world that no ordinary therapist can comprehend let alone
	empathize with or understand, they can't treat what they don't know.
	I believe I will have instant trustworthiness from my peers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How do you plan on marketing the book? I have already driven
	a previous work to the number one spot on Amazon on three separate
	occasions with social media campaigns and give aways that resulted
	in 13,000 downloads from the Kindle store through KDP. I also am a
	very entertaining interview on radio and have done so with my own
	resources on many occasions. I promote my own book signings and have
	had many successful outings in the past. I am also a public speaker
	and have made presentations to many large groups. I plan to reach
	out to every fire department in the nation and offer my services to
	their organizations in the hope of saving even one life, who can
	argue with that?</p></li>

</p><p>Je m'appelle Valérie et en 2008 je suis partie sauver le monde!</p>
<p>J'ai passé 2 ans à rencontrer les jeunes qui vivent dans les rues un peu partout en Amérique du Sud (mais surtout au Pérou à Lima). J'avais envie de comprendre, de connaître et peut-être même d'aider quelques un(e)s à se trouver. J'ai fais des projets concrets au tous début, avec l'aide de l'organisme Tous les enfants de l'autre monde (TEAM). Ils m'ont permis de connaitre le milieu et de faire de très belles rencontres. Je vous invites d'ailleurs à visiter mon blog de ces aventures: <a href=""http://valerieteam.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Six mois avec les enfants de l'autre monde</a>. </p>
<p>Après mes expériences extraordinaires avec TEAM, je suis partie de façon indépendante parcourir les rues et ruelles de l'Amérique du Sud.<span><br/>

J'ai passé 2 ans à rencontrer les jeunes qui vivent dans les rues un peu partout en Amérique du Sud (mais surtout au Pérou à Lima). J'avais envie de comprendre, de connaître et peut-être même d'aider quelques un(e)s à se trouver. J'ai fais des projets concrets au tous début, avec l'aide de l'organisme Tous les enfants de l'autre monde (TEAM). Ils m'ont permis de connaitre le milieu et de faire de très belles rencontres. Je vous invites d'ailleurs à visiter mon blog de ces aventures: Six mois avec les enfants de l'autre monde. 
Après mes expériences extraordinaires avec TEAM, je suis partie de façon indépendante parcourir les rues et ruelles de l'Amérique du Sud.

<p>I became a raw vegan three years ago after years of suffering headaches

diseases. </p>

but still I was sick and so decided to delve deeper in an attempt to find the
root cause of disease. Three years ago I discovered <b>Raw Veganism</b> after finding a book about raw eating by <b>Arshavir Ter-Hovannessian</b> and so decided to become a vegan. I’m glad
to say that my health has greatly improved since I made this change.</p>
<p>During my journey I have become more familiar with the philosophy of veganism,

This book is

All of the review sites and blogs claiming to support indie movies were really doing quite the opposite. They were reviewing Hollywood shit labeled indie because the budget was 100 million instead of a quadrillion billion cagillion. The ones who did review indie movies were burying those films under the Hollywood garbage and judging the indie movies by a Hollywood standard.

All of the review sites and blogs claiming to support indie movies were really doing quite the opposite. They were reviewing Hollywood shit labeled indie because the budget was 100 million instead of a quadrillion billion cagillion. The ones who did review indie movies were burying those films under the Hollywood garbage and judging the indie movies by a Hollywood standard.

<p>Goldsmiths students are selected from a large pool of candidates to study and develop their craft at a postgraduate level, so the anthology will be of a high standard and include up-and-coming, and previously unpublished work.</p>
<p>The anthology is designed to launch these writers into the industry by offering samples of their exciting work in an accessible, beautifully designed format.</p>
<p>We will be launching the anthology in London in March 2016, where students will read from the anthology.

Our venue contract includes not just an inspiring space (a stunning art deco council chamber), but access to a delicious menu of canapés, wine, beer, and mixed drinks, as well.</p>
<p>We have also secured a brilliant graphic designer who is willing to create the anthology for us at a hugely reduced fee of £350. </p>
<p>We also need £700 to organise a print-run of over 500 copies. This allows us to disseminate widely, spreading this truly exciting new work to a diverse audience.

</p><h3>Breve reseña</h3>
<p>Somos tres mujeres latinoamericanas, para
quienes el día a día se presenta como un reto entre las responsabilidades, el
trabajo y la familia. Hace aproximadamente un año y medio comenzamos a soñar y
trabajar con Vive scrapbook. Vive es un sitio de clases online dirigidas a
crear bienestar y fomentar el disfrute de la historia personal usando la ayuda
del scrapbook, la fotografía y cualquier medio que nos permita capturar lo que
vivimos y compartirlo.</p>
<p>Nuestro objetivo es acompañar a más
personas hispanohablantes en el camino de experimentar, disfrutar lo que hacen,
recordar, agradecer… ¡queremos inspirar a otros a vivir a plenitud! </p>
<p>Estamos comprometidas con el desarrollo
de la industria del scrapbook en español que tiene un futuro prometedor.
Seremos la primera empresa con clases en línea de scrapbook para
hispanohablantes.</p>
<p>Tenemos ya listo nuestro video
promocional donde explicamos con detalle nuestra propuesta de valor (ver arriba). Queremos que
lo veas de primero! y así puedas entender mejor nuestro sueño y ayudarnos a
terminar de construirlo.</p>
<p>Estamos a punto de dar el primer paso con
nuestros clientes. Nuestra página web estará activa a partir del <u><b>17 de Julio del 2014.</b></u></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Nuestra
campaña:</b></p>
<p>Hoy estamos en búsqueda de fondos para
materializar nuestro sueño. Somos una empresa online, que requiere de una
plataforma tecnológica que soporta la página web en la que estarán disponibles
todas nuestras clases. Hasta ahora hemos invertido USD15,000 en desarrollar el
website y clases para el lanzamiento, pero necesitamos USD45,000 más para poder
materializar el proyecto completo.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Tu aporte:</b></p>
<p>En Vive queremos tocar muchas vidas.
Estamos muy cerca de alcanzar el objetivo de tener nuestra página web en línea
y disponible pero necesitamos tu ayuda para nuestra entrada en producción.
Cualquier donación que puedas hacer será maravillosa para nosotras.</p><p>
<b>¿Qué haremos con esos fondos?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Queremos ampliar nuestro catálogo de clases. Nuestro objetivo es
     tener 24 clases el primer año. Hasta ahora solo hemos producido 4 y
     necesitamos de tu ayuda para obtener los recursos para la producción de
     muchas más que nos permita tener una oferta amplia para nuestros usuarios.</li>
<li>Fortalecer nuestra plataforma tecnológica para ofrecer mayor
     interacción con nuestros usuarios y para integrarnos con herramientas robustas
     que nos permitan analizar constantemente la evolución de nuestros clientes
     y el mercado.</li>
<li>Hacer crecer nuestra comunidad. Queremos tener 4988 usuarios registrados durante los primeros 12
     meses (0.05% del mercado target identificado). Para ello, necesitamos invertir en marketing. Tenemos identificado
     una red inicial de blogs y organizaciones que podrían promocionarnos, así
     como también una serie de actividades con medios online que estamos
     seguros nos ayudarán a traer muchos clientes potenciales a nuestro
     website.</li>

</p><h3>Briefing</h3>
<p>We started to work on this dream one and
a half years ago. Vive scrapbook is a website of online courses that connects
users with their life experiences and help to document them through the
scrapbook, photography and other artworks. We are three latinamerican entrepeneurs
women in the middle of everyday challenges with professional, family and
personal roles. We have a vision to create a community wherein people can
experience, share, enjoy, remember, be grateful… We want to inspire people to
live to the fullest!</p>
<p>The scrapbook industry in spanish has a
promisory future, we’re commited to it. We are the first organization with online
scrapbook classes in spanish.</p>
<p>Vive promotional video is ready! (see above) And we
want you to see it first. It explains our value proposition to customers so it
will help you to understand our dream and hopefully help us to make it
happened.</p>
<p>Countdown is moving very fast… on <b>July 17th, 2014</b><b> </b>we will be LIVE! </p>

<p><b>Our campaign:</b></p>
<p>So, what are we missing? We are raising funds for our project. As an online organization, we require a tecnological
platform to support our website and the courses development. So far, we have
put on the table USD15,000, but we need at least USD45,000 more to be able to
accomplish our initial objectives.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Your help:</b></p>
<p>This project aims at touching lifes. We
are pretty close to reach our goal to have our final website available but we
need your support to put it online and increase our classes portfolio. Any

<p></p>
<p><b>What exactly we want to do with this
money?</b></p>

<li>Increase our classes portfolio to 24 during first year of

<li>Make our community BIG! We want to reach 4988 registered users in year 1 (0.05% of our identified potential target). Hence, we need to invest in

Somos tres mujeres latinoamericanas, para
quienes el día a día se presenta como un reto entre las responsabilidades, el
trabajo y la familia. Hace aproximadamente un año y medio comenzamos a soñar y
trabajar con Vive scrapbook. Vive es un sitio de clases online dirigidas a
crear bienestar y fomentar el disfrute de la historia personal usando la ayuda
del scrapbook, la fotografía y cualquier medio que nos permita capturar lo que
vivimos y compartirlo.
Nuestro objetivo es acompañar a más
personas hispanohablantes en el camino de experimentar, disfrutar lo que hacen,
recordar, agradecer… ¡queremos inspirar a otros a vivir a plenitud! 
Estamos comprometidas con el desarrollo
de la industria del scrapbook en español que tiene un futuro prometedor.
Seremos la primera empresa con clases en línea de scrapbook para
hispanohablantes.
Tenemos ya listo nuestro video
promocional donde explicamos con detalle nuestra propuesta de valor (ver arriba). Queremos que
lo veas de primero! y así puedas entender mejor nuestro sueño y ayudarnos a
terminar de construirlo.
Estamos a punto de dar el primer paso con
nuestros clientes. Nuestra página web estará activa a partir del 17 de Julio del 2014.

Nuestra
campaña:
Hoy estamos en búsqueda de fondos para
materializar nuestro sueño. Somos una empresa online, que requiere de una
plataforma tecnológica que soporta la página web en la que estarán disponibles
todas nuestras clases. Hasta ahora hemos invertido USD15,000 en desarrollar el
website y clases para el lanzamiento, pero necesitamos USD45,000 más para poder
materializar el proyecto completo.

Tu aporte:
En Vive queremos tocar muchas vidas.
Estamos muy cerca de alcanzar el objetivo de tener nuestra página web en línea
y disponible pero necesitamos tu ayuda para nuestra entrada en producción.
Cualquier donación que puedas hacer será maravillosa para nosotras.
¿Qué haremos con esos fondos?

Queremos ampliar nuestro catálogo de clases. Nuestro objetivo es
     tener 24 clases el primer año. Hasta ahora solo hemos producido 4 y
     necesitamos de tu ayuda para obtener los recursos para la producción de
     muchas más que nos permita tener una oferta amplia para nuestros usuarios.
Fortalecer nuestra plataforma tecnológica para ofrecer mayor
     interacción con nuestros usuarios y para integrarnos con herramientas robustas
     que nos permitan analizar constantemente la evolución de nuestros clientes
     y el mercado.
Hacer crecer nuestra comunidad. Queremos tener 4988 usuarios registrados durante los primeros 12
     meses (0.05% del mercado target identificado). Para ello, necesitamos invertir en marketing. Tenemos identificado
     una red inicial de blogs y organizaciones que podrían promocionarnos, así
     como también una serie de actividades con medios online que estamos
     seguros nos ayudarán a traer muchos clientes potenciales a nuestro
     website.

Us being two women who shared similar experiences, who come from similar backgrounds, and share the same values of life, we believe destiny brought us together for a common cause. Together we've written this ""self love"" book to share our individual journeys into womanhood with the world in hopes to encourage young women who feel and see life and view the world in ways that we do. We want to be able to give young girls and women coming into their own LOVE and LIGHT, guidance to help them along their journey, to show them that they too can make it.</p><p>'Her Crown' is not a memoir, this is a collective full of wisdom and experience, which we feel the world has yet to offer. This book is a compilation of our thoughts, lessons, trials, triumphs, spiritual growth, and conversations between the two of us that we wish to share with our sisters to empower them and reassure them of their worth. 'Her Crown' is more than a mere title, it is a STATEMENT! An affirmation that we are Queens, by birth; and every day as we go along, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are always on our way further into our Queendom.</p><p>We are very passionate about 'Her Crown' and its message and we would LOVE to share our journeys with other women who are struggling with the same issues we have struggled with growing up and have dealt with. We are doing this so women do not have to go through the pain that we did or if they are going through life's trials, we want to make it apparent that all is well, always. We want to help women reach a point in their lives where they can look back on everything that they have gone through, smile, and know that none of it was in vain.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We will need $4,000 to get the book published and to also cover all of the other production cost.</p><p>Let's take a minute to talk about perks! We have many to offer, so don't think you have to choose just one!

This book is destined to uplift women who look like us, breathe like us, eat like us, dress like us, dance like us; who are motivated by what we are motivated by, which is live and love itself.
