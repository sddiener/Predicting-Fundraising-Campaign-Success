The nuyu™ Sleep System operates at a low decibel level so you can sleep peacefully. Further, the sleep mat is made with an ultra-soft cotton/polyester blend, and when placed beneath your fitted sheet, it's undetectable to the body. You'll only feel the warming and cooling comfort it's meant to provide, with no bumps or ridges.

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">How Does The Temperature Cycle Work?<br/></strong>

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">Is The Sleep System Sensing My Body Temperature?<br/></strong>

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">Can I Change The Temperature Any Time I Want?<br/></strong>
Yes, you have full control of what temperature your sleep system is set to. You can make adjustments at any moment during the night, and your sleep system will adjust to your needs.

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">What Is The Circadian Rhythm?<br/></strong>
Often referred to as the ""body clock"", the circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that tells our bodies when to sleep and regulates many other physiological processes. This internal clock is affected by environmental cues, like light and temperature. When one's circadian rhythm is disrupted, sleeping and eating patterns can be interrupted. The best sleep you experience is when your body follows the natural circadian rhythm temperatures.

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">How Does The Sleep System Work?<br/></strong>
The sleep system uses a patent pending temperature algorithm that works like the body's circadian rhythm. It cycles the temperature of the sleep pad to help keep you comfortable throughout the night.

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">Do I Need A Special Size To Fit My Bed?<br/></strong>
No, the system uses a one size pad that is designed to fit under the torso area.

<strong style=""color: #bdcf03; font-size: 22px;"">Why is the pad sized only for my torso?<br/></strong>
The Sleep System works with your body's core temperature. By applying incremental heating or cooling to your torso, studies have shown a direct relationship to sleep quality. Your legs are important for temperature regulation to allow your body to adjust itself to the right ""micro climate"" under your covers. Simply put, it's why you stick your foot out from under your covers when you are hot and curl up when you are cold.

</div></div>","Is it difficult for you to fall asleep? Do you wake up during the night feeling unbearably warm or too cold? Quality sleep is something we all need, and we know how frustrating it can be when you're not getting enough. Now there is a natural solution to help you get to sleep and stay asleep, so you feel better rested. The nuyu™ Sleep System works like your body's natural circadian rhythm, making sleep temperature more comfortable for a better night's sleep.






According to the National Sleep Foundation, nearly 60% of Americans and many more worldwide suffer from sleep problems1. Studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that lack of proper sleep is linked with chronic disease – including coronary heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and obesity2.




Sound sleep is an integral part of optimizing your health and well being. Helping you sleep more comfortably is our goal. As life moves faster, we need to feel our best – and we can't be our best without good sleep. The Health o meter™ nuyu™ Sleep System helps you to get better night's sleep so you are ready to take on the day.




Unlike other apps or devices that simply monitor and report on our sleep, the Health o meter™ nuyu™ Sleep System uses a patent-pending temperature algorithm that works like your body's natural circadian rhythm to help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up more refreshed.



For a detailed report on the effects of temperature and sleep, please see this report
Skin Deep: enhanced sleep depth by cutaneous temperature manipulation 
conducted by the Department of Sleep & Cognition, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and VU University Medical Center of Clinical Neurophysiology, Neurology and Medical Psychology, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 





The nuyu™ Sleep System operates at a low decibel level so you can sleep peacefully. Further, the sleep mat is made with an ultra-soft cotton/polyester blend, and when placed beneath your fitted sheet, it's undetectable to the body. You'll only feel the warming and cooling comfort it's meant to provide, with no bumps or ridges.




The app provides initial temperature recommendations, but you can also customize and adjust settings to your optimal comfort level.





To get started, open the app and complete your personal profile. The nuyu™ Sleep System will recommend a starting temperature, and then the proprietary sleep algorithm will start to work like your circadian rhythm by cycling the temperature throughout the night! When you're ready to sleep, just let the system know. When you awake, rate your sleep quality using the app and, if necessary, adjust the temperature to optimize your comfort level.



After conducting our initial field testing of 20 users with reported sleep problems, we discovered that our users reported a:








Here’s how to do it. 
1. 
Just log into your account on Indiegogo and get
your custom link, or share by using the social media buttons on the left side
of the campaign page. 
2. 
If you choose the custom link, just copy and
paste that into your pinterest page, Instagram, Facebook or an email so that
link is used in all of those places. 
If you use the Facebook, Twitter or G+ buttons, those will automatically create
a custom link that connects to your individual account. 
3. 
When somebody clicks on that link and makes a
purchase, we can track that link back to your individual account and know that
the referral came from you. It’s all tracked through the Indiegogo website
metrics so we know who you are to get the free product to you. 
4. 
If you’ve already purchased one of these
products, we will refund your purchase price or send you another for free.





Introducing: 








The nuyu™ personal activity tracker helps you get active,
and stay active by tracking your steps, calories burned, distance, and your
light, deep, and restless sleep.  Your
personal activity data is wirelessly sent to your smart phone or tablet – the same
app you use for the sleep system - so you can keep a record of how active
you've been the past day, week, month, or year. 
Easy to set up, your nuyu™ activity tracker features an OLED screen
which allows you to view your data throughout the day without looking at your
phone.  Wear on your wrist, in your
pocket, or clipped under your clothing. 
Challenge yourself each day to reach your goals, whatever they may be,
with nuyu™ 






















The Health o meter™ nuyu™ Sleep System is a revolutionary new device, which unlike other apps or devices that simply monitor and report your sleep, this system works like your body's natural circadian rhythm to make you more comfortable so you can get a better night's sleep. Selecting a perk allows you to pre-order the nuyu™ Sleep System at a huge discount.









The Health o meter™ nuyu™ brand is part of Jarden Consumer Solutions. You may not recognize us by name, but you probably are familiar with our brands, such as Mr. Coffee®, Oster®, Crock-Pot®, FoodSaver® and now nuyu™. Knowing we are part of a family of trusted brands, you can be assured that the team behind the nuyu™ Sleep System has experience to build durable, reliable and smart products. 


So why are we turning to the Indiegogo community for support?
It is because the nuyu™ Sleep System is an innovative new way to help people sleep and feel better, and we believe the Indiegogo community of early adopters shares our belief that technology can help solve the problems that affect millions and millions of people worldwide. The Indiegogo community gives us the opportunity to gain valuable feedback to continue to make improvements based on advice and commentary from people like you. We think it's a smarter way to innovate and we'd like your help.





The Health o meter™ nuyu™ team is dedicated to not only improving your sleep, but to also assist in all things for wellness. This is why we've created an ecosystem of products and services including an activity tracker, a wireless scale and personalized online coaching plans (coming soon). This interconnected ecosystem can help you manage your own personal wellness goals with unique tools to help you achieve them.

Does Each Person Need Their Own Sleep System?
Yes, because everyone sleeps at different temperatures and for different lengths of time. Sleep is a personal experience, and in order to get the best sleep, the temperatures should be personalized to you!



How Does The Sleep System Know What Temperature Is Best?
Since everybody is different, the nuyu app will make a recommendation based on our testing and research. If the initial recommendation is not comfortable for you, you can customize the temperature to find the one you like best.



How Does The Temperature Cycle Work?
There are three cycles: When you are going to sleep, the sleep system warms you. Then, it cools you down during the night, and then warms you again, naturally.



Is The Sleep System Sensing My Body Temperature?
No, but it doesn't need to. The Sleep System works like the body's natural circadian rhythm. It's designed to help keep your body comfortable.



Can I Change The Temperature Any Time I Want?
Yes, you have full control of what temperature your sleep system is set to. You can make adjustments at any moment during the night, and your sleep system will adjust to your needs.



What Is The Circadian Rhythm?
Often referred to as the ""body clock"", the circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle that tells our bodies when to sleep and regulates many other physiological processes. This internal clock is affected by environmental cues, like light and temperature. When one's circadian rhythm is disrupted, sleeping and eating patterns can be interrupted. The best sleep you experience is when your body follows the natural circadian rhythm temperatures.



How Does The Sleep System Work?
The sleep system uses a patent pending temperature algorithm that works like the body's circadian rhythm. It cycles the temperature of the sleep pad to help keep you comfortable throughout the night.



Do I Need A Special Size To Fit My Bed?
No, the system uses a one size pad that is designed to fit under the torso area.



Why is the pad sized only for my torso?
The Sleep System works with your body's core temperature. By applying incremental heating or cooling to your torso, studies have shown a direct relationship to sleep quality. Your legs are important for temperature regulation to allow your body to adjust itself to the right ""micro climate"" under your covers. Simply put, it's why you stick your foot out from under your covers when you are hot and curl up when you are cold. 


COMPATIBILITY



What phones and operating systems is the system compatible with?



Android:The list was too long to post, but it is compatible with most models except for HTC One Max, Android version 4.4.2, and HTC One Remix, Android version 4.4.2. But, we are working on getting those phones online.

The world of fitness can be a tedious and
frustrating one.  A continuous journey of ups and downs, but unfortunately
for most people that journey is really a vicious cycle of ""so-so""
results due to the vast amounts of information on the latest diets and workout
trends.  People become extremely frustrated with failed attempts of
transforming their body and creating a healthier, fitness inspired lifestyle.
With this mission, we are hard-set on
inspiring and changing 20,000 lives in the first year with our innovative
results-driven fitness programs.
Element 5 Fitness is
not for the ""average"" gym goer.  We do not attract the
""typical"" fitness crowd. Make no mistake, we are different.
Our fitness family, a.k.a. ""Fitness
Warrior Tribe"", is serious when it comes to achieving fitness goals. We
are driven, committed, and invested in our minds, bodies, and health - not just
today, but for the long haul.

This is why we at HuggingU created the world’s first back mask for flawless skin. The revolutionary design, based on the facial beauty care mask, provides skincare maintenance for your back.   HuggingU offers the back mask in two different varieties: 17 min. Revitalizing-Peeling Back Mask & 7 min. Hydro-Detoxifying Back Mask. The Revitalizing-Peeling Back Mask exfoliates dead skin and controls excess sebum, which can lead to break outs. The Hydro-Detoxifying Back Mask moisturizes new skin for suppleness while brightening the skin tone.   The back has the largest surface area of skin on your body, but as it is difficult to reach, it is hard to wash and often not washed thoroughly. Additionally, as your back is often covered with clothing, the skin rarely gets a chance to breathe.Wear the 17 min RP Back Mask and rinse after 17 minutes. Your back will be clearer and softer than ever before.  *  Click the names below to see explanations for each ingredient.Tea Tree Oil , Orange Peel Oil, Lemon Peel Oil, Lavandin Oil, Purified Water, East Indian Lemongrass Oil, Salicylic Acid, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hyaluraonate   After taking a shower, it's important to apply body lotion to all parts of your body. However, how often have you forgotten to apply lotion to your back properly because it was hard to reach? By wearing the 7 min HD Back Mask, provide moisture and nourish your skin in a simpler way.   * Click the names below to see explanations for each ingredient.Phyto placenta extract, Rice embryos, Rye Extract, Asiatic Pennywort Extract, Purified Water, Sea Trumpet Extract, Sodium Hyaluraonate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate The 7 Min HD Back Mask is also scented with violet flowers to make your skin smell great. Apply this gentle and fragrant scent before you head out on the town.   Remember how your back takes up the largest portion on our body? Don't leave your back un-nourished and unhealthy. The Revitalizing-Peeling Back Mask provides treatment to your back’s acne by exfoliating dead skin and controlling excess sebum. The Hydro-Detoxifying Back Mask moisturizes new skin for suppleness while brightening the skin tone.Bacne (Back Acne) results as a combination of excess oil, clogged pores, bacteria and inflammation. Skin needs to breathe, but as your back is nearly always covered with clothing it is a body part particularly at risk. In addition, being difficult to reach, the back is often not washed thoroughly. This allows for the accumulation of dead skin and more prone to bacterial infection. Muggy weather, over exertion, stress and excessive alcohol consumption also can be aggravating factors.   Reducing inflammation and preventing skin irritation are key factors in the fight against bacne. Inflammation not only causes redness, but also blocks your pores while producing excess oil.  The 17 min. Revitalizing-Peeling Back Mask provides skin care by controlling excess sebum, exfoliating dead skin and fight skin infections. Tea Tree Oil can help in washing away excess sebum while Salicylic acid naturally loosens proteins in the skin to allow dead skin to shed more easily. Vitamin C shields skin from free radicals, which is why orange and lemon peel oil helps to fight skin infections. The 7 min. Hydro-Detoxifying Back Mask provides skin care by moisturizing, whitening and soothing your skin. Rice embryos and rye extract contain proteins which help skin retain moisture, Phyto placenta is a rich source of nutrients to keep skin healthy, and Cynanchum Atratum Bunge extract is effective in cooling your skin.  The cynanchum atratum plant, commonly known as the swallowwort root or Bai Wei, is the key ingredient for HuggingU’s acne prevention. Used in Chinese medicine to cure fevers, cynanchum atratum has powerful cooling and anti-inflammation properties.    New skin is radiant and blemish-free as it never has been exposed to external elements. However as new skin is exposed to external elements it begins to age. Phyto placenta is a rich source of nutrients which actively rejuvenate skin therefore preventing premature aging keeping skin bright and spot free.    Step1. Spread the back mask out, and insert your arms into the arm straps. Step2. Place the back mask on your back and raise the arm straps up to your shoulders. Step3. Ensure that the back mask is evenly spread across your back.  * For the 17'RP back mask, wear it for 15~20 minutes and then rise your back thoroughly with warm water. Recommended Use: 1~2 time per week . * For the 7'HD back mask, wear it for 7~15 minutes. No need to rinse your back after use.  With its simple design simply slip on the back mask as if you were wearing a back pack. For those who find this position uncomfortable, you can also use the back cushion for support. Tip1 : As the back is sensitive to temperature, the back mask may give off a cold sensation. If you prefer a warmer sensation, simply place the back mask in the microwave for a few seconds. Make cool mask in summer, and make it warm in winter!Tip2 : For enough results, we recommend that our product be used regularly more than one month.    People who are uncomfortable and cannot comfortably flex their body can use Back Mask in any circumstance by using the Back cushion!          Developer's wordSelf back mask is the world's first mask for back skin.

<h3>A New Day For Discs:</h3>
<p>Whether you are new to the sport or have played along side Johnny Roberts and Ken Climo, we all have those discs that are special to us, signed discs, ace discs, collector drops, or other. We at Disc Capsule are no different, and have tried many ways to display and show off our favorite discs. Hanging them in their bags on the wall was difficult to decorate around, shadow boxes were bulky and took away the ability to see an especially swirly back of a disc or bottom stamp, and hanging them on the wall unprotected left an uneasy feeling. None fit what we were trying to accomplish, and both had drawbacks that left a lot to be desired. </p>
<p>Justin Gaston has been an avid disc golfer and invested member of the disc golf community for over a decade. Justin had come up with the idea for Disc Capsule a little over a year ago and had been slowly making it a reality since, but over the course of daily conversations decided it was time. An all in one device to protect your disc, that you can hang or let stand on its own like a picture frame. Disc Capsule was born and a prototype created. </p>

<p>Disc Capsule will be able to stand on its own, or hand neatly on the wall.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Protecting our discs is not easy, between storage wear, sun damage, and general organization, and that doesn't give much allowance to displaying them. Disc Capsule not only protects your discs from time and the elements, but allows you to do so on display in way of your choice. UV resistant material will protect your glow discs, soft foam lining will keep them from scuffing. Hang them or stand them up, but still have easy access if you want to show them off, or even put it in the bag!</p>

<h3>Our Story<font size=""3""><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Skin Care for Athletes by Morning Indigo developed as a business without plans for a business. The
 original line was developed purely out of necessity. I always loved natural body products but due to the tough financial year I couldn't
 afford to buy my favorites, so I opted to make them for the family! With several years
 of work experience and training from skin care companies such as Estee 
Lauder and Artistry Skin Care, I went onto the internet and started 
searching for the<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/skincareforathletes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""> </a>raw ingredients, in small quantities, to make my

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><font size=""3"">A couple of years later, I received a flyer from Team in Training to help raise money for the Leukemia Society and in exchange they would coach me through a marathon.  So at the age of 44 I went from the couch to completing a marathon in 5 months.  I then went on to complete another marathon and triathlon with Team in Training. One thing that I noticed, due to the training, was that 
my skin was drying out from all of the showers, chlorine and the 
sun/wind exposure. Since I made body products, a teammate asked that I develop a body moisturizer that sprayed. It took a few months of research, discovering what athletes needed and what they put their skin through and which essential and carrier oils would best benefit the skin.  It hit me that it didn't make sense that an athlete would train right, eat right, get in all of their hydration and supplements just to go home and douse their skin (largest organ on the outside of their body) with chemicals.  So finally, the Tri-Body Moisturizing Spray and 3-in-1 Tri-Body Wash was developed.<br/></font></p>

sun/wind exposure. Since I made body products, a teammate asked that I develop a body moisturizer that sprayed. It took a few months of research, discovering what athletes needed and what they put their skin through and which essential and carrier oils would best benefit the skin.  It hit me that it didn't make sense that an athlete would train right, eat right, get in all of their hydration and supplements just to go home and douse their skin (largest organ on the outside of their body) with chemicals.  So finally, the Tri-Body Moisturizing Spray and 3-in-1 Tri-Body Wash was developed.

The ImpactSince our launch, almost four years ago, I've earned my certification in Holistic Aromatherapy, completed 5 half-marathons, a half-Ironman triathlon and several 5ks. I am truly a late-blooming endurance athlete! The product line has also grown, having expanded from two products to seventeen offering total body care.  Skin Care for Athletes is a certified B Corporation, and our products are certified and highly rated by Environmental Working Group (ewg.org), Leapingbunny.org, Caringconsumer.org and World of Good by Ebay. Our products are rated ""Excellent"" on Goodguide.com and are the only organic skin care line for athletes certified vegan by PETA.  The Tri-Body Collection and our P.A.R. line (Prepare Achieve Recover) have anti-fungal/anti-bacterial properties; offers light UVA/UVB protection, all are sulfate, petrochemical, paraben and phthalate free and never tested on animals.  We were recently recognized as ""Champions"" by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and Skin Care. 



Get
In The Game




With
your support we will continue to provide an excellent product made from
organic and natural ingredients.  Our goals for 2012 are to grow and educate our customer base, our brand and to get into more retail
stores, both on-line and brick/mortar.   Here is the outline of how we
will utilize the money we receive.




Product Expansion. 
     Utilizing the one-for-one model, we are proud to launch our newest product, our
     organic Giving Goddess Soaps. These organic/natural 3 oz soaps come in a set of
     three with the individual embedded words, Faith, Hope, Love.  For
     each set sold, a set will be donated to women and children's homeless
     shelters.  Buyers of the soap will be able to have the equivalent
     set of soaps donated to a women's shelter of their choice or it can be
     left up to our company to donate it to one of our local shelters. A small
     portion of the money raised will cover the initial product development of
     raw materials, packaging and marketing.


Sales and Marketing.
 As we
     make a push to get into more on-line and brick and mortar stores, 
we will contract with a company specializing in small business marketing and a manufacturers  sales representative. We plan
     to continue our social media and grass roots marketing efforts via 
our blog, facebook, youtube channel and twitter
 pages by interviewing athletes of
     all levels, coaches, medical experts in the sports field providing
     information and education on organic and green fitness products. 
Exhibiting and selling at 5 or more large athletic events, as we 
continue to put our product directly into the hands of  fitness
     enthusiasts. Expo fees must be paid months in advance to secure a 
good
     location.  As this is an Olympic year we are in talks with a few
     Olympic hopefuls regarding product only sponsorships.  


Operations/Product Production.
     Product production covers the purchasing of such items as raw materials (oils, butters,
     essential oils), packaging (bottles, caps, shrink wrap), design and
     purchase of retail counter displays and to upgrade our labels by having the
     printing out-sourced.

<p>In 2003 my best friend’s mom, Bev Cushing, was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 47. Bev and my mom were friends long before they had 2 daughters (that’d be me, and my friend Dawn) that became best friends.  Those 2 friends were inseparable growing up, sharing clothes, toys - and moms. </p>
<p>There was always room for one more at the Cushing household, that’s just the kind of lady Bev was. My ""Other Mom"" was not just my other mom - with an open heart and an open door, she was everyone's Other Mom.  In the spring of 2011, Bev passed away from her long battle with cancer. My album Pony Up is dedicated in her honor.</p>
<p>Every year the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation puts on Canada’s largest single day, volunteer-led fundraising event dedicated to raising funds for breast cancer research, education and awareness.  This year, on September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2012 I am going to Calgary with my guitar in tow to cheer on my friend as I perform on the Main Stage as she does the Run For The Cure for her mom.  I am contributing to the run the best way I know how – through music. But I want to go beyond that, so I have started this campaign. With your help, we can raise money to donate to the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. </p>
<p>For all of the daughters, sisters, mothers, grandmas, aunts. For the sons, husbands, grandfathers, uncles.  For best friends.  For “Other Moms”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I am giving my music and other goodies away in exchange for your donations towards this cause. As all runners need a good teammate, I am joining Dawn’s team (though from the stage instead of in sneakers) and all proceeds raised in this campaign are for our team that is running for Bev.</p>
<p>If you've been thinking of buying one of my CDs, now is the perfect time to get one. If you want one for a friend, now is the time.  What’s more, is I am coming up with other unique offers exclusive to this campaign! If you want a private concert for you and your friends- this is the time!  Want me to finally cover that song you have asked me about? Now is the time.</p>
<p>Basically what I’m trying to say is…NOW IS THE TIME to get some Katie Rox goods!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know that in our lifetime we will see a cure for Breast Cancer, but I know that in this lifetime– we can try. </p>
<p>Music heals, and connects us all.  It is how you ended up on this page. I want to give you my music, and I want to help with this cause.  I know this campaign can reach an international base, and this is why I am asking for your help.  We come from all walks of life, and unfortunately so many of those walks have been affected by cancer.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Rubber Soul Yoga Revolution opened in 2006 in Athens, GA.  We have successfully offered yoga to the community on a donation basis.  Donation yoga allows people of all income levels and all job types to give yoga a try and--hopefully--stick with it.  In 2009 we began offering a yoga teacher training, also at a highly affordable price.  The teacher training brings students of yoga to a deeper level of understanding, where issues of global poverty, deforestation, climate change, industrial agriculture, and health epidemics are encountered.  While yoga is initially a personal health initiative, it eventually becomes a universal health opportunity.  Rubber Soul encourages all practitioners to become activists.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now we would like to bring Rubber Soul to New York City. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Students are constantly thanking me for setting up a yoga studio on a donation basis.  When people are out of funds, as many are these days, they are often also in crisis.  Rubber Soul accepts everyone, gives people a safe place, and nourishes the spirit.  I received this note last month:  ""Dear Rubber Soul, I started learning yoga here right after I hit my lowest-low.  I have since taken my life back and pulled myself up by my bootstraps.  It wouldn't have been possible without this studio and each and every beautiful, wonderful instructor.  I love life.  Thank you for reminding me.""  These are hard times.  Yoga helps.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>New York is a city of extremes.  While many can afford special care, others cannot.  Rubber Soul sees yoga as the first step toward not only helping others but showing others how they themselves can help others.  In this way, we can seed the revolution that very much needs to happen.  Humanity faces so many challenges in this upcoming century.  In order to succeed, we must learn to give to others.  As a country, the United States must shift from the world's top energy user to a nation that participates in a global downsizing, so that all of humanity may occupy our small planet.  This is the sort of thing that we teach alongside yoga.  What better place to do it than in New York City itself?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In this campaign, we are asking for a very specific amount for a very specific purpose.  $3800 is one month's rent for a 1200 sq. ft. commercial loft space in Manhattan.  This month will allow us to get the word out.  It will give us an extra 31 days to get the ball rolling.  If the campaign goes over $3800, that will give us even more time.  Wonderful!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When we began Rubber Soul in Athens, our website had 894 hits.  A month later, it had 1424 hits--almost twice as many.  Now, six years later, it gets 5653 hits per month.  This shows that businesses take time to build.  The early months can be expensive.  In Athens, where the rent is around $1200, this isn't much of a trouble.  In New York, it could be a grave difficulty.  Help us offset this growing period!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Funding for Rubber Soul comes entirely from the people who take yoga classes.  They donate per class.  This isn't a charitable donation for them, since they are receiving a service.  It is impossible to receive grants from larger agencies, since the population being served is undefined.  It is anyone who walks through the door.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you donate today, you can have perks.  For $10, you can have a free class at Rubber Soul, either in Athens or in New York City once we open in April.  For $25, you can come for a week as many times as you like.  For $50, you can come for two weeks.  For $100, you can come for a month.  For more than $100, you can decide how many times you'd like to come to classes as our guest.  It could be for months, years, or even decades.  Your generosity now is of extra value, because it comes at a pivotal time.  Become our angel and never pay for a yoga class again!</p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></span></h3></div></div>","Our Story
Currently there is no all inclusive birth center in Los Angeles AND there is a critical shortage of midwives of color. The Community Birth Center (TCBC) is born out of a need and a vision; and with your support- we will reach our goal.  We believe that financial circumstances should not exclude anyone from caring,   supportive, safe midwifery services- and therefore have created this birth center to serve our local community and all of those who believe in our mission and services.  Further, by creating this space- we will serve as a hub for all birth practitioners and a training ground for those interested in becoming an apprentice- or simply donating their time and effort to this grassroots movement.The Community Birth Center belongs to us all.


The Impact
DIsparities in the United States, continue to show that low income and minority families have the highest rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, preterm birth, and very low birth weight babies.  According to the NPR, Minorities and low income women are about 60 percent more likely to deliver babies early, and black infants are about 230 percent more likely to die before their first birthdays.  This statistic is horrifying and the question is why?Experts state that lower use of prenatal care, less adequate care, and high stress associated with lower socioeconomic status, contribute to women being three to four times more likely to die in pregnancy.  The Community Birth Center, aims to address this issue head on.  We will provide quality care, to all communities regardless of race or socioeconomic background.  We want to provide quality care to EVERY WOMEN!  We ARE our community and we ARE the ones we have been waiting for.



What We Need & What You Get
We need your support. By word of mouth, social networks (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc), we must get the word out.  Financially we will meet our goal, with the help of all who share in this dream.     Let's make this happen.  On May 5th our Indiegogo Campaign will conclude with The Grand Opening of The Community Birth Center.  May 5th is also The International Day of the Midwife!Your contributions will go toward ensuring TCBC stays open and runs smoothly. We plan on taking full paying clients ($4,500 for homebirth or birth center, which includes standard prenatal bloodwork & 1 ultrasound) and at least 1 discounted family PER MONTH.  This means that with your help, we will be able to not only open this much needed birth center, but we can also offer services for FREE each month, to a family in financial need.  The money will also go to our website, rent, flooring, paint, birth tub installation, shower installation & our tankless water heater. (This is to ensure we never run out of hot water!!!)We all have the right to make informed decisions and seek out the birth experience of our dreams-and with your support the Los Angeles area, will not only gain a much needed/wanted/dreamed of birth center- we can also offer families the opportunity that might not have it otherwise.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>John Foster has been a personal trainer for about 7 years.  At one point, he grew frustrated with the whole gym environment, the superficiality of it all.  He had always been really interested in philosophy and spirituality, and after finding some key ideas such as barefoot training and Integral Philosophy, he started to develop Life Warrior.  He began to combine barefoot training, body-weight training, yoga, mindfulness, Integral Philosophy and plant-based nutrition, and found that looking good and being healthy  could be much more than a superficial activity.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amanda Russcol was teaching yoga, studying nutrition, opening vegan restaurants and going to school to be a life coach.  After returning from studying yoga in the Himalayas, she moved to Denver and began teaching yoga, mindfulness, meditation and plant-based nutrition.  She was working on building a similar program to John's at a retreat center on a small island in the Bahamas (which is an ongoing project).</p>
<p>John met Amanda as he was trying to get his holistic gym going.  They were amazed at how much they had in common, and decided to join forces to create a space where people could learn all they need to know to take control of their minds, bodies and spirits.  </p>
<p>The space is a studio in Littleton, Colorado, about 20 minutes south of Denver.  It is in an amazing healing center that includes massage therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture and organic spa treatments.   The Life Warrior space is equipped with a jungle gym, kettlebells, lots of fun body-weight training and boot camp equipment, yoga swings, mats, blocks and more.  What you won't find are typical gym machines - we want to teach people how to move so that they can bring their workouts with them wherever they go.  Life Warrior is getting ready to open, but still needs lots of assistance (that means MONEY - from you!) to buy the rest of the equipment, pay teachers, market our services and become the most fun, natural, progressive lifestyle space around!</p>
<p>We've been very lucky to gain the help of Janet, who lost over 100 pounds with John, as our bookkeeper and general over-seer.  She's amazing with numbers and, as she won't be part of the day-to-day operations, she will be in a great place to look at the big picture and keep us focused on it!  We're also so glad to have Carly, a yoga instructor and marketing whiz, who already has our grassroots campaign up and running.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our vision is to open Life Warrior training centers all over the United States and eventually the world. We want to create true life warriors who will transform themselves, their communities, and their environment. This project is exactly what health, training, and community will begin to look like in the year of 2012 and beyond. </p>

<p>What I can't do, <b>WE</b> CAN DO! </p>
<p>How can I care for my loved one? What resources are available? How can I find what I need to help me care for my loved one? What next? </p>
<p>When individuals are faced with the diagnosis that a family member has any form of dementia they are overwhelmed with questions.</p>
<p>With Alzheimer's disease cases mushrooming in numbers, we felt an advocacy packet to distribute upon diagnosis is long overdue. Resources are available, however, not always readily accessible. Our goal is to help make  resources more readily accessible to family members of all ages. <br/></p>
<p><b>Our objective is to provide an information packet to help families cope with the challenges of Alzheimer's Disease and to help the diagnosed individual.

<p>As a group of authors we have each been impacted by the devastation of Alzheimer's Disease. We have come together with our respective books and unique experiences to offer support and resources that we could not find when we first started on our respective journeys. Our own experience has been there is a gap between books that are too clinical and sometimes depressing or written for medical professionals compared to hands-on, experiential, positive books that can connect lay people with professionals.

<p><strong><span>Inspiration</span></strong><br/>Our collective inspiration has been how Alzheimer's disease and dementia has engulfed our lives and the lives of our extended families. Each of our experiences were unique but the one thing we all had in common was seeing a need to help all families be better informed, prepared and enlightened when this affliction enters the door. Alexandra's mom's entire family; siblings and father, were/are impacted by dementia so this is an issue that hits right in her home. But the inspiration to write her book, ""Green Kitty"" came one day when she was working in assisted living. </p>
<p>There was this wonderful feisty little lady who loved to tell about the time that she kissed Elvis Presley. She always ended the story by saying that he would still be alive if he had married her! But one day her 10 year old granddaughter came to visit and she was having a bad memory day. The poor old woman repeated herself several times and asked the same question more than once to her granddaughter. The young girl then rudely and loudly said ""Grandma- you've already said that three times."" The sweet grandmother's face just fell. Alexandra could see from across the room the woman's feelings had been hurt and remembers thinking to herself, ""Someone ought to have told that young girl what was going on with her grandmother, what to expect and how to react to it."" </p>
<p>That’s what made her decide to use her collection of amusing animal stories to write a book that would help children ages 8-12 have a better understanding of dementia.</p>

What I can't do, WE CAN DO! 
How can I care for my loved one? What resources are available? How can I find what I need to help me care for my loved one? What next? 
When individuals are faced with the diagnosis that a family member has any form of dementia they are overwhelmed with questions.
With Alzheimer's disease cases mushrooming in numbers, we felt an advocacy packet to distribute upon diagnosis is long overdue. Resources are available, however, not always readily accessible. Our goal is to help make  resources more readily accessible to family members of all ages. 
Our objective is to provide an information packet to help families cope with the challenges of Alzheimer's Disease and to help the diagnosed individual. This packet does both, helps the families and their loved one; the family members will get much needed support which will help them become better care-givers. The knowledge and insight shared in this packet helps by providing more skills to deal with the problems that arise and more understanding of how this illness impacts their loved one. These skills  and understanding will go a long way toward easing the devastation of the journey for everyone involved.
As a group of authors we have each been impacted by the devastation of Alzheimer's Disease. We have come together with our respective books and unique experiences to offer support and resources that we could not find when we first started on our respective journeys. Our own experience has been there is a gap between books that are too clinical and sometimes depressing or written for medical professionals compared to hands-on, experiential, positive books that can connect lay people with professionals. It is our mission to fill that gap.

It’s been our experience there are not enough resources for children over the age of 6 or for adult family members and caregivers. Our mission is to fill this gap as a package resource for families as well as a resource for memory care advocates to provide interactive tools for their clients and patient families.
Our ""tag line"" is a quote from a disabled Veteran who through the support of other Veterans learned, ""What I can't do, WE can do""! 
Budget: $29,000.00 Goal includes expenses as approximated. Non-profit status will be applied for upon successful fundraising campaign.
Approximate Expenses:  Initial packet materials for number of packets (purchased from respective authors and participants at wholesale rates) to be determined by funds raised @ $50.00 per packet with the initial goal of 200 packets = $10,000.00; Design website: $5,000.00; Web Maintenance 2 Years - $4,000.00; Outreach/Marketing: Approximately 80 hours at $150.00 = $5,000.00; Miscellaneous Expenses, mailing materials, stationary supplies, communications, mileage, etc. - $5,000.00

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello! I am Dr. Igor Reizenson, DDS, dentist and inventor of the CLEARsmile device. My goal is to change the face of dental hygiene as we know it. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The CLEARsmile project is seeking to raise funds to develop a device that will replace the traditional toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and mouth rinse. It will allow kids, elderly, and everyone in between to have a much easier time keeping their teeth and gums clean and healthy.</p>
<p>The CLEARsmile device is essentially a pressure wash for your teeth and gums that hits every angle, simultaneously. It blasts and dissolves bad dental bacteria easily from every nook and cranny. The purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to build a fully functioning CLEARsmile prototype. Getting to the prototype stage is huge hurdle that I need to overcome in order to put a CLEARsmile device in homes everywhere. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I had a study done by Harvard Business graduates and determined that to get a working CLEARsmile prototype is going to cost about $750,000. And yes, I realize that is a seriously intimidating number! I've come up with some what I think are great incentives so I hope that you will seriously consider donating and becoming part of dental hygiene history.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I came up with the idea for CLEARSmile while working in the Veterans Hospital and doing my weekly rounds seeing elderly bed ridden patients not able to clean their teeth, and nurses not able to do it for them. This compromised their healing and increased their stay in the hospital.</p>
<p>I went from that residency to doing community dentistry on mobile buses for under privileged kids all across the state of Georgia. Providing dental care for these two populations revealed a great need for an oral hygiene device that would be quick, easy, predictable and effective.</p>
<p>I believe the CLEARsmile device can change the face of dental health by replacing traditional brushing and flossing methods for dental hygiene. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I realize that not everyone can make a donation to the CLEARsmile project and that's ok. There are other ways that you can help out. Fundraising thrives on getting the most number of people possibly to learn about a project. Even if you can't donate, please spread the word about CLEARsmile. Every little bit helps! </p>

What We Need & What You Get
I had a study done by Harvard Business graduates and determined that to get a working CLEARsmile prototype is going to cost about $750,000. And yes, I realize that is a seriously intimidating number!

The Impact
I came up with the idea for CLEARSmile while working in the Veterans Hospital and doing my weekly rounds seeing elderly bed ridden patients not able to clean their teeth, and nurses not able to do it for them. This compromised their healing and increased their stay in the hospital.
I went from that residency to doing community dentistry on mobile buses for under privileged kids all across the state of Georgia. Providing dental care for these two populations revealed a great need for an oral hygiene device that would be quick, easy, predictable and effective.

And if her mother can ""pay it forward"" and make this game happen, I'll be on the sidelines cheering with her.""  <br/>      David Loeb, MD, PhD Pediatric Oncologist, Johns Hopkins Hospital     <br/><br/>My daughter Kelly was 10 years old when she became violently and potentially fatally ill. After more than 2 years of various hospital stays, countless tests and incorrect diagnoses here in California, by the grace of God, we got her to Johns Hopkins Hospital &amp; University in Baltimore where she was ultimately properly diagnosed &amp; treated. She had a very rare autoimmune condition called collagenous gastroentercolitis, which means that her body was literally eating itself alive. She was given a chemotherapy drug called Cyclophosphamide (high-dose Cytoxen), not knowing if it would work, as it had only been used a few times on children with compromised immune systems. It re-booted her immune system and she slowly but surely kept getting better and better. She is now back to the healthy &amp; vibrant girl she once was. Nothing short of a miracle, really. Since her recovery, this treatment has now been opened up and offered to children who would have otherwise not been eligible due to a shortage of research funding and awareness for orphan diseases such as this. After watching my daughter being ushered to death's door, and then witnessing her literally coming back to life, I am faced with an overwhelming need to pay my blessings forward and to do everything in my power to make sure that this life-saving research continues. No child or family should ever have to ride this kind of a roller coaster.<br/><br/>""Under the Friday Night Lights"" is in honor of my daughter and the doctors who saved her life, and is a fundraising football game/concert to benefit childhood research at the #1 hospital in the world...Johns Hopkins. With its critical mass of world-class expertise, culture and cross-disciplinary collaboration and proven results, Johns Hopkins is leading the way to treatment and cure of childhood diseases. The game will raise money for (and hopefully awareness of) the plethora of illnesses that can strike a child at any given time without notice. It will bring this very worthy cause to light and bring the grand necessity of this research front and center. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Kelly was finally well enough to cheer for her high school football team (which was her only dream during her lengthy illness), who, during her senior year, went completely undefeated, even all the way through playoffs. They were and still are an amazing group of young men. Our small town of Windsor, California has so many similarities to the fictional town of Dillon, Texas, the setting for the TV series ""Friday Night Lights,"" all the way down to the personalities of the main characters vs. our real-life Windsor Jaguars. So what better way to celebrate life than by playing a charity football game??? We are officially challenging the cast of FNL to come up to Windsor and play against our undefeated Jags! The funding we would receive from you would go directly toward getting Kelly's story to the powers that be who developed the series, which would involve a business plan, promotional items (video, copyright permission, etc.), travel expenses, securing the field and a date, jerseys for the players, and going after major corporate sponsorship. Any funding above and beyond our needs would go directly to the Oncology and Immunology Research Departments at Johns Hopkins. Should the event fail to take place, any unused funds would go to those entities as well. I'd really like to have the event filmed so everyone could see it, not just Windsor or Sonoma County residents. That's also something I'd ask for in my pursuit, even if it's only something that you could watch online. <br/><br/>After the game, there will be a live band on the field for everyone, patron &amp; participant alike, to enjoy and to celebrate all that we will have achieved! A little fun to go with the fun, if you will...!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This project (and others like it) are potentially invaluable to the Oncology and Immunology Research communities. Our immune systems are responsible for every single cell and function in our bodies. None of us are exempt. Even something as simple as having seasonal allergies stems from the immune system. The reason I chose to do a benefit for Johns Hopkins is not quite as simple as you might think. While it's true that their doctors &amp; research saved my daughter's life, it goes even further than that...they actually share their information with other health organizations so that the WORLD may benefit from it, not just their community or those who are lucky enough to get there. The same cannot be said for most research facilities, even places like St. Jude. In addition, Hopkins has been the top hospital AND research facility for the majority of the last 20 years, so that should speak for itself.<br/><br/>Many of you may not know this, but before Kelly was born, I was a local band manager and promoter and I produced several benefits each year for local charities in the Bay Area. It was always my dream to resume that work when Kelly was a bit older, but when she got sick, I had to put all of that on the back burner. So in a way, I'm kind of picking up where I left off, but on a much grander scale, and for far more personal reasons. If I had the resources, I would do this every single year.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously, there are endless challenges and potential obstacles in my way in producing an event of this magnitude. I'm not gonna lie, this will be a huge undertaking, for sure, and at times, it will get overwhelming. But in all honesty, that's really what keeps me motivated! My bands (all 5 of them) gave me the name ""Super K"" many years ago, because there was nothing I wouldn't do or try for any of them. Together, we all achieved more than any of us ever dreamed we could. And I'm proud to say that to this very day, my reputation is still intact and as good as it was all those years ago. I believe that we are all in this game of life together, and that none of us are better than any other, regardless of ""what side of the tracks"" we come from. When Kelly got sick, it was almost as if I stepped out of my life and my role as her mother and became her protector and staunch advocate instead. That was the only way I was going to get through it. In a way, I was ""managing"" her health care. The risks were huge, and I had to walk a very fine line to keep the peace between her caregivers and our family on a daily basis. Her life literally depended on it. I did what I had to do, but I did it with respect and dignity, because if the tables were turned, that's what I would hope for and expect from others. After all that I've been through and watching my daughter waste away before my very eyes, dare I say, I'm really not afraid of anything anymore. Throw something in front of me and I'll either climb over it or go around it...or maybe I'll just walk right through it, but I WILL get to the other side!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>For those who may be unable to contribute monetarily, helping me spread the word would be just as valuable. Or for local folks, volunteering a service or helping at the event would be great. As I've said, I can't do this by myself. Together, we can all make this happen. There are share tools on the Indiegogo site that can help you help me, and, in turn, help the cause.<br/><br/>
</div></div>","""Children like Kelly, who endure so much, and emerge, looking as if nothing had ever happened, are the reason I do what I do. And if her mother can ""pay it forward"" and make this game happen, I'll be on the sidelines cheering with her.""        David Loeb, MD, PhD Pediatric Oncologist, Johns Hopkins Hospital     My daughter Kelly was 10 years old when she became violently and potentially fatally ill. After more than 2 years of various hospital stays, countless tests and incorrect diagnoses here in California, by the grace of God, we got her to Johns Hopkins Hospital & University in Baltimore where she was ultimately properly diagnosed & treated. She had a very rare autoimmune condition called collagenous gastroentercolitis, which means that her body was literally eating itself alive. She was given a chemotherapy drug called Cyclophosphamide (high-dose Cytoxen), not knowing if it would work, as it had only been used a few times on children with compromised immune systems. It re-booted her immune system and she slowly but surely kept getting better and better. She is now back to the healthy & vibrant girl she once was. Nothing short of a miracle, really. Since her recovery, this treatment has now been opened up and offered to children who would have otherwise not been eligible due to a shortage of research funding and awareness for orphan diseases such as this. After watching my daughter being ushered to death's door, and then witnessing her literally coming back to life, I am faced with an overwhelming need to pay my blessings forward and to do everything in my power to make sure that this life-saving research continues.

<p></p>
<p>No Time Wheysted’s number priority is to
provide assistance for individuals and help them achieve their bodybuilding and
fitness goals. </p>
<p>In doing so, we will provide a variety of
resources from credible sources ranging from articles and videos that will
educate the wider community on fitness facts, all for <b>FREE</b>. We understand that everyone is capable of finding their own
information through the internet, however it can often take hours on end
sifting and sorting through data especially when there are so many
contradictions in the fitness world. We understand how valuable the commodity
of time is and recognise that no one wants to spend countless hours finding
information, particularly if it’s incorrect, so why not leave that job for us,
and instead spend your time efficiently implementing accurate fitness tips from
one main resource, No Time Wheysted. </p>
<p>Our ambitions as company isn’t simply just
to provide correct information, as we also pride ourselves on staying ahead of
the curb, so that we can impart new bodybuilding &amp; fitness knowledge to our
community, as well as striving to help motivate and inspire a new generation of
healthy and fit individuals. </p>
<p>In addition, our goals to encourage people
to get in shape and reach their fitness goals not only will bring satisfaction
to everyone that succeeds, but it also illustrates that no goal is impossible.
Bodybuilding and fitness is very much of a mental task then it is a physical
one, and we believe that the mindset created and developed in the gym is able
to be transferred to any aspect of life. As a result, <b>NTW </b>aims to inspire
people to breaking new goals and setting new heights with their body, to set an
example for other aspects of their life. For what it’s worth, we also aim to
remove the void of hesitation, self-doubt and being stagnant and instead replace
it by a sense of determination, to willingly chase after any dream or ambition,
no matter how hard they may be.  </p>
<p>Finally, there is one more thing we also
wish to achieve and that is to grow this bodybuilding and the fitness industry
as a whole, through helping athletes all over the word gain the recognition
they deserve. We already have some very big athletes that have been
interviewed, but wish to hold them off until we attain a new website. </p>
<p>At the moment we have very limited
resources to make this movement a reality and need <b>YOUR</b> help to make this
possible. Until then, we will do our best and work with what we have to provide
you guys the information you need to achieve your own ambitions. </p> </div><div><br/></div><div>

<div>Hello there! Welcome to our project! We are three high school students who are starting up an organization to give back to our amazing Toronto community. Our goal is to provide hospital and retirement home waiting rooms with beautiful photo books packed with our original photographs taken from places all around the world. This is all in an effort to accelerate recovery in patients, as well as brighten the mood of everyone who visits. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Well I'm glad you asked, Internet friend! We are asking for $1000 to fund our project.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>We have created a stunning <b>20 page, full page, full colour, photo book</b> complete with our own photos from our various adventures. We are all passionate photographers and want to use our work for good, so <b>we want to print 20 of these books and hand deliver them to Toronto medical buildings and retirement homes!</b>
</div>
<div>
<i>Visit our website <a href=""http://www.awheart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.awheart.com</a> to view the photos that will be included in the book, and please email us at contact.artwithheart@gmail.com if you would like to suggest a waiting room in need of some uplifting art! </i><br/>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello there! Welcome to our project! We are three high school students who are starting up an organization to give back to our amazing Toronto community. Our goal is to provide hospital and retirement home waiting rooms with beautiful photo books packed with our original photographs taken from places all around the world. This is all in an effort to accelerate recovery in patients, as well as brighten the mood of everyone who visits.    What We Need

Well I'm glad you asked, Internet friend! We are asking for $1000 to fund our project.

We have created a stunning 20 page, full page, full colour, photo book complete with our own photos from our various adventures. We are all passionate photographers and want to use our work for good, so we want to print 20 of these books and hand deliver them to Toronto medical buildings and retirement homes!


Visit our website www.awheart.com to view the photos that will be included in the book, and please email us at contact.artwithheart@gmail.com if you would like to suggest a waiting room in need of some uplifting art! 



The money raised here will also be used to pay for our website, that when this campaign is over, will be open for people to sponsor a photo book and choose where they want it to be donated. A small portion of the funds raised in this campaign will be used to print and deliver the prints and photo books to our Silver, Gold and Platinum Sponsors! 


If we don't reach our ambitious $1000 goal in 60 days, we will simply lower the number of photo books that will be donated to fit the amount raised, and those books will still find a happy home in a waiting room near you. 


If we raise more than $1000 we will print and donate as many photo books as we can possibly afford! Check back on our website www.awheart.com and our Twitter @ArtWithHeart14 to see our progress!

Please note! We are not yet a not for profit organisation as we are raising the funds to do so! This means we are not yet legally allowed to issue tax receipts!
Perks
We have 4 different perks available; Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, and all donors will be listed as a sponsor at the back of our photo books.
You can find the descriptions for the perks on the right. For those that require image selection (Silver, Gold, and Platinum), please write down the item code of the photo you would like (photos and item codes can be found at www.awheart.com/ourgalleries/), and email us at contact.artwithheart@gmail.com with the information!

Hello, I'm Samantha hull. wife ,mother and the owner of the WFL .
 The WFL was founded by my husband and Fighter Jeremiah aka Thunder and was started just to be a way for him to let loose and have some fun with new people . But we soon seen that there was lots of people asking to see more. We were getting asked to come put on shows at Cons all over Florida and other places. Thats when we brought in CEO Frank White to help get this going and he told us about indiegogo to help with getting the ring made in time for the 1st WFL show at Ultracon of South Florida in Dec. 
 With this Ring we will be able to shoot the promo videos we need and hold the ranking fights before the 1st show in dec. Basically without this ring the wfl is dead in the water and the the dream of what we made here will be a out of reach fantasy.

<p>Blind Wrestling Beauty and the Beast</p>
<p>Introducing Clinton (Blind Wrestling Beauty) and
Marcus (The Beast) <br/></p>
<p>We are on a mission to reach our goal to be at the
Commonwealth Games in July 2014, in Glasgow Scotland. We wrestle out of Dilworth
Wrestling Club, Auckland and proudly represent New Zealand in freestyle
wrestling.</p>
<p>To get there we are asking for a little bit of your
help and kindness. To qualify for the Games we have been selected to represent
New Zealand at the upcoming Commonwealth Championships held in Johannesburg,
South Africa on the 5th of December 2013. With a top 5 performance this
will qualify us for a spot at the Glasgow Games. We are currently training 10 times a week to make this happen. </p>
<p>The trip will cost us just over $5000 each including travel and accommodation. Our goal is to raise $2000 to go towards our trip.</p>
<p>Clinton who is legally blind, has had an
illustrious wrestling career and has been huge inspiration to many around
the world. He is a role model and a true example that impossible is just a
word, and that with belief, hard work, and a never say die attitude that
anything is achievable.</p>

<p>Health professionals tell us we can go further. Body scanning can be applied to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epidemiology - Population studies</li>
<li>Diagnosis - Risk factors, deformity &amp; posture detection, endocrine issues, metabolism</li>
<li>Diet &amp; Weight - Helping to treat obesity and Diabetes Type II</li>
<li>Fitting - Supportive apparel, casts, prosthetics</li>
</ul>
<p>We enable tracking of every aspect of the body shape and size, both internally (volume) and externally (measurements). This can enable a much more full and accurate estimation of health over time than crude rules-of-thumb such as BMI. </p>

Choose everything from material and cut, to the finer details such as buttons, cuffs, and monograms. All of it is selected by you, made perfectly for you, and sure to become a treasured friend.</span></li>

<h3></h3>
<p><i></i></p>
<h2>Why this matters so much to us</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our founder Nell Watson's original concept was to help increase the adoption of advanced, low-waste manufacturing methods that can promote the up-skilling of textile workers. This could then lead to a revolution in clothing, <i>mass-customisation</i>. This means being able to produce personalised goods for prices approaching what you pay for standard issue.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The missing piece is the ability to easily get the specification of a person, so that goods can be easily custom-ordered. Solutions for this have so far had serious flaws:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Manual measurement is difficult to do alone, expensive to have done by an expert, and highly subjective.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Body scanners are very expensive, bulky, specialist equipment. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The MS Kinect (which our technology is forward-compatible with) is impressive, but not built for this purpose, and is not very portable. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Measurement by camera alone typically requires an inconvenient known 'marker', such as an A4 piece of paper or similar, as a reference for size. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Despite these problems, body measurement offers crucial benefit to a whole range of sectors; e-Commerce, Custom-fit, Health, and beyond. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We set out on a mission to solve the problems of access, ease of use, and complexity forever. This was our vision :</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited measurements: virtually the entire body can be measured, in any way you can imagine. Surface, cross sections, volumes of the body.<br/>
</li>
<li>Ease of use: No restrictions by where you can get yourself measured, and no need for any specialist markers. <br/>
</li>
<li>Access anywhere: Have your personal body data accessible wherever, or for whatever you might need it (commerce, health etc), but only ever be accessed with your permission.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After 2.5 years of continual development we're finally reaching our destination!</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>FAQ:</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can you really do this?</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes we can! We've spent over 2 years developing this technology from scratch. It works well, and when calibrated, is ready for commercial release. </span></p>
<p><b>Is it safe?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Yes, it only 'scans' using information from your camera, it's as safe as any picture. It's also very secure in terms of security and data (see below).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>How many times can I use it?</b> For all of the packages in the perks offered here: As many times and as often as you wish.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>So it really doesn't require any special hardware? </b>Indeed, the standard camera in your laptop, tablet or smartphone is enough (bear in mind, it requires specific poses taken by the system itself, you can't just import family photos!)</p>
<p><b>What accuracy can I expect?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> After calibration, we see an optimal accuracy of up to 8mm for circumferential measurements (around the body), and 3mm for linear measurements (such as limbs). This depends on having reasonable camera quality, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you scale the measurements? </b>The tech makes an estimate of height, and then asks the user to check it. This provides a scaling reference, and is MUCH more simple than using a fixed marker.</p>
<p><b>What are the limitations?</b> Currently, the technology needs </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Good lighting (bright, ideally not strong shadows).<br/>
</li>
<li>A reasonably un-cluttered background behind the user<br/>
</li>
<li>The user to be wearing thin clothing (ideally gym clothing or underwear) <br/>
</li>
<li>A decent camera (minimum 2 megapixels) is also required</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Over time, we aim to roll out new techniques to further compensate for all of these factors.</p>
<p><b>How many measurements do you take? </b>We can take over <a href=""100%20body%20measurements"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100 body measurements</a> by default, and can create extra, custom measurements upon request. Hands and feet are the most difficult measurements to capture, in general.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What about Data and Privacy?</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Everything is highly secured. All data is sent via secure SSL connection, and image data is never saved to disk, instead being processed on-the-fly and then immediately deleted. Data is only ever read by machine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In terms of Data Protection - your personal data belongs to you. We safeguard that data on your behalf, and port it to whichever application that YOU may explicitly choose to share your data with. </span></p>
<p><b>What are the general terms of use?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We're offering a special experience for people who back us today. You'll have access to special versions of our software, and will be treated to ongoing first-access to new features. It is our intention to provide gratis, unlimited scanning access to our backers (fair use applies) for a minimum of 12 months, and likely for much longer thereafter.</span></p>
<p><b>What platforms will I be able to run it on? </b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>PC or Mac with a Web GL compatible browser (Flash or HTML5) with a 2+ MegaPixel camera.<br/>
</li>
<li>iOS- iPhone 4s and above, iPad 2 and above.<br/>
</li>
<li>Android (coming 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Is a demo version available?</b></p>
<p>In times past we offered demos of our old prototypes to the public. However, we have major interface and technology upgrades coming in the near future. We feel that the old prototypes honestly no longer do justice in accurately illustrating the power of the forthcoming commercial version of the technology, so we've taken them down for the moment, to make them ready for general release.</p>

Measure your whole body
Track your fitness over time
Find or create products perfect for you





YOU were meant to fit in this world. 
With instant 3D body scanning, you can track your health as never before, find and source clothes made for your body and have a virtual avatar that is exactly YOU.


How to digitise your body in seconds

1. Launch the application on your device (PC/Mac, tablet, or smartphone), and enable your camera. Fit yourself or friend into the outline; two photos are taken automatically, when in the right position. 












2. The photos are then uploaded to the cloud, and automatically processed by a sophisticated algorithm we've created, in just a few seconds. This process separates person and background, and finds the body underneath (reasonably thin) clothing.





3. A unique 3D model is then rebuilt of the person scanned. This is presented as a 'mannequin', or an avatar, along with over 100 body measurements.




So simple, yet so many uses!


Finally, find clothes that really fit. Plug your measurements into partners to discover the perfect garment for you!
Be part of a new wave of customised goods and services for everyone!
Track your body & workouts! Motivate & Measure real improvement!
3D Print a mini version of yourself!

We're constructing so much more than a measurement widget - we're building a network. 
Imagine a simple, digital “passport” for your 3D body measurements. Tweet 


Plug it into any range of service providers that you choose (from e-commerce, custom-fit or health). 

Keep control over who can see what. 

Instantly customise your preferences, with just a click of a button.





We stand for revolutionary access to personalised goods and services



Questions:
Why do we still live in a world where people (many of them children) slave away to make cheap, disposable clothing? Much of it just ends up dumped, since by the time it's been made and shipped, fashion has already moved on.
Why is all of it made for some mystery standard person, who doesn't even exist, that doesn't match anyone very well?
Poikos believes in being able to quickly pinpoint your 'Goldilocks Garments', perfect for you.
Why is it that only the richest of people can afford to enjoy the comfort and privilege of personalised goods, such as clothing?
Poikos believes in a world where we can celebrate what makes us special. We believe in being able to actively choose those goods and services personal to us, at a price that we can all afford. 


Why try to fit into anyone else? Be yourself! Vive La Différence! 


We stand for revolutionary access to health





""And would some Power the small gift give us To see ourselves as others see us!..."" -Robert Burns


Changes in the body can sneak up on us slowly before we realise. See if your body is heading in the right direction! 

Our founder was trying to lose weight, and was curious about her true progress. She began scanning herself week by week, and used Poikos tech to predict her future body (better or worse based on current trends). 
Being able to see potential futures objectively gave her lasting motivation to lose more than 15kg over 5 months. Simple awareness of our body leads to much better health outcomes. Tweet







Health professionals tell us we can go further. Body scanning can be applied to:

Epidemiology - Population studies
Diagnosis - Risk factors, deformity & posture detection, endocrine issues, metabolism
Diet & Weight - Helping to treat obesity and Diabetes Type II
Fitting - Supportive apparel, casts, prosthetics

We enable tracking of every aspect of the body shape and size, both internally (volume) and externally (measurements). This can enable a much more full and accurate estimation of health over time than crude rules-of-thumb such as BMI. 
Great health cannot be expressed in just one number. Tweet




Poikos GATs - Global Anthropometry Tools


GATs enable you to analyse and make sense of your data.
Share your information securely with those who help you to manage your health.See how your body stats and health progress compare anonymously against the results of others in your area or demographic. Or, choose to go head-to-head with a friend or team!

We stand for creating a positive impact on humanity



We are determined to use this technology to help improve our world by supporting powerful new innovations.
We've been inspired to work towards improving the lives of 1 billion people over the next 10 years.
We're searching for partners in the social and charitable sphere who can apply our technology and expertise to help improve the world in collaboration with us.
Please get in touch with us if you share a similar vision of leaving a powerful legacy to the world. Nell's direct email: nell@poikos.com

Why we need your support today
After 2.5 years of tough development, our technologies for body measurement are almost ready. However, we now need to calibrate the system. We know that people expect accurate results, every time! 

We're inches away from the finish line. Our tech is proven. Final calibration on hundreds of early users takes both effort and money, because we need to do it fast but properly. 



We’ve invested more than $250k to get this far. We’ve won international awards for our unique approach to this age-old problem. Help nudge us over the finish line, and claim your place in history! YOU can make it happen!








Mmmm, perks!

To help to say 'thank you' for helping to get this out there, we have unique and awesome perks for you to choose from, from 3D avatars, to 3D-printed ""mini-me's"", to custom-fit clothing! Get yours, for as little as $25! Tweet








For our custom-clothing perks, we've chosen to collaborate with two garment manufacturers who particularly inspire us:

PretCastle is a zero-waste manufacturer, which uses unique, breakthrough technology (Direct Panel on Loom) to enable garments to be created thread-by-thread, rather than cutting a pattern out of a roll of material. This enables not only waste savings of 15%, but also creates advanced customisation capabilities, such as varying material elasticity in different parts of the garment.
Bombay Shirt Company offers men and women the ability to design their own unique custom-fitted shirt. Choose everything from material and cut, to the finer details such as buttons, cuffs, and monograms. All of it is selected by you, made perfectly for you, and sure to become a treasured friend.

Both PretCastle and Bombay Shirt Company are examples of the sorts of highly innovative, socially-minded ventures that our technology can support in partnership, and with whom we are proud to build an ecosystem.


What your money makes possible
Here's what your money will be spent on, in order of priority and impact:

Product development and calibration, testing and rapid improvement
Securing an ecosystem of partners to plug measurements into

Building an even stronger team, focussed on developing what users want

Ease of use: No restrictions by where you can get yourself measured, and no need for any specialist markers. 

Access anywhere: Have your personal body data accessible wherever, or for whatever you might need it (commerce, health etc), but only ever be accessed with your permission.



After 2.5 years of continual development we're finally reaching our destination!

FAQ:

Can you really do this? Yes we can! We've spent over 2 years developing this technology from scratch. It works well, and when calibrated, is ready for commercial release. 
Is it safe? Yes, it only 'scans' using information from your camera, it's as safe as any picture. It's also very secure in terms of security and data (see below).
How many times can I use it? For all of the packages in the perks offered here: As many times and as often as you wish.
So it really doesn't require any special hardware? Indeed, the standard camera in your laptop, tablet or smartphone is enough (bear in mind, it requires specific poses taken by the system itself, you can't just import family photos!)
What accuracy can I expect? After calibration, we see an optimal accuracy of up to 8mm for circumferential measurements (around the body), and 3mm for linear measurements (such as limbs). This depends on having reasonable camera quality, etc.
How do you scale the measurements? The tech makes an estimate of height, and then asks the user to check it. This provides a scaling reference, and is MUCH more simple than using a fixed marker.
What are the limitations? Currently, the technology needs 


Good lighting (bright, ideally not strong shadows).

A reasonably un-cluttered background behind the user

The user to be wearing thin clothing (ideally gym clothing or underwear) 

A decent camera (minimum 2 megapixels) is also required


Over time, we aim to roll out new techniques to further compensate for all of these factors.
How many measurements do you take? We can take over 100 body measurements by default, and can create extra, custom measurements upon request. Hands and feet are the most difficult measurements to capture, in general.

What about Data and Privacy? Everything is highly secured. All data is sent via secure SSL connection, and image data is never saved to disk, instead being processed on-the-fly and then immediately deleted. Data is only ever read by machine.
In terms of Data Protection - your personal data belongs to you. We safeguard that data on your behalf, and port it to whichever application that YOU may explicitly choose to share your data with. 
What are the general terms of use?
We're offering a special experience for people who back us today. You'll have access to special versions of our software, and will be treated to ongoing first-access to new features. It is our intention to provide gratis, unlimited scanning access to our backers (fair use applies) for a minimum of 12 months, and likely for much longer thereafter.
What platforms will I be able to run it on? 


PC or Mac with a Web GL compatible browser (Flash or HTML5) with a 2+ MegaPixel camera.

iOS- iPhone 4s and above, iPad 2 and above.

Android (coming 2014)

Is a demo version available?
In times past we offered demos of our old prototypes to the public. However, we have major interface and technology upgrades coming in the near future. We feel that the old prototypes honestly no longer do justice in accurately illustrating the power of the forthcoming commercial version of the technology, so we've taken them down for the moment, to make them ready for general release.
Any other questions? Please either leave a comment, or get in touch with the team.

<h3>Hello all,</h3>
<p>My name is Luke Tungesvick and I am a born and raised Colorado native with a passion for the environment. Our forests have recently been plagued by both bugs and fire alike leaving many trees needing to be cleared. The wood is harvested but the top branches or crown is left behind as waste. This material, that was previously burnt off as useless, is actually where the tree stores all of the nutrients it's been collecting and we extract these nutrients using the tree's own static electricity to disintegrate the pine to powder. This is wonderful because it both solves what to do with this previously useless material, as well as helps to create some of the best soap in the market.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Essentially, I am requesting $10,000 to help progress the scale of the business (ramp up production) as well as investigate the use of a bio-degradable jar. It is currently a one man operation but we have much greater aspirations!</p>
<p>With every pledge you will get your own bottle(s) of Pinerite. You have to try it to believe it, but it sincerely is the best cleaner you will ever use. </p>
<p>Even if the full goal is not reached we will still use the funds procured to further this project as far as possible, be it only scaling up, the new jar or vice-versa. Every penny will be stretched.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p>This campaign's benefits speak for itself. We are using essentially no electricity, have no polluting runoff, and use a material previously considered wasteful, to create quite literally the best general cleaner ever. Moreover the pine crowns we need are literally everywhere in the Rocky Mountains and desperately need to be cleared out from the effects of the beetles and the blazes. I hate to sound like a broken record but it is WITH-OUT QUESTION THE BEST soap you will ever use. </p>
<p>I really appreciate every single one of you even taking the time to learn about this new technology and the amazing products spawning from it. If you do not wish to pledge please just stay aware of new ethical products that are striving to better our planet!</p>
<p>Educate yourselves, Knowledge is power!</p>

<p>           My name is Chad Deaver, I am a Parkour
Instructor and Personal Trainer, and I am opening the first parkour gym in
Dallas to provide safe equipment and knowledgeable instruction to the North Texas area. I was
certified through World Freerunning and Parkour Federation (WFPF) in January
2013, CrossFit in September 2011, and Cooper Institute in October 2013.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago in high school,
as captain of the Berkner wrestling team, I began to help others
understand the way the body works and achieve their athletic and fitness goals.
I went on to receive my Bachelor's from UTD, during which time I fell in love
with both parkour and CrossFit. I began acquiring certifications and training
experience on the side, so that one day I could realize my dream of
opening the first parkour gym in Dallas!</p>
<p>Parkour is exploding in popularity across the
globe as an exciting new discipline with positive core values and real life
application. Since most people's exposure is through YouTube videos and
not proper training, it has been misunderstood.  At it's heart, parkour is
simply the discipline of training the body to traverse obstacles within the environment in the safest, most efficient way possible.</p>
<p>There are so many people throughout this
region who are looking for a place to safely learn and train in parkour. Cities
like Austin, Houston, and San Antonio all have parkour gyms. Current traceurs
need a place to train other than gymnastics facilities which hold ""open
gym"" once a week, grant limited access to equipment, and provide an
unrealistically padded/springy environment. Children and adults inspired by
shows like American Ninja Warrior are constantly posting on social media sites
trying to locate a facility that teaches parkour classes. Everyone from children to grandparents can benefit from the improved coordination, balance, agility, and strength that parkour training yields. Our facility will
provide all these people with a safe place to train, especially during extreme
and inclement weather.  Fugitive Fitness will allow for people of lower skill or fitness
level to build up to the bigger moves that they see online, rather than having
to go outside and face the potential dangers. We will also provide some of the
most effective strength and conditioning coaching available to ensure the
safety and success of our students. The combination of skill and technique with
strength and conditioning will provide practitioners of any age a functional
fitness with benefits throughout their lives. </p>
<p>We will definitely be opening very soon, but
we are still about $8000 short of our start-up goal. Here is your chance to be
a part of something huge in the DFW community. Donations can get you everything
from T-shirts and bandanas to free memberships and memorial plaques. Please
contribute whatever you can, but most importantly spread the word! We need
everyone in Dallas to know who we are, where we are, and what we are doing for
parkour and fitness in the North Texas area. Please help however you can
and we'll be training together soon!</p>

One has to Take into account many different factors for the surgery let alone the factors for travel to and from, recovery, and making sure the videographer and all their tools get there on time as well.Certain surgeons lost favor when we researched them and found they'd run into complications, their end results looked lack luster, or the patient accounts of a positive nature. I want to remind you all that vaginoplasty is a major surgery involving one's major sexual organs. Being cheap and risking it on ill equipped or lack luster surgeons can mean ending up with a colostomy bag for the rest of your life and a Barbie doll genital region. What stability could a girl suffering from gender disphoria find then if they lack any genitalia at all? Risks of rectal breaches, infection, and a host of gruesome after affects abound all responsible transitioners must at some point take into account prior to deciding on surgery and surgeon.There is a long recovery period were one will have trouble doing day to day things from 2-3 weeks to a month in a half depending on how surgery goes and how their unique body reacts. I'd like to note we are not asking for aid in travel expenses, work time lost due to recover, or the amount more it'll cost once taxes have been added onto the figures.The decision to go with Dr. Mcginn over anyone else had to do with a sound tract record, her unique view point being a post operative transsexual woman herself, her end result images and discussions we've had with real people who've gone to her for this particular operation. She is the next cheapest elite surgeon after Dr. Suporn and she is only a few states away vs the entire Pacific Ocean.The $2,000 over is taking into account the 4% service fee of IndiegogoSharing TimelinesThe following is a a link to Korinne's full timeline Korinne's Living TimelineThe Following is a timeline from Kelly Klaymour's transition process:",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The Nashville Rollergirls All Stars are going to Playoffs! It's that time again... the Nashville Rollergirls All Stars are headed to Division 1 WFTDA Playoffs in Evansville, Indiana on September 19, and we need your help to finish out the season successfully! 
2014 has been a banner season for the All Stars. After ending the 2013 season ranked #39, we scheduled a demanding 2014 season with more travel and home games than ever to provide our young All Star team with the experience needed to compete at the highest levels. It's paid off! We've steadily climbed the rankings every month this year, and we're going to playoffs this year ranked #31 in the world.  
The Nashville Rollergirls All Stars have played 17 games since February 2014 We've been rising in the WFTDA worldwide rankings from 2013 #39 to current #31
We've faced tough competition from teams ranked high above us including Toronto (#23), Ohio (#20) and Minnesota (#5) 2014 has included travel to Columbus OH, Cincinnati OH, Bloomington IN, Atlanta GA, Columbia SC, Ft. Lauderdale FL and soon, Evansville IN for playoffs 
Roller Derby is EXPENSIVE.
 The 2014 season has been taxing on the wallets of our All Stars. Earlier in the year, our travel to Ft. Lauderdale, FL cost more than $600 per skater. This weekend, we're traveling to Atlanta for a playoffs-prep scrimmage with the #13 Atlanta Rollergirls. 2014 marks the first season in the history of NRG that all 20 All Star team members have competed on a game roster, which means we're more competitive than ever - But it also means that we have more skaters regularly traveling and bouting than ever!
Did you know...?  
A set of Nashville Rollergirls jerseys costs each skater $100, and they have to be replaced every year or two. A good set of knee pads costs $100, and knee pads should be replaced every 6-12 months for maximum protection! Add $30 for elbow pads, $20 for wrist guards, $40 for a shiny black team helmet, $20 for toe stops (replaced every few months) and a whopping $500 or more for a solid pair of skates. The cost of roller derby gear is staggering! 2014 travel costs will exceed $1,000 per skater this year, and that doesn't include the unpaid time off many skaters have to take from work. Don't forget about our coaches, officials and announcers who travel with us too! Travel costs for the league this year will top $20,000 and it comes straight out of our pockets.  
  Here's where YOU come in: 
The Nashville Rollergirls have been so fortunate to partner with the world-renowned locals at Anderson Design Group to become part of their iconic Spirit of Nashville collection. The original artwork they created for our poster is featured alongside local legends like the Ryman Auditorium, Cheekwood, the Bluebird Cafe, Centennial Park and more.

These posters are beautiful. The vibrant original artwork is printed on high quality, thick poster paper and the posters have been stored flat to prevent dings, creases and tears. Each poster is hand-numbered out of 100, and the first few buyers will receive copies signed by the illustrator! 
 
For $40, you can own one of the first 100 prints of the Nashville Rollergirls Spirit of Nashville poster.  For $50, you can have your poster signed by one Nashville Rollergirl of your choice. For $100, you can have your poster signed by the entire 2014 All Star team!


To save on packaging and shipping costs, we'll offer local pickup at our September 14 game at the state fair, as well as a few other TBD local Nashville pickup dates over the next month or two. 

If you don't live in Nashville but still want to support us, we're happy to ship to you! Please select the support level that includes a small fee to cover the cost of poster tubes and shipping.

<p>My name is Jayne, my husband Bill and I have a beautiful daugher, Gena who will turn 30 in March and is the most amazing person.  Gena was born with congenital heart defects and has had health issues and surgeries throughout her life.  Gena's heart valves both quit working three years ago and they had to be replaced, she now has two tissue valves.  It was a surgery she would have not made it through were it not for her strength.  She was in the ICU for 66 days and was the sickest person at the Hospital for several weeks.  A flap from her belly was used to close her chest as they were unable to close her sternum. </p>
<p>I started writing her story and my Mother wanted to put it in her blog, so it was finished by her and here are the links to read and see a few pictures.</p>

<p> Gena lost the muscle and feeling in her left leg from a clot in her foot while sedated and chest still open in the ICU.  They were unable to give her anything to break up the clot for fear it would travel toher heart.  Much dead tissue was removed after they were able to close her chest with a flap from her belly.  She is undergoing physical therapy to get the use of her left leg better so it's not causing the right leg to overwork.  She had surgery to have the foot held up permanently instead of having her toes pointed down as they were. </p>
<p>Gena has always been independent so not working has been an adjustment for her.  She volunteers at a kitty rescue in Charlotte near her home and works on her legs with her husband at night.  She wants to be able to stand for long periods without pain. </p>
<p>Her and her husband are involved in a PT Cruiser Car Club and Gena's is decorated like Hello Kitty. There goal is to move to Colorado and eventually start a family.  If Gena isn't able to carry a baby full term, adopt or have a gestational carrier.  They will make wonderful parents some day.</p>

Summary of Placebo Effect Campaign



Placebo Effect - the world's most trafficked online placebo resource - is building the world's first mobile placebo application, one that takes the placebo effect out of the lab and brings it into people’s lives so you and others around the world can experience more love, joy, inspiration, or whatever you feel you need in your lives. 



We've built a prototype of the app (Watch us demo the Placebo App), and now we need your help to fund building a production version that can scale to support you and millions of people around the world.

About Placebo Effect



Placebo Effect was created in December of 2011 by Daniel Jacobs with one simple directive: to educate people all over the world about the placebo effect, and to inspire people to learn to use it to heal, grow, and evolve in their lives!


Placebo Effect, our website (pictured below) is now the world’s most trafficked online placebo effect resource. We also have created a methodology for using the placebo effect in people’s lives that has been practiced around the world.


We have developed a prototype placebo app that is based on our Placebo Methodology, and on all existing placebo effect research. Now its time to turn our Placebo App prototype into Placebo App that can change the lives of millions of people around the world.




 
Why the Placebo App



Placebo effects happen when peoples' belief systems - both conscious and unconscious - inspire positive change. The results, oftentimes, can be staggering: tumors can heal, anxiety can go away, academic performance can increase... all because someone took a placebo.


Different people have different conscious and unconscious beliefs in different circumstances. The same experience could provide one person with a strong placebo effect, and create no placebo effect for another person.


Until now there has been no way to provide people with a personalized placebo effect that is aligned with their own experiences - despite the demonstrable effectiveness of placebos across medical studies. We decided to change that!



Most of us haven't even begun to tap our own healing, growing, and performance potential - because we've been taught that pills, people, or procedures know better about what we need than we do. The Placebo App shows us how powerful we really are!

Typically a project of this magnitude would be well into six-figure range. Due to strategic partnerships and the team’s experience level, we will be able to make placebo magic with much less.


Funds above $50,000 will be spent on Stage II development, which includes further optimizing the application based on community feedback, readying the app for important clinical trial testing, and sharing the app with millions of people around the world.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Caelan was injured in a bicycle accident on September 23, sustaining a sever brain injury.  He also lost his mother to pancreatic cancer in May this year, so the family has faced a good bit of difficulty.  Caelan has been doing really well in rehab for the injury, and we hope to have him home in November.  His Dad (ME!) would like to be home during the home rehab stages, but we do not have the funds available to do that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Given the other stresses on the family this year, I would dearly love to be able to be home for Caelan's transition from the hospital to normal life.  He will likely need extensive outpatient therapy sessions once he is released, and I want to be available for that.  I can take the family leave (FMLA) time off, but still need to pay bills.  The goal is to have enough gifts to cover at least 2 months of expenses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Caelan is (if I may be allowed to brag) an exceptional boy, and has already faced enough challenges.  Funding this campaign would allow for our family to better meet his needs as he comes home and prepares for the remaining steps in his recuperation.  Anything over our basic monthly bills will be put into a scholarship fund for Caelan.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give, let others know about Caelan, and please pray for his continued recovery.</p>

Why do We Believe in Finishing and Why Should You?

Proof! Yes, it is that simple. The only reason that Finishing began is because it quickly began showing me results. After losing the use of my left arm from C5 Palsy, I was serious about finding something to help. Finishing was a large component of my success in the healing process. Since that time we have seen the research produce incredible numbers of improvement among the participants.


So what's so different about Finishing compared to other workouts?
Finishing is proving itself to be revolutionary in terms of how we view exercise and workouts. Let's be clear, fitness and health is not about one magic pill, diet, workout, or piece of equipment. Health and fitness comes from a combination of things that develop into our lifestyle and habits. When it comes to fitness you have two main areas that people go to, cardio or resistance training. i.e. running or lifting weights. Finishing is unique in that it safely develops the user by working the entire body through a combination of both cardio and resistance training in the same functional workout. 
Here are the key points.
1. Entire Body - unlike running or cycling or even swimming, Finishing works the entire body; legs, hips, back, abs, chest, arms, and shoulders. Working the body in a full range of motion to develop strength, endurance and flexibility.
2. Cardio - because we are working through timed intervals, there is no planned time for rest in the middle of the workout. You are in motion the entire time. The overall quality of the Cardio benefit is directly related to the intensity of the workout. You decide.
3. Resistance Training - Because we are sliding a weight across a surface, we experience resistance. That resistance places a load on the body that the body must build itself in order to meet and successfully overcome in order to perform the motion.
4. Functional Workout - This has been a key trait of Finishing. Our motions and exercises are using the body in the same way you would use your body in your daily activities. Whether it's swinging a golf club or picking something up from the ground. We teach the body to understand how to move and then strengthen the body to move efficiently and effectively.
5. Safely - Yes, I have seen and done other workouts that will make similar claims, the one that first comes to mind is Crossfit. Don't get me wrong I love to workout and love a challenge, and even love doing various aspects of these workouts, but the number of people that I have seen or read about that are getting hurt from the ""functional"" movement exercises performed during their ""workout of the day"" is staggering. The problem is often due to poor form, excessive intensity, or simply doing moves that your body cannot support without leaving them susceptible to getting injured.

2007, my mother passed of Colon Cancer and I wanted to find a unique way to

my passions. I thought to myself,  ""What better way to give back than

</div>
<div>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Beenie. I'm teaming up with Princess Hair Shop, a primarily online hair extensions company, to raise money for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Our goal is $1,000. Like so many others, I have had family members and friends that have been impacted by breast cancer. Witnessing those close to me battle breast cancer and seeing the physical changes being just an indication of the struggles and pains they are dealing with has made me so appreciative of all of the small things I have in my life. One of those small things that I've become so appreciative of is my hair. My hair is currently 31"" long, something not many people can say. However, I am ready to chop it all off and donate it to Locks of Love.</p>
<p>When my friend lost her hair during her fight, she always joked about how I should cut my hair for her. I wasn't joking when I said I would. It seems like such a small thing, but growing up as the kid that had the ridiculously long hair, I know the sense of identity something as simple as hair can bring.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown. I'll cut around 15 inches of my hair off and donate it to Locks of Love if the fundraising goal of $1,000 for Komen for the Cure is met. In return you'll get to see what I'd look like with short hair (which you totally care about...right?) and a feeling of amazingness. Also I'll send you a picture of Nic Cage, by request. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word! If you don't want to donate here, you can always support the cause by donating on the Susan G. Komen website, donating your hair to Locks of Love, or on many other websites. Also, Race for the Cure is coming up soon! Make sure you sign up! I'll see you there :) </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are Airborn Academy, an internationally recognised, professional Freerunning and Parkour group who are completely passionate about this breathtaking innovation of movement. We have successfully delivered a wide range of Freerunning and Parkour projects in Merseyside and throughout the UK and currently offer coached classes, freestyle sessions, workshops and demonstrations across all age ranges, abilities and skill levels.</p>

<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tR0VM_oGDvs?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>We are eager to share our enthusiasm and coaching experience to encourage our communities to get involved in this exceptional discipline and experience the positive impact it can have on wellbeing, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>The time is right for us to flip to the next chapter of the Airborn story and help shape the future of Freerunning and Parkour ...</p>
<p><strong>So, what's next?</strong></p>
<p>Our vision is to open a state of the art, purpose built, urban sports centre called the ‘Airborn Academy’. This will primarily focus on the training and development of Freerunning and Parkour within a safe but completely unique and exciting environment, but will also offer a multitude of other urban sports classes including tricking, trampolining, cheerleading, martial arts, breaking and other urban dance, gymnastics and aerial skills.</p>
<p>After over a year of searching and hard work getting our plans together, we now have the ideal venue ... next, we need to create the perfect facility including a sprung floor, tumble tracks, crazy obstacles, and inspiring bar and multi-levelled areas.</p>
<p><strong>What we need ...</strong></p>
<p><b>In this pitch we are asking for £17,000 for two major pieces of equipment for the Airborn Academy: </b></p>
<p><b>*   £10,000 for the state of the art, bespoke designed foam pit </b></p>
<p><b>*   £7,000 for the 8 metre long fast track </b></p>
<p>The foam pit is awesome and a central piece in the design layout of the Airborn Academy. It is essential for teaching safe landing of Freerunning and gymnastics movements and is also a lot of fun!</p>
<p>The fast track is a trampoline-based run up leading into the pit and is a vital piece of equipment allowing students to safely practice and develop their skills; from complete beginners to the advanced athletes. It reduces impact on joints, assists in learning new movements and helps develop confidence. </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits to the community?</b></p>
<p>Those who try it really engage in Freerunning and Parkour, especially young people who may not connect with the usual mainstream sports offered in schools. They have a lot of fun mastering skills and movement they would not have thought themselves capable of, in a non-competitive environment, plus there are the huge benefits participating in this activity also brings:</p>
<p><em>Improves health and wellbeing.</em></p>
<p><em>Increases engagement in sports and urban arts especially in the youth.</em></p>
<p><em>Diverts anti-social behaviour within teenagers and young adults towards positive activities, which will in turn benefit and improve the local c</em><em>ommunities and neighbourhoods.</em> </p>
<p><em>Increases confidence and self esteem.</em></p>
<p><em>Inclusion in the community; this activity really promotes a sense of family and belonging amongst the students.</em></p>
<p><em>Offers possible opportunities to participate in displays, events, television and online media.</em></p>
<p><strong>When will the Airborn Academy open?</strong></p>
<p>We will open our doors in 2013 to develop and support the urban sports culture and provide a venue for our students to use the freedom of movement and their imagination to get creative and progress their skills and talents in their chosen disciplines.</p>
<p>We hope you are excited as we are about this worthwhile project ... please check out the links to our website and YouTube media below to give you further information about the Airborn Academy and what we are all about.</p>

<p><b>OUR STORY</b></p>
<h3>13 Years Ago...</h3>
<p>Our dad was diagnosed with stage four Prostate Cancer. </p>
<p>He had gone in for a random checkup when they found it. He had no symptoms. There was no warning. He was only fifty years old.</p>
<p>The doctors told him if he didn't begin treatment immediately, he would not survive another six months.</p>
<p>That was 13 years ago.</p>
<p>Thanks to a last-minute detection, his doctors and the research that went into developing the cutting-edge treatments that saved his life, our dad is still with us today. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">But for thousands of families across the country, the journey is just beginning:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The American Cancer Society has predicted that about 238,590 new cases of Prostate Cancer will be diagnosed this year. About 29,720 men will die of Prostate Cancer.</span></li>
<li>It is the second most common, and second most fatal, cancer in men in the United States.</li>
<li>1 man in 6 will be diagnosed with Prostate Cancer in his lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>1 in 6. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It's time to get tough on Prostate Cancer. </i></p>

OUR STORY
13 Years Ago...
Our dad was diagnosed with stage four Prostate Cancer. 
He had gone in for a random checkup when they found it. He had no symptoms. There was no warning. He was only fifty years old.
The doctors told him if he didn't begin treatment immediately, he would not survive another six months.
That was 13 years ago.
Thanks to a last-minute detection, his doctors and the research that went into developing the cutting-edge treatments that saved his life, our dad is still with us today. 
But for thousands of families across the country, the journey is just beginning:


The American Cancer Society has predicted that about 238,590 new cases of Prostate Cancer will be diagnosed this year. About 29,720 men will die of Prostate Cancer.
It is the second most common, and second most fatal, cancer in men in the United States.
1 man in 6 will be diagnosed with Prostate Cancer in his lifetime.

1 in 6. 

It's time to get tough on Prostate Cancer. 
The BlueZone and the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Chicago
The BlueZone is a Goro family organization dedicated to raising funds and awareness to aid in the fight against Prostate Cancer. This year, we'll be hosting our first annual PCL (Prostate Cancer League) BlueZone Kickoff Classic on the football fields of Lincoln Park between Montrose and Wilson. Any and all proceeds will go to benefit the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Chicago.


The Tournament - November 16, 2013 
7 on 7, co-ed flag football. 
10 players per team, 12 player max. There MUST be 3 girls on the field at all times. No exceptions. (That's on the field, not on the sidelines.) 
Two rounds of pool play and then bracket play. Each team is guaranteed at least three games.
Two, ten-minute halves per game with a five-minute halftime.
$250 entry fee per team. Captains, sign up your teams. First come, first serve so don't wait to sign up!
Donations and Sponsors


Sponsors
Sponsors will have their company, business or family name printed on the back of the 200+ event shirts. Event sponsors will also have their company, business or family name on banners at the November 16 event.

<h2>The Supplements You Want At The Prices You Want!</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Who We Are &amp; What We Want To Do</span></p>
<h3>The Service</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to buy supplements without the hassle of the big stores, like GNC, with their car salesman-like employees and high prices? Or, do you buy the cheap stuff at Wal-mart and want to try something higher quality at a still low price? Or are you just looking for a more convenient solution? FlexBundle.com is an online subscription service we created to deliver sports nutrition supplements to more mainstream fitness advocates who want convenience, great deals, and quality without the hassle of stores and the confusing multitude of options. We see this industry as one that is growing; in 2012 alone the vitamin, mineral, and supplement category generated $32 billion in revenue and Forbes listed it as one of the fastest growing industries. The online sale of these products isn't new, but for sport enthusiasts the current solutions are too cluttered and geared towards hardcore users. We want to help more maintstream people find the product types that suit their bodies and goals and then allow them to receive them automatically every month.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Our small team of web developers and fitness enthusiasts, the creators of FlexBundle.com, are led by brothers Justin and Trevor. Young and enthusiastic, both have a combined 14 years of experience in web development and several years as gym-goers and nutrition enthusiasts. Starting out young in the web development game, both of us began competing in high school as members of Business Professionals of America in the web competitions. This gave of a strong foundation in commercial web creation, competition, and lit the entrepreneurial spirit within. Following our high school years, we sharpened our skills working for web development firms, computer science research institutes in college, and by completing many websites and mobile apps for local businesses and organizations. Besides our interest in web, we both love the fitness and nutrition science, culture, and practice. By learning about supplementation and exercise from books, blogs, and many other sources, we were able to harden our once soft, squishy bodies and lead healthier lives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need To Continue</h2>
<p>As development of this service is nearly complete, we need your assistance to get us off the ground. We've done the work build the service but we need to buy an initial stock of products. We limit our variety to only quality, inexpesive versions of each product type, making it easier on beginner and intermediate gym-goers. We need approximately $3,000 to buy our initial stock of products, including all product types and flavors in appropriate initial quantities. Here are the products we plan on carrying initially:</p>

<p><strong><span><span>We make maps that improve the delivery of healthcare to people in need. Working collaboratively with our NGO customers, we produce maps and data graphics designed to reflect the ground truth of the people they serve, help track and improve operations and reveal strategic opportunities. Our mission includes training in order to leave behind basic GPS skills for capturing vital data, so the maps can adapt dynamically with the needs of our customers and the people they serve.</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Our two team members graduated from Middlebury College, where we both majored in Geography and minored in global health. While at Middlebury, we were both struck by the potential of mapping to improve public health. Maps, we realized, are an easy tool for understanding the scope and scale of a problem, for planning the best interventions to address that problem, and for communicating the efficiency of an intervention to others. With this in mind, we recently launched Broad Street Maps, a consulting service that helps small health organizations improve their services by ""putting patients on the map.""<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.4541090428829193""><br/><br/><span>What we do</span></strong></p>
<p>More specifically, Broad Street Maps equips grassroots health organizations with open-source mapping techniques to visualize and improve their services.  Maps provide the visualization and context to make sense of often incomprehensible data. We aim to support small health organizations by designing and implementing individualized mapping projects. By collecting spatial data using a GPS and combining it with existing health information to produce maps, organizations can illustrate the geographic distribution of the problems they seek to address, bringing better services to where they're needed most.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.4541090428829193""><br/><br/><span>Our project in Peru</span><br/></strong></p>
<p>After a successful first project with Gardens for Health, International (<a href=""http://gardensforhealth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gardensforhealth.org</a>) in Rwanda in the summer of 2012, we are traveling to Peru on March 1st to complete a project with a small organization called Sacred Valley Health (<a href=""http://www.sacredvalleyhealth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sacredvalleyhealth.org</a>). While the project with Gardens for Health focused on mapping cases of malnutrition, <strong>the project with Sacred Valley Health is aimed at getting a better picture of where tuberculosis and diarrheal cases are most prevalent. The maps that we make with Sacred Valley Health will enable the organization to better understand where the hotspots of disease are so that they can maximize their limited resources and manpower and get treatment to their most vulnerable patients.</strong></p>

We make maps that improve the delivery of healthcare to people in need. Working collaboratively with our NGO customers, we produce maps and data graphics designed to reflect the ground truth of the people they serve, help track and improve operations and reveal strategic opportunities. Our mission includes training in order to leave behind basic GPS skills for capturing vital data, so the maps can adapt dynamically with the needs of our customers and the people they serve.
broadstreetmaps.org
Our two team members graduated from Middlebury College, where we both majored in Geography and minored in global health. While at Middlebury, we were both struck by the potential of mapping to improve public health. Maps, we realized, are an easy tool for understanding the scope and scale of a problem, for planning the best interventions to address that problem, and for communicating the efficiency of an intervention to others. With this in mind, we recently launched Broad Street Maps, a consulting service that helps small health organizations improve their services by ""putting patients on the map.""What we do
More specifically, Broad Street Maps equips grassroots health organizations with open-source mapping techniques to visualize and improve their services.  Maps provide the visualization and context to make sense of often incomprehensible data. We aim to support small health organizations by designing and implementing individualized mapping projects. By collecting spatial data using a GPS and combining it with existing health information to produce maps, organizations can illustrate the geographic distribution of the problems they seek to address, bringing better services to where they're needed most.Our project in Peru
After a successful first project with Gardens for Health, International (http://gardensforhealth.org) in Rwanda in the summer of 2012, we are traveling to Peru on March 1st to complete a project with a small organization called Sacred Valley Health (www.sacredvalleyhealth.org). While the project with Gardens for Health focused on mapping cases of malnutrition, the project with Sacred Valley Health is aimed at getting a better picture of where tuberculosis and diarrheal cases are most prevalent. The maps that we make with Sacred Valley Health will enable the organization to better understand where the hotspots of disease are so that they can maximize their limited resources and manpower and get treatment to their most vulnerable patients.

Looking ahead:
After Peru, we have office space in the North End of Boston. Our efforts will be spent primarily on pursuing new clients. Additionally, we will focus on developing more comprehensive training materials and project evaluation strategies. 
Where will the money go?
The money we raise in the first stage we will use to cover start-up costs and prepare for May, when we will have completed the field work for our Peru-based client, and will establish our base of operations as a hybrid organization (both a 501C3 organization and an LLC) in a social enterprise incubator in Boston. 
$5000: Business costs, including office space, software (e.g. Adobe Suite), and computers.
$5000: Operational expenses for the first six-months
We intend to raise additional funds through grants, building on the success we have had in securing grants for our work in 2012, and we have applications under consideration. By early 2014, our plan calls for balancing the sources of capital with roughly 40% coming from grants, 40% coming from fees paid by our clients, and 20% from founding investors.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi friends and family.  As many of you know I am a former military pilot.  Flying has been a passion of mine since I was a small child.  Thankfully I was able to achieve my childhood dream of growing up and serving as a U.S. Air Force pilot.  </p>
<p>Aside from the missions I flew while in the Air Force, this cause presents the first time I am able to do good and utilize my flying and talents to benefit others.  I feel very fortunate for some basic things that are easiliy taken for granted at times--health, education, opportunity, etc.  The kids that I am flying with have not been as fortunate.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Flying isn't cheap.  It will cost me roughly $140 per hour to opperate the aircraft.  With an expected total of four (4) flying hours, that comes to $560.  I plan to fly as many kids as I can in this projected time frame.  </p>
<p>I'd gladly pay it all myself, but obviously there are reasons I am here seeking your assistance.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Builds self-esteem and confidence of children and youth with specials needs, through the experience of flight.  Can you imagine how excited these kids will be to have this opportunity?!</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, if you can't help out on the financial end...I simply ask that you help me in my efforts by sharing this fundraising request with your friends and family.  </p>

<p><b><u>Whats All This About?</u></b></p>
<p>Hello
I am a 35 year old couch potato trying to do something special in 2014.  That special deed will be whipping myself
into shape to complete 260 miles worth of endurance events to raise money for
Kenzie, an amazing little boy.  The
programme will involve distance running, road cycling, swimming and Triathlons
to raise money in support of Kenzie’s Wish Fund.</p>
<p><b><u>Kenzies Wish </u></b></p>
<p>At
the age of 6 weeks old Kenzie started to develop eating dissorders which meant
he has to be fed through a tube down his nose. 
Kenzie is waiting for a gastrostamy (a tube into his tummy) along with
another operation</p>
<p>for
oesophageal reflux where his doctor will wrap his stomach </p>
<p>around
the oesophagus tubes.</p>
<p>Kenzie
is under a number of specialist doctors who believe he may also have  suspected Angelman Syndrome, Autism and is an
Albino which means he has visual impairment.</p>
<p>Kenzie
also has communication difficulties and recently, has also been diagnosed with
severe scoliosis which means he has a curve </p>
<p>on
his upper and lower spine which causes distortion in muscles and the ribs.</p>
<p>Kenzie
cannot stand unaided without specialist equipment that he has had to borrow.</p>
<p>Kenzie’s
Wish Fund has been started with a wide range of events raising invaluable funds
to help towards specialist equipment to support</p>
<p>physical/mental
sensory needs ensuring the best life possible.</p>
<p>All
of the proceeds of the 260 miles will go to support the tremendous efforts of
our community in raising money for Kenzies Wish fund and will be one of many
events underway and planned this year. </p>
<p><b><u>Whats
The Target?</u></b></p>
<p>The fundraising target is £500 which will go directly to

<p>Regardeless of whether you can (or cant) afford to

all of the efforts are having!</p>
<p>That’s all easily worth a couple of minutes to make a
small donation.  This is a flexible

<p><span>I created this campaign to help us raise fund to pay for my Mom's chemotherapy and related expenses.</span> Cancer treatment is exhausting for one's family pocket so we need your help with this.</p>

<li>Surgery (Closing of Stoma)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are almost in the end of the treatment plan so we can't back out now! Together our family can overcome this trial if you could help us financially.</p>

just thought there was something dreadfully wrong with me, and I continued to
try to get rid of these feelings.  Around October of 2010 I listened to an
episode of the Atheist Experience in which someone called in saying he had PTSD
from coming out of religion.  After the call Matt Dillahunty started
talking about Marlene Winell and how he heard her speak about RTS at a
convention.  Immediately I knew that I had RTS.  This was good
because I started to think of myself as having a condition that other people
experienced also instead of believing that something was dreadfully wrong with
only me.</span></i><span style=""color: #3C3C3C;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

website and was immediately drawn to the idea of a weekend retreat.  I had

recovery.  The retreat looked like it could offer this so after speaking
with Marlene I signed up for the retreat.  Just the step of signing up
seemed to be helpful in my path to recovery.  I felt like I was taking a

how to accept and listen to my feelings, both positive and negative, and to
express them.  I have learned to grieve what I have lost and to start
dreaming again for the future.  I still struggle at times, and I feel like
I will always be on a path towards recovery.  The difference now is that I

</div></div>","Hello!  
Thank-you
for your interest in Journey Free. 
We are a small group working to provide help to people coping
with Religious Trauma Syndrome and more broadly, seeking to educate the public
about this pervasive problem.  We
are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our director, Dr. Marlene Winell, has her therapy
practice, and where most of our recovery retreats are held. 
 
A Journey Free
retreat is a full weekend of healing and personal growth to
help people who have suffered the effects of authoritarian religious
indoctrination.   Dr. Winell has written the
only self-help book
about this and has been working in this area for 20 years.  
Last year, she named Religious Trauma
Syndrome as a kind of PTSD and began speaking and publishing on the
subject.  In June, an article was in Cognitive
Behavior Psychology Today.  





More and more people are leaving
organized religion,1 and fundamentalist, rigid religions in
particular.  The
internet is starting to overflow with stories of RTS and cries for help. 
On forums for former believers (such as exchristian.net), one can see the
widespread pain and desperation. In response to my presentation about RTS on
YouTube, a viewer commented:



Thank
you so much. This is exciting because millions of people suffer from this. I
have never heard of Dr. Marlene but more people are coming out to talk about
this issue. Millions–who are quietly suffering and being treated for other
issues when the fundamental issue is religious abuse.
 
However, there are very few services available to help
people with the mental health problems and family ruptures that result. 
Therapists are not trained in treating religious and spiritual issues – a
serious problem that is recognized in the profession.2   There are a number of  obstacles to recognizing the issues of RTS and people face a lot of difficulty when they need assistance.  See Marlene's article;  Why RTS is So Invisible.
That’s where we come in and we need your help. 
We are seeking to:
 
1.   Establish
a scholarship fund to enable those in need to attend a recovery retreat,
which is the most intense and effective way of helping people recover. 
 
2.   Support
Marlene in traveling to conferences to speak about Religious Trauma
Syndrome.   Sometimes expenses are
paid, such as the upcoming Exmormon Foundation Conference in October, but
professional and academic conferences are not.  These
are important for educating the public and the mental health community. 
Marlene’s paper has been accepted for the International Congress
on Psychology and Religion held in Italy in August, and she needs help to
attend!   This is her first opportunity to present to this
kind of audience.  It would be progress in getting spiritual abuse
recognized and treated.  
 
We are hoping to raise a total of $6000.   This
would include $3200 to provide 8 people with financial aid to attend a retreat,
and $2800 in travel funds to support Marlene.   

Any additional funds will go to these other projects:  1) Website development to enlarge the scope of information and resources offered, 2) Webinars on ""Steps in Recovery,""  3)  Publishing of a collection of writings from people who have worked through RTS and want to give back, called Happy Heretics:  Tips for Healing, 4) Administrative assistance, 5)  Production of videos and a documentary film.  
 


Thank-you so much for any support you can offer!!! 


We have our eighth retreat coming up soon, and there are a
number of people who would like to attend who need financial assistance. 
 Coming at all takes courage for someone with this background
because the biggest issue in recovery is intense fear. 
Christian fundamentalism also teaches that psychology is evil
and that the secular world is dangerous.  So
people coming to this retreat are taking a big step.     


""I am but a year into
recovery from a lifetime I can only begin to describe as hellish. I am
very interested in connecting with others who are also in their journey of
freedom from religious traumatic pasts, and am considering the trip out
west to attend one of your retreats; unaware these types of retreats
existed, when I happened upon the information on your site, I burst into
tears. Some of relief for the knowledge I am not alone, even more for the hope
of being a participant one day.""
 
But another problem is the cost of attending.  Many
of the folks who most need help are also struggling financially.  They are
often dealing with challenging career and family issues as PART OF the problem,
which means they do not have as much ability or support to get services.  We
have done our homework to find a retreat facility that is economical and also a
supportive, healing environment.  We have volunteers helping and we do all
our own cooking.  Participants are able to pay on a sliding scale basis,
and financing is possible.  Yet we have basic costs and would like to
create sponsorship options so that no one needs to be turned away due to lack
of funds.  
 
The details of this program can be found at JourneyFree.org, including testimonials from former
attendees, a full program,
the retreat staff, photos, and FAQ.  Our YouTube channel
has videos.  This letter was from a
young man who created a very moving video series which dramatically illustrates
how RTS can develop.
 
“I just saw your talk at the Texas Freethought Convention about what
you call RTS.  I have been working on a youtube deconversion series. . . the
first 3 parts so far are here.
""I've been working on the 4th part, focused on
trauma, for better than a month now and having a hard time with it.   I've
been reading a lot about trauma and finding myself amazed by how closely what
we attribute to trauma and PTSD align with my experience of deconversion.  No
one talks about religion and trauma.  Not in the scientific journals, not
on trauma resources... I thought maybe I would be the only one to address it.  I
love that you are fighting to name this.  You are doing important
work.""
 
The
Impact

Participants have called the retreat experience ""life-changing,"" a ""turning-point,"" a ""jump-start in recovery,"" and ""transformative.""   
An intensive intervention like this is needed because the trauma experienced by
religious and spiritual abuse is deep and recovery is not easy.  The work
of healing is not a simple intellectual process that can be done with reading a
book, people feel terribly alone, and real help is hard to find. After doing
eight retreats so far, we have found weekend retreats to be the approach with
the most impact, followed up with membership in our online support group.   

You can hear from past participants on video and read comments on our site.  One person's longer story is below. 
This is how ""Daniel"" tells of coming to a retreat:  

       
   
“For the longest time I
just thought there was something dreadfully wrong with me, and I continued to
try to get rid of these feelings.  Around October of 2010 I listened to an
episode of the Atheist Experience in which someone called in saying he had PTSD
from coming out of religion.  After the call Matt Dillahunty started
talking about Marlene Winell and how he heard her speak about RTS at a
convention.  Immediately I knew that I had RTS.  This was good
because I started to think of myself as having a condition that other people
experienced also instead of believing that something was dreadfully wrong with
only me.
                
“I soon found Marlene's
website and was immediately drawn to the idea of a weekend retreat.  I had
been living in isolation for so long with nobody to share my pain with.  I
longed for the chance to share my story, my troubles, and to get some tools for
recovery.  The retreat looked like it could offer this so after speaking
with Marlene I signed up for the retreat.  Just the step of signing up
seemed to be helpful in my path to recovery.  I felt like I was taking a
courageous step forward for my own benefit.  I started to feel the
faintest shimmer of hope. 
                
“The retreat proved to be
far better than I expected.  It was so amazing to speak openly about my
struggles, fears, and baggage from the past.  It provided a sense of
community, acceptance, and I could feel the wall I had set up against the world
was starting to come down.  The retreat also offered practical tools and
exercises that I could implement at home on my own.  
                
“After coming home from
the retreat I joined Marlene's online support group.  The best part of
being in the group was I felt like I had people who were ready at a moments
notice to listen, understand, and support me.  I also felt empowered by
the fact that I could be an encouragement to them, and it felt really good to
find ways to lift up and respond to others in the group.
                
“It has been almost a year
since I first fell apart emotionally.  It is staggering to see how much
growth I've experienced in that amount of time.  I went from feeling my
life was over to feeling that my life has just begun.  I went from trying
to shut out the world to wanting to welcome it back in.  I have learned
how to accept and listen to my feelings, both positive and negative, and to
express them.  I have learned to grieve what I have lost and to start
dreaming again for the future.  I still struggle at times, and I feel like
I will always be on a path towards recovery.  The difference now is that I
have tools to deal with such episodes, and I am able to respond in much more
effective and mature ways.” 
 The
Need


Many people write who feel
isolated and hurting, sometimes after many years, and are just realizing the
real source of their suffering. We have heard repeated words of gratitude that
finally someone has named the problem - RTS - and they feel less alone, less
crazy, and more hopeful that help is available.  With these retreats, we
want to reach as many as we can.   Here are a few of the many expressions of
need we have received.  Go to this page for more stories of why folks need help.



 





These are ""Karin’s"" words, a woman who would like to attend the next retreat:
 
“Hello, I watched the talk you gave at the Texas Free Thought convention on your website. I wish that it could be on DVD.  I have watched it about 3 times.  I also ordered your e-book which I have read and will do so repeatedly. To be honest, I am glad that I gave myself a chance of being able to exist on this earth plane.  More therapists and the Mental Health Association should be made aware of Religious Trauma Syndrome and how it can have a damaging psychological effect on a person that lasts for many years.  For me, that is the worst kind of hell I have ever experienced.  I have no regrets of still being in physical existence in that I was able to learn about your book and to see your video.  I have hope. I can flourish. I can learn. Best of all, this has helped me come to the realization that I am not alone.  That there is help available. I knew there was a reason why I had to hold on. . .
 
“Everything about my living arrangements is up in the air.  Anyway, I'm not going to allow myself  to end up homeless.  But if the situation warrants it, then I still have to keep believing that I am not worthless.  I am interested in joining the forum, I just need some time to get some things taken care of. . .
 
“After ordering your e-book and reading it, your words have helped me to understand myself a lot better.  I appreciate you taking the time to read this.  No one but you has ever asked me to write out my story.  I remember when I was younger, I tried so hard to fit in, that I completely lost sight of who I was.  I tried to forget and go on as though nothing ever happened.  But it ended up that ""the nothing ever happened"" thing followed me everywhere I went, that the Word of God and prayer were not enough.  The day finally came that ""yes Karin things did actually happen to you and it's time you dealt with it"".  The physical and psychological abuse I endured at the hands of my so-called care-takers has caused me a lot of grief and problems.  It would be nice if all we needed was prayer and the Word of God but life as it turns out will never be as simple as that.  The people who are Christian Fundamentalists are creating the very demons that they fear. 
 
“There is a lot more to this life as I have discovered.  Thank you Marlene for being the voice of all of us who have suffered under the heavy hand of religion.  Thank You for acknowledging my presence and that I actually exist.  Thank you for believing that my story matters.”
 





Other ways to help:  






Helping us spread the word about RTS, let us know about opportunities to speak or do workshops or interviews, clerical assistance, website development, transcribing, video editing, writing stories for the media, free or inexpensive venues for retreats, frequent flyer miles for people attending retreats.   Or just write to us to tell us your story, share ideas or give some encouragement!   Thank-you, thank-you!    The Journey Free Team

Kauila is deeply devoted to making Hawaii a living demonstration of the Aloha principles for everyone.  Please help him continue this important work by donating to his well-being and sharing your Aloha with him.  In doing so, you extend your Aloha to the world.  Mahalo",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>My name is Jordyn - I am a 17 year old girl from Northern Ontario and I have known countless children who have been affected by cancer. Countless children who have had so much potential, spirit, and hope. <br/><br/>I am raising money for Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer (NOFCC). They are a registered charitable organization that is committed to helping families in Northeastern Ontario who have a child diagnosed with cancer. Their mission is to provide hope, support, advocacy and education to families who have a child with cancer.<br/><br/><u>My mission?</u> To promote their stories and in turn raise money for the children out there who still have hope. My little brother Kieran is 6 years old and I cannot imagine how terrifying and devastating it would be if he were to develop cancer. We need to help this charity. </div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: georgia;"">Our journey began March 12th 2008 when I married my best friend. I had always known I wanted children and had started nannying in 2005 and haven't stopped since watching children. It was a no brainer to start trying to create a family together. We got pregnant and sadly miscarried shortly after.It was devastating but I picked up the pieces and thought it would only be a matter of time before I had a bouncing baby in my arms. Soon after my husband got orders to Portsmouth VA with the Navy. After 8 months I decided to make a appointment to see what was happening with my body, why wasn't I having a baby? We went to the appt. with the expectations of test and giving a detailed history but instead we were not taken seriously because of our age ( 21 &amp; 23) I was handed a bottle of prenatals and sent on my way. Looking back it infuriates me that I wasn't taken seriously, I wanted a baby, I was there for answers and instead I was judged. 2 months Later in November we got orders to go to Japan. I was so upset I thought for sure my plans for a baby would be put on hold. When we arrived in Japan I got a job at the base daycare, and baby making was on hold until 2009. After being at the daycare I met a wonderful family that wanted a nanny, thats when I started watching Elijah &amp; Isaiah. They were the light in my world after each month of negative tests they still brightened my day, they reminded me of what I would hopefully have one day. In August of 2010 I decided to go for testing again, this time the doctor took me seriously. Brandon was perfect and I was broken, I don't ovulate regularly on my own. It wasn't the answer I wanted but I was prepared, I had already done extensive research and knew the first step Clomid. We went through my birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas &amp; New years without a pregnancy. I couldn't believe it. I was doing everything plus some to get what others had come so easily to them. In the time I had done treatment I had friends get pregnant, lose a baby, and become pregnant again. It was so unfair, why couldn't it happen to me? January we decided to take a break to get ready to do injectables. On the way home from a youth sports game we coached I held my pee for almost 3 hours, I finally got home and said why waste it, I pee'ed on an ovulation kit and WHAM! What my body hadn't been doing it was finally doing it. Valentine's Day 2011 was the best day in 2011. I decided to take a pregnancy test and forgot all about it, I picked it up later fully expecting to see one lonely line, I started to cry I couldn't believe it was 2 pink lines. I called Brandon and was so excited, called the doctor for a blood test. I picked up the boys from school and we went to the hospital for blood test. We waited for the results, I was PREGNANT! Before I could celebrate DR.Q said it was a low HCG and we would do another draw on Monday. That weekend was excrutiating. I wanted to be happy but I couldn't let my self get excited. Monday came.........Numbers dropped to 5 it was a chemical pregnancy. I couldn't take it any more. In March the Tsunami disaster happened and I came home for a few weeks. When we got back I was ready to see a specialist off base in Japan. We went and yet again I was dissapointed. the doctor didn't listen to me and didn't take me seriously. We did 3 IUI with medications and still no pregnancy. So here we are a family that should have a baby without one.........</span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Something is missing from our family not even my three precious kitties can fill the void I feel in my life. I never thought this would be where I was, a 24 yr. old woman suffering from infertility. I remind myself everyday that this is the path God has chosen for me because He knows I am strong enough. I have been more open about our struggle and have answered countless questions. I talk t openly because I know one day I will say ""I am struggling with infertility"" and the reply would be ""me too""</p>
<p>First let me say that we are not asking for a handout. We have lived frugally for the last 3 years paying off debt, and paying for treatments one at a time (in YEN mind you!) My husband could have stayed in the military but that wasn't his dream. He is going to school to be a special education teacher and hopes to be a football coach. It wasn't my dream to have the money to do IVF but have no father there for my baby. We are living with my parents to save for IVF and to build a home for our family but, it just doesn't seem right to have a home and not be able to fill it... Even with your donations we will still need to save the money for testing and medications. We will continue to live within our means. We know that having a baby is not cheap but we don't have thousands of dollars laying around waiting to be spent. So many take for granted the ability to create a baby for free, for everything we will go through to have a child, this kid will never say we didn't want them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to do IVF with ICSI. Although our Goal will cover the Procedure it will not cover our medications and initial testing (another $3,000 at least) thats why we are looking for help with the procedure.</p>
<p> <a href=""http://www.fertilitycenter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fertilitycenter.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 6,800 will cover:</p>
<p>Cycle monitoring including all ultrasounds</p>
<p>egg retrieval including anesthesia</p>
<p>Insemination of my little eggies using ICSI</p>
<p>embryo culture and transfer from cycle (take the eggies out put the eggies back in)</p>
<p>Blood pregnancy test following transfer</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may ask what if we don't raise our goal?</p>
<p>Although our goal is IVF any money raised will go towards some kind of treatment or medications for a treatment like IUI.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Additionally for every dollar amount that we receive over our goal we will be donating it to other families like ours. Most couples that suffer from infertility have no insurance that covers treatment and will never have the chance to try IVF.</div></div>","Our Story

SWR is less than a year old and is in its' “pre-revenue” phase; as in, we have yet to earn any money.As a result we are seeking your support to help fund the crucial, 2nd phase of our growth.If we were successful in raising $500,000, the following will become realty: We'll be able to cover day-to-day operations in the near term ($50,000) and we'll be able to build a scaled demonstration unit to be used as a precondition to entering the marketplace ($450,000).The private sector has already reacted positively to Strategic Water Resources Neptune CF technology, as illustrated by a Letter of Intent we recently received from a Fortune 500 Company to deliver three desalination plants to locations in Panama, Columbia and the Caribbean.We also have another dozen business deals, pending the construction of the scaled demonstration unit, to include:  Treatment of landfill leachate in Massachusetts;
High oxygen process water for hydroponic greenhouse project; Water treatment plants in Pennsylvania; 
Wastewater treatment for a major seafood processor; etc.Our potential market(s) is a vast one and if the early response from a cross-section of industries to SWR is any indication of what the future may hold then it will be  a very bright one. Provided of course, that we can raise the necessary money to keep going.We are also very much committed to helping the third world overcome its' myriad water problems as soon as we're able. Our lower cost, smaller-scaled water projects, could make the difference between life and death for thousands of destitute people.We thank you for considering our appeal.All the best,The SWR Team",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p><b>Sequenced, 6-month exercise program </b></p>
<p>All the components of Total
Body Blueprint (warm-ups, weight training, cardio and flexibility) are
integrated into a manageable periodized program. Every month, you’ll enter a
new phase with possibly a different training split, new exercises, rep ranges,
intensities, cardio methods and/or circuits to prevent stagnation and boredom. </p>
<p><b>Private website with workout tracking </b></p>
<p>Gain access to your private
account to printout or track workouts, view training calendars and monitor progress
using grids and graphs with my online platform 24/7. An excellent tool for
motivation. You’ll also be able to learn proper mechanics by watching
short exercise demonstrations of me with detailed instructions using the
exercise library. </p>
<p><b>Mobile application with exercise demos </b></p>
<p>Download a mobile app that coincides with the website,
allowing you to record each workout while in the gym. And brush up on how to
perform the movements prescribed by viewing exercise clips.</p>
<p><b>Biometric tracking </b></p>
<p>To measure progress, we first establish a baseline. We then
set a goal using an “ideal bodyweight” calculation. Once per month you’ll track
progress by measuring body composition with one of my suggested methods and
muscle circumferences with a tape measure. Don’t worry, I’ll teach you exactly
how to do everything, and it’s all tracked and graphed for you online. Some
weeks you just step on a scale and provide your bodyweight. The important thing
is that you will always have <em>objective data </em>to go on – not just
opinions. </p>
<p><b>Progress photos </b><br/></p>
<p>The body transformation process is at least in part
subjective and about how you look. Every month you’ll take new photos and

provide much of the motivation you need to keep moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Nutritional guidance </b></p>
<p>Diets. They've become a cliché, haven't they? We're on them,
then we're off. People follow them only for a short period, if at all, and it usually
ends in failure. Diets are useless and unrealistic. I do things very
differently here. I teach you lean healthy eating without starving yourself.
You’ll also be provided with tasty recipes and a tutorial on how to use the fitbit
modality for accountability purposes. Eventually, your eating habits will come
so naturally to you that it becomes automatic, for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>Results
100% guaranteed <br/></strong></p>
<p>My belief is this: if
you invest in a fitness program – and you do what I’ve prescribed – you should
get the results you want. I’m supremely confident with FitRx, and you should be
too. So if you give the program 6 months, follow my workout plans and log them at least 80
percent of the time, you’ll be leaner, stronger,
healthier and happier with your physique than you ever thought you could be. And

<h3>peacecare</h3>
<p>peacecare, a nonprofit organization that cultivates collaborative, community-level global health solutions is working on a project in the SNNPR region of Ethiopia to prevent Maternal mortality using a technique called ALSO<sup>®</sup> (Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics), which teaches physicians, midwives and other healthcare workers to prevent and manage emergencies during labor and delivery.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with Peace Corps, this peacecare project fosters collaboration between the health district of Bonga, Ethiopia and Northwestern University to improve health care delivery within the local existing health care system.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>cost effective interventions</h3>
<p>Using the 'training of trainers' method, the team from Northwestern will be training Ethiopian healthcare workers to train other local healthcare workers in the ALSO<sup>®</sup> technique, improving sustainability and cost effectiveness of the project.  This technique is knowledge-based and does not call for many material resources, making it appropriate in a low-resource setting.    ALSO<sup>® </sup>is used to train physicians, midwives, and nurses all across the United States and in over fifty other countries worldwide.    It has been studied in other developing countries and shown to decrease obstetrical complications such as hemorrhage after delivery.</p>
<p>All contributions go to on-the-ground costs and any small contribution will go a long way.</p>
<h3>impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>One of the UN Millenium Development goals is to ""Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio.""  Most maternal deaths are avoidable with increased education and training.  The peacecare project addresses this goal of preventing needless deaths in the developing countries like Ethiopia, by building the capacity and empowering its own healthcare workers to provide high-quality care to their fellow Ethiopians.</p>

We still do not have any idea what has caused her to be sick.</h3>
<p>She is on 24 hour tube feeds with not being able to have anything by mouth. Her tube goes into her small intestine. They doctors have done all kinds of things and now are trying her on new meds to see if they will help. All they know is that her stomach has went to sleep so to speak. We have got over $30,000 in medical bills so far and our insurance has only picked up about $14,000 of that.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise money to help with at least part of the medical bills. We are also going to try and use part of it to help with the cost of her feeds. It is costing around $15- $20 a day just for her feeds. I would not ask for help if it weren't for it being so much and for the fact that since she has got sick that I lost my job and my husband had to miss a few days of work.</p>
<p>All the money that we get raised will go toward her feeds and medical bills that are still adding up. Please find it in your hearts to help us as we try to get her back to being a healthy normal 5 year old.</p>
<p>Thank You all for reading and God Bless you.</p>

We’re all setting ourselves up for failure in the posture department. For one, we sit hunched over our computers or phones all day long, a very unnatural position for the human body. Then, we go home and sleep on a pillow that only makes things worse by pushing our heads forward for 8 hours a night. It’s no wonder we all have bad posture, back pain, and stiff necks. Other posture pillows have tried to help correct this, but they’re uncomfortable, making it hard to do what you actually need to do on them: SLEEP.And that's why we created the True Pillow. It's the only posture pillow that’s designed with your comfort and posture in mind so you can wake up refreshed; ready to take on the day.   True Pillow comfortably supports your head, neck, and back while improving your posture thanks to its patent-pending design. It's unique shape fixes forward head posture by restoring the curve in your cervical spine while lightly stretching your neck muscles to their natural state.True Pillow’s long wedge was strategically designed to keep your chest up while keeping your shoulders down to the mattress. This restores your overly-rounded upper back curve while fixing rounded shoulders. Sleep on True Pillow for just 30 nights to look and feel more confident than ever before. Eliminate irritating tension in your neck and upper back that you thought were just “part of life”. True Pillow doesn’t discriminate when it comes to sleeping position either. You can sleep comfortably on your back or your side.You might even find you’re getting a lot more dates thanks to True Pillow (ladies love a man with good posture). True Pillow is made of 100% memory foam, a material designed to give comfortable support. It comes with a fitted, washable white, black, or grey zip cover.

Samdong International is a
not-for-profit NGO launched to provide the world community with sustainable
development support and social welfare corporation, based on the founding idea
that all of mankind is one family.<br/>After the devastating earthquake this week in Nepal, we are asking your help to support our grassroots efforts there to bring emergency relief and essential aid to the most vulnerable sectors of the community.  <span> At present,
reports suggest that 3,200 people have been killed and more than 6000
injured.  In addition, tens of
thousands of people have been left homeless; while others are sleeping on the
streets due to constant aftershocks and building instabilities.</span>
<br/>With a grassroots presence on the ground, Samdong International pledges to get your donation dollars into action without delay, without red tape, and with deep collaboration with the local people to answer real needs in real lives.  <br/><br/><b>PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS TIME SENSITIVE- THIS CAMPAIGN WILL LAST UNTIL MAY 11TH.  WE ASK THAT IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO GIVE, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE.   HELP IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY!</b><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>With a 5 year grassroots presence in Nepal and staff currently in place on the ground on Nepal and in Korea,  we are well poised to make a real, immediate difference in the survival of Nepalese people.  We are asking for support to transition our Community Center and surrounding grounds in Kathmandu, which has survived the quake unscathed, into an emergency refugee housing center, soup kitchen, and  emergency medical field center.  </p>
<p>Funds will go to support:</p>
<p>1.  Beds<br/></p>
<p>2.  Blankets<br/></p>
<p>3.  Medical Supplies<br/></p>4. Clean Water<br/><br/>5.  Food<br/><br/>6.  Tents <br/><br/>7.  Mosquito Nets<br/><br/>8. Rehydration Salts and Zinc Tablets<br/><br/><h3>Impacts<br/>
</h3>The impacts of your donations will be felt by real people with real needs.   The days immediately following disaster are the most essential in determining who will survive and who will perish due to exposure to the elements, lack of food resource, illness, untreated injury, or dehydration.  Ensure that we can combat these threats together.<br/>With a long term presence in Nepal, Samdong International will also be there to transition from emergency management into planning for the future and rebuilding, in solidarity with the people of Nepal.  <br/>
</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The greatest challenges facing the work now lie in the areas of sourcing needed goods, and communicating reliably with the affected areas.  We will interface on the ground level with larger international agencies, such as the RED CROSS and CARE, helping to gain access to needed resources and offering our services to people most in need.  <br/>As we watch the economic situation on the ground, it will be left to Samdong    Financial Advisory team to decide the best course of action to make the funds    stretch the furthest, whether we import goods from Korea once transportation    into Nepal becomes an option, or we source within the country.           <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you are unable to donate but still want to help, please share this campaign on any and all of your social media platforms,  under the hashtag #standwithnepal.<br/><br/>We thank you deeply from the bottom of our hearts.  Let's all stand together for Nepal!  One World, One Family!  <br/>

that all of mankind is one family.After the devastating earthquake this week in Nepal, we are asking your help to support our grassroots efforts there to bring emergency relief and essential aid to the most vulnerable sectors of the community.   At present,
reports suggest that 3,200 people have been killed and more than 6000
injured.  In addition, tens of
thousands of people have been left homeless; while others are sleeping on the
streets due to constant aftershocks and building instabilities.
With a grassroots presence on the ground, Samdong International pledges to get your donation dollars into action without delay, without red tape, and with deep collaboration with the local people to answer real needs in real lives.  PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS TIME SENSITIVE- THIS CAMPAIGN WILL LAST UNTIL MAY 11TH.  WE ASK THAT IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO GIVE, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE.   HELP IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY!
  What We Need 
With a 5 year grassroots presence in Nepal and staff currently in place on the ground on Nepal and in Korea,  we are well poised to make a real, immediate difference in the survival of Nepalese people.  We are asking for support to transition our Community Center and surrounding grounds in Kathmandu, which has survived the quake unscathed, into an emergency refugee housing center, soup kitchen, and  emergency medical field center.  
Funds will go to support:
1.  Beds
2.  Blankets
3.  Medical Supplies4. Clean Water5.  Food6.  Tents 7.  Mosquito Nets8. Rehydration Salts and Zinc TabletsImpacts
The impacts of your donations will be felt by real people with real needs.   The days immediately following disaster are the most essential in determining who will survive and who will perish due to exposure to the elements, lack of food resource, illness, untreated injury, or dehydration.  Ensure that we can combat these threats together.With a long term presence in Nepal, Samdong International will also be there to transition from emergency management into planning for the future and rebuilding, in solidarity with the people of Nepal.  
 Risks & ChallengesThe greatest challenges facing the work now lie in the areas of sourcing needed goods, and communicating reliably with the affected areas.  We will interface on the ground level with larger international agencies, such as the RED CROSS and CARE, helping to gain access to needed resources and offering our services to people most in need.  As we watch the economic situation on the ground, it will be left to Samdong    Financial Advisory team to decide the best course of action to make the funds    stretch the furthest, whether we import goods from Korea once transportation    into Nepal becomes an option, or we source within the country.           
  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to donate but still want to help, please share this campaign on any and all of your social media platforms,  under the hashtag #standwithnepal.We thank you deeply from the bottom of our hearts.  Let's all stand together for Nepal!  One World, One Family!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><div>Angie's Testimonial: </div><div>
<p><span>I’ve struggled with my gender ever since I can remember. For years I felt misunderstood and bullied into an identity that never felt right. I have a particularly vivid memory from when I was ten years old. I was playing shirtless on a slip-n-slide with my family and close friends. While running around shirtless, one of the adults shouted ""what're you gonna do when you get boobs?""! It took me about half a second to reply ""I'm gonna have to cut them off!"" and continue to run around unfazed about my solution.</span></p>
<br/><p>As I continued to grow, so did my gender dysphoria. Feeling comfortable in my body was a privilege that I left behind with the slip-n-slide. I couldn't believe I was supposed to wear dresses and barrettes. Adults often told me to slow down and be careful while letting the boys run and jump as high as they wanted. In elementary school my teachers would tell the class I was a girl and not to confuse me for a boy. My androgyny made adults so uncomfortable. Some screamed while others publicly humiliated me.</p>
<br/><p>Eventually I started listening. I was 14 when I began to assimilate, to force myself into a feminine role,  and the clothing that the people around me so desperately needed me to assume. Unsurprisingly, this did not solve the problem. In fact, the process began a painful isolation from my own body.</p>
<p>It’s taken me 20 years to feel in my body again; 20 years to actually want to be in my body again. I have overcome some of my body dysphoria by binding my chest (as many of you know), but it is only a temporary solution. I am happier and healthier than ever, but still feel like I need to make some changes so that I may feel at home in my body again. I am planning to have chest surgery- a gender confirmation surgery where my breast tissue will be removed. </p>
<p>I’ve found a doctor in Florida that I feel very comfortable with, and I am beyond ready to take the step of getting top surgery – this step that I’ve know I’d need since I was 10 years old. I know I am going to continue to rely on your emotional support, and now I am also asking you to support me financially. Any contribution you can make will leave me eternally grateful.</p>

<u>The Project </u>-</h3>We are a team of two individuals with a common dream of riding in some of the
most extreme conditions in the Himalayas. Chasing this dream, we aim
to be the first men ever to ride on the entire frozen Zanskar river in Ladakh,
a high altitude plateau in the Western Himalayas. We also aim to be the first cyclists ever to climb some of the highest passes of the world in Winter. We
will be making a feature documentary of the entire expedition. We will also
highlight how the local villagers live in these extreme conditions, cut off
from the rest of the world for close to 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
<h3><u>Why is this project special?</u></h3>
The expedition happens in extreme conditions. The average temperature in Ladakh
in winter is -15'C and goes down as low as -40'C. Add to that we will be riding
at high altitude. The ride goes from 11,500ft to 18,300ft through the 600Km
journey. No cyclist has ever attempted this feat just because of the sheer
difficulty in terms of terrain and temperatures. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1086844/files/20141210105346-12943676773_4121f4dbb5_o.jpg?1418237626"" src="""" style=""width: 508.740524781341px; height: 381px;""/></p><br/>

He is a professional nature and wild-life film maker who is extremely talented.
His attention to detail and great photography knowledge makes him the best
person to be on our ride. His recent work 'The Unsung' has been aired around
the world and has received great reviews.  

Why do we need the
funds? 


An
expedition of this magnitude requires a lot of money and we have put in a lot
of our own funds. But are falling short of the required budget as we need some
of the best equipment and logistical support to undertake this expedition as we
will be operating in extreme sub-zero temperatures day in and day out for 26
days.


Our major expenditure goes in Food,
Travel & Accommodation. - Food & Ration for 3 people - $1700 (for 26 Days)- Accommodation & Tentage - $2700 (for 26 Days)- Travel (Flights and other local transport) - $2100


We will be borrowing some of the
winter gears and other photography equipments from our friends for the
expedition.


We have some exciting perks for you
too! We will get to capture some rare photos of some of the most stunning
landscapes on earth. Add to that the video footage that we will produce using
drones shot by professionals.





The Impact -We want to be the guys who open the
doors for exploration in the Himalayas in the most difficult season, the
winters. And tell the world that with precised planning and managing risk,
anyone can venture deep into these big mountains in winters. 
Cycling in the Himalayas are limited
only to the 4 months of fair weather. But what about the remaining months? This
project is all about showing the world that difficult terrain and temperatures
should not hinder exploration in this amazing mountain range on a bike.


Risks & Challenges -


There are certain risks on this
expeditions which is beyond our control. Mountain hazards like Altitude
Sickness (AMS), Ice/Snow conditions and weather turbulences in high altitude
will be the major risks.


 We are fully prepared to handle these
risks both in terms of making the right decisions while it matters as well as
in terms of having the right equipment and the skill to overcome the risk
factor.


 We both have been going to the
Himalayas for the last 5 years and have been to Ladakh more than 3 times. All
these expeditions have been self-supported and hence we have both knowledge and
experience to handle these risks.



Other Ways
You Can Help - 
We are doing this expedition to tell
the world that extraordinary journeys can be undertaken by folks like us. You
can help us by sharing this not just to help us raise funds but to motivate
more people to take up journeys like these.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign
