<h3>Short Summary:

</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Zakary Koenigs. I am 13 years old and I’m in 8th grade. Together with Just Like My Child Foundation, we’ve raised over $15,000 to build one of the first libraries in a poor, rural community in Central Uganda.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464730031/Screen_Shot_2016-05-31_at_14.26.13_ftsp5g.png"" src="""" style=""text-align: center;width: 270.89811320754717px;height: 274px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464640602/unspecified-2_mjayrb.jpg"" src="""" style=""text-align: center;width: 302.32380952380953px;height: 256px;""/></p>
<p>Just Like My Child Foundation has been working in this community for many years, and I’ve been lucky enough to visit 3 times. I loved visiting the schools and meeting the kids. I realized that that even though we’re different in a lot of ways, <b>we are, for the most part, the same</b>. We all LIKE to play, learn, have friends — and we all love using technology.<br/></p>
<p>This summer, I am being Bar Mitzvah’d and I have decided that as part of my Mitzvah project (a project where we commit to something bigger than ourselves) <b>my goal is to raise $10,000 to supply Namumira’s Library with everything it needs to be super successful</b>, including Books in the Local Language, Reading Desks, Chairs, Educational Posters, Solar Panels for Electricity AND Computer Tablets — because I believe access to technology is important to learning and so far, kids like me in Namumira have little-to-no access to technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I've met the kids in Namumira. That's why this campaign is important to me. I know that this new Library <b>will help them get a better education</b> AND it will help <b>keep them safe</b> after school hours. PLUS the whole community will use it as a community resource for years to come. </p>
<p>Every dollar makes a difference and your generous donation will go DIRECTLY to help these very children get a better education. Please consider helping me reach my goal!</p>

Where the Money Goes:


My Fundraising Goal = $10,000 USD. Together, we can create a safe learning space for kids in Namumira, Uganda. Here's how the money will be used:


Books in the Local Language
Educational Posters
Learning Materials and Supplies
Solar Panels for Electricity
Computer Tablets -- an invaluable learning resource that will connect students with the world around them.

Just Like My Child Foundation has successfully completed building 27 school structures so they know exactly how to get this done on time, on budget, and with the greatest community involvement.

Risks and Challenges: 

If I don't reach my goal, every penny raised will go towards providing the Library with the items above, with a priority on books, solar panels, and computer tablets.

IF I REACH MY GOAL this summer, I'll travel to Namumira, Uganda with Just Like My Child Foundation in November to help paint the finished library and bring extra supplies.

</p><p>Hello
everyone my name is Anibal Guerra a Venezuelan Computing science professor who
is currently in Medellin Colombia making my PhD in Electronic Engineering.. Becoming
a doctor is very important to me since being a professor has always been the
dream of my life. </p>
<p>The reason I'm here today is, as perhaps you’ve seen,
my country (Venezuela) is under a strict control of currency which requires
that in order to enjoy my money (in bolivars) I must buy dollars to the
Venezuelan government. But for more than a year most of student requests for
purchasing dollars have been denied by the government, and in my personal case
I have not received a single dollar since last May. [Check <a href=""https://www.google.com.co/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=venezuelan%20students%20abroad%20dollars&amp;es_th=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Venezuelan students currency problems</a>]<br/></p>
<p>Despite only having a
student visa (as required by Venezuelan government) I have taken informal Jobs
to get some money, but right now I have no money to pay the full amount of my
fifth semester enrollment. I don’ t want to stop studying, but the University
of Antioquia is asking me for the payment of the last semester which already
ended but I have not paid yet. In the next months I will
try to obtain my residence here and to be able to work formally as a professor
here if needed, but it will take a couple of months left. </p>

<br/></div>","Hello
everyone my name is Anibal Guerra a Venezuelan Computing science professor who
is currently in Medellin Colombia making my PhD in Electronic Engineering.. Becoming
a doctor is very important to me since being a professor has always been the
dream of my life. 
The reason I'm here today is, as perhaps you’ve seen,
my country (Venezuela) is under a strict control of currency which requires
that in order to enjoy my money (in bolivars) I must buy dollars to the
Venezuelan government. But for more than a year most of student requests for
purchasing dollars have been denied by the government, and in my personal case
I have not received a single dollar since last May. [Check Venezuelan students currency problems]
Despite only having a
student visa (as required by Venezuelan government) I have taken informal Jobs
to get some money, but right now I have no money to pay the full amount of my
fifth semester enrollment. I don’ t want to stop studying, but the University
of Antioquia is asking me for the payment of the last semester which already
ended but I have not paid yet. In the next months I will
try to obtain my residence here and to be able to work formally as a professor
here if needed, but it will take a couple of months left. 
So your help can make me to
grow professionally in I a way I can be a better professor and teach better
things to new generations. I appeal to those who
have the availability and willingness to help with one, two or five dollars to
help achieve this objective to continue my education and become a better professor.I need to gather about 10000 dollars only to pay for the three semesters

You CAN help create NEW TRADITIONS for Anishinaabe youth through CANOE TRADITIONS. Through CANOE TRADITIONS, Anishinaabe youth CAN reNEW old TRADITIONS. Please support this project. Chii Miigwech!!!!</strong>
</p><p>
I am very proud of my Anishnaabe heritage. I was very fortunate to have Art Solomon, an Anishinaabe Elder, as one of my teachers. </p><p>

Art once said: </p><p><strong><em>

""The traditional way of education was by example, experience, and storytelling. The first principle involved was total respect and acceptance of the one to be taught, and that learning was a continuous process from birth to death. It was total continuity without interruption. Its nature was like a fountain that gives many colours and flavours of water and that whoever chose could drink as much or as little as they wanted to whenever they wished. The teaching strictly adhered to the sacredness of life whether of humans, animals or plants.""</em></strong> </p><p>

I believe that the arts can be a way to better understand ourselves….to better understand each other….to know about our culture and traditions. To know where one is going, one must know when one has come from. As Louis Riel said: <strong><em>""My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they awake, it will be the artists who give them their spirit back.""</em></strong> </p><p>

I have a background in education (mainly environmental science and outdoor education) as well as in the social services field. In addition, I have been involved with several youth canoe building projects. </p><p><strong>

This idea all started as a result of the Fort Severn Canoe Project.</strong> In the summer of 2012, John Hupfield and I went to Fort Severn (on Hudson’s Bay) to help conduct a month long workshop in the restoration of wood canvas Freighter canoes, with the local First Nations youth, which was featured on CBC’s The National (see <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/04/27/f-fortsevern-canoe-restoration.html)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/04/27/f-fortsevern-canoe-restoration.html).</a> </p><p>Though my work in Fort Severn was supposed to be restoring Freighter canoes, it involved much more, especially after the project was extended through the entire summer. Besides the work on canoes, this experience awoke my desire to contribute in a positive way, with all I had gained while doing social service work and as an educator, as well as through traditional teachings. Since I am of the Bear clan, I suppose one could say that the bear came out of hibernation. </p><p>

So I returned to my artistic roots, since I learned much about my Anishinaabe culture and traditions through art….as well as being able to share such knowledge with others. </p><p><strong>

In 2015, we got funded through the Toronto Art Council's Animating Historic Sites to work at Todmorden Mills and produce the Journey By Canoe: An Indigenous Art Project and Exhibition.</strong> The canoe would portray a visual representation of a journey that we all have taken, whether the Original Peoples of this land or New Canadians from other lands. The canoe was used as a metaphor for such a journey. It was a story of one's own migration....learning not only to paddle the canoe, but also walk the path of life too. Maybe through this art project, not only was First Nation history and culture illustrated, but all the Sacred Colours (all races) involved may have found a way to bridge any cultural differences. 
</p><p><strong>
But this was just part of a larger plan....a small step towards a bigger goal. Building on what we achieved in the art show at Todmorden Mills last summer, we would like to work towards taking an actual Journey By Canoe. During the summer of 2017.
</strong></p><p>An Ontario First Nations canoe project is envisioned, patterned after Pulling Together (<a href=""http://pullingtogether.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pullingtogether.ca/</a>) or Tribal Journeys (<a href=""http://tribaljourneys.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tribaljourneys.wordpress.com/</a>) from the West Coast. This could be called <strong>Journey By Canoe</strong>, <strong>involving a number of</strong> <strong>canoe trips from various Anishinaabe (Ojibway) communities from around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, as well as inland from Temagami, North Bay, Lake Simcoe and the Kawarthas, with the trips ending at Manitoulin Island.</strong> Such trips are thus centered around one of the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe people. </p><p>

The Ojibway or Anishinaabe people were canoe people. These series of canoe trips could bring awareness of Native culture and traditions; as well as engaging Native youth, especially with Elders. Opportunities for teachings will be had, through the various aspects of this project, from the building process to the actual canoe trips. As well these trips could bring awareness to First Nations rights; to Mother Earth; to the environment; to water; to the Great Lakes; and wilderness. Such trips could involve bark canoes or wood canvas canoes. Built by Anishinaabe youth. Using the most natural materials possible. </p><p>But such a project will be a very involved and large undertaking. Sometimes it is better to take small steps (crawl before you walk, and walk before you run). This proposed initiative is one such step. <br/></p><p>It is hoped that such an annual journey would start in 2017....the Sesquicentennial year for Canada....but more so a beginning for Anishinabek youth. </p><p>To do so we want to build several canoes this year (2016). As well, we hope to create a non-profit foundation to pursue funding opportunities that would permit growing this idea even further....such as winter camping....maybe even looking at also building snowshoes or toboggans....or even tikinagans. </p><p>But more than anything else creating ways to get youth back out on the land. </p><p><strong>SO with the funding from this Indiegogo campaign, Canoe Traditions, we could build several canoes, both birch bark and wood/canvas.
These builds would occur at Curve Lake First Nation, during a pilot project that is supported by Chief and Council. The canoes built would all become part of the envisioned canoe journey.</strong> </p><p><strong>Curve Lake First Nation will serve as the base for the first series of builds.</strong> <strong>

It is also possible that youth from other communities such as Alderville, Hiawatha and Scugog Island First Nations could be involved in these canoe builds at Curve Lake. This is dependent on final approval from the respective First Nation communities, which is only possible with adequate funding.
</strong></p><p><strong><em>
""The canoe is a very important piece of our history, the history of this Mississauga ancestral territory.""</em> - Chief Phyllis Williams, Curve Lake First Nation 


</strong></p><p><strong>Four wood canvas canoes can be built for $25,000. </strong></p><p><strong>Two birch bark canoes can be built for $35,000. </strong></p><p><strong>SO the total request for this Indiegogo campaign, Canoe Traditions, is $60,000. Anything raised beyond and above that would be applied to the overall canoe project....the overall canoe journey. </strong></p><p><strong>

We do offer perks, dependent on the cash value donated, that may range from Indigenous art to other unique opportunities....check them out.  </strong></p><p>

Overall, we hope to raise enough funding and support to create an ongoing project, building both wood canvas and birch bark canoes, as well as related traditional items, in First Nation communities. Funding raised could also create a training allowance for participants during the canoe builds. <br/></p><strong><em>


""First, the canoe connects us to Ma-ka-ina, Mother Earth, from which we came and to which we must all return. Councils of those who were here before us revered the earth and also the wind, the rain, and the sun – all essential to life. It was from that remarkable blending of forces that mankind was allowed to create the canoe and its several kindred forms.

From the birch tree, came the bark; from the spruce, pliant roots; from the cedar, the ribs, planking and gunwales; and from a variety of natural sources, the sealing pitch.

In other habitats, great trees became dugout canoes while, in treeless areas, skin, bone and sinew were ingeniously fused into kayaks. Form followed function, and manufacture was linked to available materials. Even the modern canoe, although several steps away from the first, is still a product of the earth. We have a great debt to those who experienced the land before us. No wonder that, in many parts of the world, the people thank the land for allowing its spirit to be transferred to the canoe.

Hand-propelled watercraft still allow us to pursue the elemental quest for tranquility, beauty, peace, freedom and cleaness. It is good to be conveyed quietly, gracefully, to natural rhythms….The canoe especially connects us to rivers – timeless pathways of the wilderness. Wave after wave of users have passed by. Gentle rains falling onto a paddler evaporate skyward to form clouds and then to descend on a fellow traveller, perhaps in another era. Likewise, our waterways contain something of the substance of our ancestors. The canoe connects us to the spirit of these people who walk beside us as we glide silently along riverine trails.""</em> – Kirk Wipper, founder of the Canadian Canoe Museum</strong></div>","“Even long ago there were some men who could not make all the things that were needed. In each camp there were only a few who could make everything. The hardest thing to build was the canoe. The man who could make a canoe was very happy because the people depended on it so much.” – John Kawapit, Eastern Cree, Great Whale River, Quebec

In the summer of 2012, John Hupfield and I went to Fort Severn (on Hudson’s Bay) to help conduct a month long workshop in the restoration of wood canvas Freighter canoes, with the local First Nations youth, which was featured on CBC’s The National (see http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/04/27/f-fortsevern-canoe-restoration.html). Though my work in Fort Severn was supposed to be restoring Freighter canoes, it involved much more, especially after the project was extended through the entire summer. Besides the work on canoes, this experience awoke my desire to contribute in a positive way, with all I had gained while doing social service work and as an educator, as well as through traditional teachings. Since I am of the Bear clan, I suppose one could say that the bear came out of hibernation. 

So I returned to my artistic roots, since I learned much about my Anishinaabe culture and traditions through art….as well as being able to share such knowledge with others. 

In 2015, we got funded through the Toronto Art Council's Animating Historic Sites to work at Todmorden Mills and produce the Journey By Canoe: An Indigenous Art Project and Exhibition. The canoe would portray a visual representation of a journey that we all have taken, whether the Original Peoples of this land or New Canadians from other lands. The canoe was used as a metaphor for such a journey. It was a story of one's own migration....learning not only to paddle the canoe, but also walk the path of life too. Maybe through this art project, not only was First Nation history and culture illustrated, but all the Sacred Colours (all races) involved may have found a way to bridge any cultural differences. 

But this was just part of a larger plan....a small step towards a bigger goal. Building on what we achieved in the art show at Todmorden Mills last summer, we would like to work towards taking an actual Journey By Canoe. During the summer of 2017.
An Ontario First Nations canoe project is envisioned, patterned after Pulling Together (http://pullingtogether.ca/) or Tribal Journeys (http://tribaljourneys.wordpress.com/) from the West Coast. This could be called Journey By Canoe, involving a number of canoe trips from various Anishinaabe (Ojibway) communities from around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay, as well as inland from Temagami, North Bay, Lake Simcoe and the Kawarthas, with the trips ending at Manitoulin Island. Such trips are thus centered around one of the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe people. 

The Ojibway or Anishinaabe people were canoe people. These series of canoe trips could bring awareness of Native culture and traditions; as well as engaging Native youth, especially with Elders. Opportunities for teachings will be had, through the various aspects of this project, from the building process to the actual canoe trips. As well these trips could bring awareness to First Nations rights; to Mother Earth; to the environment; to water; to the Great Lakes; and wilderness. Such trips could involve bark canoes or wood canvas canoes. Built by Anishinaabe youth. Using the most natural materials possible. But such a project will be a very involved and large undertaking. Sometimes it is better to take small steps (crawl before you walk, and walk before you run). This proposed initiative is one such step. It is hoped that such an annual journey would start in 2017....the Sesquicentennial year for Canada....but more so a beginning for Anishinabek youth. To do so we want to build several canoes this year (2016). As well, we hope to create a non-profit foundation to pursue funding opportunities that would permit growing this idea even further....such as winter camping....maybe even looking at also building snowshoes or toboggans....or even tikinagans. But more than anything else creating ways to get youth back out on the land. SO with the funding from this Indiegogo campaign, Canoe Traditions, we could build several canoes, both birch bark and wood/canvas.
These builds would occur at Curve Lake First Nation, during a pilot project that is supported by Chief and Council. The canoes built would all become part of the envisioned canoe journey. Curve Lake First Nation will serve as the base for the first series of builds. 

It is also possible that youth from other communities such as Alderville, Hiawatha and Scugog Island First Nations could be involved in these canoe builds at Curve Lake. This is dependent on final approval from the respective First Nation communities, which is only possible with adequate funding.

""The canoe is a very important piece of our history, the history of this Mississauga ancestral territory."" - Chief Phyllis Williams, Curve Lake First Nation 


Four wood canvas canoes can be built for $25,000. Two birch bark canoes can be built for $35,000. SO the total request for this Indiegogo campaign, Canoe Traditions, is $60,000. Anything raised beyond and above that would be applied to the overall canoe project....the overall canoe journey. 

We do offer perks, dependent on the cash value donated, that may range from Indigenous art to other unique opportunities....check them out.  

Overall, we hope to raise enough funding and support to create an ongoing project, building both wood canvas and birch bark canoes, as well as related traditional items, in First Nation communities. Funding raised could also create a training allowance for participants during the canoe builds. 


""First, the canoe connects us to Ma-ka-ina, Mother Earth, from which we came and to which we must all return. Councils of those who were here before us revered the earth and also the wind, the rain, and the sun – all essential to life. It was from that remarkable blending of forces that mankind was allowed to create the canoe and its several kindred forms.

From the birch tree, came the bark; from the spruce, pliant roots; from the cedar, the ribs, planking and gunwales; and from a variety of natural sources, the sealing pitch.

In other habitats, great trees became dugout canoes while, in treeless areas, skin, bone and sinew were ingeniously fused into kayaks. Form followed function, and manufacture was linked to available materials. Even the modern canoe, although several steps away from the first, is still a product of the earth. We have a great debt to those who experienced the land before us. No wonder that, in many parts of the world, the people thank the land for allowing its spirit to be transferred to the canoe.

Hand-propelled watercraft still allow us to pursue the elemental quest for tranquility, beauty, peace, freedom and cleaness. It is good to be conveyed quietly, gracefully, to natural rhythms….The canoe especially connects us to rivers – timeless pathways of the wilderness. Wave after wave of users have passed by. Gentle rains falling onto a paddler evaporate skyward to form clouds and then to descend on a fellow traveller, perhaps in another era. Likewise, our waterways contain something of the substance of our ancestors. The canoe connects us to the spirit of these people who walk beside us as we glide silently along riverine trails."" – Kirk Wipper, founder of the Canadian Canoe Museum",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><h2>Help Build the 'BMSBH' Center</h2>
<p>My name is Supawan Green, I’m a Buddhist author of some 40 books both in Thai and English. Throughout the past 20 years I have given talks, led retreats and conducted workshops comprising of meditation by using Tai Chi as a simple, non-religious means to ease mental pain for people. I have helped hundreds of students of different countries, creeds and religions to 'bring their mental self back home'.</p>With your help, I want to now take my teaching to a new level by establishing a center in which people can learn to use meditation through various means in order to reduce mental suffering.<br/><br/>It is my goal to help solve problems at the source: the mind - paving the way for global stability, peace and harmony.<br/><br/>The 'Bring Your Mental Self Back Home' Centre will consist of two departments:<br/><br/>a) Learning Area<br/>b) Practical Area<br/><br/>Learning Area <br/><br/>This area will help individuals understand how the human mind works and the reason for our confinement in the prison of life. Also learning how mental turmoil arises and how to combat it. Ajarn Supawan’s simple analogy of 'Tom and Jerry' will be the universal basis of learning how the human mind works. The analogy is well known amongst Supawan’s followers, but hasn’t been recognized by a wider audience; so this center will be able to propagate the use of this clear and simple device.<br/><br/>Practical Area<br/><br/> This department will enable the students to practice what they have learnt in the Learning Area. Equipping them with the crucial tools to help them through daily lives; both at work and at home, where they have to meet people who they like and dislike and all the challenges that come with these interactions. This practice will help people to reduce and overcome their mental turmoil in all forms. The crucial tool is to ‘bringing your mental self back home’.<br/><br/>The results of practicing the four foundations of mindfulness are:<br/>Solving the problem at the source: the mind. When the mind of the individual is strong due to this practice, they will develop the wisdom and know how to solve problems on their own without crossing the moral threshold. <br/><br/>By tackling the individual’s mind, this will amount to solving widespread social problems – creating an ‘Enlightening Culture’. By eradicating unwholesome thoughts, their actions will be wholesome and naturally moral. <br/><br/>The Rooms of the Practical Area<br/><br/>In terms of practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, the practitioner must engage in the practice continually in four different postures (sitting, walking, standing, lying) and in every waking moment. Therefore, a normal household environment is most ideal for this purpose. The practical area will be split into four rooms –<br/><br/>Massage and Meditation Room<br/><br/>Traditional Thai massage can easily be adapted to our ‘enlightening culture’ by emphasizing the execution of massage with mindfulness. In this room, both the masseur and the receiver will be encouraged to bring their mental selves back home to calm mental turmoil. This will also provide a wholesome occupation to prospective masseurs.<br/><br/>Meditative Exercise Room<br/><br/>This is the room where we will focus on physical activities such as Tai Chi, Qi Gong and Yoga. These exercises can help cultivate high levels of self-awareness and help people overcome mental turmoil.<br/><br/>Meditative Kitchen<br/><br/>The kitchen is the most important part of any household with lots of activities carried out here. It is therefore the ideal place to practice mindfulness with such activities as washing and chopping vegetables, cooking, cleaning and so on. All these daily menial activities contain hidden spiritual wealth. If they pursue witha the practice, the individual can easily find happiness in their everyday tasks.<br/><br/>Meditative Living Room<br/><br/>This room will focus on other tasks that aren't done in the kitchen: cleaning, sweeping, mopping, ironing, folding clothes, washing laundry from massage room,<br/>knitting, sewing, embroidery, painting and other artistic crafts, talking meditation.<br/><br/>Meditative Garden<br/><br/>Provided that the centre has enough space for a garden, all gardening activities will also be done in meditative manners as guided by Ajarn Supawan. <br/><br/>Planting the Seed of Enlightenment<br/><br/>You can see that this project is on a large scale and will require the appropriate funding to make it a reality.

<p><b>Ryan Stahl</b>- Hello to everyone here
at Indiegogo, my name is Ryan Stahl.  I was fortunate enough to grow up in
beautiful sunny Sarasota, FL where my favorite past times involve boating and
fishing.  I am also an avid music fanatic and thoroughly enjoy playing
guitar and exploring new music.  I received my bachelor's degree in
Entertainment Business from Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL and have
been working in the broadcast industry since graduating in 2012.  I have
experience working in sales at WXIN ( the FOX affiliate in Indianapolis).
 I also have experience in the software side of the advertising sector.
 I work for a software company called WideOrbit as an Implementation
Specialist, where I train businesses how to use and implement our business
management software efficiently to maximize revenue.  I have trained
numerous stations across the U.S., including stations owned by large corporations
such as Media General and Cox Media Group.  I have to coordinate all
departments within a station, which includes sales, traffic, accounting,
promotions, and master control.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Robert Roche</b>- Thank you for visiting our page on Indegogo! My name is Robert Roche and I am from Orlando Florida. When I was 18, I attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL where I studied marketing and business and dreamt about becoming an entrepreneur. During college I was driven to be a leader, an innovator, and inspired to be on the cutting edge. After graduating by the age of 20 with my bachelors degree, I had the pleasure in playing professional golf while I followed my dream of entrepreneurship. Later on I moved to Sarasota, FL where I worked with a travel company called Grand Incentives and helped launch over 3 new travel programs. I helped pioneer their sales script, ran a team that specialized in new product launches, and helped them cultivate a customer service team which increased company sales. I am currently specializing in sales and consulting in the Orlando area until Pedway is ready to launch which then I will spend my full time helping drive it’s success. </p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463846348/What_is_Pedway-_2_hg2drm.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>Pedway is an idea
my partners Robert Roche and I developed to help
people connect for both personally and professionally at a more in depth level than just meeting others through mutual
friends.  When I moved up to Indianapolis for my first career job, I
didn't know any people living there.  I had trouble finding new friends
and making new connections, it was difficult for me to move to a city where I
didn't know anyone.  This in turn took a toll on me, to the point where I
felt alone and depressed because I couldn't find any new friends I could
associate and collaborate with.  If I had a tool like Pedway at the
time, I could have used it to find local friends that have much of the same
commonalities as me.  It essentially is a tool used to break the ice
meeting new friends on a personal level.  I am confident my experience
would have been different if I had a tool like this at my disposal. </p>
<p>With proper funding,
we can make this dream become a reality.  We have invested many hours into
this idea.  Once we receive the proper funded needed to start this
campaign.  We can begin working a better future for everyone.  People
will be able to make friends much easier and businesses will be able to find
better quality candidates.  Today as a society we are so involved in
technology and it is only going to rise to new levels.  The ability to
network and meet as many people as we can to grow ourselves and our businesses
is essential to success in today's fast-paced environment.  Businesses
have been having trouble keeping employees in the long term.  Employees
move companies too often and we are confident we can start working towards
helping those employees find the right fit for their professional careers.
 It will also be much easier for people to make new friends on a personal
level.  Moving and traveling to new cities will be less stressful when
trying to network and connect to people who have many similarities. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F167570588&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F167570588&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F571901704_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463846457/What_is_Pedway-_3_htu4yg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Ryan Stahl- Hello to everyone here
at Indiegogo, my name is Ryan Stahl.  I was fortunate enough to grow up in
beautiful sunny Sarasota, FL where my favorite past times involve boating and
fishing.  I am also an avid music fanatic and thoroughly enjoy playing
guitar and exploring new music.  I received my bachelor's degree in
Entertainment Business from Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL and have
been working in the broadcast industry since graduating in 2012.  I have
experience working in sales at WXIN ( the FOX affiliate in Indianapolis).
 I also have experience in the software side of the advertising sector.
 I work for a software company called WideOrbit as an Implementation
Specialist, where I train businesses how to use and implement our business
management software efficiently to maximize revenue.  I have trained
numerous stations across the U.S., including stations owned by large corporations
such as Media General and Cox Media Group.  I have to coordinate all
departments within a station, which includes sales, traffic, accounting,
promotions, and master control.
Robert Roche- Thank you for visiting our page on Indegogo! My name is Robert Roche and I am from Orlando Florida. When I was 18, I attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, FL where I studied marketing and business and dreamt about becoming an entrepreneur. During college I was driven to be a leader, an innovator, and inspired to be on the cutting edge. After graduating by the age of 20 with my bachelors degree, I had the pleasure in playing professional golf while I followed my dream of entrepreneurship. Later on I moved to Sarasota, FL where I worked with a travel company called Grand Incentives and helped launch over 3 new travel programs. I helped pioneer their sales script, ran a team that specialized in new product launches, and helped them cultivate a customer service team which increased company sales. I am currently specializing in sales and consulting in the Orlando area until Pedway is ready to launch which then I will spend my full time helping drive it’s success.

The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation was launched in 2015 to represent the international organisation Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights in Switzerland.

The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation is a politically independent & confessionally neutral, non-for profit organization under Swiss law. The Foundation is exclusively funded by donations from within Switzerland and exclusively operates in Switzerland.

The foundation acts as a ""start-up"" in the Swiss NGO-scene and therefore is actively involved in fundraising, which is especially necessary to support the development of all material related to the educational program Speak Truth To Power.   


VISION STATEMENT 
""Continuing the legacy of Robert F. Kennedy and keeping to the long tradition of humanity and democracy in Switzerland, we strive for a society, in which every human being not only knows and respects human rights, but protects them during everyday life.""

SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER Speak Truth To Power is a multi-faceted human rights education program consisting of a book, an online learning platform, a photo exhibit, an iPad app (in development phase), and a theatre play. The whole program is free for all students in Switzerland. Children learn through this program that they too can be human rights defenders, and they too can stand up and speak out when they see injustice happening around them.Together with the Competence Center for Human Rights at the University of Zurich and the Teachers College in Fribourg, the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation developed a book containing stories of international as well as Swiss Human Rights defenders from the past and presence. 
Who are the people behind this crowdfunding campaign?
We represent a group of students in their final year of studies from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland who work together with the foundation. We were challenged with setting up a fundraising structure for this foundation. We strive to gain traction in Switzerland and share our thoughts about human rights with the world by doing so.  In order to push the program we need more funding to pay for current and future events to reach out to schools and students within Switzerland. A substantial part of the funds will be used to print and distribute educational material to schools directly.

<p>
</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our goal is to create and produce a mobile app series on conflict resolution for preschool age children.</p> Our pilot app will include the following:
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Seven to ten minute puppet video ""appisode""</li>
<li>Interactive games</li>
<li>Sing along with original music</li>
<li>Experts corner for parents and caregivers to nurture skills</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We believe we must use the digital space to develop content that generates positive interactions with peers, to counter–balance the possible loss of social–emotional skill development that can result from individual screen use. We will create an <b>app series</b> focused on conflict resolution to help break cycles of negative interaction and teach children skills of self–regulation in social situations, for example:</p>
<ul style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<li><b>Resolution of peer conflicts</b></li>

<p>During early childhood, children form lasting skills of communication, socialization and emotional development. Research also shows that at this time, peacemakers and bullies begin to emerge. Resolution of relational conflicts and the successful building of social–emotional skills can defuse frustrations that create negative outcomes, such as:</p>
<ul style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<li><b>Bullying</b></li>
<li><b><b>Exclusion</b></b></li>
<li><b><b><b>Violent Behavior</b></b></b></li>

Everything are almost in the palm of my hand, the agency already sent me the career plan everything is already set up, all I'm gonna do is to process my Visa and ready to go, some of my friends donated a small amount of money but still not enough for me to continue on my journey. That's why I'm here reaching out for help, I was hoping if some of you who can help me pursue my dream and continue on my journey, because for me there is still hope, even if there's only 1% chance for me to succeed I will still accept it.

You guys are my only hope to fulfill my dream to work in Connecticut.

How can you help me on my Career Training
Unfortunately, this career training with Madison beach hotel in Connecticut  is unpaid, So It will cost me approximately $6,205. I've been working hard for this for a few months but not enough to reach for that amount so some of my friends and family donated a small amount.Through this I have been able to cover the half of the expenses but still not enough to continue my journey, and that is where you come in. I’m asking for the support of anyone else who inspired by my story to help me raise funds to cover the other half. With your support I’m aiming to raise enough money to cover my flight costs this is required to be open ticket to ensure I have to go back in the Philippines after my 1 year contract, visa fees, my first 1 month of rent and expenses while I'm in Manila in order to make this dream into a reality!


$160 will help me cover my Visa costs
$2200 will help me cover my flight costs.This is the payment of the airfare round trip Manila-US-Manila (Open ticket)
$220 will help me cover my 1 month of rent
$220 will help me cover my pocket money and expenses in Manila





Connect me with your people; share my story with your friends, family, co-workers, anyone and everyone...after all, I am a big believer in the power of communities! Or do you know someone in Connecticut, maybe someone who can help me with accommodation, give me advice on Connecticut life or, just simply wish me luck!
You can also contact me on my Skype or Viber

<p>Hello! </p>
<p>Welcome to our crowd-funding page
for Goblin, an innovative children’s theatre company. </p>
<p>We’ve got some very exciting plans and we and we need
your help to make them happen!</p>
<p><b>Who are we?<span><br/></span></b>Goblin
is a children’s theatre company. Founded in 2013, Goblin have delighted
thousands and thousands of audience members with high-quality children’s
theatre featuring music, fun and lots of creativity. With shows such as <i>The
Ballad of Rudy</i>, <i>Mr Tiger Goes Wild</i> and <i>Penguin! Elephant!</i>
we’ve performed at some of the best venues in the UK, including The Royal
Exchange, Manchester and The Southbank Centre, London as well as the Edinburgh
Fringe. This year we are touring <i>Penguin! Elephant!</i> around the UK, and
creating a very special new show with Little Angel Theatre; <i>Emily Rising</i>
by Dan Rebellato.  </p>
<p><b>What’s the Aim?</b> <br/>
We want to bring high-quality theatre for children into schools. GOBLIN IN SCHOOLS
will be a new project which aims to create new and regular work that can go
into primary schools up and down the country.</p>
<p><b><span>Why
is it important?<span><br/></span></span></b>Theatre companies touring to primary
schools are often the first and only time children experience live performance.
We’ve heard from many teachers that they’d love more high-quality offers to be
available to schools. We make innovative and diverse work for children and we’d
love to bring this to as many people as possible. We want to make shows that enlighten
learning and the curriculum and that creatively stimulate passion in a
subject. </p>
<p><b>How are we going to do this?</b><br/>
We’re looking to start schools performances the Summer term of 2017, but it
takes a lot of planning. Following some detailed research with teachers, we
plan to create a new website and teacher resources, and with some chosen
partners start creating some shows which will be ready to go into schools. The
money raised will also pay for a part-time schools manager.  </p>
<b>And remember</b><div>Please help spread the word about this campaign especially on Facebook and Twitter and share this page with your friends/followers. </div><div>You can follow Goblin on twitter @goblintheatre or Facebook here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/goblintheatre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/goblintheatre/</a>

</div></div>","Why We Need Percy Station?


Somerset Street West is an undervalued urban space in the city of Ottawa. The area lacks a hub for cultural activity and exploration more than ever after the recent closure of Raw Sugar and the destruction of the Daily Grind, Middle East Bakery, Shiraz Market and A Dark Cloud Tattoo Parlour from a tragic fire last fall. The removal of these cultural institutions creates gaps in our urban fabric leading to a lack of participation in our local community. 

What is Percy Station?

Percy Station, a modular structure that thrives on rotating programming and functions as a shared community space. Through the City of Ottawa’s Streetside Spot program Percy Station will transform an area of street parking on Somerset Street near its intersection with Percy Street. Currently we have support from both the City of Ottawa and The Somerset Street Chinatown BIA.

Where Will Percy Station Be?

Percy station will be located on Somerset Street in front of the vacant lot where The Daily Grind, Middle East Bakery, Shiraz Market and A Dark Cloud Tattoo Parlour were housed before a fire destroyed their businesses in the fall of 2015.



An Opportunity to Contributing to Your Community
Percy Station creates a destination for pedestrians and cyclists in an area that has been stripped of culturally relevant businesses by a recent disaster. Reactivating this space will benefit businesses with increased foot traffic and contribute to the Somerset Street Chinatown BIA’s streetscape improvement and beautification initiatives. Programming the space will bring local artistic talent to Chinatown and discussions on urban development will excite people to explore the surrounding community.  
Improving Our Urban Landscape
Another major focus of Percy Station is to empower Ottawans through discussion and education about the processes behind urban development. Percy Station’s proximity to an undeveloped site creates a personal connection to these issues for visitors, adding incentive for self-organized conversations on improving our urban landscape. The Percy Station website will also provide space for discussion on the development of the adjacent plot, making this conversation accessible to everyone.

<div> </div>
<div>''Bucharest will host Outernational Days festival this weekend. Run by The Atticeditorial team, this will be the festival's inaugural edition. “The project was born out of a cultural need [to explore] a very wide musical spectrum, to which the Romanian audience lacked access until now,” the organisers explain in their mission statement.'' <strong><a href=""http://www.thewire.co.uk/news/42331/romanian-festival-outernational-days-takes-place-this-weekend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Wire</a> </strong>magazine. </div>

<p> </p>
<p>''The sheer existence of this sort of event, especially in a context like Bucharest, is a pretty huge, almost miraculous deal. The task of putting together three full days of concerts, complete with debates, workshops and club nights, sounds like an overly ambitious task and possible financial suicide, especially without corporate sponsors.'' <strong><a href=""http://revistaarta.ro/en/almost-a-holiday/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Revista Arta</a>.</strong></p>

<p>''A few months later I arranged a personal meeting with Dragos Rusu, the Editor in Chief of The Attic during CTM Festival in Berlin (January 2016). These blind date with email buddies can be a risky business as you can imagine. There is no guarantees that the words come easy. But not so with Dragos and his gang. These young bucks zipped through CTM Festival with an never-ending and wide-eyed curiosity – we almost had to tie them down in order not to lose them! Whether it was an hours-long artist talk on the schedule, or wildly improvised music set or the full-strength after-party, the editorial staff of The Attic have clearly dispensed with the need for sleep. Even in the most euphoric states of existence their interviews are jam-packed with interesting thoughts and insightful wisdom on the music taking place around us. And also fermenting in their minds was the idea of their own Attic Festival… in the tradition of CTM, but with the sounds of The Attic. Now, just five months later, Outernational Days Bucharest  is a reality and about to happen from 1. till 3. Juli in Bucharest. (I told you they don’t do sleep.)''. <i>Dreaming In The Discotheque</i> - <strong><a href=""http://www.kaput-mag.com/kolumne_en/outernational-days-bucharest_dreaming-in-the-discotheque/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kaput Magazine</a></strong>.  </p>

The band is composed by the three founding member (<strong>Horatiu Serbanescu, Andrei Dinescu, Eugen Imecs</strong>) plus frequencies maestro and guitarist <strong>Janin Pasniciuc</strong>. They are the creators of Steaua de Mare, Zebre, Aneb/Plevna or Shamaneslim projects, sharing their tunes into the diverse mix of IMEX!

<div>
<b>Ogoya Nengo</b>, born Anastasia Oluoch in 1943, in a small village called Magoya, near the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. Hailing from a family of singers and orators, she soon joined their trade and practice as social messengers and commentators, commonly referred to by the locals as Dodo singers. Already in her early teens Anastasia had achieved much acclaim in her society and received the name ""Ogoya Nengo"" which means ""The Priced One"" at the early age of 13. Ogoya became the rave of the time, criss-crossing the region with their music, singing to great chiefs, warriors and colonial officers who became enraptured by her talent. Ogoya Nengo's approach to Dodo, a genre which is in danger of vanishing, is a very personal one: Her timeless and mystical music is characterized by her powerful voice.</div>

<p><em><i>""A 4.000 year-old rock'n'roll band.”</i> William S. Burroughs</em></p>
<p><b>The Master Musicians of Jajouka</b> became a counter-cultural icon when Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones confessed that even he had trouble standing up to “the constant strain of the festival” during the performances he recorded in their tiny village in the foothills of Morocco’s Rif Mountains. Their reputation was cemented when Rolling Stones Records released “Brian Jones presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka” in 1971, and that reputation continues until today.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the music projects that we propose and would like to present at <b>Outernational Days 2</b>:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong><a href=""http://www.sunraarkestra.com/1-main.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sun Ra Arkestra</a></strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Sun Ra</strong> was one of the greatest and least known jazz artists of the last four decades, whose influence on diverse musicians is little known to the general public. A pianist and band leader, his style ranged from retro swing to avant free, and often in the same piece. His band could play a swinging Gershwin tune and almost imperceptibly soar into their free cosmic equational tones as if they possessed a single mind. </p>
<p>The Arkestra still performs today, under the able direction of alto saxophonist <strong>Marshall Allen</strong>. Sun Ra said and wrote many strange things while he was upon this planet. The easy, mindless reaction is to just label him ""weird"" and hide behind that facile label. Another possibility is that he was passionately engaged in and by his creative mythology, and that what he really meant could only be articulated in his music.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaoTYqmfWhg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Karkhana</a>  </b></li></ul>
<p>BEIRUT-CAIRO-ISTANBUL: Combining some of the most innovative players from Beirut, Cairo and Istanbul, <strong>Karkhana</strong> met in Beirut for the first time in February 2014. They recorded both live and in studio for Italian vinyl label Sagittarius A-Star. They recently meet in Beirut again, albeit with a variation on their last line up, to share their blend of free jazz and psychedelic with various shades and traces of shaabi, tarab, sufi and much more.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZ0g29wSak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hailu Mergia with Tony Buck &amp; Mike Majkowski</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hailu Mergia</strong> was a star in the 1970s: As keyboarder of the legendary Walias Band he jammed in the hotels of Addis Ababa with such legends as Duke Ellington and Manu Dibango. Mergia took advantage of a US tour to flee the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia and has since been living as a taxi driver in Washington, D.C. The Awesome Tapes from Africa label is to thank for the revival of Mergia’s unique music, with reissues of the album “Hailu Mergia &amp; His Classical Instrument” ( 1985 ) and the dizzying-sum-fetching record “Tche Belew” ( 1977 ) which created a furore. Mergia is now back on the road, with exceptional Australian musicians <strong>Tony Buck </strong>( The Necks ) on drums and <strong>Mike Majkowski </strong>on double bass. Mergia’s music is hypnotic, futuristic and nostalgic in equal measure: The trio’s intense concerts are true one-of-a-kind experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CteuXaURw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meridian Brothers (Colombia)</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Meridian Brothers</strong> is tropical / psychedelic group from Colombia.

<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmFPJaV58hU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force (Dakar / Berlin)</a></b></li></ul>
<p>This is not sanitized music for the feelgood market. This is the real deal, stripped down to its essentials - stringent repetitiveness meets rhythmic complexity. Singer/MC <strong>Mbene Diatta Seck</strong>, talking drum master <strong>Modou Mbaye</strong> and dancer <strong>Fatou Wore Mboup </strong>with their stunning stage presence and energy are joined by legendary veteran characters like sabar drummer <strong>Bada Seck</strong> and guitar player <strong>Assane ""Ndoye"" Cisse</strong> - who have both played with Baaba Maal for some 30 years - and some young hotshots from the Dakar scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPP_bkMUG2k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Les Filles de Illighadad - Fatou Seidi Ghali &amp; Alamnou Akrouni (Niger)</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Fatou Seidi Ghali</strong> and <strong>Alamnou Akrouni</strong> reside in the tiny village of Illighadad, Niger. Fatou plays the tende, and an old blue guitar, slightly bent because of the extreme weather. She is one of only two Tuareg female guitarists. Together with her cousin, vocalist Alamnou Akrouni, they strip Tuareg music from all progressive leanings, right back to its bare essence. Various Western African artists have expanded the Tuareg-blues movement on a global scale, but rarely have these soul-purging sounds resonated so candidly and emotively.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnEvDarue4Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">James Holden with live band</a></b></li></ul>
<p>British musician <strong>James Holden </strong>is a man of many talents: zeitgeist-defining label boss of Border Community, trend-setting producer, hugely in-demand monster remixer, and a talented DJ. He developed a new project with the intent on keeping live collaborative performance at the centre of his music-making for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>iNSANLAR</strong> consists of Turkish musicians <strong>Cem Yıldız </strong>on vocal, bağlama and electronics, <strong>Barış K</strong> on electronics and <strong>Hogır</strong> on percussions and vocal percussions. The trio delve deep into their Anatolian ancestry with this piece, they go as far back as the 16th &amp; 17th Centuries.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9z17eZv5WA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bombino (Tuareg/Niger)</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Omara ""Bombino"" Moctar</strong> is an internationally acclaimed Tuareg guitarist and singer-songwriter from Agadez, Niger. His music frequently addresses Tuareg geopolitical concerns and is sung in the Tuareg language of Tamasheq.  With the widely-acclaimed international release of Agadez, Bombino has established himself as a definitive and timeless African guitarist.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah_6AC1XG9Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Okay Temiz presents Oriental Wind Ensemble (Turkey)</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Okay Temiz</strong> is a leading Turkish fusion jazz percussionist and drummer. Okay Temiz's Oriental Wind years established him as an ethnic jazz musician. He works with traditional tunes, but does not just play them in a different setting with different instruments. He takes it further into improvisation. Meanwhile, other non-Turkish musicians in the group are not trying to play Turkish music either. They have ideas of their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_As1wKRuTH4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shamanelism (Romania)</a></b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Shamanelism</strong> is an unconventional band whose members are convicts from prison for juvenile from Rahova (Bucharest) and Craiova. The band was formed several years ago and it was conducted by Romanian musicians <strong>Andrei Dinescu, Horațiu Șerbănescu</strong> and <strong>Ion Dumitrescu</strong>. The main aim of the project was to help reconsider the relationship between the society and the penitentiary system, beyond and kind of prejudice, helping the inmates to reintegrate in the community after detention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will continue working with our friends from the <strong>Future Nuggets</strong> and <strong>Paradaiz</strong> collectives on developing new projects commissioned for the festival. </p>
<p>In time, we want to develop spirited projects commissioned for Outernational, together with artists and ensembles who performed in our past Outernational events: Rabih Beaini, Vincent Moon, Idris Ackamoor, Senyawa, Paradise Bangkok, Praed, Alan Bishop, Maurice Louca, Khidja, Booty Carrell, DJ soFa. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your donations will have a massive impact on the festival. Not only are you helping fund the artistic part of the festival for 2017, but you are helping support live music for this year and years to come. Your donations help us keep the ticket prices affordable, so that everybody can enjoy live music and have a multicultural experience at affordable costs.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Outernational is a much wider and unexplored terrain, with a huge potential to expand. We are aware of the condition of music in influencing social perceptions and ultimately try to better understand the world around us.</span></p>
</div>
<div><p>The first edition of <b>Outernational Days </b>festival gathered a total of <b>3,000 participants</b> during the <strong>three days</strong> of the festival, for both the locations: <i>Uranus Garden</i> (no. 144 Uranus St.) and <i>Control Club</i> (no. 4 Constantin Mille St.). <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The audience was very diverse, from teenagers to adults, from young students to parents who came with their children. </span></p></div>
<div>Your contributions will help <b>Outernational Days </b>become an annual summer festival, where everybody is welcome!</div>

<p>What if we don’t reach our goal? We will still use any money raised to help continue our mission: the series of <b>Outernational Night</b> events and the festival <b>Outernational Days 2</b>, but we risk not being able to bring all the projects in 2017.</p>
<ul>
<li>We may need to reduce the number of days of festival to 2 days.</li>
<li>We may need to reduce the number of the bands participating.</li>
<li>We may need to increase the cost of tickets.</li>

</div></div>","Who we are
We are The Attic and this is our story. 
 

We are a group of passionate people from Bucharest and beyond that investigate different cultures from all over the world. We created an online platform that functions as a magazine, with the aim of publishing insightful interviews with artists and bands, as well as various features, articles, video and audio podcasts. The music approach has no typical boundaries of gender, style, time or space, but admits its importance and relevance. We question everything and try to pursuit the essence of what we believe is good, timeless and continues to resonate regardless of its release date. We organise cultural events in different venues in Bucharest, from Outernational concerts to avant-garde electronic music live performances.

 

What is Outernational Days festival
We created Outernational Days as a festival that wants to fight prejudices, vices and fears, a festival where everyone is welcome, regardless of age, cultural background, social position, gender or ethnicity.

We defined Outernational as a place positioned outside of history; as a shapeless world that has been developing at the periphery of the International sphere. What makes Outernational music so distinct is its lack of exposure in mainstream and non-mainstream media, for reasons that are usually linked to ethnical biases. Outernational music comprises many contemporary hybrids from all over the world: from Kurdish halay to Romanian manele, from Bulgarian orkestras of chalga to Peruvian chicha, from Palestinian dabke to Mexican narcocorrido, Egyptian electro-chabi  and many other genres and styles.

 
What the media said
''Bucharest's inaugural Outernational Days festival which is putting Romanian folk music centre stage while fighting for space in the city's tragically diminished live scene''. Review of Outernational Days 2016 in The Quietus. 
 
''Bucharest will host Outernational Days festival this weekend. Run by The Atticeditorial team, this will be the festival's inaugural edition. “The project was born out of a cultural need [to explore] a very wide musical spectrum, to which the Romanian audience lacked access until now,” the organisers explain in their mission statement.'' The Wire magazine. 
 

''Outernational Days brings Rabih Beaini, Andy Votel to Romania in 2016. The new three-day event explores the music of peripheral cultures.'' Resident Advisor. 
 
''The sheer existence of this sort of event, especially in a context like Bucharest, is a pretty huge, almost miraculous deal. The task of putting together three full days of concerts, complete with debates, workshops and club nights, sounds like an overly ambitious task and possible financial suicide, especially without corporate sponsors.'' Revista Arta.
 
''A few months later I arranged a personal meeting with Dragos Rusu, the Editor in Chief of The Attic during CTM Festival in Berlin (January 2016). These blind date with email buddies can be a risky business as you can imagine. There is no guarantees that the words come easy. But not so with Dragos and his gang. These young bucks zipped through CTM Festival with an never-ending and wide-eyed curiosity – we almost had to tie them down in order not to lose them! Whether it was an hours-long artist talk on the schedule, or wildly improvised music set or the full-strength after-party, the editorial staff of The Attic have clearly dispensed with the need for sleep. Even in the most euphoric states of existence their interviews are jam-packed with interesting thoughts and insightful wisdom on the music taking place around us. And also fermenting in their minds was the idea of their own Attic Festival… in the tradition of CTM, but with the sounds of The Attic. Now, just five months later, Outernational Days Bucharest  is a reality and about to happen from 1. till 3. Juli in Bucharest. (I told you they don’t do sleep.)''. Dreaming In The Discotheque - Kaput Magazine.  
 

 
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help in order to continue our mission of transforming the global into local, and viceversa. Your contributions will help us make Outernational Days a self-sustainable and independent festival, which would become financially accessible to everybody, with no discrimination of any sort. 
We really appreciate any amount you contribute. And to show our appreciation we have some cool perks to say thank you!

 
Our perks include:

tickets to our events from the Outernational Night series; 


tickets to Outernational Days 2 festival, June 30 - July 2, 2017; 

Outernational specially designed T-shirts and bags;
very limited tape/CD with one concert from the 2016 edition of the festival, on demand;
posters, stickers and collectables from our past & future events; 
vouchers of different values, to be used at Outernational Days 2 festival;
Bucharest city-tour conducted by members of our team; 
studio session with professional Romanian producers/musicians;
the possibility to visit and meet Romanian musicians of oral tradition, in their own environment;
dinner with a Romanian artist at the infamous restaurant Hanul Drumețului in Bucharest;
private percussion and didgeridoo lessons in Bucharest with professional musicians.

 
In order to continue our mission, we created an international crowdfunding campaign to support Outernational, with a total goal of 25.000 USD. We will use your contributions to pay the artists and bands booked for Outernational. This includes artist fees, travel and accommodation costs. 
 The total budget of a festival with a magnitude such as Outernational Days is much bigger than our proposed goal and includes many other costs besides the artistic part (such as the rent of the Uranus garden and the necessary improvements of the space, sound-system, stage, lights, security, promotion of the event through outdoor print and social media). Awareness
We want to raise awareness of the Outernational concept, so we've come up with 5 punctual Outernational Night events that will happen in Bucharest before the second edition of our festival. Every event will comprise premiere concerts with bands from all over the world, local ensembles, as well as panel discussions, lectures and movie screenings.
 

October 1, 2016, Outernational Night #1: The Dwarfs of East Agouza (Cairo) 

Facebook event
The Dwarfs of East Agouza is a trio from Cairo, Egypt, featuring Maurice Louca (Alif, Bikya), Sam Shalabi (Land of Kush, Shalabi Effect) and Alan Bishop (Sun City Girls, The Invisible Hands, Alvarius B.). Born during 2012 when the three were living in the same apartment building in Cairo’s Agouza district, the trio’s instrumental improvisation-based explorations are propelled by Louca’s North African percussion loops and shimmering keys, Shalabi’s West African tinged free jazz guitar and grounded by Bishop’s driving Krautrock-style acoustic bass. 


October 28, 2016,  Outernational Night #2: Jerusalem in my Heart (LB/CA) // Impex (RO)

Facebook event


Jerusalem In My Heart (JIMH) is a live audio-visual happening since 2005, with Montréal-based producer and musician Radwan Ghazi Moumneh at its core. Moumneh is a Lebanese national who has spent a large part of his adult life in Canada and has been a fixture of the Montréal independent music community from his early days as guitarist in various notable 90s bands to his tireless activity as a sound engineer and producer over the last decade. Moumneh is also active in the Beirut and Lebanese experimental music scenes, where he spends a few months every year. 

Impex imports and exports rhythms and sounds from the universe to the world and vice versa. Sound wise, the band goes through a large array of styles, from house, rock, manele, jazz, Romanian emo, IDM, electro and folk music to contemporary classical music. The band is composed by the three founding member (Horatiu Serbanescu, Andrei Dinescu, Eugen Imecs) plus frequencies maestro and guitarist Janin Pasniciuc. They are the creators of Steaua de Mare, Zebre, Aneb/Plevna or Shamaneslim projects, sharing their tunes into the diverse mix of IMEX! During a live show, many surprise guests take the spotlight, their ages varying from 15 to 70 years old.
 


December, 2016, Outernational Night #3: Baba Commandant & The Mandingo Band (BF)   
Facebook event 

 
Baba Commandant & The Mandingo Band are a contemporary group from Burkina Faso. Coming from Bobo-Dioulasso, the group is steeped in the Mandingue musical traditions of their ancestral legacy. The enigmatic lead singer Baba Commandant (on his real name Mamadou Sanou) is an original and eccentric character who is well respected in the Burkinabé musical community. 
 

Spring 2017, Outernational Night #4: Ogoya Nengo & The Dodo Women's Group (Kenya) 


Ogoya Nengo, born Anastasia Oluoch in 1943, in a small village called Magoya, near the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. Hailing from a family of singers and orators, she soon joined their trade and practice as social messengers and commentators, commonly referred to by the locals as Dodo singers. Already in her early teens Anastasia had achieved much acclaim in her society and received the name ""Ogoya Nengo"" which means ""The Priced One"" at the early age of 13. Ogoya became the rave of the time, criss-crossing the region with their music, singing to great chiefs, warriors and colonial officers who became enraptured by her talent. Ogoya Nengo's approach to Dodo, a genre which is in danger of vanishing, is a very personal one: Her timeless and mystical music is characterized by her powerful voice.
 

Spring 2017, Outernational Night #5: The Master Musicians of Jajouka (Morocco)

""A 4.000 year-old rock'n'roll band.” William S. Burroughs
The Master Musicians of Jajouka became a counter-cultural icon when Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones confessed that even he had trouble standing up to “the constant strain of the festival” during the performances he recorded in their tiny village in the foothills of Morocco’s Rif Mountains. Their reputation was cemented when Rolling Stones Records released “Brian Jones presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka” in 1971, and that reputation continues until today.
 
Outernational Days 2 
June 30 - July 2, 2017
For the second edition of Outernational Days we want to bring to Bucharest musicians from Morocco, Greece, Mali, Asia, Kenya, amongst other areas. We want to increase the number of female musicians playing on stage and develop new ensembles of local musicians. Besides music, we want to screen film documentaries and organise more discursive events (lectures, panels, a/v installations).

We want to create a unique space from the Uranus garden, the venue of our festival. We want to engage local visual artists who would contribute in offering to the audience a nocturne dimension of the festival. This garden hides one of the last standing water castles in Bucharest, engineered by Anghel Saligny and built sometime around the 1800s. The landmark survived massive demolition during the Communist period and multiple fires. Uranus manages to capture the true essence of Outernational and urban space in Bucharest, tempting through a combo of distinct elements and a relaxed, cool atmosphere created in the heart of chaos and unrest. It is a sheer oasis, around which everything gravitates with speed.

We want to enhance the involvement of the local communities in our festival, get more volunteers, organise more music workshops, screen more documentary films and encourage new local music ensembles/projects to play on stage.

Here are just a few of the music projects that we propose and would like to present at Outernational Days 2:
 
The Sun Ra Arkestra
Sun Ra was one of the greatest and least known jazz artists of the last four decades, whose influence on diverse musicians is little known to the general public. A pianist and band leader, his style ranged from retro swing to avant free, and often in the same piece. His band could play a swinging Gershwin tune and almost imperceptibly soar into their free cosmic equational tones as if they possessed a single mind. 
The Arkestra still performs today, under the able direction of alto saxophonist Marshall Allen. Sun Ra said and wrote many strange things while he was upon this planet. The easy, mindless reaction is to just label him ""weird"" and hide behind that facile label. Another possibility is that he was passionately engaged in and by his creative mythology, and that what he really meant could only be articulated in his music.
 
Karkhana  
BEIRUT-CAIRO-ISTANBUL: Combining some of the most innovative players from Beirut, Cairo and Istanbul, Karkhana met in Beirut for the first time in February 2014. They recorded both live and in studio for Italian vinyl label Sagittarius A-Star. They recently meet in Beirut again, albeit with a variation on their last line up, to share their blend of free jazz and psychedelic with various shades and traces of shaabi, tarab, sufi and much more.
 
Hailu Mergia with Tony Buck & Mike Majkowski
Hailu Mergia was a star in the 1970s: As keyboarder of the legendary Walias Band he jammed in the hotels of Addis Ababa with such legends as Duke Ellington and Manu Dibango. Mergia took advantage of a US tour to flee the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia and has since been living as a taxi driver in Washington, D.C.

Meridian Brothers is tropical / psychedelic group from Colombia. Born in Bogotá in 1998 and based on the musical interests of composer Eblis Alvarez, in the beginning, the project was focused exclusively on cassette recordings and experimentation with alternative ways of playing instruments and electronic media.
 
Mark Ernestus' Ndagga Rhythm Force (Dakar / Berlin)
This is not sanitized music for the feelgood market. This is the real deal, stripped down to its essentials - stringent repetitiveness meets rhythmic complexity. Singer/MC Mbene Diatta Seck, talking drum master Modou Mbaye and dancer Fatou Wore Mboup with their stunning stage presence and energy are joined by legendary veteran characters like sabar drummer Bada Seck and guitar player Assane ""Ndoye"" Cisse - who have both played with Baaba Maal for some 30 years - and some young hotshots from the Dakar scene.
 
Les Filles de Illighadad - Fatou Seidi Ghali & Alamnou Akrouni (Niger)
Fatou Seidi Ghali and Alamnou Akrouni reside in the tiny village of Illighadad, Niger. Fatou plays the tende, and an old blue guitar, slightly bent because of the extreme weather.

British musician James Holden is a man of many talents: zeitgeist-defining label boss of Border Community, trend-setting producer, hugely in-demand monster remixer, and a talented DJ. He developed a new project with the intent on keeping live collaborative performance at the centre of his music-making for the foreseeable future.
 
iNSANLAR (Turkey)
iNSANLAR consists of Turkish musicians Cem Yıldız on vocal, bağlama and electronics, Barış K on electronics and Hogır on percussions and vocal percussions. The trio delve deep into their Anatolian ancestry with this piece, they go as far back as the 16th & 17th Centuries.
 
Bombino (Tuareg/Niger)
Omara ""Bombino"" Moctar is an internationally acclaimed Tuareg guitarist and singer-songwriter from Agadez, Niger. His music frequently addresses Tuareg geopolitical concerns and is sung in the Tuareg language of Tamasheq.  With the widely-acclaimed international release of Agadez, Bombino has established himself as a definitive and timeless African guitarist.
 
Okay Temiz presents Oriental Wind Ensemble (Turkey)
Okay Temiz is a leading Turkish fusion jazz percussionist and drummer. Okay Temiz's Oriental Wind years established him as an ethnic jazz musician. He works with traditional tunes, but does not just play them in a different setting with different instruments. He takes it further into improvisation. Meanwhile, other non-Turkish musicians in the group are not trying to play Turkish music either. They have ideas of their own.
 
Shamanelism (Romania)
Shamanelism is an unconventional band whose members are convicts from prison for juvenile from Rahova (Bucharest) and Craiova. The band was formed several years ago and it was conducted by Romanian musicians Andrei Dinescu, Horațiu Șerbănescu and Ion Dumitrescu. The main aim of the project was to help reconsider the relationship between the society and the penitentiary system, beyond and kind of prejudice, helping the inmates to reintegrate in the community after detention.
 
We will continue working with our friends from the Future Nuggets and Paradaiz collectives on developing new projects commissioned for the festival. 
In time, we want to develop spirited projects commissioned for Outernational, together with artists and ensembles who performed in our past Outernational events: Rabih Beaini, Vincent Moon, Idris Ackamoor, Senyawa, Paradise Bangkok, Praed, Alan Bishop, Maurice Louca, Khidja, Booty Carrell, DJ soFa. 
 
Please help us grow this festival to an amazing community event!
 
Our goal is flexible, so even if we don't reach the entire of it, any of the funds we will get from your donations will be used to continue our series of Outernational events and develop the second edition of Outernational Days. 


The Impact

Your donations will have a massive impact on the festival. Not only are you helping fund the artistic part of the festival for 2017, but you are helping support live music for this year and years to come. Your donations help us keep the ticket prices affordable, so that everybody can enjoy live music and have a multicultural experience at affordable costs.  
Outernational is a much wider and unexplored terrain, with a huge potential to expand. We are aware of the condition of music in influencing social perceptions and ultimately try to better understand the world around us.

The first edition of Outernational Days festival gathered a total of 3,000 participants during the three days of the festival, for both the locations: Uranus Garden (no. 144 Uranus St.) and Control Club (no. 4 Constantin Mille St.). The audience was very diverse, from teenagers to adults, from young students to parents who came with their children. 
Your contributions will help Outernational Days become an annual summer festival, where everybody is welcome!
 
Risks & Challenges

What if we don’t reach our goal? We will still use any money raised to help continue our mission: the series of Outernational Night events and the festival Outernational Days 2, but we risk not being able to bring all the projects in 2017.

We may need to reduce the number of days of festival to 2 days.
We may need to reduce the number of the bands participating.
We may need to increase the cost of tickets.

<p>I was born in 1990 into a poor

high school in 2009. Unfortunately my family couldn’t support me so
I could start the university just in 2011.</p>
<p>I start studying English in Our Objective
Organization, a very valid school. In the meanwhile I began the English
Literature course at university just in the week-ends. In 2012 I got my first
job as English teacher and interpreter in Hope Agency Organization. I was overworking
and doing manual jobs not in my tasks for little money and not enough for
paying my studies. So I was obliged to look for another job and after months I
found a teaching position in a private school in Angkor Borei. However, soon I
realized that the manager didn’t care about the education of the children,
neither about paying the bills of the school or the salaries of the teachers. I
was exhausted of working for not honest people so I decided to take the control
of the situation, I became the new director of the school, I paid all the debts
the former manager left by selling the only possession my parents could give
me, and I founded the Asean International English School in April 2014. One

<p>That’s how our school was born. At

monthly fee for children is based upon the income of their family, if they are
very poor we try to get some scholarship for them. At present we have twenty
children who doesn't pay anything and we will like to help more families but it
is not easy to find external helps. Our school provide for each student English
courses three hours per day every day. We have five teachers and they need to
be paid as well. The history of our country is not helping us, Cambodia is
trying to get up after years of war and a very dark period in the Seventies’.

<h3><strong>THE DRS. WOLFSON ECO PROJECT FUNDRAISER</strong></h3>
<p>Every child deserves to be in a school that supports their health, their happiness and their education. Unfortunately, most public and private schools in America fall way short of that standard. Kid’s aren’t healthy; in fact, they’re sicker than ever. Kids aren’t happy, as more kids than ever are being treated for mental health issues. Kids aren’t learning, as studies show American school age children academically behind their peers in other developed countries.</p>
<p>And why are school-age kids having these problems? Because schools feed kids bad food. They expose kids to environmental toxins. They don’t let them play outside in non-polluted soils. They teach them to take tests rather than to learn.</p>
<p>The Drs. Wolfson ECO School in is a unique, nature-based learning experience for kids in pre-K through 6th grade. It’s a school where playtime outside in non-polluted soils is encouraged, where only organic nutritious foods are served, and where kids aren’t constantly exposed to environmental pollutants. The Drs. Wolfson ECO School’s focus is to nurture a child’s natural inquisitiveness in an organic, toxic-free environment, while boosting their self-confidence and teaching them to become independent learners and thinkers.</p>

<p>We are a team which started an educational project that's been going for 5 years now and hundreds of people came here to learn. Over the years we studied ecological architecture and permaculture design in order to bring you the best quality education in acroecology and natural construction.</p>
<p>Baza Ulmu is a unique permaculture design school where people from all around the world come and learn natural building, no till gardening, food forests and much more useful information following the key permaculture design principles. We are here to give you the right tools and neccessary skills to create your abundant landscape and/or eco-house with all the facilities in order improve the quality of life for you and your family.</p>

<p>Baza Ulmu was created to inspire people of all ages. </p>
<p>An international project developed by its co-founders and people from all around the world have helped make this dream come true and now we can say it's time to turn this into a public educational space. We bring in permaculture designers and architects as well as eco-builders for courses to teach people how to start their own projects, build their houses or grow their food in a sustainable way. Sometimes entire classrooms of children come here with their teachers and we don't have the necessary facilities to accommodate them. This campaign will help create the right learning conditions for people of all ages and will give an example for other educational projects.</p>

<p>We want to dedicate ourselves full-time to this project that can go on for decades. </p>
<p>Together we can make a world class permaculture center where people can learn the importance of where their food comes from, agroecology systems, passive solar houses, alternative energy and much more. Everything we've done so far was through our own effort and honest earned money which is quite limited (minimum wage in Romania is 220 euro/month).</p>
<p>Together we can produce valuable video content for everyone! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“ Come to this place and get to learn some permaculture, some natural building techniques / It’s lovely place in the middle of nature. / With very involved very motivated knowledgeble pleople sharing what they learned in the past years with you”.</p>

<p>What if there was a place like a Hobbit land in the middle of nature where you could come and learn everything you wanted to know about eco-building about permaculture, agroecology, passive solar houses, rocket stoves, plants and animals, growing your own food or sustainability?</p>
<p>What if you could learn all this through online courses made specially for your needs, both from a classroom environment and directly from the field when we go to clients for consultancy.</p>
<p>What if there was also a glamping resort wher you could come and get hosted?</p>
<p>What about a space designed especially for children where adults and children alike could come and learn thru play and non formal education?</p>
<p>In order for you to fully enjoy our educational center we need to build a classroom for the courses, develop the glamping resort for good accommodation, make a communal kitchen and dinning space and built showers. This would make it fit for an educational trip and a summer retreat vacation.</p>

<p>It was an amazing experience creating BAZA ULMU, but we are a small team and we can’t do everything on our own. That’s why we ask your help so we can improve the quality of our corses and to build all the facilities needed in order to bring more people in and to make sure that everyone takes home a wealth of information as well as an amazing experience!</p>
<p>  With 10.000 USD we can build a classroom with all the necessary equipment and accommodation for overnight stay for 24 people. </p>
<p>The cost of the classroom + equipment is 4000 USD</p>
<p>The cost of accommodation huts is 1000 USD/hut x 6 can host 4 people/hut</p>
<p>With 15000USD we could finish the main house, build the classroom, huts and plant our entire food forest and make a new film.</p>
<p>With 20000USD we could have all of the above plus off the grid electricity and the ability to invest in a business that can generate our income so that we can become financially independent.  </p>

<p>What if you could learn to design natural integrated systems that produce healthy and abundant food indefinitely?</p>
<p>You could meet a lot of people who have the same mindset about ecology.</p>
<p>You could have some hands on experience and practice some skills which they could never do in a classic city classroom.</p>
<p>You could learn how to use some tools like different hand tools and start getting building start to get designing…</p>
<p>Finding solutions for building your home with natural materials and techniques can be difficult.</p>
<p>So is designing a food production system… It’s amazing how many people design and build their houses without considering their health, esthetics or ergonomics.</p>
<p>By choosing the right kind of materials and techniques and learning how to design these natural buildings you could not only save a lot of money but also have a farm where you feel in a holiday year round.</p>
<p>Here you could learn how to use different tools for building, gardening and designing that will help you develop and implement your own plan.</p>

<p>This film is about our project, how it started up until this very moment. It includes specific information about our design and how everything is interconnected eg: the water from the roof is collected with no visible piping and goes passively into the garden which doesn't need any additional water year round. </p>
<p>How we've built our permanent raised beds and how we manage them</p>
<p>Tools we use, food forest strategies</p>
<p>Real designs for real clients that we break down with you</p>
<p>Frequently asked questions and more</p>

<p>This picture represents ""wallpaper B""</p>
<p>This film, you guessed it, is about natural building. It includes specific information about earth friendly materials and how to design and build a lasting and beautiful house, but also annexes such as: root cellar, terrace, solar shower, rocket mass heaters, rocket stoves, living roofs and more.</p>
<p>Subjects followed in the film:  What is bio-construction? How to design from scratch or upgrade your home. What you want vs what you need. Maximising resources. Passive solar houses. Different building techniques and materials: Superadobe, cordwood, living roofs, cob, thatch, wood, rocket mass heaters, </p>
<p>Discussions on designs we made for different clients and situations. Frequently asked questions and many more.</p>
<p>Andrei studied design and ecological architecture and is working with architects and engineers to provide projects for others. </p>
<p>Lucian studied film making to make all this possible, video is a powerful educational tool and with your help we can make more content in the future.</p>
<p>We've put together a variety of perks to include everyone's possibilities, whether you're a fan or future eco-builder/permaculture designer there is something for everybody.</p>
<p>Ex. check out the <a href=""https://giphy.com/gifs/3oz8xrLW5mXOoKAQTu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">T-shirts</a> </p>
<p>     If we don't reach our entire goal we will focus on building the classroom and perhaps one or two accommodation huts but it's going to take us a very long time without your help perhaps years. And the films have already entered the production stage so they will be done within our established time frame.</p>

<p>With your help, we can create an educational space which you and your friends, as well as thousands of other people will enjoy later on by attending our classes. Children need to take part in non formal education as well as ecological education as soon as possible. The outdoors and fresh air as well as healthy food combined with dynamic activities is a winning situation in which kids could learn about the importance of where their food comes from and how to play in an Earth safe environment.</p>
<p>Our project has already gained a lot of media attention and was featured in many newspapers, articles online and tv programmes:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480601122/w4ixbtmz2lq6dwuheqob.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are always invited for talks in the country and abroad and are active members in the Romanian Permaculture Association. Starting February we will finish the necessary paperwork to create Baza Ulmu Association. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We will do our very best to finish our entire design of our education centre in a timely manner however it's pretty hard to find skilled workers that are able to stay for a couple of months (commuting is impractical every day because we are 20 km from the city in a mountaneous area). We do almost everything ourselves and are working around the clock sometimes 12 hrs a day rain or shine. Another issue is the films as they are not yet produced. We have about 90% of the video and audio we want to use and are working with a storyboard. However this is the first time we take on such a demanding challenge of completing two films in a matter of months in a 3 people team. Lucian spent around 500 euro only for ALL of the filming equipment including the post production software so cost isn't really an issue. Almost all our footage has been filmed and edited with this equipment.  We are very optimistic! </p>
<p>We’ve  put together an amazing group of collaborators and partners</p>
<p>Hundreds of volunteers have helped and learned in this center in 5 years!</p>
<p>Now this is where you come in: we are so close of bringing BAZA ULMU SCHOOL to life but we need your support to help complete this project so we can share this knowledge to the world!</p>

We are here to give you the right tools and neccessary skills to create your abundant landscape and/or eco-house with all the facilities in order improve the quality of life for you and your family.

Andrei is a designer and passionate eco-builder who teaches natural building. From concept to implementation, anything is possible within reason. Find his C.V. here.
Lucian can walk you through our no dig, productive food systems and tell you things you never knew about the magic in the plant kingdom. C.V.
Roxi has translated permaculture books and helped with the immigration situation from Africa.
We are dedicated to things that really matter!

Baza Ulmu was created to inspire people of all ages. 
An international project developed by its co-founders and people from all around the world have helped make this dream come true and now we can say it's time to turn this into a public educational space. We bring in permaculture designers and architects as well as eco-builders for courses to teach people how to start their own projects, build their houses or grow their food in a sustainable way. Sometimes entire classrooms of children come here with their teachers and we don't have the necessary facilities to accommodate them. This campaign will help create the right learning conditions for people of all ages and will give an example for other educational projects.

We want to dedicate ourselves full-time to this project that can go on for decades. 
Together we can make a world class permaculture center where people can learn the importance of where their food comes from, agroecology systems, passive solar houses, alternative energy and much more. Everything we've done so far was through our own effort and honest earned money which is quite limited (minimum wage in Romania is 220 euro/month).
Together we can produce valuable video content for everyone! 
 
“ Come to this place and get to learn some permaculture, some natural building techniques / It’s lovely place in the middle of nature. / With very involved very motivated knowledgeble pleople sharing what they learned in the past years with you”.
                                       TUDOR Petrutiu - Romanian Permaculture Association
 
 

 

 
What if there was a place like a Hobbit land in the middle of nature where you could come and learn everything you wanted to know about eco-building about permaculture, agroecology, passive solar houses, rocket stoves, plants and animals, growing your own food or sustainability?
What if you could learn all this through online courses made specially for your needs, both from a classroom environment and directly from the field when we go to clients for consultancy.
What if there was also a glamping resort wher you could come and get hosted?
What about a space designed especially for children where adults and children alike could come and learn thru play and non formal education?
In order for you to fully enjoy our educational center we need to build a classroom for the courses, develop the glamping resort for good accommodation, make a communal kitchen and dinning space and built showers. This would make it fit for an educational trip and a summer retreat vacation.

“The aim is to teach people how to acomplish these things because now everybody is living in the city and it’s very hard for them to learn these skills, these practical skills. /Using a chainsaw chopping some wood, maybe climbing on a ladder, everything. / What type of wood is a certain tree when you see it, how to use it in a bio-construction.”
                                               Lupse Andrei - designer and co-counder of Baza Ulmu
 
“I think it’s better to give Idea as soon as possible to the young people, Mr Clint - Tell you the truth. like this they are not contaminated with all they can see all the common things we can see in real life like a big big building and wood and bitumen. / So educate them, I think it’s always a question of education.
/ For all things, all that go bad, I think that education can change it.”

It was an amazing experience creating BAZA ULMU, but we are a small team and we can’t do everything on our own. That’s why we ask your help so we can improve the quality of our corses and to build all the facilities needed in order to bring more people in and to make sure that everyone takes home a wealth of information as well as an amazing experience!
  With 10.000 USD we can build a classroom with all the necessary equipment and accommodation for overnight stay for 24 people. 
The cost of the classroom + equipment is 4000 USD
The cost of accommodation huts is 1000 USD/hut x 6 can host 4 people/hut
With 15000USD we could finish the main house, build the classroom, huts and plant our entire food forest and make a new film.
With 20000USD we could have all of the above plus off the grid electricity and the ability to invest in a business that can generate our income so that we can become financially independent.  
 

 
 
What if you could learn to design natural integrated systems that produce healthy and abundant food indefinitely?
You could meet a lot of people who have the same mindset about ecology.
You could have some hands on experience and practice some skills which they could never do in a classic city classroom.
You could learn how to use some tools like different hand tools and start getting building start to get designing…
Finding solutions for building your home with natural materials and techniques can be difficult.
So is designing a food production system… It’s amazing how many people design and build their houses without considering their health, esthetics or ergonomics.
By choosing the right kind of materials and techniques and learning how to design these natural buildings you could not only save a lot of money but also have a farm where you feel in a holiday year round.
Here you could learn how to use different tools for building, gardening and designing that will help you develop and implement your own plan.

“We offer a variety of couses including whole system design, starfing your own farm, leisure center or building your own house with all the neccesary facilities.”
                                                                      Lupse Lucian - co-founder/media director
What I find really really great at Baza Ulmu is that they-re organising a lot of courses, summer courses, a lot of workshops. / This is quite amazing because this way you can reach a lot of people.
                                                                  Catalin Savin - FEAST Theatre, FEAST Fest  
 
“At our countryside we have another place and it went also as well, almost as well as here and it’s all perfect / We’re starting to grow mushrooms now, and it’s gonna be a promising year for us. / Permaculture should be the Future”

We carefully take every step of our way in order to provide you with two valuable films you can enjoy and get a lot of good information out of.
Film 1 - Baza Ulmu - the journey begins

This film is about our project, how it started up until this very moment. It includes specific information about our design and how everything is interconnected eg: the water from the roof is collected with no visible piping and goes passively into the garden which doesn't need any additional water year round. 
How we've built our permanent raised beds and how we manage them
Tools we use, food forest strategies
Real designs for real clients that we break down with you
Frequently asked questions and more
Film 2  - Bio-construction - how to

This picture represents ""wallpaper B""
This film, you guessed it, is about natural building. It includes specific information about earth friendly materials and how to design and build a lasting and beautiful house, but also annexes such as: root cellar, terrace, solar shower, rocket mass heaters, rocket stoves, living roofs and more.
Subjects followed in the film:  What is bio-construction? How to design from scratch or upgrade your home. What you want vs what you need. Maximising resources. Passive solar houses. Different building techniques and materials: Superadobe, cordwood, living roofs, cob, thatch, wood, rocket mass heaters, 
Discussions on designs we made for different clients and situations. Frequently asked questions and many more.
Andrei studied design and ecological architecture and is working with architects and engineers to provide projects for others. 
Lucian studied film making to make all this possible, video is a powerful educational tool and with your help we can make more content in the future.
We've put together a variety of perks to include everyone's possibilities, whether you're a fan or future eco-builder/permaculture designer there is something for everybody.
Ex. check out the T-shirts 
     If we don't reach our entire goal we will focus on building the classroom and perhaps one or two accommodation huts but it's going to take us a very long time without your help perhaps years. And the films have already entered the production stage so they will be done within our established time frame.


 
You can be a part of this journey by helping this campaign to reach it’s goal!  
What would you do to help bringing this kind of project to life?
Would you contribute with your donation to bring this kind of place one step closer to reality?
Where almost there it just needs an little extra help from the public who supports this kind of actions. It just needs a little more investment to bring this project to a whole new level.

This picture represents ""postcard B""
With your help, we can create an educational space which you and your friends, as well as thousands of other people will enjoy later on by attending our classes. Children need to take part in non formal education as well as ecological education as soon as possible. The outdoors and fresh air as well as healthy food combined with dynamic activities is a winning situation in which kids could learn about the importance of where their food comes from and how to play in an Earth safe environment.
Our project has already gained a lot of media attention and was featured in many newspapers, articles online and tv programmes:

We are always invited for talks in the country and abroad and are active members in the Romanian Permaculture Association. Starting February we will finish the necessary paperwork to create Baza Ulmu Association. 
Risks & Challenges
We will do our very best to finish our entire design of our education centre in a timely manner however it's pretty hard to find skilled workers that are able to stay for a couple of months (commuting is impractical every day because we are 20 km from the city in a mountaneous area). We do almost everything ourselves and are working around the clock sometimes 12 hrs a day rain or shine. Another issue is the films as they are not yet produced. We have about 90% of the video and audio we want to use and are working with a storyboard. However this is the first time we take on such a demanding challenge of completing two films in a matter of months in a 3 people team. Lucian spent around 500 euro only for ALL of the filming equipment including the post production software so cost isn't really an issue. Almost all our footage has been filmed and edited with this equipment.  We are very optimistic! 
We’ve  put together an amazing group of collaborators and partners
Hundreds of volunteers have helped and learned in this center in 5 years!
Now this is where you come in: we are so close of bringing BAZA ULMU SCHOOL to life but we need your support to help complete this project so we can share this knowledge to the world!

<p>For almost a decade, Anthony B. Rodriguez has been a thought leader in environmental activism and self-empowerment. His popular YouTube channel Revolutionofthought1 has showcased how he has made conscious changes to his life in an effort to live in harmony with the planet. He has learned to forage for wild food, grow his own food and learn about how other cultures live self-sufficiently. </p>
<p>In the course of living a more natural life, Anthony has traveled the globe taking photographs, producing hundreds of videos and making two feature films, including one about the Amazon jungle. He plans on making more inspirational films that celebrate environmental and social consciousness, but is lacking the requisite equipment.

<p>For the year of 2016 I have been writing and conceptualizing two new feature films, as well as drawing connections to how they are relevant to the issues of contemporary times. These films will bring me around the country &amp; the globe, as well as cover some major problems humanity is facing today, and delve into solutions! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Arnes Klisura. I have bachelor degree in Physics. I am big fan of non formal learning and all kind of online learning. I love MOOC's (massive on line courses provided on web sites like edx.org, coursera.org, alison.com, khanacademy.org and many others). I have found out that even if I pass 10 000 of those on line courses, there is no way to prove it because there is no platform that integrates all of them. I want to be able to prove my mastery of the subject and to get diploma for it which will be as valid as standard University diplomas.</p>
<p>Being that there are very few if any companies that can make qualitative and quantitive analysis of a person mastery at any subject, I decided to create my own, with your help. It will be our platform that will inspire millions and help them to get recognition as experts based on their mastery and it does not matter how did they achieve it.</p>
<p>More then anything else, this platform will integrate all kinds of learning. For example someone with bachelor degree in mathematics from some University will be able with small donation to get recognition in all the world for his mastery. </p>

<p> I’ve being admitted and received an opportunity to enter the AFI Conservatory despite the huge competition.

<p>Among AFI’s alumni are such directors as David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet), Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother!), Andrea Arnold (American Honey, Fish Tank, Big Little Lies), Patty Jenkins (Monster, Wonder Woman), Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life) and many others amazing storytellers.  <br/><br/>AFI Conservatory alumni have received total of 149 Academy Award nominations and won 30 prizes. <br/><br/>And now, I have a unique chance to become a part of that society.

Among AFI’s alumni are such directors as David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet), Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother!), Andrea Arnold (American Honey, Fish Tank, Big Little Lies), Patty Jenkins (Monster, Wonder Woman), Terrence Malick (Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life) and many others amazing storytellers.  AFI Conservatory alumni have received total of 149 Academy Award nominations and won 30 prizes. And now, I have a unique chance to become a part of that society. And I need your help to do that.WHY I CHOOSE AFI CONSERVATORY? 1.  To get keys to physical production2. To direct films under the supervision of working professionals.3. To collaborate with one of the most talented directing students from all over the world4. To navigate myself in global movie industry. 5. To become a powerful film director and tell unique stories. COST For the first year, I need $90. 000. 
($60.000 is the cost of the tuition for the first year.
Minus $10.000 of given scholarship, makes it $50.000. 
$40.000 will cover the rent, daily expenditures, medical insurance and supplies while my first year in L.A) Unfortunately, the program of AFI Conservatory is so intense that it is impossible for students to have part-time work. Moreover, student visa has a limited amount of working hours allowed, so it makes overtime work illegal. Cinema empowers people, it gives new meaning and ideas, reveals the depth of human condition and shows the versatility of this world. And I am sure that I can contribute to this world with my ideas. But I can do nothing without your help and support. Thank you!",3.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>No doubt, there is always a risk associated with any project. The current state of our app is a fully functioning private beta version. Due to intermittent changing nature of Cloud Infrastructures, we would like to make sure that all tools are updated to the latest version before production release. One of the major challenges we would likely face is in the area of translating our app to many languages (7+ languages). This will definitely depend on our stretch goal reached. We are already working on getting a competent service provider that could handle all translations just in time. However, we are absolutely sure of meeting the launch deadline. </p>

Same day PERK Fulfillment  One Stretch Goal Left, Two Already Reached! Language Chat allows you to easily learn 14-16 languages 10x faster  by chatting, listening & speaking with the power of Cloud AI Technologies. 
 Language learning shouldn't be difficult at all. Less than 10% of those who enrolled in a World Language could engage in conversation after they finished. 
 Some major problems of other tools 

Take Control



 
Language Chat combines the latest Cloud AI technologies from Microsoft Azure, Amazon, & Google Cloud to help you learn to speak languages from your first chat, without complexities. It’s the first user generated content language learning app built to super accelerate learning process with a higher retention.
Gain confidence by practicing with Cloud AI Speech Recognition and you’ll be amazed how fast and easy you would be speaking a new language.
 

  
Language Chat enables you to learn any language without forgetting. Learn from what you already know in your native language.
 

 

In three simple steps, you are in with fun. Absolutely the easiest way to learn a language with high retention.
 

 

 

 

Each user will get all available languages minus your native language, regardless of your reward. 


Language chat works with your First Language. First production release could support up to 7 First Languages with room for more in the future. The number of first languages will depend on our stretch goals reached.

 

This campaign has only three straightforward stretch goals to meet. Let's do it. We will definitely get there. Japanese, Korean, and Arabic are already in pipeline.

 


 

Your chats for a specific language can be saved  for offline access. This means that you can still access them without internet connection.

 
 Note that in order to use Cloud Speech Recognition from saved offline chats, internet is required.

Drill and test your pronunciations using cloud speech recognition for each chat message. It enables you to build your speaking confidence while chatting at the same time. 


 

 


Set your preferred nature native voices and automatically listen to natural native voice pronunciation of your chat and repeat along as many times as you want.  

 

Integrated neural bilingual dictionary is your friend!  Use bilingual dictionary available in each language you're on, to learn more synonyms and their natural native pronunciations.  

 

All your chats are automatically saved in the cloud for your future reference. You can also continue learning from where you stopped on each topic.  

 
 

Your personal word bank allows you to save words you wish not to forget from the neural bilingual dictionary. Each word comes with native audio pronunciation.  

 


Thanks for the enthusiasm. Back this project and  take advantage of our early bird lifetime subscription perk and save hugely; only available on Indiegogo Indemand.
Please note that lifetime subscription won't be offered once we launch. 

Language Chat project is ongoing even before the campaign and we will continue to work on it in order to deliver our promises on time.

<div>Hello, my name is Melissa Quinones of ShopStickyRice.com and my husband, Daniel Quinones of LoveRoboughty.com.  We have been together over 9 years and in those years we have developed our craft in fine art, graphic design, apparel and fashion design, photography, styling, cinematography, film making and more.    In the process of becoming established in the industry from working with Disney, Nike, DC Shoes, Metal Mulisha, Harley Davidson and many more we have incorporated our talents and businesses to help others in their art careers through internship programs, youtube interview shows, written interviews and creating brands that help other non-profits in the arts, education and human trafficking issues to become sustainable and grow.</div>
<div><b>This Campaign:</b></div>
<div>The campaign we have started here on Indiegogo,  God's Land: Phase One is an extension of who we are and what we feel our purpose is.  It is a 5 part project that will give an already established non-profit school of faith a fresh look, more hands-on experiences and environments, remodeling and expansion of their already pristine credentials of 18 years of student, parent and community success.  We fully believe in God's Rainbow Christian Academy and felt the urgency to make this diamond in the rough shine in only the 2nd week of our visit here. We knew this place simply needed quality marketing, re-branding, and a thorough facelift.    After we began creating their new website we knew the world really wouldn't see everything we've experienced here in the children's smiles, great attitudes and sense of intelligence these students exuded.  We knew we had to create a short 'about' video for their site that would give a glimpse into this community.  One month later we had 3 short films and a release party to show the families our appreciation, there wasn't a dry eye in the love filled room at the ranch that day.</div>
<div><b>The Magnitude of Your Help:</b></div>
<div>With your help to share or fund this project is immeasurable!  We've heard first hand from the parents and graduated students how this school saved their family relationships, gave wisdom on raising their kids and how to see their communities as family because they first respond to them as if they were their own.  Not only is the education top notch but the ability to have a property that can allow for hands on projects is priceless. This school already has proven its ability to raise stellar students with the little they have stewarded thus far, imagine being a part the expansion to allow more students to experience Gods Rainbow and improve the quality of the already existing students learning environment with your contribution.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<div>The land we are developing in totality is around 3 acres.  That is a lot of land we want to ensure each square foot is impactful in ever way possible.  As an old ranch  repairs are in order and those are all addressed through out our 5 phase plan.  Sure there are plenty of new child care programs and buildings popping up around God's Rainbow but none of them have the 18 year history, heart and vision that we do for Sugar Land like we do.  </div>
<div><b>The Perks:</b></div>
<div>When you give to this project you will be providing the children with a new butterfly garden, trails through a magical pine forest, an organic vegetable garden and a fruit and nut orchard.  You will also provide a parking lot that has been needed for parents to park and a driveway expansion for cars to pass each other safely.  Because the current sheds are decaying to environmental conditions a new shed will be erected to house the tools and supplies needed to maintain the land and provide the kids with the proper tools to do their projects.  We also plan to put in a new fence to keep the horses away from the new garden beds.  And last but not least to phase one, a new sign must be erected!  If you drove past this place you may not have known it existed and that is a shame! So we will be creating a new drive-thru sign that will be well lit and accommodate the new drive way expansion.  </div>
<div><b>Incomplete Funds Plan:</b></div>
<div>If we do not reach our goal we have prepared a priority list that would take care of the permits, contractors, utility vehicles and into materials to get the job started and sustainable for when we are capable for raising the full amounts needed.</div>
<div>
<b>What will you get? </b> </div>
<div>We are excited to give back a variety of perks to our donors.  Some of those included a DVD of the documentary we will be creating recording the progress of the land development and personal interviews with those who have attended the school, those who donate resources and those who volunteer their time to create this vision.  We will also have unique name plates made into the bricks, stones or wood that will be used in the structures of the park.  You can also anticipate a more unique perk like having a trail, park feature, or even a utility vehicle named after you or your family. At the finish of each phase, we will throw a release party on the developed land to commemorate each phase milestone which will also be one of the perks you can look forward to!</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div><b>Impacting Others:</b></div>
<div>This project will make a huge impact on the community of Sugar Land, Houston and the world by creating a place where relationships grow and thrive for the higher education and hands-on experience for the children.  Not only will the students be more engaged but there will be lasting life lessons infused in every moment we build together with a life long place dedicated to bringing people together.  Until now we have not seen a place that has a botanical garden, children park, wildlife studies, organic garden, and school all emerge into one place of tranquility for miles around, this is a unique opportunity to be a part of with people who truly care about community and healthy lifestyles.  </div>
<div><b>Our Track Record:</b></div>
<div>God's Rainbow Christian Academy's 18+ years in Houston combined with our 9+ years of bringing people together through education, creativity, working alongside skilled craftsmen and builders in Los Angeles we are confident we can bring this vision to life with your support. What makes this tangible to those who are not located Houston is our ongoing efforts to keep you updated via our social sites and videos and the positive results in the hearts we shared time with here on the ranch.  This project will last beyond our years and continue to keep giving back and shaping the future of generations to come!</div>

Hello, my name is Melissa Quinones of ShopStickyRice.com and my husband, Daniel Quinones of LoveRoboughty.com.  We have been together over 9 years and in those years we have developed our craft in fine art, graphic design, apparel and fashion design, photography, styling, cinematography, film making and more.    In the process of becoming established in the industry from working with Disney, Nike, DC Shoes, Metal Mulisha, Harley Davidson and many more we have incorporated our talents and businesses to help others in their art careers through internship programs, youtube interview shows, written interviews and creating brands that help other non-profits in the arts, education and human trafficking issues to become sustainable and grow.
This Campaign:
The campaign we have started here on Indiegogo,  God's Land: Phase One is an extension of who we are and what we feel our purpose is.  It is a 5 part project that will give an already established non-profit school of faith a fresh look, more hands-on experiences and environments, remodeling and expansion of their already pristine credentials of 18 years of student, parent and community success.  We fully believe in God's Rainbow Christian Academy and felt the urgency to make this diamond in the rough shine in only the 2nd week of our visit here. We knew this place simply needed quality marketing, re-branding, and a thorough facelift.    After we began creating their new website we knew the world really wouldn't see everything we've experienced here in the children's smiles, great attitudes and sense of intelligence these students exuded.  We knew we had to create a short 'about' video for their site that would give a glimpse into this community.  One month later we had 3 short films and a release party to show the families our appreciation, there wasn't a dry eye in the love filled room at the ranch that day.
The Magnitude of Your Help:
With your help to share or fund this project is immeasurable!  We've heard first hand from the parents and graduated students how this school saved their family relationships, gave wisdom on raising their kids and how to see their communities as family because they first respond to them as if they were their own.  Not only is the education top notch but the ability to have a property that can allow for hands on projects is priceless. This school already has proven its ability to raise stellar students with the little they have stewarded thus far, imagine being a part the expansion to allow more students to experience Gods Rainbow and improve the quality of the already existing students learning environment with your contribution.   What We Need & What You Get

<p><span>  She challenged Black Germans- particularly women- to  not

<p><span>  Audre

her insight to the struggle of Afro-Germans. She understood those

<p>their overall German and African experience. “You are not alone”, she said. </p>
<p><span>  She also encouraged the women to work together, to make themselves visible, to raise their voices...each in their very own way. </span></p>

“THE AFRO-GERMANS” 
OVERVIEW
  In

  She challenged Black Germans- particularly women- to  not

knew that most Afro-Germans were fractured and came from different parts

raised in different parts of Germany, which did not lend itself to organizing.
  Audre
 Lorde’s experience in both the Civil Rights and Women’s movement gave 
her insight to the struggle of Afro-Germans. She understood those

their overall German and African experience. “You are not alone”, she said. 
  She also encouraged the women to work together, to make themselves visible, to raise their voices...each in their very own way.

sister
 organization, ADEFRA. This in turn sparked the publication of

<p>I am an <b>archaeologist</b> and my research

<p>To achieve this goal<b> I need your help</b>!</p>

to carry out an <b>intensive archaeological
survey</b> in Iraqi Kurdistan. The main goals of this
project are :</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Three surveyors, including
me and a draughtsperson, will carry out the fieldwork.</p>
<p>The area around Gomel is of great interest because of
its central position in the Navkur Plain, in the hinterland of the ancient Assyrian
capitals of <b>Nineveh</b> and <b>Khorsabad</b>. This territory, with plenty of water and fertile
soils, was a trade route hub from prehistory onwards. In later periods the area was strategic for commercial routes, but also for military transit and
– in the case of the <b>Assyrian Empire</b> – for communications between the Turkish
Upper Tigris region, rich in resources, and the principal Assyrian cities.</p>
<p>My project aims to
investigate this crucial area, about which little is known, and you can help me to make it happen!</p>

<p></p>
<h4><b>MY STORY</b></h4>
<p>As a girl I always dreamt of being an archaeologist. I have a MA in<span> Near Eastern Archaeology and I have just finished a
two-year </span>postgraduate specialization course focusing on Near Eastern archaeology. I studied and worked hard to reach my objectives and now I am happy to
be enrolled in a PhD programme. <span>I have taken part in
several archaeological surveys and excavations in Italy and in the Near East.
In particular, I  have already worked in
Iraqi Kurdistan, an amazing land rich in history.</span></p>
<p>My research <span>has its origins in the wider ""<b><a href=""http://www.terradininive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Land of Nineveh Archaeological Project</a></b>’""(LoNAP) which has been conducted since 2012 by the
Italian Archaeological Mission in Assyria (IAMA) of the University of Udine. I have been a member of LoNAP since 2013 and I am proud to be part of such incredible
project. </span></p>
<p>Now I hope
to manage to carry out my own project in order to contribute to the
understanding of such an interesting region. Not only will this improve my
personal skills (and academic CV), but also it will also add to what is known about this area of Mesopotamia to which little attention has been paid for too many years .</p>
<p>My work will
also <b>help to protect and preserve the
archaeological heritage</b> of this land. This will be possible thanks to the creation of site distribution
maps for each chronological period: all the
information relating to the sites we identify (geographical coordinates, site preservation
condition, etc.) will be shared with the <b>Regional
Direct</b><b>orate</b><b> of Antiquities</b>, in order to facilitate the protection of these archaeological
sites.</p>

<h4><b>WHAT I NEED </b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>I need $ 9,000 to cover the following expenses:</p>

 return air tickets for me and for the
other members of the survey team (2 archaeology students and a draughtsperson)</p>

<h4><b>ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
THE POLITICAL SITUATION?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although Iraq is currently shaken by a terrible conflict, the region of
Iraqi Kurdistan has remained essentially free of clashes. During summer 2014
several archaeological missions worked in the region of Duhok
without encountering any particular problems or threats. I was in Dohuk in
January-March 2015 and the situation seemed quite stable. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, it is
possible to continue working safely in Kurdistan despite the critical political
situation which is affecting the region. Obviously, we will be in continual contact with the diplomatic authorities in the country in order to avoid any
kind of tension or danger. </p>
<p>In this moment of shadow for <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Iraq's</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> cultural heritage, I think that

<p><b>INTRODUZIONE</b></p>
<p>Mi
chiamo Francesca Simi e sono una dottoranda in Scienze dell’Antichità dell’Università
Ca’ Foscari di Venezia (Corso Interateneo Università di Udine, Trieste e

<p>Sono

sviluppo dell’insediamento umano in un’area specifica della Mesopotamia
settentrionale, l’<b>antica Assiria</b>.</p>
<p>Per realizzare
questo progetto <b>ho bisogno del vostro
aiuto</b>! </p>
<p>Questa estate, vorrei effettuare una ricognizione archeologica

<p>Gli obiettivi principali di questo progetto sono:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Tre ricognitori, me inclusa, e un disegnatore, svolgeranno
il lavoro sul campo.</p>
<p>L’area circostante Gomel è di
grande interesse archeologico a causa della sua posizione centrale nella Piana
di Navkur, nell’entroterra delle antiche capitali assire di <b>Ninive</b> e<b> Khorsabad</b>. Questo territorio, ricco di acqua e suoli fertili, ha
costituito un vero e proprio snodo commerciale dalla preistoria in poi. Nelle
epoche successive, l’area divenne strategica per le rotte commerciali e
militari che la percorrevano e – nel caso dell’Impero Assiro – per le vie di
comunicazione che mettevano in contatto le regioni dell’Alto Tigri turco con le

INTRODUCTION

My
name is Francesca Simi and I am enrolled as a PhD Student in the Ancient Heritage Studies Inter-University Programme of
the Ca' Foscari University of Venice and the Universities of Udine and Trieste.

I am an archaeologist and my research
project involves the investigation of human settlement in a specific area of Iraqi Kurdistan, in the heartland of ancient Assyria.
To achieve this goal I need your help!
This summer, I am planning
to carry out an intensive archaeological
survey in Iraqi Kurdistan. The main goals of this
project are :



a systematic exploration in the site area of Tell Gomel;


an
intensive survey of the surrounding micro-region; 


the study of the
archaeological material recovered. 


Three surveyors, including
me and a draughtsperson, will carry out the fieldwork.
The area around Gomel is of great interest because of
its central position in the Navkur Plain, in the hinterland of the ancient Assyrian
capitals of Nineveh and Khorsabad. This territory, with plenty of water and fertile
soils, was a trade route hub from prehistory onwards. In later periods the area was strategic for commercial routes, but also for military transit and
– in the case of the Assyrian Empire – for communications between the Turkish
Upper Tigris region, rich in resources, and the principal Assyrian cities.
My project aims to
investigate this crucial area, about which little is known, and you can help me to make it happen!









MY STORY
As a girl I always dreamt of being an archaeologist. I have a MA in Near Eastern Archaeology and I have just finished a
two-year postgraduate specialization course focusing on Near Eastern archaeology. I studied and worked hard to reach my objectives and now I am happy to
be enrolled in a PhD programme. I have taken part in
several archaeological surveys and excavations in Italy and in the Near East.
In particular, I  have already worked in
Iraqi Kurdistan, an amazing land rich in history.
My research has its origins in the wider ""Land of Nineveh Archaeological Project’""(LoNAP) which has been conducted since 2012 by the
Italian Archaeological Mission in Assyria (IAMA) of the University of Udine. I have been a member of LoNAP since 2013 and I am proud to be part of such incredible
project. 
Now I hope
to manage to carry out my own project in order to contribute to the
understanding of such an interesting region. Not only will this improve my
personal skills (and academic CV), but also it will also add to what is known about this area of Mesopotamia to which little attention has been paid for too many years .
My work will
also help to protect and preserve the
archaeological heritage of this land. This will be possible thanks to the creation of site distribution
maps for each chronological period: all the
information relating to the sites we identify (geographical coordinates, site preservation
condition, etc.) will be shared with the Regional
Directorate of Antiquities, in order to facilitate the protection of these archaeological
sites.





WHAT I NEED 

I need $ 9,000 to cover the following expenses:
- 
4
 return air tickets for me and for the
other members of the survey team (2 archaeology students and a draughtsperson)
TOT. 3200 $
- 
blood tests and residence permits for 4 persons 
TOT. 400 $
- 
two and a half months’ car rental with driver
TOT. 4.000 $
- 
Supplies
(archaeological survey tools, writing and drawing supplies, internet connection)
TOT. 1400 $
The Italian Archaeological Mission
in Assyria will provide practical assistance (e.g. accommodation and
meals for the first two-and-a-half months for the survey team), since the
present project is framed within the more extensive “Land of Nineveh Archaeological Project”.










WHAT YOU GET




5$ - I’ll give you a personal thank you on Facebook
and Twitter


15$ - I’ll
send you a hand-written thank-you postcard signed by all the members of the
project


25$ - You’ll
receive a thank you postcard and a pin with the project logo


50$ - You’ll receive a thank you postcard and a
cotton shopper with the project logo


100$ - You’ll receive the postcard, the pin
and the cotton shopper, plus during the fieldwork you will be updated weekly by
e-mail (photo, video and journal)


250$ - You’ll receive all the above perks,
plus you will be personally thanked in my PhD thesis and you’ll receive a digital
copy of it


500$ - You’ll
receive all the above perks, plus a hardcover copy of my PhD thesis


1000$ - If you are so kind to help me with
1000 $, I will talk with you on Skype every week to personally update you and
answer to your questions. I can also introduce you to the Director of the Land of
Nineveh Archaeological Project and all the team members whose work you are so
generously supporting









ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
THE POLITICAL SITUATION?

Although Iraq is currently shaken by a terrible conflict, the region of
Iraqi Kurdistan has remained essentially free of clashes. During summer 2014
several archaeological missions worked in the region of Duhok
without encountering any particular problems or threats. I was in Dohuk in
January-March 2015 and the situation seemed quite stable. 
Therefore, it is
possible to continue working safely in Kurdistan despite the critical political
situation which is affecting the region. Obviously, we will be in continual contact with the diplomatic authorities in the country in order to avoid any
kind of tension or danger. 
In this moment of shadow for Iraq's cultural heritage, I think that
a new project working in this amazing land will be a true light of hope.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

succeed!

Facebook, LinkedIn, by email, telephone or on your blog.

VERSIONE ITALIANA 


INTRODUZIONE
Mi
chiamo Francesca Simi e sono una dottoranda in Scienze dell’Antichità dell’Università
Ca’ Foscari di Venezia (Corso Interateneo Università di Udine, Trieste e
Venezia). 
Sono
un'archeologa e il mio progetto di ricerca si pone l’obiettivo di studiare lo
sviluppo dell’insediamento umano in un’area specifica della Mesopotamia
settentrionale, l’antica Assiria.
Per realizzare
questo progetto ho bisogno del vostro
aiuto! 
Questa estate, vorrei effettuare una ricognizione archeologica
intensiva nel Kurdistan iracheno. 
Gli obiettivi principali di questo progetto sono:



un’esplorazione sistematica nell’area del sito di Tell Gomel;


una ricognizione intensiva nella micro-regione circostante
il sito;


lo studio dei materiali archeologici raccolti.


Tre ricognitori, me inclusa, e un disegnatore, svolgeranno
il lavoro sul campo.
L’area circostante Gomel è di
grande interesse archeologico a causa della sua posizione centrale nella Piana
di Navkur, nell’entroterra delle antiche capitali assire di Ninive e Khorsabad. Questo territorio, ricco di acqua e suoli fertili, ha
costituito un vero e proprio snodo commerciale dalla preistoria in poi. Nelle
epoche successive, l’area divenne strategica per le rotte commerciali e
militari che la percorrevano e – nel caso dell’Impero Assiro – per le vie di
comunicazione che mettevano in contatto le regioni dell’Alto Tigri turco con le
principali città assire.
Per indagare quest’area così cruciale, ma ancora poco
conosciuta, vi chiedo di aiutarmi.


LA MIA STORIA
Ho sempre desiderato diventare
un’archeologa. Mi sono laureata in Archeologia e ho appena ottenuto un Diploma
di Specializzazione in Beni Archeologici. Il mio ramo di specializzazione è il
Vicino Oriente. 
Ho studiato e lavorato duramente
per raggiungere i miei obiettivi, ho partecipato a ricognizioni e scavi
archeologici in Italia e nel Vicino Oriente. In particolare, ho già lavorato
nel Kurdistan Iracheno, un paese incredibile, ricco di storia e tradizioni
millenarie.
La mia ricerca si inserisce nel
più ampio ""Progetto Archeologico Regionale Terra di Ninive"", condotto dal 2012
dalla Missione Archeologica Italiana in Assiria dell'Università degli Studi di
Udine. Sono un membro della missione dal 2013 e sono orgogliosa di far parte di
questo grande e ambizioso progetto.
Ora spero di portare avanti la
mia ricerca per dare il mio contributo alla comprensione di questa affascinante
regione. Infatti, la realizzazione di questo progetto non solo mi permetterà di
affinare le mie competenze personali, ma accrescerà anche le
conoscenze a nostra disposizione di questa area della Mesopotamia

Il mio lavoro aiuterà anche a proteggere e preservare il patrimonio

<p>It’s not that often you get to make a modest donation and know you are not only changing a single life, but perhaps an entire generation. </p>
<p>My name is Mary Daley Yerrick. I am a co-founder of Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women leaders throughout the world.  I am a social entrepreneur and a proud member of the Education &amp; Empowerment of Women &amp; Girls Campaign organized by Sandra Kasonso in the country of Zambia on the continent of Africa. </p>
<p>Sandra came into my life in 2007 when Vital Voices Global Partnership hosted an Africa Summit for Women's Leadership in Cape Town that brought together women from all over Africa. Attending were women who had a burning desire for positive change for women and girls, but needed a plan.  Education was at the core of their plan. Education could lead the way to economic empowerment. Nelson Mandela said “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” </p>
<p>Sandra embraced the theme of the Summit. She knew change needed to come for the poorest women and girls of Zambia. She had an idea. She knew that these women had very limited education and no financial resources, but they needed to break the cycle of poverty for the sake of their children. She wanted to help by teaching them a traditional Zambian skill that she could oversee and ultimately use to empower the women to improve the future for their family. It was “beading.” She would buy the raw materials, design the products and employ the women to bead the various products. Then, she would take them to market and sell them. </p>
<p>They didn’t make a lot of money, but it was enough to begin their transition. She found out that the most important reason they wanted to have money was so that their children could go to school which requires a fee and the purchase of uniforms and books. It was unaffordable for most poor mothers. The fee was $150 and Sandra had a goal of raising that much for each of the women and then take it forward from there. She was successful, thanks in part to an Artisan Entrepreneur training conducted by Vital Voices in various locations throughout Africa. I designed and participated in the training and ExxonMobil funded it.</p>
<p>It has been one of the most gratifying things I have ever done. And, now, I want to do more to help Sandra and the women and girls she is helping change their lives for good.  What follows is Sandra's story about her journey to educate and empower females in Zambia to achieve a much better future. </p>

</div></div>","Introduction

It’s not that often you get to make a modest donation and know you are not only changing a single life, but perhaps an entire generation. 
My name is Mary Daley Yerrick. I am a co-founder of Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women leaders throughout the world.  I am a social entrepreneur and a proud member of the Education & Empowerment of Women & Girls Campaign organized by Sandra Kasonso in the country of Zambia on the continent of Africa. 
Sandra came into my life in 2007 when Vital Voices Global Partnership hosted an Africa Summit for Women's Leadership in Cape Town that brought together women from all over Africa. Attending were women who had a burning desire for positive change for women and girls, but needed a plan.  Education was at the core of their plan. Education could lead the way to economic empowerment. Nelson Mandela said “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” 
Sandra embraced the theme of the Summit. She knew change needed to come for the poorest women and girls of Zambia. She had an idea. She knew that these women had very limited education and no financial resources, but they needed to break the cycle of poverty for the sake of their children. She wanted to help by teaching them a traditional Zambian skill that she could oversee and ultimately use to empower the women to improve the future for their family. It was “beading.” She would buy the raw materials, design the products and employ the women to bead the various products. Then, she would take them to market and sell them. 
They didn’t make a lot of money, but it was enough to begin their transition. She found out that the most important reason they wanted to have money was so that their children could go to school which requires a fee and the purchase of uniforms and books. It was unaffordable for most poor mothers. The fee was $150 and Sandra had a goal of raising that much for each of the women and then take it forward from there. She was successful, thanks in part to an Artisan Entrepreneur training conducted by Vital Voices in various locations throughout Africa. I designed and participated in the training and ExxonMobil funded it.
It has been one of the most gratifying things I have ever done. And, now, I want to do more to help Sandra and the women and girls she is helping change their lives for good.  What follows is Sandra's story about her journey to educate and empower females in Zambia to achieve a much better future. 
Why we exist!Magic Hands of Africa was created as a ""social business"" to help uplift the lives of women and girls living in poor communities in Zambia, Africa, through making and selling beaded crafts!  NOTE: A ""social business"" for those unfamiliar with the term is one created and designed to address a social problem, i.e. poverty, in a self-sustainable way with profits reinvested in the business itself.  In the past, our women “beaders"" lived on less than US$1 a day and struggled to pay the required fees to keep their children in school, feed their families, provide shelter and pay medical bills. Magic Hands of Africa began with a mission to supplement the income of single mothers and help them meet their critical needs. It began in 2007 after the founder, Sandra N. Kasonso, attended a Vital Voices Global Partnership Africa Summit, held in Cape Town, South Africa. After networking and being mentored by various women social entrepreneurs from other countries, she returned home fired up and inspired to turn her one-woman beading business into a social business that employed, or better yet, partnered with ten impoverished Zambian women, trained them in beading skills, bought and gave them the supplies to make the finished products, which she would ultimately sell to local and international customers. The group of ten women workers soon grew to forty! The products were beautiful, fashionable and high quality.  As a result, the income derived helped the women pay for school fees and provide food for their families. YAY!The challenge that led us here!In 2010, however, as the economy dipped, sales began to dwindle and Sandra was forced to cut costs. It was heartbreaking for her to turn away the women who had once relied on her, knowing she was not now able to help mother’s pay their children's school fees. But, her passion kept burning within her -- she wanted to help these mothers, and she refused to  give up. She sought ways to improve and sustain her business model and went through various business management trainings. Happily, she has has now reached a point where she feels more empowered with knowledge and a determination to succeed. Her only challenge now is a lack of start-up funds, and is hence turning to crowdfunding to seek your support to help her revive her new and better social business.  Why fund us?       Mailess Tembo with her grandmother. Mailess was educated using funds raised from sales of our beaded products. She completed high school recently and is the first in her family to do so!By helping to fund this program, you will help Sandra achieve her 2015 goal of educating 40 girls and empowering 10 women with US$150 grants to be invested in their alternative  small businesses, like selling produce by the side of the road, so that during slow sale periods at Magic Hands of Africa, the women will not be affected because they will be running their own successful small businesses. The ten women will be personally mentored by Sandra who will explore with them their interests in other income-generating pursuits in the informal job sector. Their progress will be documented and shared on Magic Hands of Africa social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WordPress and Pinterest). The women constantly tell Sandra how the beading business has helped their families. One woman, named Royce, said her teenage son once remarked ""Mum, what would have happened to me had you not been beading? Would I have completed my high school?""Help Sandra keep her dream alive by growing her new and improved beading business to help more women and girls have a brighter future.Note:  Donors may remain anonymous, if they prefer.  What you get for funding us!First, you will receive a big heartfelt thank you and then you will receive these beautiful handmade beaded lanyards made by our women! But that's not all, we have more perks in our gallery for you to choose from all handmade with love by our Zambian women!

The biggest challenge we'll face in our implementation plan is the Boko Haram crisis in the northern states in Nigeria and in order to bypass this, we hope to partner with television stations in the Nigeria who will broadcast our cartoons. More specifically, NTA (Nigeria Television Authority) being the television network with the widest reach in Nigeria.
   Risks & Challenge The risks we face on the company level is in the production process of our cartoons which is why we have a board of advisors for different backgrounds to complement our shortcomings and ensure we succeed.

<p>The Montessori School
of Waukesha (MSOW) is the oldest (founded 1964) and largest Montessori school
in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. The demand for an educational model preparing
children for a world where anything is possible has been heard loud and clear
by MSOW. Enrollment is nearing
capacity, but we want to
expand our campus to offer this education to more children. With the purchase of 2 adjacent properties in the
past three years, we have gone from a 3 acre to 9 acre campus! Additionally, we are creating a Montessori Training Center to certify new
Montessori teachers, as well as share the fundamentals of Montessori with
traditionally trained teachers. In 2013, MSOW launched a capital campaign titled: ”Montessori.
Education in Action.” Funds raised for these significant initiatives will
change the history of Montessori School of Waukesha and Montessori education in
Wisconsin. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Donations will be used to enhance and grow our program: new classroom
materials, and program expansion for science, art and music, all of which will
enhance each child’s experience and education. Additionally, donations will be used for
a dual purpose lecture hall/auditorium for the school and Montessori Training
Center. A performance stage, botanical garden, and a nature trail have
already been funded!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The capital campaign is designed to complete the goals of the

</span>With $75,000 we can begin to make changes to classrooms
(preparation for construction) and pay the professionals needed to create this
plan (architects, builders, engineers, etc…).</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our world is changing faster than ever before. We want the next
generation to be prepared to make the world an even better place. Just imagine
what could exist even bigger and better than Google or Amazon!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>If we don’t reach our entire goal here on Indiegogo, we will be
sad, but don’t worry as there are always places to use the money within the
classrooms for updates and new learning materials. There is great demand for a
Montessori training center, so we will expand our offerings in professional

This makes scaling a solution very costly and difficult. In several cases, a group of people may have to crowd around a single device such as a laptop which affects the learning experience.<br/><br/>In other cases, when children have an individual laptop or computer, the classroom interactions are disrupted. The best approach would be to have a single device, which can create a large image, and many children can use and benefit from at the same time, and also interact with the teacher and their peers, rather than just focusing on a single device.<br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Empowering people with the tools to solve local and global problems. 
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We believe many health issues can be solved by first addressing basic education needs. We're talking about issues like malnutrition,
diarrhea and leprosy. By giving people the tools they need to be part of the solution, we'll tackle these global issues collectively. The Santara Computer will help provide children have the tools they needs to create a healthy
home, family and life.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">The Santara Computer: Built-in Projector + Solar Charging + Built-in Library + Educational Software</h4>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>The Santara Computer's built-in projector really sets it apart from other computers. Another key things that distinguishes the Santara Computer from other devices is its incredible flexibility. It can display images using the projector, a television, or a HDMI monitor, it can be powered multiple ways, it's multi-lingual, and it also has multiple ways of connecting to the Internet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419030/files/20150427104502-crowdfunding-tech-features.jpg?1430156702"" src="""" style=""width: 400.0147874306839px; height: 381px;""/>  </p>The software on the Santara consists of a Linux based operating system (which we've called the Santara OS and which will be open source), which we've customized with a lot of additional services and resources, such as offline translation of basic words and phrases into Hindi, Tamil, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, and other languages. An interesting feature of the Santara Computer is the ""printing press."" With the printing press, users can print from somewhere in rural India, Kenya, or another country by simply selecting a document to print, picking a printer in Cambridge UK (or somewhere else). The document will be transmitted over the Internet, printed in the UK, and then mailed back to the person who sent it for printing. While the Santara Foundation will initially pay for the shipping costs, we hope to eventually get financial support to make this feature widespread. <div><br/></div>
<div>In addition to translation features, the printing press, and operating system tweaks to work with the Santara Computer hardware, there are several other features (illustrated below) which enhance the learning experience. We eventually hope to have an app store where teachers can develop their own content and distribute it online for free, in addition to developing programs using the EduCell programming language.</div>
<div>

<p>The Santara Computer was originally developed by Andrew Deonarine, a medical resident in Public Health and Preventative Medicine at the University of British Columbia, and who completed a PhD recently from the University of Cambridge in computational and theoretical biology. During his residency training, Andrew thought that many international and local health issues could be addressed by first addressing basic education, in particular literacy. This lead to the development of EduCell, an educational authoring / programming system that runs on inexpensive cellular phones such as Nokia's S40 platform. EduCell won the Economist Magazine - Innocentive Prize in 2010 which consisted of $10,000. This eventually lead to Andrew becoming a fellow at the Royal Institution of the United Kingdom, where he worked with Royal Institution fellows to develop innovative educational software and technology.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To ensure the success of the Santara Computer, we have spent thousands of pounds producing prototypes, designing hardware and software, and making sure the whole system works well together. We are now entering limited-series production (LSP) models for field testing, particularly in Kenya and India. The prototypes that have been developed so far are illustrated below:</span><br/></p>

<p>While the Raspberry Pi is a well established platform, our inexpensive projector has brought a vital innovation to the Raspberry Pi community. While previously to work with Raspberry Pis users had to have a television or a monitor, which can often be quite expensive and consume a lot of power, they can now use a mini projector to get a bright image wherever they are. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419710/files/20150427133656-crowdfunding-project.jpg?1430167016"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The projector built into the Santara Computer is capable of producing an image with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The image can reach up to 50 inches (diagonal) in size, and is visible in dim / evening light. Of course, a vivid image can be seen in a dark room. In the top left image, the Santara software can be used to display an interesting ""transparent"" or ""floating"" image which can be very captivating and engaging for children and learners. Additionally, content from </span>large international organisations can easily be imported, adapted, and used in the Santara computer. <br/></p>

And you can be part of it.</h4>
<p style="""">Several proofs of concepts and prototypes have been built, and we are in the process of field-testing our Mark 3 prototype. But
there’s a lot that will go into taking it from prototype to production. And it is going to cost $1 million.</p>
<p style=""""></p>

<br/>
<p style="""">This is obviously an ambitious goal, and the reason why we need $1 million is for the following reasons:</p>
<p style="""">1. We have a lot of collaborators ready to go, but many of them are small and do not have funding: even though the Santara is inexpensive, it's hard to ask a school in a rural, poor village to pay for it. As a result, we are hoping to raise enough funds to get the Santara into as many schools as possible, 1000 at the least.</p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1419884/files/20150427143243-crowdfunding-country.jpg?1430170363"" src="""" style=""width: 415.6296296296296px; height: 181px;""/></p>Right now we have extensive interest in both India and Kenya which we're hoping to capitalise on in the coming weeks an months, but we can only do so with the help of you the donor!</div>
<div style="""">
<br/><p style="""">2. In order to keep the unit cost down, we need to purchase large amounts of items: certain supplies, like cameras, storage devices, etc. need to be purchased in batches of 1000 or more in order to get a competitive price for each computer, and keep it under $100. </p>
<p style="""">3. Significant funds are needed for research and development, both on hardware and also on educational theory: while this technology will seek to augment the classroom, or in some cases, replace the classroom all together, we hope to not only fund the development of new, inexpensive, and innovative technology but also fund research papers into new education techniques and approaches we hope to develop with academics down the road.</p>
<p style=""""><span style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">4. Software development and translation: while we are developing an extensive set of software, and also integrating a lot of existing software, books, and information from </span>existing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sources, often these resources are only available in English. As a result, we're developing a comprehensive translation framework, as well as doing manual translation of a lot of resources. This is very cost-intensive and labour-intensive.</span></span></p>
<p style=""""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">Based on our budget, $1 million
will help us with costs associated for software development, logistics,
manufacturing and distribution. Some of the dollars raised will go to
administration, allowing us to have the right team spearheading this important
work. We'll also be setting up offices in three countries and hiring people to train teachers.</span></p>

<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Santara Computer was conceived of and developed by Andrew Deonarine, a medical doctor, who came up with the idea after researching international health. It grew out of work Andrew did on a previous platform called EduCell, which won the Economist Magazine - Innocentive prize in 2010 for Education. We believe that there is significant potential for the Santara Computer to revolutionise health and education, an opinion shared by others as well:</p>

We developed a built-in mini-projector which can project a large image in dim lighting large enough for groups of 15-20 children to see. Combined with health education resources, revolutionary new software which teaches children to read in record time, a built-in library and much more, the Santara Computer has the potential to revolutionize global health and education.
Disease, malnutrition, premature death, and related health issues affect millions of people around the world. In many cases, the solution to these problems is empowerment through education: accessing maternal clinics can reduce death during pregnancy, oral rehydration solution can help address dehydration, simple medications can stop leprosy, etc. If it were just possible for people to obtain and understand health information, then they would have the tools they need to address not only their own issues, but the issues of their communities as well. In order to address health issues, often general education issues like literacy must first be tackled. 

Several projects have sought to bridge the health issue / education gap using devices such as tablets, desktop computers, and laptops. However, these suffer from limitations which make them difficult to implement and unsustainable in some cases.

Tablets, laptops, and desktop computers suffer from a key limitation: in most cases one device works with one student. This makes scaling a solution very costly and difficult. In several cases, a group of people may have to crowd around a single device such as a laptop which affects the learning experience.In other cases, when children have an individual laptop or computer, the classroom interactions are disrupted. The best approach would be to have a single device, which can create a large image, and many children can use and benefit from at the same time, and also interact with the teacher and their peers, rather than just focusing on a single device.

By incorporating a single, large projected display the Santara Computer can address this issue. Instead of having to spend money on several individual devices like computers and tablets, classroom interactions are maintained since all children can work from a single display. As well, only one device is required to teach many children.

Empowering people with the tools to solve local and global problems. 

We believe many health issues can be solved by first addressing basic education needs. We're talking about issues like malnutrition,
diarrhea and leprosy. By giving people the tools they need to be part of the solution, we'll tackle these global issues collectively. The Santara Computer will help provide children have the tools they needs to create a healthy
home, family and life.


The Santara Computer: Built-in Projector + Solar Charging + Built-in Library + Educational Software

The Santara Computer's built-in projector really sets it apart from other computers. Another key things that distinguishes the Santara Computer from other devices is its incredible flexibility. It can display images using the projector, a television, or a HDMI monitor, it can be powered multiple ways, it's multi-lingual, and it also has multiple ways of connecting to the Internet.

    The software on the Santara consists of a Linux based operating system (which we've called the Santara OS and which will be open source), which we've customized with a lot of additional services and resources, such as offline translation of basic words and phrases into Hindi, Tamil, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, and other languages. An interesting feature of the Santara Computer is the ""printing press."" With the printing press, users can print from somewhere in rural India, Kenya, or another country by simply selecting a document to print, picking a printer in Cambridge UK (or somewhere else). The document will be transmitted over the Internet, printed in the UK, and then mailed back to the person who sent it for printing. While the Santara Foundation will initially pay for the shipping costs, we hope to eventually get financial support to make this feature widespread. 
In addition to translation features, the printing press, and operating system tweaks to work with the Santara Computer hardware, there are several other features (illustrated below) which enhance the learning experience. We eventually hope to have an app store where teachers can develop their own content and distribute it online for free, in addition to developing programs using the EduCell programming language.




The Santara Computer was originally developed by Andrew Deonarine, a medical resident in Public Health and Preventative Medicine at the University of British Columbia, and who completed a PhD recently from the University of Cambridge in computational and theoretical biology. During his residency training, Andrew thought that many international and local health issues could be addressed by first addressing basic education, in particular literacy. This lead to the development of EduCell, an educational authoring / programming system that runs on inexpensive cellular phones such as Nokia's S40 platform. EduCell won the Economist Magazine - Innocentive Prize in 2010 which consisted of $10,000. This eventually lead to Andrew becoming a fellow at the Royal Institution of the United Kingdom, where he worked with Royal Institution fellows to develop innovative educational software and technology.





To ensure the success of the Santara Computer, we have spent thousands of pounds producing prototypes, designing hardware and software, and making sure the whole system works well together. We are now entering limited-series production (LSP) models for field testing, particularly in Kenya and India. The prototypes that have been developed so far are illustrated below:


While the Raspberry Pi is a well established platform, our inexpensive projector has brought a vital innovation to the Raspberry Pi community. While previously to work with Raspberry Pis users had to have a television or a monitor, which can often be quite expensive and consume a lot of power, they can now use a mini projector to get a bright image wherever they are. 


The projector built into the Santara Computer is capable of producing an image with a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The image can reach up to 50 inches (diagonal) in size, and is visible in dim / evening light. Of course, a vivid image can be seen in a dark room. In the top left image, the Santara software can be used to display an interesting ""transparent"" or ""floating"" image which can be very captivating and engaging for children and learners. Additionally, content from large international organisations can easily be imported, adapted, and used in the Santara computer. 


Revolutionary poverty reduction.
And you can be part of it.
Several proofs of concepts and prototypes have been built, and we are in the process of field-testing our Mark 3 prototype. But
there’s a lot that will go into taking it from prototype to production. And it is going to cost $1 million.




This is obviously an ambitious goal, and the reason why we need $1 million is for the following reasons:
1. We have a lot of collaborators ready to go, but many of them are small and do not have funding: even though the Santara is inexpensive, it's hard to ask a school in a rural, poor village to pay for it. As a result, we are hoping to raise enough funds to get the Santara into as many schools as possible, 1000 at the least.

Right now we have extensive interest in both India and Kenya which we're hoping to capitalise on in the coming weeks an months, but we can only do so with the help of you the donor!

2. In order to keep the unit cost down, we need to purchase large amounts of items: certain supplies, like cameras, storage devices, etc. need to be purchased in batches of 1000 or more in order to get a competitive price for each computer, and keep it under $100. 
3. Significant funds are needed for research and development, both on hardware and also on educational theory: while this technology will seek to augment the classroom, or in some cases, replace the classroom all together, we hope to not only fund the development of new, inexpensive, and innovative technology but also fund research papers into new education techniques and approaches we hope to develop with academics down the road.
4. Software development and translation: while we are developing an extensive set of software, and also integrating a lot of existing software, books, and information from existing sources, often these resources are only available in English. As a result, we're developing a comprehensive translation framework, as well as doing manual translation of a lot of resources. This is very cost-intensive and labour-intensive.
Based on our budget, $1 million
will help us with costs associated for software development, logistics,
manufacturing and distribution. Some of the dollars raised will go to
administration, allowing us to have the right team spearheading this important
work. We'll also be setting up offices in three countries and hiring people to train teachers.




By reaching our campaign goal, the
Santara Foundation will aim to distribute 1000 computers in three countries. Based on a classroom of 15
people, 1000 computers can educate as many as 15,000 students at
any given time!
The final cost of the Santara Computer will be $100.


How we’ll thank you for donating
We
know you’re interested in Santara because you want to be part of big change more than getting swag or gadgets in return for your donation. We've put together a few ways we'll show our appreciation for your support (without spending too much of your precious donations on it!)





We’re not the only ones who have good stuff to say about the Santara
Computer!

The Santara Computer was conceived of and developed by Andrew Deonarine, a medical doctor, who came up with the idea after researching international health. It grew out of work Andrew did on a previous platform called EduCell, which won the Economist Magazine - Innocentive prize in 2010 for Education. We believe that there is significant potential for the Santara Computer to revolutionise health and education, an opinion shared by others as well:


“The Santara Computer is a
sustainable answer to the challenges of computer technology in settings like
Awegys School’s where there’s no electricity,” Gretchen Seibert, Director, Mtaala Foundation, Uganda



“Santara's technology
has the potential to work with organizations around the world in order to
better serve their respective communities,” Susie Marks, Executive Director, Hamomi Children’s Centre




To launch the Santara Computer, we recently had an opening gala on April 9th, 2015 at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. Over 100 people attended the function, and it was a great success! Some photos of the gala presented below. Visitors got to see the Mark 2 in action, and also talk with its inventor Andrew Deonarine, as well as others such as the project lead, lead hardware / software developers, and volunteers.

My years of work have brought me international recognition as an expert on the transforming psychological effects of trauma in disaster victims.  This has allowed us to travel to over 45 countries, to bring healing, empowerment, and transformation to those who have suffered the devastation of disaster, whether human-made or natural.Our GoalsWe need $6,000 USD, to bring healing workshops to the surviving communities in three countries -- Palestine, Israel and Jordan.  We will also train the professionals, ministers and teachers, and camp staff who are traumatized as well. Imagine being displaced for 60 years. Imagine not having a livelihood, employment, food, and electricity for over four years. This is what is motivating us to leave the comfort of our homes and go to the Middle East and make a difference in the surviving communities. Over 200,000 people have been killed. Over 8 million people have been displaced to four different countries, and there is no hope of the conflict ending in peace. We are going to the Middle East to empower the survivors, to help them release their grief, trauma and suffering, to give them tools for healing through workshops, empathy, dialogue, conflict transformation, as well as conducting research to share with the scientific and diplomatic communities around the world.[*Contributions for non profits can only be made using credit or debit cards.]Example of ATOP's Work 1: Mission to Sierra Leone (Part 1 of 3).Humanitarian Mission to the Middle East: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh1-juQNbEI&feature=youtube_gdataPerksWe have some wonderful symbolic but meaningful gifts to show our appreciation, such as a Ancestral Meditation CD, books on healing, live energy balancing and yoga sessions, and even a live presentation at your venue, by our 2015 team.How We Will Use Your DonationYour donations will be used to enable an ATOP Meaningfulworld humanitarian outreach team to travel in May 2015.  Whatever we are able to raise, will be solely dedicated to this Empowerment Humanitarian Mission. If we do not reach our goals, we may assist smaller number of people. Example of ATOP's Work 2: Symposium at United Nations International on Woman's DayThe ValueThe humanitarian outreach missions by Meaningfulworld are invaluable to our world community. Unfortunately, tragedy can strike anywhere. It is our goal to educate, heal and empower people with compassion; to endure, to love themselves, respect each other and to live with meaning and peace. By teaching professionals, students, NGOs (non-government organizations) and field workers in each of these countries how to handle the effects of disaster, we are helping them to help themselves. Then, even after we leave, our teachings can be utilized to continue helping those in need.  For over 25 years ATOP Meaningfulworld has worked in over 45 countries around the world, bringing healing in the most traumatized parts of the world such as Sierra Leone, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, DR Congo, Haiti, Romania, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and many states in America (after hurricanes, earthquakes, 9/11, as well as Gulf and Iraq war Veterans). Example of ATOP's Work 3: Mission To HaitiSpread the word!Thank you for taking the time to learn about our campaign.  Please let others know about us by using word of mouth, email, or the IndieGoGo share tools on this site.By spreading the word about our fundraiser you will help us achieve our goals.

The Dididai ward was dedicated to children with disabilities who are now without the general necessities and specialized supplies needed for their survival. After the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal on the 25th of April the death toll at the time of writing is at 3,000 and those known to be injured at least double that figure. The orphanage now lies in ruins and what remains is unsafe for the children to stay in.   Luckily the children were not in the building at the time of the earthquake but they are currently sleeping outside in the cold without the  shelter or supplies necessary for their continued safety and well-being. Many of the children have disabilities and as such they are particularly vulnerable to disease and sickness. These children are in desperate need of support in the form of emergency aid.  


   What We Need  The children are currently safe, but sleeping outside in cold and wet conditions without water, and food is scarce. Tremors continue to rock the country, which undoubtedly is terrifying for all the people of Nepal. There is also the threat of disease as time goes on and many of the children are particularly vulnerable to this. Even though we set the goal at £1500, every tiny bit helps and no donations will go to waste as we need to purchase essential supplies such as  clean water food medicine 



Until we reach them we can not be sure what other essential equipment will need to be purchased but we will be updating on what money is spent on. Please donate what you can.

</div></div>","TinkerTainers are MakerSpaces, created specifically for children with a keen interest in the principles of STEAM-based education. Set up in reclaimed shipping containers, these spaces are portable, low-cost structures that can be easily erected just about anywhere, making them the perfect solution when addressing the infrastructural problems plaguing education in South Africa.The dream is create stand-alone makerspaces for Africa's kids who show real talent in the fields of scitech, robotics and electronics and a passionate desire to learn. The space, equipped with all the latest tech, will encourage children to move beyond the injustices of history and look to a future that holds promise of real change.The biggest project at TinkerTainer Cape Town will be the search for 8-10 truly talented young adults to be a part of the first group of students experiencing the TinkerTainer's after-school programmes, designed to equip kids with the skills necessary to take an idea and turn it into a reality that can change their personal situations and empower and enrich the lives of the communities they live in and ultimately, the world at large. TinkerTainer will encourage learning through play and support the creative and exploratory journeys of children discovering Sci-Tech, from concept to completion.On the 15th June 2015 (yes, that’s just 1 week away!!!) and in celebration of Youth Day, the #TinkerTainer team is embarking on a journey to create awareness and share knowledge with the South African public about the  #MakerMovement  and  #STEAM education.We are working on securing sponsorships and support in the areas of: travel (transport* and accommodation**),  #MakerMaterial,  #MakerSpaces  and hardware (robotics kits, parts for self-assembled 3D printers and filament, circuit boards, laptops/tablets, books and any #STEAM material possible).  This project means so much to me that my partner and I have decided, regardless of what happens with support from the public and/or private sectors in South Africa, we will take to the road anyway, accompanied by our 2 Siberian Husky siblings and our (at best) temperamental mobile internet connection.We will visit schools and communities around the country, using any means of transport necessary to create widespread awareness of this project, why we are doing it and the benefits for every community that is blessed with a #TinkerTainer.The challenge is on now to get the #TinkerTainer idea funded and we are ready to shout it from the rooftops!*a vehicle, including petrol or a shuttle service or cab that is prepared to take us with the huskies**anything pet friendly, even a caravan in the yard!CURRENT ISSUES IN EDUCATION IN SOUTH AFRICA

</div></div>","Help Provide Computers to Needy Students and Schools in Costa Rica
Most of us take for
granted how much computers have improved how we live our lives.  For others, they have not gotten the
chance.  We would like to change
that.  How would you feel if you knew
that you could easily change the lives of the less fortunate and help provide
them without access to computer technology? 
We already know, it feels great!


Our newest program is
already underway.  We at Global Digital
Divide, Inc have already collected 6 desktop computers, 2 laptops, 1 monitor
and 1 printer.  That's just a small
amount of what we need to provide to meet your goal and not leave any
disappointed students and schools.  We need your help in securing $10,000 in
donations over the next 30 days to fully fund this newest program.  With your generous donations we will acquire more
new and used desktop computers, laptops and tablets, prepare them to be used
right away and transport them to already qualified Costa Rican students and
schools.





We Give More Than Just Computers
Your donation goes
towards more than just providing computers. 
We prepare each donated device so that recipients can get the most out
of them.  Each donated device comes with:

Start page set to the world renown Khan Academy.  The Khan
     Academy is a 'completely free to the user' non-profit educational website
     that provides instructional videos and practice exercises primarily in the
     area of K-12 math, science, computer programming, history, art history,
     economics, English language and more.
Pre-installed typing software so students can easily
     and quickly learn how to type. 
     Knowing this skill early will make using the computer much more
     efficient.
Already set up free email and chat programs
Pre-installed Skype, Microsoft Office including Word,
     Excel, PowerPoint and more
And more coming, we're always searching for more
     beneficial software and services we can put on every donated device.  Each successfully executed campaign
     brings valuable feedback on how we can increase the effectiveness of our
     donated computer technology


Who We Are: Global Digital Divide, Inc




Global Digital Divide, Inc is a registered 501(c)(3) charity so you can feel secure knowing
     that all funds go towards legitimate non-profit activities and that your
     generous support is fully
     tax-deductible. 

It was officially started after seeing how difficult it
     was to acquire such technology and initially bringing a few smart phones
     and laptops to Costa Rica. After seeing the profound impact it had on the
     recipients, the idea of Global Digital Divide, Inc was formed.

The husband and
     wife team decided they could start Global Digital Divide, Inc and help
     bring excess computer technology from the USA and elsewhere to Costa Rica
     but on a much larger scale.

Now that Global Digital Divide, Inc is now a fully
     registered 501(c)(3) public charity, we can expand and reach more students
     and schools than we could possibly imagine before
But this is only possible with the generous support from
     you!


Our Campaign and How You Can Get Involved

We need to secure at least $10,000 over the next 30
     days to fully fund our newest campaign and fulfill our obligations towards
     the already qualified recipient students and schools.
You can get more personally involved with us and the recipients
     with our perks!

If we reach our goal and go beyond it, we can acquire more computers, laptops and tablets and give to more students and schools.  There are so many students and schools who could benefit.

If we don't reach
     our goal, we will still provide technology to as many qualified students
     and schools as we can.  



The Ball Is Rolling But We Need Much More




We have already collected this equipment
above but it's just a fraction of what we need to meet our obligations.  We have already qualified many students and
schools who have demonstrated a need for such computer technology and a
capability to use it.  Our goal is to
provide either a desktop computer, laptop or tablet to all already qualified
students, schools and classrooms.  If
we go over our goal of $10,000 over the next 30 days, we can qualify more
students and schools to receive donated technology and provide more types of
devices to more students in existing schools and classrooms.


Help Us Get These Capable Students Access to Computers





Imagine the Possibilities

to a donated Global Digital Divide computer (made possible from your generous
support) and makes contacts with specialty coffee buyers in the USA.  By selling their coffee directly to eager

 There are many things we need to do to be successful:

Diversity's main activities are workshops and lectures, film and movie screenings, weekly ""Safe Space"" support group meetings, and research and consulting.
We also contribute to the LGBTQIA people beyond University settings. In June 2015, we organized the Ningbo LGBTQ Students Summit in order to provide training and capacity building to future LGBTQIA student leaders. In July 2015 we organized a Professional Mixer as an opportunity for LGBTQIA people to meet and learn more about how to navigate their workplace.

   Financial Situation 
Unfortunately, until this point, we haven't gotten any financial support. Therefore, all the multiple activities we do are mainly self-funded. Last semester, we sold buttons and t-shirts to fundraise, but as we grow we realize that there is a lot to be done, and we cannot cover all the costs associated with providing the support our peers need.
The amount we are trying to gather was calculated based on some expenses we believe we will have throughout the whole year. We will post updates of activities we organize both here as well as on our Facebook page (Diversity-LGBT-Ningbo).
All the funds will go towards supporting sexual and gender diversity in China, especially through the following: providing educational and awareness sessions, capacity building workshops, mentoring and peer counseling programs, support groups, film screenings, and research.

    Main Challenges  Advocacy and raising awareness for sexual and gender diversity is becoming more and more difficult in China. Public opinion in the country regarding “non-traditional” sexual orientations and gender identities remains predominantly negative. In most cases, educational institutions lack the basic knowledge around sexual and gender diversity. For this reason, the difficulties are greater than in many other parts of the world. We will utilize a Sino-Foreign University as a safe space from where to expand our range of action.

<p>I have worked independently in the area of leadership development for 23 years and as an associate with London Business School. I also run a small charitable trust called Small Acts of Kindness. Our aim is to support the education of children and young people in areas effected by extreme poverty or conflict. For the last 5 years we have been working with Tamil communities in Sri Lanka then, this year, I made contact with Dhruba, who helps run RUWON Nepal, an organisation working to empower women in the rural communities in Nepal. I booked my flights to go and visit his small orphanage - another of his projects - and see his work among the women and children in the rural villages around Kathmandu. Then the earthquake hit.</p>
<p>I saw the damage and heard the stories. Then, I heard that the small orphanage where I was staying was also in danger. The single donor was stopping her funding and these children would soon be ‘re-allocated’ - that means some of them will spend the rest of their childhood, perhaps longer in ‘domestic service’. We have managed to keep it open for a month or two but the money is nearly gone. </p>
<p>Why is this important to me? I just can’t imagine what these children have already endured in their short lives. They come from the villages in rural areas, the poorest of the poor - and then they lose their families. Then the earthquake, and now, they will lose their new mother and their new home. I have to help in some small way.</p>
<p>I hardly need to tell you the impact that your donations will have on these children. Keeping the home open will give them a totally different life; security’ love and opportunity rather than yet more suffering and possible abuse.</p>
<p>More than that; we will use these funds to develop the facilities and capacity of the home to help other children within Nepal and this local community. We are already working on a project with two local girls’ schools and we are planning a visit in February with a group of sports coaches, facilitators and teachers. The home can become a centre for volunteers to come and help these children and others like them. </p>
<p>The home currently costs $30,000 a year to run - a large portion of that is the rent. I have set the target at $60,000 so that we can secure the home for the immediate future.  The long term goal is to purchase or build a property but this will be another project. </p>
<p>The funds will be sent directly to RUWON Nepal Star Orphanage. There is no intermediary and I will be helping, through Small Acts of Kindness, to manage the funds and how they are used. The funds will be used for rent, food, clothing for the children, improving the facilities and providing the care staff. All the funds  will be used in this way regardless of how much we raise.  </p>
<p><b>What can we offer you for you generosity? </b></p>
<p>For donations of $25 - You will have to forgive the broken English but you will receive a letter and photograph from the children to thank you for your donation (first 100)</p>
<p>For donations of $100 - You will receive a cap with the Small Acts of Kindness name and logo (first 50).</p>

PUREST Academy for Kids, Inc was established in February 2014 with a mission to promote overall educational growth and development for children age 6 weeks to 6 years of age, by providing quality childcare at affordable prices. Early childhood education is vital in a child's overall growth and development.  Children need a quality program that gives them the tools they need to have a successful transition into Kindergarten. Our program focuses on providing families with a program fulfilling their complete educational needs regardless of their financial situation.</p>
<p>Opening a Child Care Facility requires a series of steps. We must first find a location. Next, we must receive approval from the City in which the facility is located, allowing use of that facility as a child care center. We then must submit the licensing application to the State of California Child Care Licensing Division. We have completed every one of these steps! We are well on our way to being licensed. However, during our Fire Inspection we were made aware that the current Fire Alarm System in the facility needs to be upgraded. This was an unexpected hurdle that we must cross in order to become a licensed facility. </p>
<p>Our goals are clear, we want to bring a much needed service to families in our community. This journey has been a long yet rewarding one and we can truly see the light at the end of the tunnel. Help us complete this vision.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What you Get<br/>
</h3> <p>The cost to put in the required fire alarm system is $8,000. As donors, you will receive a few perks for your generosity! For contributors that donate $25, we will display a public ""Thank You"" on our official website. For contributors that donate $100 or more, we will display their names in our Preschool. For donors that donate $1000 or more, we will display their name or company logo on the red carpet backdrop of our Grand Opening. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our Infant and Toddler program not only offers families an opportunity to rejoin the workforce, but the program is also beneficial to the childcare providers employed here. These childcare providers have an opportunity to increase their monthly income and obtain benefits such as affordable health insurance, life insurance, and retirement plans.</p>
<p>Low to Moderate income  families will benefit greatly from our program. Low to Moderate income families have a hard time finding high quality childcare/Preschool services for their children that they can actually afford.<br/>Our goal is to provide that service for these families, so their children are given equal opportunities and tools to have a successful transition into Kindergarten. Early childhood education has a substantial impact on the success of a child once they reach school-age years. Our program will provide the appropriate foundation that will aid in the children having a smooth and successful transition from Preschool to Kindergarten. If we empower our youth, we empower the future. Families need more than a ""babysitting"" service. At PUREST Academy we understand that the possibilities for what children can learn is limitless. When children leave our program they will have developed a LOVE FOR LEARNING. This is one of the strongest foundations for a child. This foundation can ensure that no matter what comes their way, they will be excited to continue their learning experience.<br/></p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Background</h3>Hello!  My name is Allan and I am the inventor of the WriteRight Pencil Grip and Trainer! It was inspired by a family member, an Occupational Therapist working in a New Jersey Public School District, who one day exclaimed to me:</div><div><br/></div><div>
<b><i> ""We nee<span style=""background-color: initial;"">d a pencil grip tha</span></i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>t WORKS!""</i></b>   </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As an engineer and entrepreneur, with a passion to solve problems, create and invent, we developed a new pencil grip.  Our product truly addresses the challenges millions of children and older individuals with special needs face each and every day trying to hold a writing implement!</span><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to a design patent that has already been issued (US D710,492), a utility patent is pending for our product.   We have received feedback from the United States Patent Office that it is likely to be granted very soon!</div><div><br/></div><div>We've spent countless hours and thousands of dollars getting the idea from concept to pre-production,  With the help of family, friends, teachers, and professionals, we've sold over 5,000 pre-production units manufactured using high tech 3D printing technology.   We have sold our product all over the United States and around the globe!</div><div>
<br/>With our modern society fixated on the latest and greatest technology explosion, it is fun to be excited over one of the oldest inventions that perhaps started it all. </div><div>
<br/><b><i>THE PENCIL.</i></b><br/><br/>The WriteRight is simply the greatest innovation to assist those who want to do the simplest of tasks:  Signing their own name.</div><div>
<br/>Help us take our product to the next stage in its evolution!</div><div>
<br/><h3>What's So Special About the WriteRight</h3>
<div>Historically, ""pencil grips"" have been a mish-mosh of plastic, rubber and silicone shapes, most of which were developed in the 40s and 50s. For decades, there has been little to no innovation in the humble pencil grip. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That is not to say there has not been a need.   The therapist who inspired the WriteRight pencil grip has been perpetually frustrated with the products on the market.   She works with hundreds of children every year, ranging from mild to severe challenges when writing.  Most children would give up or complain of fatigue, while others would not use the grip for fear of being mocked by their peers.    She had tried every grip on the market, and nothing worked for any length of time.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">None of the grips were designed with the entire physiology of the hand in mind, merely the position of the fingers.</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our product addresses more than just the position of the fingers.  The WriteRight is designed to fill the negative space of the hand, promoting the natural tripod grip: The integrated tail sinks into the palm of the hand causing the pinky and ring fingers to curl inward, and the friendly eyes and mouth are visual cues for proper finger and thumb placement.   For children with mild writing issues, our grip becomes a trainer, promoting muscle memory.  For severe conditions, our grip will enable children to grow into adulthood using our product as we have sizes through adult.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The innovation did not stop with the shape of the product!  We integrated a mechanical pencil which is included with the device.   It never requires sharpening, can never be removed, is always at the correct location, and always provides the perfect point for easy penmanship.  A simple ""click"" of the eraser, and the child can advance the lead.  Pop off the eraser when the lead is done, and add another. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> Simple. </span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Another challenge with today's product design is that the grips are symmetrical, for use in either hand.   But the hands are mirrors of each other, not just symmetric.  So we created sizes for both left and right handed users spanning the ages of three to adult.   We have not come across another grip where both the left and right hand are addressed.   One size definitely does <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">not</i> fit all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>  Parents of children who use our product discover that their child can pick up our product, intuitively understand how to use it  and simply start <i>writing</i> within seconds<i>.  </i>Where nearly all other products have failed, the WriteRight Pencil Grip has excelled.</div>
<div><br/></div>
As we make progress, we are actively working on a version with a pen.  An important discovery made at a special needs event demonstrated that  teens and adults with musculoskeletal and neurological conditions such as TBI, CP, MS, MD, are desperate to be able to write.  There appears to be no real solutions for them.   This is a highly under-served group of  individuals who simply want to be able to sign their own name.   <b><i>We believe we have the solution.
</i></b>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to raise $35,000 in capital for the following purposes:</p>
<p>#1:  Design, develop and manufacture  the necessary production molds to move our product into full scale, low cost injection molding process using high quality plastic resins.  Best of all, we plan to make them all right here in the USA. <br/></p>
<p>#2: Re-build our website to make it more user friendly, and easier to order product.</p>
<p>#3:  Fund travel expenses to go to tradeshows to demonstrate our products to the correct industries.</p>
<p>#4:  Complete the patent application process as soon as possible as time is running out on our filing, and some additional capital is necessary.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Whether or not we reach our desired goal, all the proceeds raised will go towards funding the production molds first and foremost.   We will start with our size Medium Right, as this is the most popular size purchased to date.</span></p>
<p>To show our appreciation for your contribution to our  campaign, we have a variety of perks to offer.   Please check them out!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In our world dominated by computers, smart phones, electronics, computer games, and the like, there is one indisputable fact.  Children will need to learn to write before they can proficiently type.  Signing one's name will likely never fall out of favor.  Penmanship is rarely taught in schools any longer, but the need to write has not gone away.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our product is timeless, yet our culture, and cultures around the world, are spending less and less time coaching the basic skills of life, such as writing.  Children are not becoming proficient with this most basic skill.   And for those children with special needs, gripping a pencil can be an arduous chore.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Professionals have said that training of how to use a pencil properly needs to occur before the age of 8, after which poor habits are difficult, if not impossible, to correct.   Our product targets this particular age group, and we have had teachers of young children tell us that <b><i>""they wish every student they had could use a WriteRight.""</i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>There are over 20 million children in grades pre-K to three, our target market, in just the United States!   Millions are not learning to hold a pencil in the proper and efficient, tripod grip.  This improper grip often leads to slower writing, inferior penmanship, hand fatigue, and in some case, tendinitis or other degenerative ailments.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Perhaps the most startling discovery we have made is that children actually <b><i>use</i> </b>our product.  Teachers and Therapists alike tell stories about how children dislike using the existing slip-on pencil grips.   They pull them off, or slide them around, lose them or simply ignore them.   Many children tease those using other pencil grips.  With our WriteRight featuring its friendly animal features and shape, children are competing to use the grip.  It's amazing!  In one case, a therapist told us that ""one child without any writing issues came up to me and said, 'I think I need help writing.  Can I have the dolphin pencil, too?'""</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Challenge</h3> <p> Our challenge right now is the need to speed to market.  We are ready to move to the next step, which is full scale production. This is how we can produce tens or even hundreds of thousands at the lowest possible price.   Our issue is the ""catch 22"" of any start-up enterprise.   We need to be ready to build production volumes in order for big retailers to place large orders.  The problem is we need large orders to justify investing in the capital.  Raising a relatively small amount of capital through this campaign will resolve the conundrum.  </p>

</div></div>","BackgroundHello!  My name is Allan and I am the inventor of the WriteRight Pencil Grip and Trainer! It was inspired by a family member, an Occupational Therapist working in a New Jersey Public School District, who one day exclaimed to me:
 ""We need a pencil grip that WORKS!""   

As an engineer and entrepreneur, with a passion to solve problems, create and invent, we developed a new pencil grip.  Our product truly addresses the challenges millions of children and older individuals with special needs face each and every day trying to hold a writing implement!
In addition to a design patent that has already been issued (US D710,492), a utility patent is pending for our product.   We have received feedback from the United States Patent Office that it is likely to be granted very soon!We've spent countless hours and thousands of dollars getting the idea from concept to pre-production,  With the help of family, friends, teachers, and professionals, we've sold over 5,000 pre-production units manufactured using high tech 3D printing technology.   We have sold our product all over the United States and around the globe!
With our modern society fixated on the latest and greatest technology explosion, it is fun to be excited over one of the oldest inventions that perhaps started it all. 
THE PENCIL.The WriteRight is simply the greatest innovation to assist those who want to do the simplest of tasks:  Signing their own name.
Help us take our product to the next stage in its evolution!
What's So Special About the WriteRight
Historically, ""pencil grips"" have been a mish-mosh of plastic, rubber and silicone shapes, most of which were developed in the 40s and 50s. For decades, there has been little to no innovation in the humble pencil grip. 

That is not to say there has not been a need.   The therapist who inspired the WriteRight pencil grip has been perpetually frustrated with the products on the market.   She works with hundreds of children every year, ranging from mild to severe challenges when writing.  Most children would give up or complain of fatigue, while others would not use the grip for fear of being mocked by their peers.    She had tried every grip on the market, and nothing worked for any length of time.  None of the grips were designed with the entire physiology of the hand in mind, merely the position of the fingers.


Our product addresses more than just the position of the fingers.  The WriteRight is designed to fill the negative space of the hand, promoting the natural tripod grip: The integrated tail sinks into the palm of the hand causing the pinky and ring fingers to curl inward, and the friendly eyes and mouth are visual cues for proper finger and thumb placement.   For children with mild writing issues, our grip becomes a trainer, promoting muscle memory.  For severe conditions, our grip will enable children to grow into adulthood using our product as we have sizes through adult.

The innovation did not stop with the shape of the product!  We integrated a mechanical pencil which is included with the device.   It never requires sharpening, can never be removed, is always at the correct location, and always provides the perfect point for easy penmanship.  A simple ""click"" of the eraser, and the child can advance the lead.  Pop off the eraser when the lead is done, and add another.  Simple. 


Another challenge with today's product design is that the grips are symmetrical, for use in either hand.   But the hands are mirrors of each other, not just symmetric.  So we created sizes for both left and right handed users spanning the ages of three to adult.   We have not come across another grip where both the left and right hand are addressed.   One size definitely does not fit all.

  Parents of children who use our product discover that their child can pick up our product, intuitively understand how to use it  and simply start writing within seconds.  Where nearly all other products have failed, the WriteRight Pencil Grip has excelled.

As we make progress, we are actively working on a version with a pen.  An important discovery made at a special needs event demonstrated that  teens and adults with musculoskeletal and neurological conditions such as TBI, CP, MS, MD, are desperate to be able to write.  There appears to be no real solutions for them.   This is a highly under-served group of  individuals who simply want to be able to sign their own name.   We believe we have the solution.

  What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise $35,000 in capital for the following purposes:
#1:  Design, develop and manufacture  the necessary production molds to move our product into full scale, low cost injection molding process using high quality plastic resins.  Best of all, we plan to make them all right here in the USA. 
#2: Re-build our website to make it more user friendly, and easier to order product.
#3:  Fund travel expenses to go to tradeshows to demonstrate our products to the correct industries.
#4:  Complete the patent application process as soon as possible as time is running out on our filing, and some additional capital is necessary.
Whether or not we reach our desired goal, all the proceeds raised will go towards funding the production molds first and foremost.   We will start with our size Medium Right, as this is the most popular size purchased to date.
To show our appreciation for your contribution to our  campaign, we have a variety of perks to offer.   Please check them out!
   The Impact In our world dominated by computers, smart phones, electronics, computer games, and the like, there is one indisputable fact.  Children will need to learn to write before they can proficiently type.  Signing one's name will likely never fall out of favor.  Penmanship is rarely taught in schools any longer, but the need to write has not gone away.  

Our product is timeless, yet our culture, and cultures around the world, are spending less and less time coaching the basic skills of life, such as writing.  Children are not becoming proficient with this most basic skill.   And for those children with special needs, gripping a pencil can be an arduous chore.

Professionals have said that training of how to use a pencil properly needs to occur before the age of 8, after which poor habits are difficult, if not impossible, to correct.   Our product targets this particular age group, and we have had teachers of young children tell us that ""they wish every student they had could use a WriteRight.""

There are over 20 million children in grades pre-K to three, our target market, in just the United States!   Millions are not learning to hold a pencil in the proper and efficient, tripod grip.  This improper grip often leads to slower writing, inferior penmanship, hand fatigue, and in some case, tendinitis or other degenerative ailments.

Perhaps the most startling discovery we have made is that children actually use our product.  Teachers and Therapists alike tell stories about how children dislike using the existing slip-on pencil grips.   They pull them off, or slide them around, lose them or simply ignore them.   Many children tease those using other pencil grips.  With our WriteRight featuring its friendly animal features and shape, children are competing to use the grip.  It's amazing!  In one case, a therapist told us that ""one child without any writing issues came up to me and said, 'I think I need help writing.  Can I have the dolphin pencil, too?'""
   Our Challenge  Our challenge right now is the need to speed to market.  We are ready to move to the next step, which is full scale production. This is how we can produce tens or even hundreds of thousands at the lowest possible price.   Our issue is the ""catch 22"" of any start-up enterprise.   We need to be ready to build production volumes in order for big retailers to place large orders.  The problem is we need large orders to justify investing in the capital.  Raising a relatively small amount of capital through this campaign will resolve the conundrum.  

Regardless of the outcome of this campaign, we will keep pursuing the next step.   It will just take more time.   With all of your help, we can accelerate the move to production, and start winning the larger orders. Our dream is to get our product out to those who need it around the globe.

</div><p><span><b>NEPAL EARTHQUAKE RELIEF FUND FOR NUBRI</b></span></p><p>On April 25th, a massive 7.9 earthquake hit Nepal, claiming the lives of over 8,500 people, and injuring twice that number. Many parts of the country were stricken by the quake. Since then, Nepal has been experiencing several aftershocks which further worsen the situation. Many people are left homeless and hungry. On May 12th, Langtang, a remote region in the North, encountered another major 7.3 earthquake that killed over fifty people and injured over four hundred. Although Nepal has received a lot of aid and support from many foreign countries, many people from the affected areas are not receiving any relief or support from the Nepali government. In order to address this, many people who are currently studying or working in Kathmandu and the affected regions are working on figuring ways to get relief funds and support to their villages.</p><p>My name is Tashi Bista.  I’m from Lo Manthang, a village in Mustang, Nepal. I currently go to school at Phillips Exeter Academy in the United States. While I am fortunate that my family and village were not impacted very greatly, the earthquake has directly affected many close friends and connections of mine (from other parts of the country, particularly Nubri in this case), and I consider this issue very real and important to me. So, I’m organizing a group of friends in Nepal and the US to help with the earthquake relief efforts. Our plan is to crowd fund via a non-profit institution called Himalayan Children’s Fund (HCF). HCF raises funds for Venerable Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche’s institutions in India and Nepal. Thrangu Rinpoche is a highly regarded Buddhist monk and teacher who has dedicated his life to preserving and protecting the teachings of the Buddha and the Himalayan Buddhist way of life. He has established institutions all around the globe that serve his intentions. He also established a private non-profit school, Shree Mangal Dvip (SMD), in Kathmandu in 1987, for the Himalayan children who are deprived of modern education, healthcare facilities, and healthy environments to grow in. I finished grade ten at SMD in 2012. I had the privilege of serving the school for a year and half, working in the director’s office.</p><p>HCF’s mission:</p><p>“The Himalayan Children's Fund is a way for people around the world, and the west in particular, to connect with the lives of people in the Himalayan Region of Nepal, India and Tibet. HCF provides support for Thrangu Rinpoche's many compassionate activities such as schools, monasteries and clinics. By providing support for education, food, clothing, medicine and other needs we hope to equip the children and adults with the tools necessary for life enhancement while helping to preserve the culture of the people which is primarily of Tibetan and Buddhist heritage.”</p><p>Our plan is to work closely with some of our friends at SMD, and the monks from the Thrangu monastery in Kathmandu, whom I know very well. They have been tirelessly working to raise funds and get supplies transported to their villages, and they need immense support in order to keep on helping the victims. We have targeted the area of Nubri in Nepal, because it’s one of the hardest-hit areas, one of the most remote, and also one of the poorest.  It has mostly been overlooked by relief efforts to this point.</p><p>Here are some of the problems we have seen so far in the Nubri area, and our proposed solutions.</p><p>Problem #1: HOUSING</p><p>Most people saw their houses knocked down to the ground, and they have nowhere else to shelter themselves and their family members. It is one of the major problems, especially during this time of the year in Nepal. It’s monsoon season in Nepal, and the situation is getting worse in the remote village areas, such as Nubri. Tulku Damcho, a Buddhist monk from that region, writes, “The monsoon is the major problem at the moment. There are many people who don’t have anywhere to sleep.” Nepali friend Dorje Tsering reports: “The rain pours in through the tarps where we’re building right now, since it’s uncovered from the sides. We want the villagers to have good, stable tents that can survive the monsoon season.”</p><p>Solution: HCF is providing tents/tarps and mats to shelter those homeless families on a short-term basis, so that the villagers have a sense of belonging somewhere. The monks and students delivering supplies want to provide tarps/tents that can survive through the monsoon season. “We just want to make sure everyone is healthy and safe,” says Dorje Tsering. </p><p>On the long-term basis, the ground team is starting to rebuild the community by reconstructing health posts, schools and other community buildings that would provide basic infrastructure and needs for the villagers. Tulku Damcho says, “We want somewhere to store the supplies we have, and somewhere to base our project.”</p><p>Problem #2: HEALTH CARE</p><p>Many people are injured, and the earthquake destroyed all the health posts in Nubri region. Dorje states that it takes several days to get medications and healthcare facilities to the villages in the mountains.</p><p>Solution:The team plans to carry in more medical supplies to the villages that have been affected by the quake. Their strategy is to try treating all minor injuries that can be treated with basic medical supplies, so that most earthquake victims in the area won’t need to get to Kathmandu for treatment.</p><p>Problem #3: FOOD</p><p>Team member Tsewang Gyurme, who finished grade ten from SMD, reported that the people in his village have limited access of food supplies, and it worsens day by day. Most of the people in these regions depend on farming the land for their livelihood. Gyurme stated that all stored food supplies have been buried under the rubble.</p><p>Solution: The team plans to provide food packages to the villages - which will include rice, dal (lentil) and dry food such as noodles, biscuits, and bars. The team also plans to bring the villagers together to plant vegetables and fruits, and for this we would also need to buy some seeds.</p><p>Problem #4: TRANSPORTATION</p><p>Lack of transportation is one of the major problems in the region. The harsh geography of the region makes effective roads impossible to build. Aid supplies have to be carried in by the villagers/porters, and that takes a few days. The monsoon season is adding fuel to the fire by making the only routes to the region impossible to hike in. Dorje writes, “Nubri remains cut off from road access and from any form of communication.” The ground team has to wait to take tents and more relief supplies to these villages until the muddy routes open.</p><p>Solution: According to the team on the ground, taking helicopters to the region is the most effective way to bring in the aid supplies, and this won’t be possible without funds to cover the transportation costs.</p><p><b>Who are we?</b></p><p>Tashi Bista is a Nepali student from Mustang, studying at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, USA.  He is the coordinator between the fundraising team in the US, and the team on the ground in Nepal.</p>Tulku Damcho is a Buddhist monk and teacher from Nubri, Nepal.  He is a highly trained and accomplished tulku, or recognized reincarnation of a previous Buddhist master.  He oversees many of Thrangu Rinpoche’s projects, and he will be the director of our on-the-ground team.<div>

Tulku Damcho, a Buddhist monk from that region, writes, “The monsoon is the major problem at the moment. There are many people who don’t have anywhere to sleep.” Nepali friend Dorje Tsering reports: “The rain pours in through the tarps where we’re building right now, since it’s uncovered from the sides. We want the villagers to have good, stable tents that can survive the monsoon season.”Solution: HCF is providing tents/tarps and mats to shelter those homeless families on a short-term basis, so that the villagers have a sense of belonging somewhere. The monks and students delivering supplies want to provide tarps/tents that can survive through the monsoon season. “We just want to make sure everyone is healthy and safe,” says Dorje Tsering. On the long-term basis, the ground team is starting to rebuild the community by reconstructing health posts, schools and other community buildings that would provide basic infrastructure and needs for the villagers. Tulku Damcho says, “We want somewhere to store the supplies we have, and somewhere to base our project.”Problem #2: HEALTH CAREMany people are injured, and the earthquake destroyed all the health posts in Nubri region. Dorje states that it takes several days to get medications and healthcare facilities to the villages in the mountains.Solution:The team plans to carry in more medical supplies to the villages that have been affected by the quake. Their strategy is to try treating all minor injuries that can be treated with basic medical supplies, so that most earthquake victims in the area won’t need to get to Kathmandu for treatment.Problem #3: FOODTeam member Tsewang Gyurme, who finished grade ten from SMD, reported that the people in his village have limited access of food supplies, and it worsens day by day. Most of the people in these regions depend on farming the land for their livelihood. Gyurme stated that all stored food supplies have been buried under the rubble.Solution: The team plans to provide food packages to the villages - which will include rice, dal (lentil) and dry food such as noodles, biscuits, and bars. The team also plans to bring the villagers together to plant vegetables and fruits, and for this we would also need to buy some seeds.Problem #4: TRANSPORTATIONLack of transportation is one of the major problems in the region. The harsh geography of the region makes effective roads impossible to build. Aid supplies have to be carried in by the villagers/porters, and that takes a few days. The monsoon season is adding fuel to the fire by making the only routes to the region impossible to hike in. Dorje writes, “Nubri remains cut off from road access and from any form of communication.” The ground team has to wait to take tents and more relief supplies to these villages until the muddy routes open.Solution: According to the team on the ground, taking helicopters to the region is the most effective way to bring in the aid supplies, and this won’t be possible without funds to cover the transportation costs.Who are we?Tashi Bista is a Nepali student from Mustang, studying at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, USA.  He is the coordinator between the fundraising team in the US, and the team on the ground in Nepal.Tulku Damcho is a Buddhist monk and teacher from Nubri, Nepal.  He is a highly trained and accomplished tulku, or recognized reincarnation of a previous Buddhist master.  He oversees many of Thrangu Rinpoche’s projects, and he will be the director of our on-the-ground team.
Tashi Wangchuk is a Buddhist monk from Bhutan who lives in Lumbini, Nepal. He completed the traditional 3-year retreat in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and served as principal of SMD Branch School for monks in Namo Buddha, Nepal. He has been tirelessly active in helping to provide relief since the earthquake struck on April 25.

Amy Schwartz is a history teacher at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, USA. Her connection to Nepal comes through her study and practice of Tibetan Buddhism under the guidance of her teacher, Venerable Thrangu Rinpoche.


Lhakpa Tsewang Lama is a “senior” student at SMD, who is from Lhi village, one the many villages affected by the quake. He finished grade ten at SMD in 2012, and is currently serving the school as a teacher, teaching Computer Science. Lhakpa is one of our main liaisons in Nepal and a close collaborator on this project. He will send us updates, photos, information, and specific reports of progress as the relief project progresses.
Raghav Bhat is a junior at Phillips Exeter Academy. Although Raghav grew up in rural New England, he has lived in Chennai for a couple years. With his interest and involvement in Hinduism and Buddhist meditation, he has become close to many Nepali people. Being the host brother of Tashi Bista while Tashi studies in the US, he has been able to learn about Nepal and the devastating effects of the earthquake.
Dorje Tsering is also from Lhi village. He works as the manager of a non-profit organization called Hope Alliance, which is based in Australia. Hope Alliance has been helping to provide education to the children in Lhi village.
Melody Nguyen is an eleventh grader studying in Phillips Exeter Academy from Vietnam. Although she has never been to Nepal herself, she feels strongly that such a humanitarian disaster deserves attention and sympathy. She hopes that this initiative will gather support from the Exeter community and from all the people around the globe.
Sachin Holdheim is a student of Indian and German descent at Phillips Exeter Academy in the US. His experience living in New Delhi, India with his family and at the Academy with roommate Tashi Bista has helped him to understand the plight of Nepal, and hopes to gather support and recognition for this disaster in his local community.
Byron Valenzuela is a senior at Phillips Exeter Academy. He has never been to Nepal, but his friendship with Tashi Bista has given him a glimpse of Nepalese culture, and this friendship has also served as a bridge to the unfortunate suffering that the people of Nepal are experiencing.
Tsewang Gyurme is also a senior at SMD School in Kathmandu. He finished grade ten and has dedicated his recent time to serving SMD School. He will be starting the IB program at ICZ school in Zurich this fall. Tsewang is one the active members on this project.
Dolma Sherpa is from Sindhupalchowk, one of the hardest-hit regions, that lies in the north of Nepal. She recently finished three year course of paramedics (General Medicine) from Nepal Institute of Medical Science and Technology in Kathmandu. She has been actively participating in earthquake relief campaigns that aim to provide healthcare to the people in her village, and in Kathmandu.
Josh Desmond is a student at Phillips Exeter, who lives in Boxford, Massachusetts. He is a great friend of Tashi, and is looking to help contribute in any way he can. He has experience working with film and video editing, and will work to raise awareness online.


Jennifer Shang is an upper at Phillips Exeter Academy from Jakarta, Indonesia. She writes, “I think what happened in Nepal is a terrible tragedy. And we as people, even if we are not from Nepal or the surrounding countries, we have to come together to do whatever we can to help.”",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>Now that my office is closed, and I in much need of your help to open it again.</b><p>My name is <b>Rosmery Romero</b> and I am of Bolivian nationality.  I had the chance to go to the United States to finish high school and do my undergraduate studies.  I managed to graduate from  Medaille College with and B.S. in Human Services. When I first  went to the United States my English knowledge was very deficient.  However, after a year of being there, I graduated from high school with honors.  While in college, I was on  the Deans List each consecutive year, belonged to many associations, was a member of Who is Who among Students from American Colleges and Universities, and  I managed to graduate as a <b>Suma Cum Laude </b>student. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441891356/mo7cqmqvktvyq8uim7mh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                               (You can view original at Gallery)<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/><p>Later, upon returning to Bolivia, I started working for Foster Parents International where I was in charge of the Donor Services Department and also worked as a community service specialist.  </p>
<p>I started working at the Centro Boliviano-Americano, Bolivian American Binational Center. After fifteen years of working as an English language teacher, teacher-counselor, and supervisor, I was assigned to work as an EducationUSA advisor. </p>
<p> At that time, advising was only an interesting concept. Information about studying in the United States was given once a week from 15:00 to 17:00 from a corner of a conference room.</p>
<p>I  had been working as an EducationUSA Adviser for the past sixteen years, since 1999. </p>
<p>During the time I worked in EducationUSA,  I have done so much to make the department expand.</p>
<p>I have improved the attention to the public and sold the idea of going to study and taking advantage of the excellent university education available in the U.S.A.  </p>
<p> I have also been working very hard on building in the students an  awareness of the importance of returning to Bolivia with newly gained knowledge in order  to  contribute to the development of Bolivia and to make this country a better place to live in; a goal every Bolivian has the duty to fight for.</p>
<p>I became a Senior Adviser in an extremely busy office. It was a hive of activity with many satisfied and interested people looking for information and services. </p>

<br/><p>Unfortunately, Education USA closed due to a radical and abrupt change in the administration of the Bi-national Center that was taken over by a leftisy Labor Union that did not believe that Education in the USA was good .</p>
<p>When closing the office, the expectations of thousands Bolivian students ended up in suspense.  I feel confident that with much effort, time and the necessary resources, I will help these individuals to fulfill their expectations. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p> Many people will benefit from a better education that will  not only change their lives, but that will also contribute to the development of the country and the continent. </p>
<p>Since I am no longer under the umbrella of the binational center and its limitations, I am confident that I will be able to reach the community on a larger scale.  To achieve my goals and objectives,  it would be of utmost importance to open an office and a couple of spaces in order to continue the advising work and even go beyond that.   This project is valid and reachable.  This job will enable more than 15,000 students per year to receive better training and formation that will make them perfect fits and recipients of financial aid from many universities in the United States.   The students that for any reasons decide to remain in the country will have necessary tools to become assets in their local universities and make a difference in their communities. </p>
<p>It is my goal to make a difference in young Bolivian students so that they are more committed to the development of our country, thus changing Bolivia into a better place to live. </p>
<p>We want  to call your attention to show how a small effort from you, how a small donation, can render unsuspected results and effects of the focused population of Bolivian outstanding young adults. These students have high expectations to develop their abilities.</p>
<p>The Bolivian government has recently implemented the Sovereignty Scholarships. Many young academically outstanding and deprived individuals were sent to study in foreign countries, at graduate and undergraduate level. </p>
<p>They went to universities from England, Japan, China, Cuba, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, to name a few countries.</p>
<p>    Only very few of them applied to the United States because of lack of knowledge of application deadlines and requirements.</p>
<p>This program will not only focus on teaching  English and preparing young adults to obtain decent TOEFL and SAT scores.  It will also provide them with  life tools that would enable them  to re-evaluate their goals and objectives, to:</p>
<p>•    Expand their horizons and set their goals.</p>
<p>•    Contribute to developing their necessary skills to complete high school and pursue a university degree.</p>
<p>•    Help their decision making to choose the right field of study.</p>
<p>•    Contribute to the development of their personal, social, and academic skills to face school and university challenges.</p>
<p>•    Facilitate access to higher education in a supportive cultural environment, enhancing their preparation for college/university entrance, either locally or in the United States. </p>
<p>•    Encourage future generations to pursue higher education.</p>
<p>•    Motivate students to identify and use their talent and potential.</p>
<p>•    Provide positive professional role models.</p>
<p>•    Establish community networks so that students support one another.</p>
<p>•    Identify problems that could interfere with the achievement of their goals.</p>
<p>•    Monitor students’ progress.</p>
<p>A small action from a willing individual or institution, together with creativity, and good, proactive management, is causing positive effects in a excluded population. It all depends on the will, honesty, and on a strong drive to get positive outcomes.  It will make the earth a better place to live and will contribute to forming young responsible and prepared individuals who will be the solution to a  country that is somewhat politically and economically corrupted. </p>
<p>The financial aid that I am asking for will be nothing compared to the magnitude of the results.  It is  my intention to  work in such an efficient, creative way that the same project  can replicate in other states and communities</p>
<p>It is my intention to open a four-room office that will offer enough space for video conferences, preparation for exams, training, university searches, pre-departure orientation,  advice on visas and other services.  This dream place will have a few computer stations and four desks, one for me, and the other three for colleagues and aids. </p>

</div>","WORKING WITH DESERVING STUDENTS

 I want to keep educating students as I did the last sixteen years. Now, with your help I want to launch an International Exams Preparation Center. (TOEFL,SAT,GRE,GMAT,USMLE and other)(View Budget below)

Several thousands of poorly prepared students passed through our EducationUSA office and received training and preparation. Most of them approved the TOEFL and SAT exams; many got scholarships to United States Universities. Besides working on academics and college applications and exams, they also experienced American Culture.
Now that my office is closed, and I in much need of your help to open it again.My name is Rosmery Romero and I am of Bolivian nationality.  I had the chance to go to the United States to finish high school and do my undergraduate studies.  I managed to graduate from  Medaille College with and B.S. in Human Services. When I first  went to the United States my English knowledge was very deficient.  However, after a year of being there, I graduated from high school with honors.  While in college, I was on  the Deans List each consecutive year, belonged to many associations, was a member of Who is Who among Students from American Colleges and Universities, and  I managed to graduate as a Suma Cum Laude student.                                                                                     (You can view original at Gallery)
Later, upon returning to Bolivia, I started working for Foster Parents International where I was in charge of the Donor Services Department and also worked as a community service specialist.  
I started working at the Centro Boliviano-Americano, Bolivian American Binational Center. After fifteen years of working as an English language teacher, teacher-counselor, and supervisor, I was assigned to work as an EducationUSA advisor. 
 At that time, advising was only an interesting concept. Information about studying in the United States was given once a week from 15:00 to 17:00 from a corner of a conference room.
I  had been working as an EducationUSA Adviser for the past sixteen years, since 1999. 
During the time I worked in EducationUSA,  I have done so much to make the department expand.
I have improved the attention to the public and sold the idea of going to study and taking advantage of the excellent university education available in the U.S.A.  
 I have also been working very hard on building in the students an  awareness of the importance of returning to Bolivia with newly gained knowledge in order  to  contribute to the development of Bolivia and to make this country a better place to live in; a goal every Bolivian has the duty to fight for.
I became a Senior Adviser in an extremely busy office. It was a hive of activity with many satisfied and interested people looking for information and services. 


Unfortunately, Education USA closed due to a radical and abrupt change in the administration of the Bi-national Center that was taken over by a leftisy Labor Union that did not believe that Education in the USA was good .
When closing the office, the expectations of thousands Bolivian students ended up in suspense.  I feel confident that with much effort, time and the necessary resources, I will help these individuals to fulfill their expectations. 
It is my intention to continue doing what I had stopped doing a couple of months ago.  I feel there is much to give through my work.


                                                               



""An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.""(Benjamin Franklin)



I also want to learn good English!

 Many people will benefit from a better education that will  not only change their lives, but that will also contribute to the development of the country and the continent. 
Since I am no longer under the umbrella of the binational center and its limitations, I am confident that I will be able to reach the community on a larger scale.  To achieve my goals and objectives,  it would be of utmost importance to open an office and a couple of spaces in order to continue the advising work and even go beyond that.   This project is valid and reachable.  This job will enable more than 15,000 students per year to receive better training and formation that will make them perfect fits and recipients of financial aid from many universities in the United States.   The students that for any reasons decide to remain in the country will have necessary tools to become assets in their local universities and make a difference in their communities. 
It is my goal to make a difference in young Bolivian students so that they are more committed to the development of our country, thus changing Bolivia into a better place to live. 
We want  to call your attention to show how a small effort from you, how a small donation, can render unsuspected results and effects of the focused population of Bolivian outstanding young adults. These students have high expectations to develop their abilities.
The Bolivian government has recently implemented the Sovereignty Scholarships. Many young academically outstanding and deprived individuals were sent to study in foreign countries, at graduate and undergraduate level. 
They went to universities from England, Japan, China, Cuba, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, to name a few countries.
    Only very few of them applied to the United States because of lack of knowledge of application deadlines and requirements.
This program will not only focus on teaching  English and preparing young adults to obtain decent TOEFL and SAT scores.  It will also provide them with  life tools that would enable them  to re-evaluate their goals and objectives, to:
•    Expand their horizons and set their goals.
•    Contribute to developing their necessary skills to complete high school and pursue a university degree.
•    Help their decision making to choose the right field of study.
•    Contribute to the development of their personal, social, and academic skills to face school and university challenges.
•    Facilitate access to higher education in a supportive cultural environment, enhancing their preparation for college/university entrance, either locally or in the United States. 
•    Encourage future generations to pursue higher education.
•    Motivate students to identify and use their talent and potential.
•    Provide positive professional role models.
•    Establish community networks so that students support one another.
•    Identify problems that could interfere with the achievement of their goals.
•    Monitor students’ progress.
A small action from a willing individual or institution, together with creativity, and good, proactive management, is causing positive effects in a excluded population. It all depends on the will, honesty, and on a strong drive to get positive outcomes.  It will make the earth a better place to live and will contribute to forming young responsible and prepared individuals who will be the solution to a  country that is somewhat politically and economically corrupted. 
The financial aid that I am asking for will be nothing compared to the magnitude of the results.  It is  my intention to  work in such an efficient, creative way that the same project  can replicate in other states and communities
It is my intention to open a four-room office that will offer enough space for video conferences, preparation for exams, training, university searches, pre-departure orientation,  advice on visas and other services.  This dream place will have a few computer stations and four desks, one for me, and the other three for colleagues and aids.

<p>For over 15 years MWB has run the Sarny Vocational Institute in war torn Ukraine.

Sarny enables students to earn state certified certificates in a variety of vocational areas. With this certificate these kids are assured of having the skills they need to get good jobs, restore hope in their lives and earn a secure future.</p>
<p>But now with all the problems in Ukraine, the Institute is faced with an uncertain future. Not only are their utility costs being increased a staggering 6 times this fall but the boiler they are so dependent on has broken down and is not fixable. Winters are harsh in Ukraine and without a boiler, the school will have to close. This would be a huge disaster. </p>

<p>Visit our Website for more details at <a href=""http://www.mothermiracle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mothermiracle.com</a></p><p>On February 22, 2015, I had the vision of a new and
beautiful school with lots of children enthusiastically studying in the
classrooms.  Some were playing volleyball
in the central courtyard of the school, while others were eating lunch in the
large dining hall.  I saw in my vision
the kindergarten students were playing with dolls and cars in the play room. </p>
<p>I picked up the phone and called the contractor to tear
down the aging, original ground-level classrooms, which were unsafe due to
damage by years of flooding, and started to build a 20,000 square foot, 3-story
structure, elevated four feet from the ground to be above the flood level.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441703849/ebfybn4oeqnjgnvgco0k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I started the construction of a new school building
without the necessary funds in hand but with tremendous faith in our friends
and supporters around the world, who I knew would help us to complete this
project. Many of my friends, family, and local people told me that I was crazy,
but I believed that with the help of sponsors and donors like yourself I could
finish this project within two years. My vision was so strong that the
contractor believed that I could come up with the funds and decided to proceed
with me on the project.</span></p>
<p>The massive three-story structure will be completed by
the end of December, and when I walk through the nearly-complete building, I
cannot believe how all this happened so fast! Many people around the world sent
us generous donations, some as little as $10, but with many such contributions
from hundreds of people it has all came together.  I have been able to pay the contractor for
his work so far.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441703993/msydsuoektqlyzf5gvsi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Construction is still going on, and there is still lots
of finishing work ahead, but the school does not have sufficient funds to
complete the construction of the building. I now have four months to come up
with $70,000 to pay the contractor for completing the first phase of the
construction:  14 classrooms, 3 science
laboratories, 12 bathrooms, dining hall, kitchen, library, 3 staff rooms,
principal's office, 2 guard rooms, art and music room, storage room for
uniforms, 3 school supply storage rooms, and a room full of toys for primary

<p></p></div>","Visit our Website for more details at www.mothermiracle.comOn February 22, 2015, I had the vision of a new and
beautiful school with lots of children enthusiastically studying in the
classrooms.  Some were playing volleyball
in the central courtyard of the school, while others were eating lunch in the
large dining hall.  I saw in my vision
the kindergarten students were playing with dolls and cars in the play room. 
I picked up the phone and called the contractor to tear
down the aging, original ground-level classrooms, which were unsafe due to
damage by years of flooding, and started to build a 20,000 square foot, 3-story
structure, elevated four feet from the ground to be above the flood level.I started the construction of a new school building
without the necessary funds in hand but with tremendous faith in our friends
and supporters around the world, who I knew would help us to complete this
project. Many of my friends, family, and local people told me that I was crazy,
but I believed that with the help of sponsors and donors like yourself I could
finish this project within two years. My vision was so strong that the
contractor believed that I could come up with the funds and decided to proceed
with me on the project.
The massive three-story structure will be completed by
the end of December, and when I walk through the nearly-complete building, I
cannot believe how all this happened so fast! Many people around the world sent
us generous donations, some as little as $10, but with many such contributions
from hundreds of people it has all came together.  I have been able to pay the contractor for
his work so far.
Construction is still going on, and there is still lots
of finishing work ahead, but the school does not have sufficient funds to
complete the construction of the building. I now have four months to come up
with $70,000 to pay the contractor for completing the first phase of the
construction:  14 classrooms, 3 science
laboratories, 12 bathrooms, dining hall, kitchen, library, 3 staff rooms,
principal's office, 2 guard rooms, art and music room, storage room for
uniforms, 3 school supply storage rooms, and a room full of toys for primary
school kids.  Mother Miracle needs your
help so that we can complete the construction and start finishing the
classrooms in time for the 2016-2017 school year.To show our appreciation for your generous donations, the
school will honor major contributors with permanent plaques in the school. For
sponsorship of an entire classroom ($29,000 or above), we will place a plaque
with the name of donor in that classroom. 
For donors who contribute approximately 1/3 of a single classroom
construction ($10,000 and above) we will make groupings of three sponsors per
classroom and will display the names of those sponsors on a permanent plaque in
the classroom.  For all major donors, we
will send photos and the video of the opening ceremony with students and
teacher of their sponsored classroom.
All donations of every size are deeply appreciated.  It is by working together with many people

And we need your help to build transitional shelters to the families directly affected by the earthquake. You donations will go DIRECTLY to the earthquake victims.   Hi, My name is Jay Poudyal and I am a wanderlust, traveller and a storyteller. For the last two years I have been traveling to villages in Nepal and sharing stories of an everyday common Nepali through my blog called Stories of Nepal. www.storiesofnepal.com & www.facebook.com/StoriesNepal. The Facebook page is a community of 120K+ followers.


45 minutes after the earthquake struck I started walking with my camera and documenting the plight of the victims through their personal stories, experiences of the earthquake, their losses and fears along with the destruction the earthquake had caused and sharing it through the blog. On the 3rd day I started a fundraising campaign through which we carried food and tarps to 5 highly affected districts for over 200 families. (Kavre, Sindhupalchok, Dhadhing, Rasuwa & Nuwakot) and built 50 transitional shelters for 50 families in Sindhupalchok. 


With the Monsoon fast approaching the families are more vulnerable to landslides, the hostile weather and other diseases. You contributions will provide more families with transitional shelters to get by through this Monsoon before they start rebuilding their lives. 

   What We Need  We need to collect USD 10000 dollars. The generated funds will go towards building transitional shelters to families directly affected by the earthquake. The updates of where the funds are going will be provided through the Stories of Nepal website (www.storiesofnepal.com) & the Facebook page (www.facebook.com/StoriesNepal).

 The Impact  Without a roof over ones head, it becomes impossible to think about rebuilding one's lives when families are consumed by loss and sorrow. The fund will have a major impact in helping people get on their feet to start rebuilding their lives and to come in terms with the reality and what must be done. With a roof over their head their attention then will be diverted towards their lives and how to make a living now that they will not have to worry about where to seek shelter.

profesores de otros niños, invitando prácticas de una manera fluída, divertida,
fácil y llena de apoyo.
2. Al ser un proyecto multimedia,
ofrece interacción real, y presiento que es así como serán pronto los
libros, por definición. ¿Por qué?


Multilingüe: el libro será publicado en inglés y
castellano, seguido en seguida de euskera, francés, italiano, portugués y
alemán.

Multi-formato: será publicado primero en Kindle y papel,
seguido de un audiobook que contendrá no solo la narración del libro en sí,
sino también pistas de sonido super atractivas para que se puedan practicar las
herramientas. 

Libro de colorear: los más pequeños podrán seguir
relacionándose con el libro de manera creativa.

Manual: el libro se convierte en plantilla
para obras de teatro, escritura creativa, y estructura para que los más pequeños
puedan expresar lo que les está pasando de una manera articulada con la ayuda
de educadores, padres, y otros cuidadores.

Página Web: seguirá creciendo en cuanto a
herramientas y recursos.

3. Es solo el primero. Siempre
Estoy Bien es el título que inaugura Evolution Revolution Books, editorial con la que planeo publicar
muchos más libros del futuro.
Así que aquí tenemos
un libro que es multilingüe, bi-continental, que existe en la nube, en tus
manos, en tus sentidos, e invita a tu hij@ a continuar creándolo conmigo.

¿Para qué son estos
fondos?
(1)
Pagar el trabajo de mi fantástico ilustrador y diseñador gráfico, Kanif Beruna.
(2)
Grabar el audiobook, algo a realizar entre España y Nueva York. 
(3)
Pagar las traducciones que no puedo hacer yo.
(4)
Cubrir todos los costes legales necesarios para proteger la
integridad del trabajo. 
(5)
Cubrir los costes de incorporación Evolution Revolution Books.
Este es un GRAN libro,
de eso no me cabe duda, y va a ser publicado. Todos los fondos serán destinados a que ocurra bien
sea muy rápido, si la campaña alcanza su objetivo, o en fases, según las ventas
iniciales cubren los costos de los siguientes pasos.
Y... es solo el principio. Siempre Estoy Bien no es
más que el primero de una gran lista de libros (el siguiente está a punto de
entrar en la fase del story-board).
¿Por qué confiar en
mi?

He producido festivales, organizado tours, enseñado,
traducido, informado, publicado, actuado, y caminado un increíble camino de
amor y consciencia. Lo que estáis
apoyando aquí, estaréis orgullosos de haber sido los primeros en reconocer y
pujar.
Si nada más, os pido que mováis el proyecto, compartáis la
campaña en medios sociales, escribáis a vuestros amigos, la mostréis a los
padres de otros niños del colegio, los monitores y profes de actividades
extra-escolares, corráis la voz en estudios de yoga, centros de meditación. Gran parte de la *Revolución de la Evolución* que deseamos todos consiste en
ayudar a los más pequeños a recordar que Todo Está Siempre Bien, y convertirse
en seres humanos conscientes de sí mismos, que viven desde el corazón y eligen
brillar desde su luz propia. 


Hace dos años deseé que, de niña, alguien me
hubiera dicho que siempre estoy bien, siempre tengo suficiente y no hay nada
que arreglar. Hoy estas verdades son mis grandes guías, y me hace feliz el
poder ofrecerlas a vuestr@s niñ@s de manera que puedan integrarlas fácilmente.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><b>The <i>My Wings</i> Story</b></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p><b>BY THE FOUNDER OF <i>MY WINGS</i></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>My Wings</i> began to take life in 2007, when I was a music teacher of young children, after graduating from U.C. Santa Cruz with a bachelor’s degree in community studies and minors in business management and social sciences, with a heavy focus on creative arts.</p>
<p>It was my passion to awaken the children’s curiosity and musical gifts at such a young age. At one point during the classes we would dance with scarves that through their imagination became wings. I noticed that as they took flight they would all lighten up, their innate joy would kick in, and their playful confidence would allow them to stretch into new areas of development and learning. Especially moving for me was seeing the children with physical or emotional challenges opening up with greater confidence through playful flying. I believe that the wings reminded the children of the feeling of freedom that is already alive within them, and that their dreams are possible and within their reach. Just like the freedom the crawling caterpillar must feel as it becomes a butterfly.  </p>
<p>I spent the next 6 years traveling and exploring community around the world. Though I saw many beautiful sights, I also saw a lot of children suffering. I felt a desire to do something to help these children. In a moment of inspiration I had a vision of beautiful shirts with wings for children to help them connect with their power and freedom within. This reminded me of  my early flying-with-scarves experiences during the children’s music classes. I looked to buy shirts with wings for the children, to remind them that they can grow, achieve their dreams, and soar in life. To my astonishment I could find no children’s shirts with wings like I envisioned. In addition to the winged shirts, the idea to include stories and activities were included to help strengthen the children’s “inner wings,” aiming to nurture empowering qualities to help children fly their highest and shine their brightest. </p>
<p>In early 2014 after moving to Sweden I won several contests for business start up support based on <i>My Wings</i>. I received  business development training and business mentorship, and it was finally time for <i>My Wings</i> to take flight. I gathered artists and designers and created the first <i>My Wings</i> designs, and made my initial prototypes. Children absolutely loved these creatively playful shirts and I believed they could help all children, the fortunate and the less fortunate as well. Thus was born the <i>My Wings</i> business model, which includes the <i>Giving Wings</i> program that gifts <i>My Wings</i> to children with special needs. </p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is my first request for money to help support the <i>My Wings</i> dream. I have self-funded thousands of dollars to get to this point, but now need help from others to take <i>My Wings</i> and the <i>Giving Wings</i> program to children around the world. I humbly and respectfully ask for your help to reach our goal and to uplift children and help them to soar in life. Thank you!</p>

How It Works
 
 
Your generous contribution to My Wings, whether it’s $5 or $5,000, enables us to fund our first production run of My Wings shirts, produce the accompanying activity booklets, and deliver My Wings to children around the world.
I have self-funded thousands of dollars to get to this point, but now need help from others to take My Wings and the Giving Wings program to children around the world. I humbly and respectfully ask for your help to reach our goal and to uplift children and help them to soar in life. Thank you!
Please contribute now by selecting your desired Perk:


You can purchase one or multiple My Wings shirts for children you know by claiming the appropriate Perk.
You can also contribute at various levels to the Giving Wings program and help give My Wings to children in need using the Giving Wings Perks on the right.
You are welcome to select and purchase multiple Perks; however, each Perk requires its own transaction. If you'd like to claim multiple Perks, please make a new contribution for each Perk. After the completion of the My Wings funding campaign, a questionnaire will be sent to contributors asking which style and what size shirts they desire, and to what address they want the shirts delivered. Contributors to the Giving Wings program will select in the questionnaire which organization they would like to support.
Giving Wings contributions will fund the production and delivery of My Wings shirts to our growing list of partners in the Giving Wings program. Initially Shriners Hospital for Children® and Pay It Forward Sweden will gift the shirts to benefit the children they serve. With your help we can expand the Giving Wings program to include other organizations around the world that support children in their right to a safe, healthy, and playful childhood.Please contribute now by selecting your desired “Perk” listed to the right.  What’s Included My Wings are made of 100% organic and Fairtrade cotton, with digitally printed polyester chiffon wings and sleeves. They are produced by our Fairtrade manufacturers that certify compliance with specific environmental, labor, and developmental standards.

Every My Wings shirt design is an original work of art. The wings are stunningly beautiful designs that depict butterfly, dragon, and fairy wings. The printing is on the front side of the wing to give maximum color vibrancy to each wing design; the back side is not as bright as the front. 
 

 The Activity Booklet and My Wings Card
Every My Wings shirt comes with an activity booklet and My Wings card that help develop confidence, self-esteem, and creative exploration. These activities are designed for adults and children to play with together, fostering quality bonding time.
 

 


 

Activity Booklet and My Wings Cards available in English and Swedish
 
How Funds Will Be Used

We will fund our first production order, build an eCommerce web site for future orders, expand the Giving Wings program with additional supportive organizations and marketing, and launch our global online marketing campaign promoting My Wings and the Giving Wings program.
 
 
Our First Giving Wings Children Support Organizations
We are pleased to be partnering with:

The Shriners Hospital for Children® Northern California
Pay It Forward Foundation of Sweden

We are currently developing relationships with other organizations that can help more children around the world.
 
  
The My Wings Story
 
BY THE FOUNDER OF MY WINGS
 
My Wings began to take life in 2007, when I was a music teacher of young children, after graduating from U.C. Santa Cruz with a bachelor’s degree in community studies and minors in business management and social sciences, with a heavy focus on creative arts.
It was my passion to awaken the children’s curiosity and musical gifts at such a young age. At one point during the classes we would dance with scarves that through their imagination became wings. I noticed that as they took flight they would all lighten up, their innate joy would kick in, and their playful confidence would allow them to stretch into new areas of development and learning. Especially moving for me was seeing the children with physical or emotional challenges opening up with greater confidence through playful flying. I believe that the wings reminded the children of the feeling of freedom that is already alive within them, and that their dreams are possible and within their reach. Just like the freedom the crawling caterpillar must feel as it becomes a butterfly.  
I spent the next 6 years traveling and exploring community around the world. Though I saw many beautiful sights, I also saw a lot of children suffering. I felt a desire to do something to help these children. In a moment of inspiration I had a vision of beautiful shirts with wings for children to help them connect with their power and freedom within. This reminded me of  my early flying-with-scarves experiences during the children’s music classes. I looked to buy shirts with wings for the children, to remind them that they can grow, achieve their dreams, and soar in life. To my astonishment I could find no children’s shirts with wings like I envisioned. In addition to the winged shirts, the idea to include stories and activities were included to help strengthen the children’s “inner wings,” aiming to nurture empowering qualities to help children fly their highest and shine their brightest. 
In early 2014 after moving to Sweden I won several contests for business start up support based on My Wings. I received  business development training and business mentorship, and it was finally time for My Wings to take flight. I gathered artists and designers and created the first My Wings designs, and made my initial prototypes. Children absolutely loved these creatively playful shirts and I believed they could help all children, the fortunate and the less fortunate as well. Thus was born the My Wings business model, which includes the Giving Wings program that gifts My Wings to children with special needs. 
This Indiegogo campaign is my first request for money to help support the My Wings dream. I have self-funded thousands of dollars to get to this point, but now need help from others to take My Wings and the Giving Wings program to children around the world. I humbly and respectfully ask for your help to reach our goal and to uplift children and help them to soar in life. Thank you!

</p><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>As a Professor
teaching at a #1 ranked MBA program I noticed an interesting trend:
increasingly, already well-educated professionals like physicians, attorneys, engineers, scientists, etc. were taking time away from their professional work to enroll in an
MBA program.  It occurred to me that there's a huge potential audience of professionals who would see the benefit of learning the fundamentals of
business without having to incur the expense and opportunity cost of getting an
MBA.  <i>MBA
in a Day</i>, published in 2004, (same year of Google IPO and “pre-Facebook”) has
successfully met that need.  More than a
decade later, it's time for <i>MBA in a Day
2.0</i>, an important update to my best-selling book.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Over the past year I have researched, written,
woven-in and updated the content of business fundamentals for <i>MBA in A Day 2.0.</i> </p>
<p>85,000 words and 303 pages later, the draft is ready
for final editing, and for the creation of engaging graphics, book production
and distribution. </p>
<p>In today's disruptive market for books and intellectual
content, it's all about generating awareness, interest and action to engage an audience and share with them meaningful work. 
Most of the funding will be dedicated to developing, nurturing and
sharing this new work that has a large audience and a big market opportunity.  Here is a breakdown of the use of funds:</p>

</ul>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Organizations, and their leaders, are increasingly
aware of the need to professionalize the way they are delivering their services
or producing their product. This trend is affecting heretofore “not-a-business”
organizations like nonprofits, hospitals, scientific research laboratories,

<br/></div>","Summary
As a Professor
teaching at a #1 ranked MBA program I noticed an interesting trend:
increasingly, already well-educated professionals like physicians, attorneys, engineers, scientists, etc. were taking time away from their professional work to enroll in an
MBA program.  It occurred to me that there's a huge potential audience of professionals who would see the benefit of learning the fundamentals of
business without having to incur the expense and opportunity cost of getting an
MBA.  MBA
in a Day, published in 2004, (same year of Google IPO and “pre-Facebook”) has
successfully met that need.  More than a
decade later, it's time for MBA in a Day
2.0, an important update to my best-selling book.
What
We Need & What You Get
Over the past year I have researched, written,
woven-in and updated the content of business fundamentals for MBA in A Day 2.0. 
85,000 words and 303 pages later, the draft is ready
for final editing, and for the creation of engaging graphics, book production
and distribution. 
In today's disruptive market for books and intellectual
content, it's all about generating awareness, interest and action to engage an audience and share with them meaningful work. 
Most of the funding will be dedicated to developing, nurturing and
sharing this new work that has a large audience and a big market opportunity.  Here is a breakdown of the use of funds:


$2,000 for final editing  ($.02 per word)


$2,000 for cover design, charts, graphs, design
consulting


$3,000 for formatting and layout, final production
version


$6,000 for paid search: Google AdWords, Facebook
and Twitter


$6,000 for social media campaign support, blogging,
social media awareness


The
Impact
Organizations, and their leaders, are increasingly
aware of the need to professionalize the way they are delivering their services
or producing their product. This trend is affecting heretofore “not-a-business”
organizations like nonprofits, hospitals, scientific research laboratories,
etc. MBA in a Day 2.0 will provide important
and necessary principles and concepts of business for leaders to apply
in these organizations. 
Sales of 15,000+ copies of the original 2004 version (available only
in hardback at a $29) has validated market viability.  Having successfully obtained a reversion of the original book's publishing rights, a sub-$20 revision MBA in a DAY 2.0  will appeal to a wide and deep market. 
Risks
& Challenges
Today, it’s a risky environment in the world of
content creation, marketing and distribution. 
We live in a dynamic, sometimes chaotic world of information that’s
shared in nanoseconds and often, in 140 characters or less.  
The greatest challenge will be to find a way to gain
awareness, access and action to the MBA in a DAY 2.0 reader.  It’s a crowded, noisy marketplace.  The marketing plan budget, while generous, will need
thoughtful development and effective execution—it’s a challenge that I am
confident to meet and to be successful in sharing my work.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Columbia University Obervatory... where I began my work in Family Science</i></p>
<p>Hi, I am Dr Jake Noel-Storr, President of InsightSTEM. </p>
<p>As an astrophysics PhD
student in New York City over 15 years ago, I began working on Family Science
programs to help families engage and share in the excitement that I have for
exploring science knowledge. But during these programs as I looked around the
room, I quickly noticed that these programs engaged only the kids, and not the
family as a whole. Parents sat around at the back of the room drinking coffee,
chatting with each other, and generally not taking part in any of the learning
activities. Kids attending were all from families who regularly went to science
centers, planetariums, nature centers, and zoos. Often, their parents were STEM
professionals themselves. </p>
<p><b>Though these events were great, and had
fantastic reviews, we added less value than we hoped, and families were missing
the opportunity to explore science </b><b>together. Families exploring science together is
surely the <i>point</i> of family science... and I became really passionate about making that possible!</b></p>
<p>From that point on I
knew that things had to change -- and I worked hard to create programs that
engage the whole family, not just the kids; and programs that reached families
who weren't already a part of the STEM community. In the following 15 years I
have worked on programs across the USA in a wide variety of communities, and
with partners including parents, teachers, librarians, science centers,
museums, the Motorola Foundation, NASA, and the National Science
Foundation... all to realize my enthusiasm for families genuinely exploring and learning together, and to help them share and enjoy in that excitement. </p>
<p>I have developed both passion and experience for what really works for families engaging in science
exploration together -- which I have honed down to what I call the Five Pillars
of Family Science.  These five pillars lay the foundation for parents to create
and enjoy truly great family learning experiences. As children spend most of
their time out of school, we must foster exploration outside the classroom to
create a more scientifically literate society. <b>This book, The Five Pillars of Family Science will
give many more families the nudge, encouragement, support, and validation that
they want </b><b>or</b><b> need to engage in learning science together. </b></p>

The book will represent a
great step forwards from the typical ""following a set of instructions in
the kitchen"" type family science that we often see on the shelves, to
allow parents to start creating new and engaging moments of science exploration
wherever and whatever they are doing. In this way it becomes second nature to
nurture the whole family towards greater scientific literacy and critical
thinking – essential for our 21st Century world.<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>InsightSTEM, and I,
aim to make a real difference with this book to the way that people think about
family science. Not only parents and families, who will be most immediately
impacted, but also other organizations and authors work in this field, which
while encouraging hands-on science at home, present it more along the lines of recipe
books or step by step hand holding activities for kids, rather than allowing
for true exploration and creative thought. These skills are essential for a
more scientifically literate and critically thinking society, where children
will be growing up in an expanding sphere of information overload.</p>
<p>The areas of greatest
concern that I will have in mind to be inclusive of while writing the book, and
where I hope that it can have the greatest impacts, are: Families that are
non-traditional in their makeup, or are in communities that are under-served in
the STEM opportunities that they have available to them; Families with kids who
are about to enter, or are in, their early teenage years where many stop
exploring science; and, any and all families who want to understand how to
continue enjoying learning together.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446332996/bf5p5nnms5fbqmj7uouc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 579px; height: 336px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Key Impact Groups for the book</i></p>
<p>As our world becomes
increasingly scientifically and technically complex, and the amount of
information that is available for consumption balloons each day, it is vital
that the children who will make up the next generation -- and the parents and
grandparents of this generation -- have the skills to explore that knowledge,
and the attitude and desire to *want* to explore that knowledge.</p>

Families will also be
together for a lot longer too – so the skills of enjoying learning together
will extend across generations. The date of my grandmother's birth is closer
to the day that Darwin set sail on the Beagle and discovered Evolution than it is
to today. Now she is a great grandmother of six. At her birth, it was almost
unheard of for someone to have a living great grandparent, but a 13-year-old
today is more than likely going to be an active great grandparent, still being
out and about and hopefully engaging in science exploration with their great
grandkids!<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>There are obvious
challenges with any creative work, of course, in terms of completing on the
anticipated schedule. However, by starting off strong with a month long writing
retreat with clear targets it will get us well underway to completing the
goal. </p>
<p>I will keep everyone
updated on the targets and progress day by day during the writing month of
November (following the calendar above) so that you can see how its progressing
and motivate me to move on faster if necessary! The editing and completion by
the end of December is an achievable goal, if we have managed to have enough
time dedicated to the writing during November. </p>

We will also be working to
find a publisher during that time which will make the distribution easier --
however, we do have publication channels identified that will allow us to get
the copies we need for the perks earned by our sponsors to press no matter what
the final publication situation may be.<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Even if you can’t or choose not to help
us out financially, there are many ways that you can help us out. Sharing the
word about this effort is essential -- so please share it around on social
media, by word of mouth, or to any parents or family organizations that you
know or maybe are a part of. </p>
<p>As I travel the country
in November there will also be opportunities for you to learn more about the
book, and give input from your own experiences if you are willing to meet over
a coffee, lunch time, or evening discussion then let me know and I will try to
include you in my cross country schedule.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading...
especially if you made it this far... and I hope you will be able to help in
the writing of this book either through your sponsorship, or through your
support in any other ways!!</p>

</div></div>","We are seeking funding to complete InsightSTEM's project to write the ""Five Pillars of Family Science"" book, and get it to publication! This book, authored by InsightSTEM President, Dr Jake Noel-Storr, will encourage and enable parents and guardians to bring genuine science exploration to their whole family.
In the Beginning...
From the moment we
open our eyes, we begin to explore our world. Through our youth this curiosity
grows with the guidance of parents, siblings, and loved ones. Richard Feynman,
a Nobel Prize winning physicist and popularizer of science, once reminisced
about his father’s role in fueling his passion for science:
 “A thing that was very important about
my father was not the facts but the process. How we find out…that’s the kind of
guy he was. I don’t think he ever successfully went to college. However, he did
teach himself a great deal. He read a lot. He liked the rational mind, and
liked those things which could be understood by thinking. So it’s not hard to
understand I got interested in science”
His father’s
fascination with the universe directly fueled Feynman’s curiosity – developing
one of the world’s greatest physicists to have ever lived. Families Matter.


Columbia University Obervatory... where I began my work in Family Science
Hi, I am Dr Jake Noel-Storr, President of InsightSTEM. 
As an astrophysics PhD
student in New York City over 15 years ago, I began working on Family Science
programs to help families engage and share in the excitement that I have for
exploring science knowledge. But during these programs as I looked around the

family as a whole. Parents sat around at the back of the room drinking coffee,
chatting with each other, and generally not taking part in any of the learning
activities. Kids attending were all from families who regularly went to science
centers, planetariums, nature centers, and zoos. Often, their parents were STEM
professionals themselves. 
Though these events were great, and had
fantastic reviews, we added less value than we hoped, and families were missing
the opportunity to explore science together. Families exploring science together is
surely the point of family science... and I became really passionate about making that possible!
From that point on I
knew that things had to change -- and I worked hard to create programs that
engage the whole family, not just the kids; and programs that reached families
who weren't already a part of the STEM community. In the following 15 years I
have worked on programs across the USA in a wide variety of communities, and
with partners including parents, teachers, librarians, science centers,
museums, the Motorola Foundation, NASA, and the National Science
Foundation... all to realize my enthusiasm for families genuinely exploring and learning together, and to help them share and enjoy in that excitement. 
I have developed both passion and experience for what really works for families engaging in science
exploration together -- which I have honed down to what I call the Five Pillars
of Family Science.  These five pillars lay the foundation for parents to create
and enjoy truly great family learning experiences. As children spend most of
their time out of school, we must foster exploration outside the classroom to
create a more scientifically literate society. This book, The Five Pillars of Family Science will
give many more families the nudge, encouragement, support, and validation that
they want or need to engage in learning science together. 

The book will represent a

</div><p>Welcome to the
<a href=""http://www.thedinosource.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">THEDINOSOURCE</a> crowdfunding campaign! </p>
<p>My name is Antonio and
I am the main person behind this project. All too many of us know what 
it is
like watching a loved one slowly slip away. First forgetting the name of
 a
restaurant, then a favorite food, then eventually your name. Alzheimer’s
disease is a devastating reality that has touched so many of our lives, 
and there is still no cure. But what if there was a way to detect the 
disease before the usual symptoms presented, to be able to seek 
treatment earlier, and to give you more days, months, and years with the
 ones you love? There is. This is exactly what I have created. </p><h3><b>What We Do &amp; How We Do It<br/></b></h3><p>Here are <a href=""http://www.thedinosource.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">THEDINOSOURCE</a>,
 we are developing software that is able to deliver an early diagnosis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, by identifying which switches in a 
person's mind fail before others and do so with a higher degree of 
frequency. Given a preset switchboard, as the grammar of a language is 
known, the brain's deterioration can be identified and tracked through 
the close study of these linguistic switches. For example, a person may 
unknowingly begin referring to a certain item by the class it belongs 
to, rather than the name of the object itself. These types of recurring 
mistakes in the word retrieval process may go unnoticed, but through our
 research, may be the key to the early detection of a loved one's 
Alzheimer's disease. With your help, we can build the infrastructure 
needed to be able to pinpoint the elements that will help us provide you
 with an early diagnosis. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450465363/l8dxha8qfsy5y2nrpcfp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 634.816px; height: 1114px;""/></p><br/>At
 the same time we are caring for the elderly, we also are dedicated to 
ensuring the success of the next generation. By applying these same 
principles and technologies, we are developing software to help children
 complete their switchboard sooner and better. In analyzing their 
speech, we can identify the switches that haven't yet been setup. 
Through adaptive, educational games, we can help them overcome 
linguistic obstacles, and at the same time, provide a usable framework 
to examine children with speech impairments. Our hope is that this 
linguistic tool will support both of your child's short- and long-term 
language development.<p>Once
 all of our research is completed, we will share what we have developed 
with you free of charge, as we believe your health is a right and not a 
privilege. But it will not stop there. Our software will be like a 
language: a living organism, constantly evolving and expanding. We 
firmly believe that from the development of such complex analysis, it 
will be possible to learn more about how certain diseases influence the 
brain, which we hope brings the medical community one step closer to 
finding a cure. <br/></p><p></p><h3>Indiegogo Perks</h3><p>Before dwelling further into what pushed us to create thedinosource project, take a sneak peek at the amazing rewards you can get for helping us today.<br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""484"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fslideshow%2Fembed_code%2Fkey%2FfoCasDelsCrLgC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2FAntonioDeRinaldis%2Funtitled-presentation-56088394&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.slidesharecdn.com%2Fss_thumbnails%2Fa-3-05dcab84e040c9e4545001d66df94e1917f21702-151212235838-thumbnail-4.jpg%3Fcb%3D1449964822&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=slideshare"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>In order we have: Stickers, Mug, Water Bottle, Pocket Notebook, Cufflinks and Tiebar and the wonderful thedinosource.com T-Shirt.</p><p>Now, it's time to tell you why we do what we do.</p><h3><b>Our Motivation</b></h3><p></p><div>Dino
 Ariozzi was my grandfather, and as a child he was my best friend. We 
didn’t live close to each other, but every single time I’d feel sick, 
he’d just pack up his teal bag and hop on the train for the three hour 
ride to my town, rushing over to make sure I was taken care of while my 
parents were at work. I still remember him going to the newspaper stand 
almost every morning to get me a small coloring book to play with. I 
remember watching TV next to him on the couch of the small apartment 
where my family and I used to live. I remember strolling downtown with 
him, and either he had incredible eyesight or the best luck, because 
nearly every time, we would find one or two coins between the 
cobblestones. He would let me keep all of them, of course, though at 
times I wondered if he was the one dropping them in the first place. <br/><p></p>
<p>He
 was one of the kindest and most trustworthy people I have ever known. 
He worked as a carpenter most of his life, owning his own small 
business. After being a victim of fraud, he was forced to shut down 
his business and work until retirement to payback his debt to the state.
 Prior to this, he had also lost his son at the age of 7 to a 
particularly aggressive case of pneumonia. Despite all of this, he 
always had a passion for life and a smile on his face. He loved life and
 I loved him. </p>
<p>During the time I was in high 
school, my family started noticing that something wasn't right, 
something had changed. He was no longer himself. At times, he would 
struggle to talk or even recognize us. We finally got the diagnosis: 
Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
<p>I witnessed my best 
friend's mind slowly degenerate until he could no longer recognize me or
 knew what my name was. He spent the last year of his life in bed, at 
home, barely able to talk. On late night of July 29, 2011, after a six 
hour drive, we finally arrived at his house. Tired from the trip, I put 
my pajamas on, went to his room to say hi, and kissed him on his 
forehead. He was awake and, once again, I saw that huge smile that used 
to greet me as a child. </p>
<p>I awoke the next 
morning to loud, frantic commotion around the house. Grandpa suddenly 
stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived less than a minute later, trying 
to resuscitate him. It didn’t work. I was there, I saw the life fading 
from his eyes. As I kissed his forehead one last time before the

THEDINOSOURCE crowdfunding campaign! 
My name is Antonio and
I am the main person behind this project. All too many of us know what 
it is
like watching a loved one slowly slip away. First forgetting the name of
 a
restaurant, then a favorite food, then eventually your name. Alzheimer’s
disease is a devastating reality that has touched so many of our lives, 
and there is still no cure. But what if there was a way to detect the 
disease before the usual symptoms presented, to be able to seek 
treatment earlier, and to give you more days, months, and years with the
 ones you love? There is. This is exactly what I have created. What We Do & How We Do ItHere are THEDINOSOURCE,
 we are developing software that is able to deliver an early diagnosis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, by identifying which switches in a 
person's mind fail before others and do so with a higher degree of 
frequency. Given a preset switchboard, as the grammar of a language is 
known, the brain's deterioration can be identified and tracked through 
the close study of these linguistic switches. For example, a person may 
unknowingly begin referring to a certain item by the class it belongs 
to, rather than the name of the object itself. These types of recurring 
mistakes in the word retrieval process may go unnoticed, but through our
 research, may be the key to the early detection of a loved one's 
Alzheimer's disease. With your help, we can build the infrastructure 
needed to be able to pinpoint the elements that will help us provide you
 with an early diagnosis. At
 the same time we are caring for the elderly, we also are dedicated to 
ensuring the success of the next generation. By applying these same 
principles and technologies, we are developing software to help children
 complete their switchboard sooner and better. In analyzing their 
speech, we can identify the switches that haven't yet been setup. 
Through adaptive, educational games, we can help them overcome 
linguistic obstacles, and at the same time, provide a usable framework 
to examine children with speech impairments. Our hope is that this 
linguistic tool will support both of your child's short- and long-term 
language development.Once
 all of our research is completed, we will share what we have developed 
with you free of charge, as we believe your health is a right and not a 
privilege. But it will not stop there. Our software will be like a 
language: a living organism, constantly evolving and expanding. We 
firmly believe that from the development of such complex analysis, it 
will be possible to learn more about how certain diseases influence the 
brain, which we hope brings the medical community one step closer to 
finding a cure.

 Ariozzi was my grandfather, and as a child he was my best friend. We 
didn’t live close to each other, but every single time I’d feel sick, 
he’d just pack up his teal bag and hop on the train for the three hour 
ride to my town, rushing over to make sure I was taken care of while my 
parents were at work. I still remember him going to the newspaper stand 
almost every morning to get me a small coloring book to play with. I 
remember watching TV next to him on the couch of the small apartment 
where my family and I used to live. I remember strolling downtown with 
him, and either he had incredible eyesight or the best luck, because 
nearly every time, we would find one or two coins between the 
cobblestones. He would let me keep all of them, of course, though at 
times I wondered if he was the one dropping them in the first place. 
He
 was one of the kindest and most trustworthy people I have ever known. 
He worked as a carpenter most of his life, owning his own small 
business. After being a victim of fraud, he was forced to shut down 
his business and work until retirement to payback his debt to the state.
 Prior to this, he had also lost his son at the age of 7 to a 
particularly aggressive case of pneumonia. Despite all of this, he 
always had a passion for life and a smile on his face. He loved life and
 I loved him. 
During the time I was in high 
school, my family started noticing that something wasn't right, 
something had changed. He was no longer himself. At times, he would 
struggle to talk or even recognize us. We finally got the diagnosis: 
Alzheimer’s disease. 
I witnessed my best 
friend's mind slowly degenerate until he could no longer recognize me or
 knew what my name was. He spent the last year of his life in bed, at 
home, barely able to talk. On late night of July 29, 2011, after a six 
hour drive, we finally arrived at his house. Tired from the trip, I put 
my pajamas on, went to his room to say hi, and kissed him on his 
forehead. He was awake and, once again, I saw that huge smile that used 
to greet me as a child. 
I awoke the next 
morning to loud, frantic commotion around the house. Grandpa suddenly 
stopped breathing. Paramedics arrived less than a minute later, trying 
to resuscitate him. It didn’t work. I was there, I saw the life fading 
from his eyes. As I kissed his forehead one last time before the 
funeral, I promised him that I’d do everything I can to avoid other 
people having to see the ones they love slowly slip away, incapable of 
recognizing the very people they used to care for and share their life 
with.

<p>Forthcoming 2016 by Mago Books</p>
<p>This book aims to introduce the long-forbidden epic
of the Great Goddess, the <i>Budoji</i>
(Epic of the Emblem City), which secretly survived throughout history and
recently revived in modern Korea. Epitomized as ""Return to the Origin of
the Great Goddess/Mago,"" the <i>Budoji</i>,
the principal text of Magoism, guides the reader to the primordial
consciousness of the Creatrix through the story of the cosmogonic origin
and the vicissitudes of the Mago Clan on planet Earth. Dr. Hwang's photo essays
open the door to the ancient understanding of Mago Pilgrimage, as known
and transmitted to pre-patriarchal Korean ancestors; the journey to ONESELF
in which one encounters the Story of the Creatrix. <a href=""https://magobooks.com/2015/12/23/mago-pilgrimage-vol-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>See more info here.</span></a></p>

Korean-born and bred feminist and discover the female principle of ultimate

“The Mago Work is committed to the collective
cultivation of the consciousness of WE in S/HE, the Great Goddess/Mago, through
publication, self-education, and networking conducted by volunteers. In
the process, we become whole in our body, mind, and spirit, regaining nature’s
power of self-evolution in ourselves. We know deep down that the gynocentric
force of Life is leading the Way. That is the Source of our love, creativity,
and compassion."" Helen Hye-Sook Hwang, Ph.D., Founding Director of The
Mago Work
The Mago Work is a natural outgrowth of Dr. Helen
Hye-Sook Hwang's life-long soul-seeking research on the Great Goddess, Mago. Since
2010, The Mago Work has grown steadily and expanded internationally. For
example, our readership of the Return to Mago E-Magazine comes from as many as
150 countries around the world. The Facebook Group The Mago Circle has 1,181
members, and is growing steadily. The volume She Rises: Why Goddess Feminism, Activism and Spirituality? was
published in 2015. Mago Academy continues to offer online classes and Mago
Pilgrimage to Korea. In 2016 we are entering a critical time to actualize the
potentiality of The Mago Work, while continuing to lay a solid foundation,
i.e., to produce and distribute the following three books (all in three
versions: color printed book, black/white printed book, and E-book). Mago
Work volunteers toil to build the wheel in which people can nurture, heal, and
empower the self, communities, and the eco-system, both alone and collectively.
Project 1
She Rises: How… Goddess Feminism, Activism, and Spirituality? Volume 2 

Co-editors: Helen Hye-Sook Hwang, Mary Ann Beavis,
and Nicole Shaw
Planning Committee: Trista Hendren and Rosemary
Mattingley
Forthcoming 2016 by Mago Books
The collective writing of She Rises Volume 2 calls for awakening, collaboration, and
transformation of individuals, communities, and cultures by answering the
question, ""How (one lives out one's commitment to) Goddess Feminism,
Activism, and Spirituality."" See Call for Contributions here. Building
on the predecessor anthology, She Rises:
Why Goddess Feminism, Activism, and Spirituality (Volume 1) in which the
answers of 92 well-known and new authors and artists were interwoven, She Rises Volume 2 anticipates opening
another new horizon to nurture, heal, and bond contributors and readers in the
consciousness of the Primordial Mother. Like She Rises Volume 1, we expect a larger number of creative
minds/hearts/spirits from around the world to contribute as authors. It will be
distributed to an international audience.

Project 2 

Seasons of the Goddess: Solstices & EquinoxesCo-editors: Helen Hye-Sook Hwang and Mary Ann
Beavis
Forthcoming November 1, 2016 by Mago Books
This anthology project aims at a multi-faceted
purpose for readers: educational, reconstructive, and practical. It intends
to restore and celebrate the old indigenous ways of celebrating seasonal marks
from around the world, while undercutting the entrenched dynamics of
patriarchal seasonal customs. See Call for Contributions here. This
is a timely work that will provide readers with new lenses for understanding
the origins of patriarchal celebrations and how the latter have co-opted the
old ways of Goddess cultures.  

Project 3

Mago Pilgrimage: Journey to the Primordial Home via Magoist Epic Narratives and Photo Essays (Volume 1)Author: Helen Hye-Sook Hwang
Forthcoming 2016 by Mago Books
This book aims to introduce the long-forbidden epic
of the Great Goddess, the Budoji
(Epic of the Emblem City), which secretly survived throughout history and
recently revived in modern Korea. Epitomized as ""Return to the Origin of
the Great Goddess/Mago,"" the Budoji,
the principal text of Magoism, guides the reader to the primordial
consciousness of the Creatrix through the story of the cosmogonic origin
and the vicissitudes of the Mago Clan on planet Earth. Dr. Hwang's photo essays
open the door to the ancient understanding of Mago Pilgrimage, as known
and transmitted to pre-patriarchal Korean ancestors; the journey to ONESELF
in which one encounters the Story of the Creatrix. See more info here.

What Co-Editors and the Planning Committee Do
Co-editors: Review and selection, copy-editing and
proofreading, communication with contributors, solicitation of contributions,
formatting (book-making), cover-designs, structuring book contents, making the
list of Table of Contents, and writing Introductions and the list of
Contributors
Planning Committee: Promotion, networking, writing
Introductions
Publisher: Printing and shipping books in and from
Korea to the U.S. and possibly elsewhere

Meet the Co-Editors and the Planning Committee
Helen Hye-Sook Hwang, Ph.D.     


My encounter with the Great Goddess known as Mago
in East Asia during my graduate studies marked the point where my consciousness
began to focus in the S/HE reality. Through my study of the Great Goddess, I
was able to affirm my cultural/historical/spiritual/ontological identity as a
Korean-born and bred feminist and discover the female principle of ultimate
reality (the Creatrix). For the last sixteen years, I have researched, written,
published, and advocated Magoism. Knowing of the Great Goddess is self-transcendental
to me; it reaches out to the world/cosmos.
Helen Hye-Sook Hwang, Ph.D. is a scholar,
activist, and advocate of Magoism, the anciently originated tradition that
venerates Mago as the Great Goddess. She earned her MA and Ph.D. in Religion with
emphasis on Feminist Studies from Claremont Graduate University, CA. She also
studied toward an MA degree in East Asian Studies at UCLA, CA. Hwang has taught
for universities in California and Missouri, U.S.A. Since 2012, Dr, Hwang
has founded, directed, co-edited, written for the Return to Mago E-Magazine (http://magoism.net), Mago Academy (http://magoacademy.org),
and Mago Books (http://magobook.com). She has co-edited and published She Rises: Why Goddess Feminism, Activism, and Spirituality? Volume 1 (Mago Books, 2015), and authored The Mago Way: Re-discovering Mago, the Great Goddess from East Asia (Mago Books, 2015). For more, see here.

Mary Ann Beavis, Ph.D.



Mary Ann Beavis (Ph.D., Cambridge University) is
Professor of Religion and Culture at St. Thomas More College, the University of
Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Canada). Her areas of specialization include Christian
Origins, Feminist Biblical Interpretation, and Women and Religion. 
The courses she teaches include “Goddesses in Myth
and History,” and her recently published research project, funded by the Social
Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada, is a study of women who blend
Goddess Spirituality and Christianity. Her book is entitled Christian Goddess Spirituality: Enchanting
Christianity (New York: Routledge, 2015) https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138936881. She is the author of many peer-reviewed articles, five of which
reflect her current interest in the Mary Magdalene/Mary of Bethany
tradition. For more, see here.

Nicole Shaw



My life purpose is creating deeper awareness. This
is what motivates me and is the thread that weaves through my artwork, writing,
activism, organic farming, advocating for local food production, founding
groups and organizations (such as the Bowen Road Farmers' Market and Nanaimo
WomanShare), and living as lightly and as sustainably as I can on the earth.

·  Board member of the Coombs Farmers'
Institute

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Harnessing young talents</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><i>While working on a platform for creative kids, I came across an 8 year old boy who was pretty good in comic writing and drawing but was discouraged by his guardians who told him that such skills can not be a used as a source of income in a third world economy and he should look into professions like medicine and law. In Africa for example, this is a common trend. Everyone wants the child to be a Doctor or a Lawyer. The problem is, the unemployment rates are so high due to lack of jobs, poor educational facilities and quality of education and undecided young minds. I counselled the boy and he realised that every talent and hobby can indeed become a source of income and even create more jobs. This was an awesome moment for me as he got inspired to know more and work on improving his skills. This is the driving force behind StackHill, a skill-based learning academy to help kids harness their talents.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nancy Udosen</p>
<p>Founder of StackHill</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Introducing StackHill</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>StackHill is a skill-based learning academy that concentrates on developing and applying specific skills for kids. StackHill provides a platform for kids to discover and harness their talents. In a continent like Africa, where unemployment rates are soaring, every child should have the opportunity to harness a talent early on to enable him/her earn a good living. StackHill focuses on children (5-18 years) and aims to develop their skills into profit making careers through skill-based training by qualified counsellors and tutors.<br/></p><p></p>
<p>Unlike traditional offline vocational centres and traditional e-learning platforms, StackHill will be offering both online and offline platforms with the following courses for a start;</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Fashion Designing for Kids - </b>Fashion design would always captivate kids especially little girls with Barbie dolls. From learning digital illustrations and design techniques to creating their own fashion collection. This course will help the kid harness that talent.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Photography for Kids - </b>Kids are intrigued by pictures and It's never too early to teach your kids about photography. Kids learn to predict outcomes and with a digital camera, the results are close to instant.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Painting for Kids - </b>Kids who paint learn to think with an open mind, to look at situations creatively. They learn to express themselves more deeply through their art and their words. Picasso in the making?.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Computer Programming for Kids - </b>Learning to code with StackHill is engaging and fun. Kids rapidly learn fundamental programming concepts as they animate characters, control robots and publish apps</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why StackHill needs your help</h3>
<p>We can achieve a great thing by helping African kids take charge of their lives by discovering and harnessing their talents. In order to launch, StackHill needs the following;</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A centre to start operations of the StackHill academy</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Skill-based training materials like cameras, laptops, sewing machines etc.</span><br/></b></li>

</div>","Harnessing young talents

While working on a platform for creative kids, I came across an 8 year old boy who was pretty good in comic writing and drawing but was discouraged by his guardians who told him that such skills can not be a used as a source of income in a third world economy and he should look into professions like medicine and law. In Africa for example, this is a common trend. Everyone wants the child to be a Doctor or a Lawyer. The problem is, the unemployment rates are so high due to lack of jobs, poor educational facilities and quality of education and undecided young minds. I counselled the boy and he realised that every talent and hobby can indeed become a source of income and even create more jobs. This was an awesome moment for me as he got inspired to know more and work on improving his skills. This is the driving force behind StackHill, a skill-based learning academy to help kids harness their talents.

Nancy Udosen
Founder of StackHill


Introducing StackHill

StackHill is a skill-based learning academy that concentrates on developing and applying specific skills for kids. StackHill provides a platform for kids to discover and harness their talents. In a continent like Africa, where unemployment rates are soaring, every child should have the opportunity to harness a talent early on to enable him/her earn a good living. StackHill focuses on children (5-18 years) and aims to develop their skills into profit making careers through skill-based training by qualified counsellors and tutors.
Unlike traditional offline vocational centres and traditional e-learning platforms, StackHill will be offering both online and offline platforms with the following courses for a start;


Fashion Designing for Kids - Fashion design would always captivate kids especially little girls with Barbie dolls. From learning digital illustrations and design techniques to creating their own fashion collection. This course will help the kid harness that talent.

Photography for Kids - Kids are intrigued by pictures and It's never too early to teach your kids about photography. Kids learn to predict outcomes and with a digital camera, the results are close to instant.


Painting for Kids - Kids who paint learn to think with an open mind, to look at situations creatively. They learn to express themselves more deeply through their art and their words. Picasso in the making?.


Computer Programming for Kids - Learning to code with StackHill is engaging and fun. Kids rapidly learn fundamental programming concepts as they animate characters, control robots and publish apps




Why StackHill needs your help
We can achieve a great thing by helping African kids take charge of their lives by discovering and harnessing their talents. In order to launch, StackHill needs the following;


A centre to start operations of the StackHill academy
Skill-based training materials like cameras, laptops, sewing machines etc.
Online web and mobile apps to serve children remotely through curated video content.

StackHill will need an estimated initial funding of $30,000 to launch.
Money raised will go into securing an apartment to house the academy, purchasing training materials and equipments, company registration and legal fees and development costs for the online StackHill web and mobile apps.
The StackHill Indiegogo campaign is a flexible one, if we don't reach our goal, the funding raised will go into developing an online platform only. 
The ULTIMATE GOAL of StackHill is to create an avenue to tackle the problem of unemployment on the long run.


What are the perks?
As a way of saying thank you. We will be offering a number of perks. We will be offering full-year subscriptions to kids based on your perks. These perks are;





A Digital Thank You card 
A StackHill T-Shirt
StackHill Branded Inspire Mug
StackHill Branded Nike Performance Backpack
A Hangout with the Founder

However, when I asked her what she would do if she had the power to change
something in her village, she had a clear answer: build a hospital, because
there is no medical center in her community.

That’s the reason why I decided to found EMPASI, so youths like Ana can enjoy their full rights and opportunities for development.

While each and every one of us has inner
potential, around the world opportunities do not flow so equally. Many youths
growing up in orphanages in Eastern Europe are deprived of quality education,
have few chances to discover their talents, and are at big risk of poverty and
social exclusion as life in an orphanage doesn’t prepare them for the outside

antisocial behaviors. These
youths don’t get the chance to play an active role in their community and are
more likely to be dependent on state for their entire life.
 However, we can
change that! We believe that every young person can become an active

As you know, starting non-profits face many

The Project's Impact
 
By participating in our programs, youths will develop

<p>College is <i>expensive</i>! Most four-year universities cost between $20,000-$60,000 per year. Most parents assume their child will receive their degree in four years, but currently over 55% of all students take longer- the average being five and a half years. This translates into a “four-year degree” costing $110,000-$330,000. This is before grad school, med school, or other extended college degrees! But it doesn’t have to cost that much.</p>
<p>I have worked with thousands of students and their families, and I am shocked at how few have any idea of how much control they can have over the cost of their education. Even worse, I see parents taking on a huge amount of debt when they easily could have saved themselves 20-60% of that debt.</p>
<p>The number one indicator of scholarships is the student’s GPA, and yet most students treat B’s as though it is a “good” grade. Few, if any, schools offer scholarship money for a 3.0 GPA. And parents- do not make the mistake most do. A B in Honors or AP classes is NOT the same as an A! Miami University of Ohio does a great job at being transparent about the fact they only look at unweighted GPA’s. Many schools are not as transparent as Miami and give families a false sense of where their child really stands.</p>
<p>So, how do <strong>you</strong> save thousands of dollars on college?</p>
<p>There are several painless things you can do, but the first is to help your child achieve A’s. This does <i>not</i> involve putting pressure on them. It involves giving them the tools to succeed and investing in their success long before college. Most students will tell you that no one has ever taught them how to study. They have never been guided on creating the best study habits, instructed on how to study, what to study, or when to study. Many schools also no longer issue students their own text book to take home, so how would they ever know if there is valuable information to be gained from the book? Maybe you have a straight-A student, but they put so much pressure on themselves, you would like to see them enjoy high school a little more. Again, the proper tool can eliminate their stress and help them become a well-rounded student.</p>
<p>I believe the proper tool is the difference between digging a ditch with a spoon and digging with a backhoe. Sure, you might get the same result using a spoon, but why put in more work than you need to when a backhoe is much more efficient?</p>
<p>The idea behind the <strong>168 Planner Ultimate Success Planner</strong> is to provide the student with the right instruments and the instructions to achieve their best grades without the stress or spending a ridiculous amount of time on trying to achieve that A. The 168 study system and planner is that tool. It is filled with study tips based on scientific research and tested over the past year with clients of College Recruiting Specialists. The 168 not only provides insight on <i>how</i> to study but also <i>what </i>to study, and most importantly, a time management system to define <strong><i>when</i></strong> to study.</p>
<p>College Recruiting Specialists has tested this system with high school and college students with amazing results: our students took control over their time and homework allowing them to improve grades, lower stress levels, and ultimately lower the cost of their future education. To make The 168 even more user-friendly, we have an instructional video on YouTube so students can reference it at any time to ensure they are using the planner to its full potential.</p>
<p>There are only 168 hours in the week- let's make sure that your child puts them to good use.</p>

Levi was the patriarch Jacob’s third son, and Aaron was a fourth generation descendant of Levi. Aaron and his four sons were designated as the first priests; Aaron served as the first High Priest. As the verses indicate, all of his male descendants were chosen by G-d to be priests forever; it is an eternal covenant. Thus even today, a kohen among the Jewish people is genealogically a direct descendant of Aaron. In our time, new advances in science and medicine have established the identity of the descendants of Aaron beyond any doubt, through DNA. </p><p><b>The Role of the Kohanim in the Holy Temple</b></p><p>G-d chose these men to be in a position of spiritual leadership. They are responsible for the sacred service in the Holy Temple  -- and in general they are responsible for our spiritual welfare. The Hebrew word <i>kohen</i> actually means ‘to serve,’ and a deeper linguistic connection can be found in the word <i>ken</i>, meaning ‘yes,'  itself related to the word <i>kivun</i>,‘to direct.’ Thus a kohen is called upon to direct in the proper service of G-d: ""And you, separate your brother Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, and bring them close to you... so they can serve me"" (Ex. 28:1).</p><p><b>A Conduit for Divine Blessing</b></p><p>In attending to the various aspects of the Divine service, the kohanim serve as a conduit to bring G-d's radiant blessing into this world. It is on this account that they are commanded to deliver G-d's blessing of peace and love to the people, as well: ""Say to Aaron and his sons... Thus shall you bless the people of Israel: 'May the L-rd bless you and protect you. May the L-rd shine His face upon you, and be gracious unto you. May the L-rd lift up His face to you and may He grant you peace' "" (Numbers 6:22 - 26).</p><p>The kohanim represent the attribute of kindness, and the focusing of life's energies on sanctity and Divine purpose. It was the attribute of kindness, understanding and love for all which Aaron, the first Kohen Gadol - High Priest, was best known for, and his descendants are entrusted to exemplify Hillel's famous dictum in the Chapters of the Fathers (Avot 1:12): ""Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving your fellow-creatures, and drawing them near to the Torah.""  </p><p>The daily blessing of the kohanim in the Temple serves to open the Heavenly gates of mercy. Through it, the people of Israel and the entire world merit not only material well-being - including offspring and longevity - but spiritual blessings as well; mercy, Divine protection and the greatest blessing of all... true peace. Since the kohanim represent the attribute of kindness,  G-d channels His blessing through their service in the Holy Temple. </p><p><b>Myth and Fact</b></p><p><b>Myths:</b></p><p></p><ul>

<p>We expect a record number of voters in this year's elections in Kansas. Help us reach as many of them as we can with the message that a well-funded, inclusive system of public education is critical to the future of Kansas and Kansas children.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>We are the MainStream Coalition, a political advocacy group in Kansas that fights for moderate values. Founded in 1993, we spent more than twenty years fighting for strong public schools, reasonable fiscal policies, and good government. Our members are Republican and Democrat and Independent, and they know that to take Kansas back from Brownback and the extremists, we need to do more than just vote.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>Won't you help?</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need money to fund postcards supporting public education. $5,000 is enough to send 10,000 postcards, enough to cover targeted households in one Kansas House district. In 2014, we sent thousands of postcards, so we know how to do this.</p>
<p>If we go over $5,000, we'll target households in another House district, Then another. There are 125 House districts in Kansas, so your donation won't go unused!</p>
<p>If we don't reach $5,000, we will still send postcards out, just not as many. But every vote adds up, and every voter counts.</p>
<p>What do you get? The glow of having made a difference? While a new direction in Kansas would be a gift we'd all accept, we do have some items to give out as thanks for your contribution, and some amazing opportunities to really get involved.</p>
<p><b>$1</b> will fund two postcards, and gets you our popular weekly email. We send just one a week, with a unique article on Kansas politics, a calendar of events you might love, and the latest political news from the legislature and the state.</p>
<p><b>$10</b> will send out twenty postcards, and you will get our newsletter and a coaster that says ""Restore Sanity to Kansas.""</p>
<p><b>$20</b> will send forty postcards, gets you our newsletter, and one of our bumper stickers: ""If you didn't vote, this is all your fault.""</p>
<p><b>$35</b> will let us send seventy postcards, gets you the newsletter, a bumper sticker and an individual membership to the MainStream Coalition.</p>
<p><b>$100</b> lets us send out two hundred postcards, and you'll get all the above swag, plus one of our new t-shirts: ""Be a voter,"" on the front, and ""Do more than vote,"" on the back.</p>
<p>The next levels are special opportunities to meet and get intimately connected to the world of Kansas politics.</p>
<p><b>$500</b>, besides letting us reach one thousand voters, will get you everything you've seen so far, as well as a unique opportunity to sit down for coffee or drinks with our Executive Director. If you're interested in just what is going on in Kansas politics, you won't find a better opportunity.</p>
<p><b>$1,000</b> will send two thousand postcards, and along with all the items above—the newsletter, the bumper sticker, the coaster, the membership, and the shirt—but also two invites to our annual Patron's cocktail party. Meet and greet some of the key elected leaders and most dedicated supporters of moderate values in the area, at a catered party in a private home.</p>
<p><b>$5,000</b> will allows us to reach an entire House district. In addition to all the swag above, you will receive two invites to a private dinner with our Executive Director and a moderate legislative leader. You won't find a more exclusive opportunity to really get involved.</p>
<p>Finally, a <b>$10,000</b> donation will let us reach two entire House districts, will net you all the swag above, and we will host a private event at your home for up to twenty of your friends, with a moderate legislative leader. We will provide drinks and hors d'oeuvres.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This election year, voters will be hearing from all sides, including from the extremists about how they purportedly support public education. Voters deserve to hear the truth about what it takes to support public education, what votes were taken over the past years both for and against public education, and who supports what positions on the issue.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>We have a track record in 2014 of sending out postcards and influencing races. In the races where MainStream worked in 2014, all moderate seats from both parties were retained, and one more was added to the list of reasonable legislators.</p>
<p>This year, we are attacking this election from several fronts. We are managing an extensive get out the vote effort, and our PAC is working to directly contribute to candidates. With these postcards, we are doing the hard but necessary work of educating voters about public education and the candidates racing to represent them.</p>
<p>Every vote counts. Every postcard helps.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Every donation will go towards postcards. While there are some economies of scale, postcards can be printed and mailed for roughly $0.50 each. We already have relationships with printers and distributors. We are knowledgeable about the issues, and have years of political savvy to call on with our staff and Board. We have every expectation that postcards will be delivered, and will have an impact.</p>
<p>That said, we cannot guarantee the outcome of the election, despite our best efforts and your generous contributions. Postcards are one step. Do consider doing more, more than this, more than voting. Get informed, get involved, and make a difference.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't contribute a postcard or two to this effort, you can still help us raise the importance of public education with Kansas voters.
