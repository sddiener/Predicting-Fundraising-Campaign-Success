</h3>
<p>Emma's Parlor got into the NOLA Fringe!!! You can help us get there by contributing here, or by attending one of our fundraising performances in Philadelphia.<br/></p>
<p> Emma's Parlor is inspired by Howard Zinn's play about the life and times of Emma Goldman. Our adaptation is a parlor ""trick"" or paper theater performance that begins with Emma's emigration to the U.S. in 1885 and moves through her life as a factory worker, anarchist, and lecturer. Our toy theater and puppets employ illustrations from the late 19th and early 20th century. We also use everyday objects one might find in a parlor, of that same period as playing spaces. A phonograph becomes a cafe filled with anarchists, a birdcage becomes a prison, and a laundry wringer becomes a ... (well we must preserve some of the mystery). We are proud to quote Philadelphia City Paper in saying this show ""embodies the notion of innovation in performance."" <br/></p>
<p>Lorna and Martina are delighted to have Emma's Parlor be one of 24 shows selected to perform at the New Orleans (NOLA) Fringe Festival 2013. Their paths have crossed many times in Philadelphia theater and puppet slams. Emma's Parlor marks their first full collaboration. Lorna comes from a background in theater and 12 years as a resident puppeteer at center for Puppetry Arts in Atlants, GA. Martina started a career as an architect then in 2003 took the exit for puppetry as a designer/builder at Mum Puppettheater in Philadelphia. <br/></p>
<p>Since taking Emma's Parlor on tour to The 10th International Toy Theater Festival at St. Ann's Warehouse this June, Lorna and Martina have been commissioned to create an entirely new piece ""Loudoun Abbey"" by Stenton Museum with PEW funding.</p>

<h3>A little about toy theater</h3>
<p>Toy theater, also called paper theater and model theater, is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 1800s in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on paperboard sheets and sold as kits at the concession stand of an opera house, playhouse, or vaudeville theater. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards realism on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again with the arrival of television after World War II. Toy-theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many puppeteers, authors and filmmakers and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.<br/> <br/>Mass produced toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the proscenium, scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin cardboard, cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.<br/></p>

<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>Join over a hundred Bay Area writers, directors, actors, and fine artists to become a part of one of San Francisco's most exciting new theater festivals!  </em></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The San Francisco Olympians Festival is an annual event that lasts for twelve nights (thirteen, if you count our opening party!) with a focus on the creation of new scripts for the theater in addition to providing a showcase for Bay Area fine artists, actors and writers.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Festival was started in 2010 by Stuart Bousel, and featured 12 new full length plays, each one based on one of the twelve Olympian gods of Ancient Greece. In 2011 the festival returned with 32 plays, ranging from five minute shorts to full lengths, each one based upon an Ancient Greek sky god or mythical figure who had become a constellation, moon, etc. In 2012 we debuted 25 one acts, each night pitting a play about an Olympian god against a play about a Titan, the race of gods who sired the Olympian gods, and were then overthrown by them. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This year we are excited to premiere 36 new plays by 30 local writers- 16 of whom will be contributing work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one acts to full lengths, and each one explores a different aspect of the Trojan War, the apocalypse of Ancient Greece. It will play 12 nights, November 6-23, at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco, and if previous years are indicative of a trend, (every year we've broken our own records), we expect this to be the largest festival yet in terms of participants and audience!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong> Why do you need so much money?</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Well, a bigger festival requires a bigger base of support and this year we're looking to raise $10,000- a really big number! Why so much? Well...</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">40% of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! The rest of the money we raise is split two ways...</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">The first half goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"">The second half goes towards achieving this year's lofty goal of paying everyone who works on the festival a stipend of some kind. In previous years actors and writers were paid, and we held raffles to raise some funds for the artists, but our entire production team and crew, including our box office manager and all of our directors, were volunteers. This year we'd like to change that by creating enough funds to offer everyone a small thank you for the hours, days and weeks they'll put into this project. If we meet our goal, we'll be able to do this, and maybe even have enough left over to put some money away for next year- something else we've never been able to do before!</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Most importantly, if we manage to raise all of our funds, we'll be able to keep our ticket price (which is only $10) low, ensuring that the wide variety of audiences looking to experience these new works can do so affordably.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Okay, but why should I support you? </strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">When you support this festival, you're not just supporting the 30 writers whose work will be presented this year, but also the 80+ actors we predict this festival will use (last year we hit 91- a new record for us!), a dozen directors and a dozen fine artists, the staff of the festival and the theater where we work, the theater itself, the neighborhood it is located in, and the cultural life of the city that is our home. Events like the San Francisco Olympians Festival are part of what make the Bay Area a unique and inspiring place to be, a leader in the arts and a center for intellectual experiment and advancement.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But our impact is not just local- it's national. The San Francisco Olympians Festival has been quickly gaining momentum since its first year, with six plays that were first given a public reading in the festival having gone on to full productions: 2010’s <em style="""">Hermes </em>(No Nude Men Productions, Dramaworks, Bread and Water Theatre)<em style="""">, Juno En Victoria </em>(Wily West Productions), and <em style="""">Salty Towers </em>(Thunderbird Theater Company); 2011’s <em style="""">Cassiopeia </em>(Eat Street Players)<em style="""">, Chronus </em>(Bread and Water Theatre), and<em style=""""> You’re Gonna Bleed</em> (DivaFest). Many others have received additional readings on local and national stages: 2011’s <em style="""">Joe Ryan</em> (Impact Theatre), <em style="""">Pleiades </em>(Atlantic Stage) and <em style="""">Selene, or Someone Like The Moon</em> (Exit Theatre); 2012’s <em style="""">Caenis and Poseidon</em> (Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco). Additionally, Exit Press has released a collection of five plays from year one of the festival, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Songs of Hestia</span>, now available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. So when you support our festival you're also supporting American Theater, Literature and Art and adding to the cultural heritage of generations of artists and audience yet to come.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank you for giving whatever you can give, for passing this campaign on to others you know who may want to support us, and for helping this festival continue to grow and make the world a better place through art!</p>

</div></div>","Join over a hundred Bay Area writers, directors, actors, and fine artists to become a part of one of San Francisco's most exciting new theater festivals!  
Who are you?
The San Francisco Olympians Festival is an annual event that lasts for twelve nights (thirteen, if you count our opening party!) with a focus on the creation of new scripts for the theater in addition to providing a showcase for Bay Area fine artists, actors and writers.
The Festival was started in 2010 by Stuart Bousel, and featured 12 new full length plays, each one based on one of the twelve Olympian gods of Ancient Greece. In 2011 the festival returned with 32 plays, ranging from five minute shorts to full lengths, each one based upon an Ancient Greek sky god or mythical figure who had become a constellation, moon, etc. In 2012 we debuted 25 one acts, each night pitting a play about an Olympian god against a play about a Titan, the race of gods who sired the Olympian gods, and were then overthrown by them. 
This year we are excited to premiere 36 new plays by 30 local writers- 16 of whom will be contributing work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one acts to full lengths, and each one explores a different aspect of the Trojan War, the apocalypse of Ancient Greece. It will play 12 nights, November 6-23, at the Exit Theatre in San Francisco, and if previous years are indicative of a trend, (every year we've broken our own records), we expect this to be the largest festival yet in terms of participants and audience!
 Why do you need so much money?
Well, a bigger festival requires a bigger base of support and this year we're looking to raise $10,000- a really big number! Why so much? Well...

40% of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! The rest of the money we raise is split two ways...
The first half goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.
The second half goes towards achieving this year's lofty goal of paying everyone who works on the festival a stipend of some kind. In previous years actors and writers were paid, and we held raffles to raise some funds for the artists, but our entire production team and crew, including our box office manager and all of our directors, were volunteers. This year we'd like to change that by creating enough funds to offer everyone a small thank you for the hours, days and weeks they'll put into this project. If we meet our goal, we'll be able to do this, and maybe even have enough left over to put some money away for next year- something else we've never been able to do before!

Most importantly, if we manage to raise all of our funds, we'll be able to keep our ticket price (which is only $10) low, ensuring that the wide variety of audiences looking to experience these new works can do so affordably.
Okay, but why should I support you? 
When you support this festival, you're not just supporting the 30 writers whose work will be presented this year, but also the 80+ actors we predict this festival will use (last year we hit 91- a new record for us!), a dozen directors and a dozen fine artists, the staff of the festival and the theater where we work, the theater itself, the neighborhood it is located in, and the cultural life of the city that is our home. Events like the San Francisco Olympians Festival are part of what make the Bay Area a unique and inspiring place to be, a leader in the arts and a center for intellectual experiment and advancement.
But our impact is not just local- it's national. The San Francisco Olympians Festival has been quickly gaining momentum since its first year, with six plays that were first given a public reading in the festival having gone on to full productions: 2010’s Hermes (No Nude Men Productions, Dramaworks, Bread and Water Theatre), Juno En Victoria (Wily West Productions), and Salty Towers (Thunderbird Theater Company); 2011’s Cassiopeia (Eat Street Players), Chronus (Bread and Water Theatre), and You’re Gonna Bleed (DivaFest). Many others have received additional readings on local and national stages: 2011’s Joe Ryan (Impact Theatre), Pleiades (Atlantic Stage) and Selene, or Someone Like The Moon (Exit Theatre); 2012’s Caenis and Poseidon (Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco). Additionally, Exit Press has released a collection of five plays from year one of the festival, Songs of Hestia, now available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. So when you support our festival you're also supporting American Theater, Literature and Art and adding to the cultural heritage of generations of artists and audience yet to come.
Thank you for giving whatever you can give, for passing this campaign on to others you know who may want to support us, and for helping this festival continue to grow and make the world a better place through art!

The greater Burlington area is in need of a space where the local belly dance community can come together for classes, workshops and performances.  My dream is to provide this space and reach out to the community to share this art form, providing inspiration and promoting self-confidence to students of all ages, shapes, sizes and experience. This space will also be open to teachers and students of other dance and movement art forms such as burlesque, poi, hooping, and stage combat.</p>
<p>We need about $15,000 for studio equipment and supplies to be relatively functional and provide a quality arts environment. Let’s face it, does the work ever really end? $15,000 is just the beginning! I have big dreams and I need your help to achieve them! The bulk of the money will be put towards a sound system, mirrors and lighting for the main dance studio and studio fit-up. We also need to make sure our legal ducks are in a row and that we have all of the necessary insurance and paperwork filled out. If we don’t reach our minimum goal, any money raised will still be put towards smaller but still necessary things, like chairs, paint or curtains. And any extra will be put in the bank and used towards obtaining decor, merchandise for sale and making things more comfortable in the future. Also, for bringing in special guest teachers!</p>
<p>And what do you get for helping me?</p>
<p>You get to be a part of this amazing journey that for me seemed to begin only yesterday. It all started when I was a shy, severely overweight, young woman in need of <em>something</em>. I attended a belly dance fitness class and I was hooked. I sought out class after class and saw my self-confidence rise and the weight drop. But those classes were hard to find. I want to make it easier for others to find classes and share the majesty of belly dance. I want to be able to offer more classes! (You also get some nice perks that you can find listed over on the right side of the page.)</p>
<p>If you can’t donate monetarily, please help by spreading the word! Share this campaign on Facebook or Twitter, talk about it with your friends, just get it out there! I can't make this happen without you! Thank you!</p></div>","Hello! My name is Aeshna Mairead and I’m the founder of Silk Lotus Dance.

<p>22.6 million people in the United States use illicit drugs.  It costs $400 billion a year in the United States alone.   Addiction kills 350 Americans a day.  And addicts are not the only one affected by their use.  Their family and friends are also impacted.  While there are apps on the market for people seeking recovery, there are none for their family and friends.  </p>
<p>My journey into the world of addiction began in 2010 when I realized my daughter was an Oxy addict.  I became aware of how it affects all classes and income levels.  Yet the stigma of addiction keeps most families quiet.  Surprisingly, when I mentioned my daughter’s issues to someone, more times than not, they also had someone involved in the struggle.  </p>
<p>There are 23.5 million people living in recovery. Take this number and multiply it by everyone caught up in the fight, not only the one working for recovery, but their extended family and friends and those trying to help them, then you begin to understand how immense is the population impacted.  Addiction has to be the leading cause for this decade.  Drastic improvement will occur over the next few years as there is more discussion, more openness, different treatment options, change in government policies, and better networks of those affected.</p>
<p>When I first was introduced to this world, my immediate concern was for quality treatment - what options were there and which were best for detox, residential treatment, sober living facilities, and intensive outpatient treatment. Initially, I wanted to help others by developing a referral system for treatment programs and the differences in them but I discovered there are so many and, instead of finding answers and support, there were only more questions and issues to explore.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>The app contains information about:</strong></strong></strong></p>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>The Education section will link the user to web pages with information on drugs and addiction.  Some of the many topics covered are overdoses, codependency and enabling, and financial help for intervention.  Parents who do not have children who are using drugs will be interested in the topics of Drug Information and Signs of Addiction.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Care</strong></p>
<p>The Self-Care page is split into four sections; financial, mental, physical, and spiritual self-care. The financial section will provide information on ??rehab treatment and health care, free programs. The mental section will have links to web pages focused on inspiration.  Gratitude Attitude, Inspirational Quotes, and Successful Recovery stories will all be included in the mental section of the Self-Care page. Hundreds of successful long term recovery stories are included in the app and social media to help reduce the stigma of addiction.</p>
<p>The physical self-care page will focus on the famly's physical care - web pages about Nutrition and Fitness are included as well as how to handle stress. The Spiritual self-care section will have links to Podcasts, online sermons and meditations.</p>
<p> <strong>Shop</strong></p>
<p>The shop section of our app will link the user to online shops and websites. Here, the user will have links to books and DVD’s. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Meetings</strong></p>
<p>The meeting section links to multiple different organizations such as Celebrate Recovery, Smart Recovery and Families Anonymous.  These sites link the user to meetings near them.  This section also includes online programs and chatrooms for families.  </p>
<p><strong>Recovery Advocacy</strong></p>
<p>The recovery advocacy section offers links to resources about the stigma of addiction.  It also includes how addiction is interpreted by governmental programs, such as legislation, crime, and regulation of drugs by the FDA.  This section also links the user to other families who have lost a loved one or who have a loved one in recovery who write blogs, Facebook pages, or websites.  Also included in this section is a place to remember those we have lost to addiction.  This graphic is an example of a posting on Facebook about the new policy from the White House.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Android app with 1000+ links will cost around $2.99.  We are still determined to have a free version of our app with around 100 links.  It does not include information about treatment programs or referral to treatment programs.  Unlike most free apps, ours will not have any ads.  We will continue to add content to keep in information up-to-date and look for ways to make the app more user-friendly and accessible.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong>“You Are Linked to Resources for Families of People Seeking Recovery” is not just a new app.  “You Are Linked” is also about networking communities built by others that share the common trait of having a loved one who is seeking recovery or who has died - linking the various bits and pieces (including people) in one place.  This campaign has become as much about the uniting the community of addiction and sending more traffic to the websites, Facebook pages, Pinterest, and Twitteraccounts that already exist.</p>

Hundreds of successful long term recovery stories are included in the app and social media to help reduce the stigma of addiction.
The physical self-care page will focus on the famly's physical care - web pages about Nutrition and Fitness are included as well as how to handle stress. The Spiritual self-care section will have links to Podcasts, online sermons and meditations.
 Shop
The shop section of our app will link the user to online shops and websites. Here, the user will have links to books and DVD’s. 

Clean was released in April 2013.
 
The shop will also connect users to recovery gifts, including jewelry and clothing and android cell phone and tablet apps.

 
Meetings
The meeting section links to multiple different organizations such as Celebrate Recovery, Smart Recovery and Families Anonymous.  These sites link the user to meetings near them.  This section also includes online programs and chatrooms for families.  
Recovery Advocacy
The recovery advocacy section offers links to resources about the stigma of addiction.  It also includes how addiction is interpreted by governmental programs, such as legislation, crime, and regulation of drugs by the FDA.  This section also links the user to other families who have lost a loved one or who have a loved one in recovery who write blogs, Facebook pages, or websites.  Also included in this section is a place to remember those we have lost to addiction.  This graphic is an example of a posting on Facebook about the new policy from the White House.

 
The Android app with 1000+ links will cost around $2.99.  We are still determined to have a free version of our app with around 100 links.  It does not include information about treatment programs or referral to treatment programs.  Unlike most free apps, ours will not have any ads.  We will continue to add content to keep in information up-to-date and look for ways to make the app more user-friendly and accessible.  
 “You Are Linked to Resources for Families of People Seeking Recovery” is not just a new app.  “You Are Linked” is also about networking communities built by others that share the common trait of having a loved one who is seeking recovery or who has died - linking the various bits and pieces (including people) in one place.  This campaign has become as much about the uniting the community of addiction and sending more traffic to the websites, Facebook pages, Pinterest, and Twitteraccounts that already exist.

 
You are Needed
We need funding to staff the continuation of “You are Linked to Resources for Families of People Seeking Recovery” so that we can:
1.  Complete the initial testing of the links (just over half way there) 
2.  Continue to monitor and maintain the links
3.  Complete the beta testing of the app
4.  Develop a free version of 100 links
5.  Maintain the social media sites that provide free access to material in the app
Pinterest (2600+ pins) -http://pinterest.com/urlinked

 
Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/youarelinkedtoresources

 
Twitter -https://twitter.com/URLinkedTo

 If we surpass the goal, the  money will be applied towards the app on the Apple platform.
If you are unable to share financially, we still need your help.  Please share the information including by posting on your Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or by emailing.  Help remove the stigma associated with addiction.  Help educate those struggling, their families, and the general public. 
Please help us “Link” this community together.
 
Thank you so much for checking out our project!

<p><strong>It is the time of the #MeToo movement! It is the time of #TimesUp. The time when many old constructs designed to subjugate women are beginning to crumble. In the arts, more and more women are speaking up and speaking out for their rights and it is filtering across sectors. For the bold women who are taking a stand, it may seem like they are forging new territory, but many have come before them. Let us say their names. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am a performer and teaching artist who is currently pursuing her Masters of Arts in Arts Management and Entrepreneurship at the New School in New York City. When not in school learning I am in New York city schools as a theater teaching artist. My passion is using storytelling to light a spark of inspiration in children young and old. </li>
<li>Move Towards the Light is a one  woman show that looks to connect with the spirit of women pioneers, who in the midst of a storm, stayed true to their own course.  These women, each in their own right, have fought and stood up for the human spirit in female form. Each, living in a challenging time in U.S. History, summoned the courage to face indignities, atrocities and poverty to triumphed in bringing African Americans one step forward.  This show is geared towards <strong>5th - 8th graders</strong> and is as much a call to action in the present as it is an homage to dynamic women from the past. </li>
<li>Let's bring dynamic storytelling for young people to increase representation of stories that reflect the multitude of contributions of people of color. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Culmination of Two Years of Study and 10 years experience! </h3>
<ul>
<li>Move Towards the Light is the culminating project, capstone project for my masters degree, but with your help it will have a life well beyond the end of my school career. Because it is currently a school project, there is no outside funding. This is where you come in! I am asking for $1500 to give birth to the show.  Here is how the money will be spent - <ul>
<li>$400 for period costumes</li>
<li>$200 for props</li>
<li>$200 for set materials</li>
<li>$250 for projection designer</li>
<li>$300 for insurance</li>
<li>$50 for transportation </li>
<li>$350 for technical crew</li>
<li>And more costs ....</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check out the perks including a Behind the Scenes docu/journal of the process!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, as of the funds that will be contributed will still go towards the creating the show. The show must go on or I don't graduate! Help me get out of school! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>This show goes straight out to the schools with two FREE performances!</h3>
<p>The development of this project will culminate in free performances in New York City for two local schools. As the play continues to develop, the plan is to perform it in schools located in all five boroughs of New York and as well as New Jersey. Move Towards the Light creates an on-going conversation about an individual's responsibility for making change within ones' life and in the community. </p>
<ul><li>At the conclusion of the campaign, you will be able to track the progress of the show in my web posts. This show will be the template with which I create a series of plays based on dynamic and daring historical women. Even though we are looking back, the baton is always passed forward to the children so that they too can become change makers. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","It is the time of the #MeToo movement! It is the time of #TimesUp. The time when many old constructs designed to subjugate women are beginning to crumble. In the arts, more and more women are speaking up and speaking out for their rights and it is filtering across sectors. For the bold women who are taking a stand, it may seem like they are forging new territory, but many have come before them. Let us say their names. 

I am a performer and teaching artist who is currently pursuing her Masters of Arts in Arts Management and Entrepreneurship at the New School in New York City. When not in school learning I am in New York city schools as a theater teaching artist. My passion is using storytelling to light a spark of inspiration in children young and old. 
Move Towards the Light is a one  woman show that looks to connect with the spirit of women pioneers, who in the midst of a storm, stayed true to their own course.  These women, each in their own right, have fought and stood up for the human spirit in female form. Each, living in a challenging time in U.S. History, summoned the courage to face indignities, atrocities and poverty to triumphed in bringing African Americans one step forward.  This show is geared towards 5th - 8th graders and is as much a call to action in the present as it is an homage to dynamic women from the past. 
Let's bring dynamic storytelling for young people to increase representation of stories that reflect the multitude of contributions of people of color. 


The Culmination of Two Years of Study and 10 years experience! 

Move Towards the Light is the culminating project, capstone project for my masters degree, but with your help it will have a life well beyond the end of my school career. Because it is currently a school project, there is no outside funding. This is where you come in! I am asking for $1500 to give birth to the show.  Here is how the money will be spent - 
$400 for period costumes
$200 for props
$200 for set materials
$250 for projection designer
$300 for insurance
$50 for transportation 
$350 for technical crew
And more costs ....


Check out the perks including a Behind the Scenes docu/journal of the process!
If I don't reach my goal, as of the funds that will be contributed will still go towards the creating the show. The show must go on or I don't graduate! Help me get out of school! 


This show goes straight out to the schools with two FREE performances!
The development of this project will culminate in free performances in New York City for two local schools. As the play continues to develop, the plan is to perform it in schools located in all five boroughs of New York and as well as New Jersey. Move Towards the Light creates an on-going conversation about an individual's responsibility for making change within ones' life and in the community. 
At the conclusion of the campaign, you will be able to track the progress of the show in my web posts. This show will be the template with which I create a series of plays based on dynamic and daring historical women. Even though we are looking back, the baton is always passed forward to the children so that they too can become change makers.

<strong> </strong><h3>What is ""The Pull of the Moon""?</h3>
<p>""The Pull of the Moon"" is a one act play written by Paige Zubel. The play focus on college students and couple Erin and Kaleb who are struggling with the lasting effects of trauma. Erin has been sexually assaulted by an unnamed aggressor, and does not know how to recover from it. Instead, she lashes out and drags Kaleb down with her. Framing their conflict is Peter, a college professor, giving a lecture on the cycle of waves. Peter insists there is no such thing as rebirth in the water, but Erin and Kaleb have to find a way to rebuild once their emotional waves crash down around them. </p>

<h3>See bottom of this section for a transcription of the video!</h3>
<h3>*****</h3>
<h3>Who we are and what we are up to:</h3>
<p><strong>Hanlon McGrego</strong>r is trans playwright and performer originally from Nova Scotia with a BA in theatre acting from Dalhousie University. Hanlon has taught and worked in dance and theatre for over two decades. Hanlon gender transitioned in his 40s and is proud to be creating theatre that he hopes is relevant to the trans community and the larger world.</p>
<p><strong>Mihaly Szabados </strong>hails from Hungary and has an extensive background in film, tv, and theatre, and is thrilled to be spreading the message of human connection and empathy through stories that centre on voices that have not been given enough bandwidth, such as those of women, trans folks, and people of colour. Hanlon wrote <i>Unexpectedly Trans</i> with co-writer and director <strong>Mihaly </strong>in 2016 and 17 and it opened as a workshop at the Halifax Fringe in 2017. <i>Unexpectedly Trans</i> was the inspiration for the short film premiering this year called <i>Holding Hands with the Awkward. </i></p>
<p><strong>HOLDING HANDS WITH THE AWKWARD</strong> (the short film)</p>
<p><strong>Tsholo Khalema</strong> is a trans actor who joined us to make Holding Hands with the Awkward and take on the role of the Phil the pharmacist and also the thief. He is pleased to be involved and we are pleased to have him! Tsholo will also be taking on the role of Tyler in the new workshop play we are bringing called Bubble Trans Pride. <strong>Syrus Marcus Ware </strong>joins the cast to play trans man Tyler who is friends with Dan, played by <strong>Kit Boulter</strong>; These two have each other's back through the various awkward moments life can bring for transgender individuals. <strong>Claire McGregor </strong>also appears with Tsholo in the in the pharmacy scene.  </p>
<p><strong>BUBBLE TRANS PRIDE </strong>(the play workshop)</p>
<p><strong>Syrus Marcus Ware </strong>is joining Hanlon to co-write Bubble Trans Pride. Syrus is a visual and performance artist, activist, and Vanier Scholar.  He is also in rehearsal for Out the Window, a play that is opening in June as part of the Luminato Festival in Toronto. </p>
<p>Hanlon and Syrus are proud and pleased to have received a Recommender Grant from the Ontario Arts Council via Buddies in Bad Times Theatre to begin writing Bubble Trans Pride, this grant has allowed us to work with amazing playwright/performer <strong>Diane Flacks</strong> (Waiting Room, Unholy) as our mentor and we feel blessed and inspired. </p>
<p>Themes of Bubble Trans Pride include ways we do and do not belong as we transition and also the personal cost of activism for a trans Black Lives Matter member and activist. </p>
<p>CAST - Mihaly will be directing and acting in the role of Bob, the bouncer and Tsholo will be performing the role of Tyler in this workshop.  We will be introducing more cast members who are local Halifax actors shortly. </p>
<p>From Skype rehearsals to a very <i>trans-</i>Canadian cast (pardon the pun please), we have a lot of exciting and fringy things going on. We believe Halifax audiences are going to enjoy the challenging, funny, and moving elements of the work we are bringing and we look forward to sharing them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p><strong>We need to get our actors and playwright to Nova Scotia and back</strong> - so to do that we need flights to be covered. We need to feed folks while they are there. We will also need funds for promoting the show, costume pieces, filming the work so we have an archival record and various other odds and ends that seem to pile up (getting in from the airport, moving set pieces around, etc). </p>
<p><strong>We estimate that we will need at least $3,000.00. </strong></p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we will first be covering the costs of just getting the actors to Halifax and back - the flights. </p>
<p>We are still working out what perks might be available. Stay tuned! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your money will help us make a piece of theatre happen and also help us premiere a film we worked very hard to produce. These will both be full of trans themes and represent trans folks and trans POC. This piece can only grow with the help of an audience and taking the piece to Halifax Fringe is our next step. </p>
<p>We tried to do our pieces locally - applying for  both the Hamilton Fringe and the Toronto Fringe two years running - but with such a small number of spots and a huge number of shows in the lotteries - we've been unsuccessful. However, we are lucky enough to be included in the Halifax Fringe for a second year and this allows us to take our pieces forward. </p>
<p>The play we took last year is being made into a pilot to pitch to producers. The play we bring this year will also be honed and hopefully make it to being produced in Toronto and also possibly made into a film, tv-, or web-series. Every bit of support gets us closer to the goal of making work that can be shared both on stage and screen and eventually reach a wide audience. </p>
<p>Hanlon says, ""When I was transitioning I consumed every bit of theatre, film, tv and youtube content I could find, and I know the importance of having trans representation. It is vital to be able to see ourselves, our stories reflected in the world.""</p>
<p>It is also important for potential allies to hear trans stories, as it increases the chance for understanding and real change in our culture. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest risks is the expense of getting the shows to NS and getting bums in seats once we are there - unlike other kinds of theatre, there is no travel funding for fringe work. </p>
<p>It's also tricky to self produce because a lot of government funding is hard to get because there is stiff competition - and although we have received some funding - we have prepared many applications that were not able to be funded - and every minute spent preparing a grant application is a minute that could instead be used to write or create, but it's almost all on our own dime and we need to live in the meantime. For this reason getting into fringe allows us to be produced and therefore we can focus on making the art - if we can get support to get there. </p>
<p>Breaking into the festivals is also taking time, and although we were honoured to be shortlisted for Rhubarb Festival this year, we did not get selected. We are hopeful to be successful in the future, but we need to keep making and developing work in the mean time. </p>
<p>One of our big challenges this year is that part of the cast is in Halifax (in part to avoid even more travel costs - but also to work with some amazing folks of course!!!) This means we have to be really creative about how we rehearse - Skype is going to be our friend! And we will be putting things together quickly at the end of August! This is one that money may or may not help but it is definitely going to have us (and hopefully you) at the edge of our seats to see how it all comes together!!! As one of our actors said, this project is ""Fringy as hell!"" And I think it will be in all the best of ways. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>• If you can't help us in the way of money, we can always use a donation of a good or service that we could offer to others as a reward for their contribution - get in touch and let us know if you have some kind of <strong>prize</strong> to contribute!</p>
<p>• Word of mouth - goodness. We always need help getting the word out - both about the show and about this campaign. Please forward this campaign far and wide!</p>
<p>• Rehearsal space in Toronto in July/August or Halifax final week of August</p>
<p>• Drives in from the airport in August or back to the Airport in September - we have some covered but let us know if you are also around and able to drive someone.</p>
<p>• Food for the artists while in Halifax - gift cards for Bulk Barn, Loblaws, etc. could be helpful-</p>
<p>• Lodging in Halifax - we think we have lodging, but we may need more. Do get in touch if you have space between Aug 25th or so and Sept 10!</p>
<p>• Car rental points or coupons with Enterprise for moving set pieces (if we have them). </p>
<p>We will update this area of 'things we need other than money' as we get closer! </p>
<p>Now please go donate if you can! And share share share - if you feel called! </p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>

<h2>Transcription of first video:</h2>
<p>“Hi I’m Hanlon McGregor. I’m a trans playwright, actor, director, and I am also making films these days.” </p>
<p>“My name is Tsholo Khalema and I’m an actor, aspiring director and a film and theatre photographer and I’m super stoked to be part of this project” </p>
<p>“My name is Mishy and I’m and actor-director and a founder of Iza’s? Productions” </p>
<p>Hanlon: “Right now I want to talk to you about a new project I’m doing called ‘Bubble Trans Pride’ and I’m working on it with my co-writer, my writing consultant Syrus Marcus Ware who is involved in a lot of Black Lives Matter projects and also is an amazing visual artist, activist” </p>
<p>Tsholo: “This project is so inspiring, it’s a pleasure to be part of this because first it encompasses a lot of what I want to do and a lot of what I want project out there in the world as an artist. So it talks about trans issues, it talks about queerness as a whole, and really talks about personally my own different intersectionalities throughout the queerness and the blackness and so forth” </p>
<p>Hanlon: “Part of what this project is about is talking about how in our queer community, and in the greater community, a lot of activists are paying a toll. They’re paying a toll for the good of a lot of other people, and one of my questions in writing this project is ‘what is the personal cost of that activism?’ And also one of the other questions I’ve asked is ‘what does transition promise, versus what does it deliver? So, what are the ways we look for belonging in our communities? And sometimes we find that on the other side of transition and for some people it’s not crossing to another side they land somewhere in the middle. Are we finding the belonging that we seek? Are we finding that sense of community and in what ways are we not finding that sense of community, and in what ways do we need to kind of consider the community that we’re building?” </p>
<p>Mishy: “We have similar interests and we like a lot of things similar, and we like artistic ways, and like to change the world with arts. Hanlon asked me if I can read his monologue. And I started to read it and give some feedback, and then turned into “Unexpectedly Trans” like the whole concept.” </p>
<p>Hanlon in film clip as Dan:  </p>
<p>“This is our Hamlet moment (repeated, layered). Yours (repeated, layered) and mine (repeated, layered)” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tsholo: “It’s just really important to tell these kind of stories. Again these kind of stories are not often heard and as artists, it’s really difficult to get funding.

Who we are and what we are up to:
Hanlon McGregor is trans playwright and performer originally from Nova Scotia with a BA in theatre acting from Dalhousie University. Hanlon has taught and worked in dance and theatre for over two decades. Hanlon gender transitioned in his 40s and is proud to be creating theatre that he hopes is relevant to the trans community and the larger world.
Mihaly Szabados hails from Hungary and has an extensive background in film, tv, and theatre, and is thrilled to be spreading the message of human connection and empathy through stories that centre on voices that have not been given enough bandwidth, such as those of women, trans folks, and people of colour. Hanlon wrote Unexpectedly Trans with co-writer and director Mihaly in 2016 and 17 and it opened as a workshop at the Halifax Fringe in 2017. Unexpectedly Trans was the inspiration for the short film premiering this year called Holding Hands with the Awkward. 
HOLDING HANDS WITH THE AWKWARD (the short film)
Tsholo Khalema is a trans actor who joined us to make Holding Hands with the Awkward and take on the role of the Phil the pharmacist and also the thief. He is pleased to be involved and we are pleased to have him! Tsholo will also be taking on the role of Tyler in the new workshop play we are bringing called Bubble Trans Pride. Syrus Marcus Ware joins the cast to play trans man Tyler who is friends with Dan, played by Kit Boulter; These two have each other's back through the various awkward moments life can bring for transgender individuals. Claire McGregor also appears with Tsholo in the in the pharmacy scene.  
BUBBLE TRANS PRIDE (the play workshop)
Syrus Marcus Ware is joining Hanlon to co-write Bubble Trans Pride. Syrus is a visual and performance artist, activist, and Vanier Scholar.  He is also in rehearsal for Out the Window, a play that is opening in June as part of the Luminato Festival in Toronto. 
Hanlon and Syrus are proud and pleased to have received a Recommender Grant from the Ontario Arts Council via Buddies in Bad Times Theatre to begin writing Bubble Trans Pride, this grant has allowed us to work with amazing playwright/performer Diane Flacks (Waiting Room, Unholy) as our mentor and we feel blessed and inspired. 
Themes of Bubble Trans Pride include ways we do and do not belong as we transition and also the personal cost of activism for a trans Black Lives Matter member and activist. 
CAST - Mihaly will be directing and acting in the role of Bob, the bouncer and Tsholo will be performing the role of Tyler in this workshop.  We will be introducing more cast members who are local Halifax actors shortly. 
From Skype rehearsals to a very trans-Canadian cast (pardon the pun please), we have a lot of exciting and fringy things going on. We believe Halifax audiences are going to enjoy the challenging, funny, and moving elements of the work we are bringing and we look forward to sharing them!

What We Need & What You Get 
We need to get our actors and playwright to Nova Scotia and back - so to do that we need flights to be covered. We need to feed folks while they are there. We will also need funds for promoting the show, costume pieces, filming the work so we have an archival record and various other odds and ends that seem to pile up (getting in from the airport, moving set pieces around, etc). 
We estimate that we will need at least $3,000.00. 
If we don't reach our entire goal we will first be covering the costs of just getting the actors to Halifax and back - the flights. 
We are still working out what perks might be available. Stay tuned! 
 

The Impact
Your money will help us make a piece of theatre happen and also help us premiere a film we worked very hard to produce. These will both be full of trans themes and represent trans folks and trans POC. This piece can only grow with the help of an audience and taking the piece to Halifax Fringe is our next step. 
We tried to do our pieces locally - applying for  both the Hamilton Fringe and the Toronto Fringe two years running - but with such a small number of spots and a huge number of shows in the lotteries - we've been unsuccessful. However, we are lucky enough to be included in the Halifax Fringe for a second year and this allows us to take our pieces forward. 
The play we took last year is being made into a pilot to pitch to producers. The play we bring this year will also be honed and hopefully make it to being produced in Toronto and also possibly made into a film, tv-, or web-series. Every bit of support gets us closer to the goal of making work that can be shared both on stage and screen and eventually reach a wide audience. 
Hanlon says, ""When I was transitioning I consumed every bit of theatre, film, tv and youtube content I could find, and I know the importance of having trans representation. It is vital to be able to see ourselves, our stories reflected in the world.""
It is also important for potential allies to hear trans stories, as it increases the chance for understanding and real change in our culture. 

Risks & Challenges
One of the biggest risks is the expense of getting the shows to NS and getting bums in seats once we are there - unlike other kinds of theatre, there is no travel funding for fringe work. 
It's also tricky to self produce because a lot of government funding is hard to get because there is stiff competition - and although we have received some funding - we have prepared many applications that were not able to be funded - and every minute spent preparing a grant application is a minute that could instead be used to write or create, but it's almost all on our own dime and we need to live in the meantime. For this reason getting into fringe allows us to be produced and therefore we can focus on making the art - if we can get support to get there. 
Breaking into the festivals is also taking time, and although we were honoured to be shortlisted for Rhubarb Festival this year, we did not get selected. We are hopeful to be successful in the future, but we need to keep making and developing work in the mean time. 
One of our big challenges this year is that part of the cast is in Halifax (in part to avoid even more travel costs - but also to work with some amazing folks of course!!!) This means we have to be really creative about how we rehearse - Skype is going to be our friend! And we will be putting things together quickly at the end of August! This is one that money may or may not help but it is definitely going to have us (and hopefully you) at the edge of our seats to see how it all comes together!!! As one of our actors said, this project is ""Fringy as hell!"" And I think it will be in all the best of ways. 

Other Ways You Can Help
• If you can't help us in the way of money, we can always use a donation of a good or service that we could offer to others as a reward for their contribution - get in touch and let us know if you have some kind of prize to contribute!
• Word of mouth - goodness. We always need help getting the word out - both about the show and about this campaign. Please forward this campaign far and wide!
• Rehearsal space in Toronto in July/August or Halifax final week of August
• Drives in from the airport in August or back to the Airport in September - we have some covered but let us know if you are also around and able to drive someone.
• Food for the artists while in Halifax - gift cards for Bulk Barn, Loblaws, etc. could be helpful-
• Lodging in Halifax - we think we have lodging, but we may need more. Do get in touch if you have space between Aug 25th or so and Sept 10!
• Car rental points or coupons with Enterprise for moving set pieces (if we have them). 
We will update this area of 'things we need other than money' as we get closer! 
Now please go donate if you can! And share share share - if you feel called! 
Thanks all!
 
Transcription of first video:
“Hi I’m Hanlon McGregor. I’m a trans playwright, actor, director, and I am also making films these days.” 
“My name is Tsholo Khalema and I’m an actor, aspiring director and a film and theatre photographer and I’m super stoked to be part of this project” 
“My name is Mishy and I’m and actor-director and a founder of Iza’s? Productions” 
Hanlon: “Right now I want to talk to you about a new project I’m doing called ‘Bubble Trans Pride’ and I’m working on it with my co-writer, my writing consultant Syrus Marcus Ware who is involved in a lot of Black Lives Matter projects and also is an amazing visual artist, activist” 
Tsholo: “This project is so inspiring, it’s a pleasure to be part of this because first it encompasses a lot of what I want to do and a lot of what I want project out there in the world as an artist. So it talks about trans issues, it talks about queerness as a whole, and really talks about personally my own different intersectionalities throughout the queerness and the blackness and so forth” 
Hanlon: “Part of what this project is about is talking about how in our queer community, and in the greater community, a lot of activists are paying a toll. They’re paying a toll for the good of a lot of other people, and one of my questions in writing this project is ‘what is the personal cost of that activism?’ And also one of the other questions I’ve asked is ‘what does transition promise, versus what does it deliver? So, what are the ways we look for belonging in our communities? And sometimes we find that on the other side of transition and for some people it’s not crossing to another side they land somewhere in the middle. Are we finding the belonging that we seek? Are we finding that sense of community and in what ways are we not finding that sense of community, and in what ways do we need to kind of consider the community that we’re building?” 
Mishy: “We have similar interests and we like a lot of things similar, and we like artistic ways, and like to change the world with arts. Hanlon asked me if I can read his monologue. And I started to read it and give some feedback, and then turned into “Unexpectedly Trans” like the whole concept.” 
Hanlon in film clip as Dan:  
“This is our Hamlet moment (repeated, layered). Yours (repeated, layered) and mine (repeated, layered)” 
 
Tsholo: “It’s just really important to tell these kind of stories. Again these kind of stories are not often heard and as artists, it’s really difficult to get funding. So we’re asking to please support this project, it’s gonna be amazing! It tells a different story than what we’ve heard. And I ‘m just looking forward to just going out there and sharing these characters with you” 
Clip from short film Holding Hands with the Awkward, Tsholo as the theif: 
“Tampons. Not anymore!” 
Mishy: “I we are building a company. That’s what I believe we are. We are gathering people together, just me and Hanlon first, and now we have Tsholo, we have a couple of people. We have a DOP we use all the time. (Carl Greene) We have a stunt person now, and Ingrid Hart, so we are building slowly. Slowly building up this company and hopefully we can tell, we want to tell stories that never been told” 
Hanlon: “We need practical things like we need to get Tsholo to Nova Scotia so that he can act  
Mishy in the background: “How 'bout me? How ‘bout me?”  Hanlon: “(laughs) We need to get Mishy to Nova Scotia too so he can direct and act” 
Excerpt from the new play being rehearsed: 
Mishy as Bob: “Whoa (laughs)! Mad skills” 
Tsholo as Tyler: “I try!” 
Bob: “Is it for black trans power or something?” 
Tsholo: “Nailed it!” 
BOB: “Yay! (High fives)” 
Tyler: “Yay, yeah” 
Hanlon: “Like, it’s really, it’s not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but if we don’t get it, we can’t do the project so that’s why we need your help” 
Mishy: “We want catharsis, we want people to change, we want people to cry, to laugh. I think it’s gonna be a great project, please support us” 
“And I think it’s a pretty important thing, I think it’s gonna have a lot of positive benefit” 
Tsholo: “(Laughing) I haven’t posted it yet, I’m waiting

<h3>Who We Are: </h3>
<p>Founded and directed by Marie-Christine Giordano, MCGD premiered in 2002 with a commission from L'Espace Moncor in Switzerland. Since then, the company has created 10 full-length evening pieces and with headquarters in Brooklyn, Giordano maintains a teaching schedule, offering technique classes to professionals, nonprofessionals and Brooklyn public school children. MCGD is a non for profit (501)(c)(3) and your donation is tax-deductible to the full extent provided by law.</p>
<p>After a very successful spring season at BAM Fisher in early June of 2017, the company is currently focused on producing this technique video demonstration. The video will demonstrate the core principles of the Giordano's Alignment  and structured training class developed by Giordano over the years. We are teaming up with the Gibney Dance Center Creative Services&amp;Digital Technology department in NYC, who will be filming and editing the film in collaboration with MCGD. </p>
<p>This video will increase our ability to reach out and to educate professional dancers, nonprofessionals, and public school children. Additionally, we will send it to universities and colleges across the country in order to apply for teaching residencies. Here in NYC, we will use it to enhance our image and visibility within the dance community, and as a result make our dance technique more accessible to all. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Ms. Giordano is clearly a choreographer committed to constructing a personal dance vocabulary.” </i> -Gia Kourlas, The New York Times.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Your Support Goes: </h3>
<p>It goes without saying that the impact of your support is invaluable.</p>
<p>Your donation will be used to contribute to:</p>
<p><strong>Artistic Pay: </strong>This project will provide the opportunity for three dancers to experience the making of a professional dance video as well as display their expertise in the technique. It is vital we provide them with adequate compensation for their time.

</div></div>","Who We Are: 
Founded and directed by Marie-Christine Giordano, MCGD premiered in 2002 with a commission from L'Espace Moncor in Switzerland. Since then, the company has created 10 full-length evening pieces and with headquarters in Brooklyn, Giordano maintains a teaching schedule, offering technique classes to professionals, nonprofessionals and Brooklyn public school children. MCGD is a non for profit (501)(c)(3) and your donation is tax-deductible to the full extent provided by law.
After a very successful spring season at BAM Fisher in early June of 2017, the company is currently focused on producing this technique video demonstration. The video will demonstrate the core principles of the Giordano's Alignment  and structured training class developed by Giordano over the years. We are teaming up with the Gibney Dance Center Creative Services&Digital Technology department in NYC, who will be filming and editing the film in collaboration with MCGD. 
This video will increase our ability to reach out and to educate professional dancers, nonprofessionals, and public school children. Additionally, we will send it to universities and colleges across the country in order to apply for teaching residencies. Here in NYC, we will use it to enhance our image and visibility within the dance community, and as a result make our dance technique more accessible to all. 
""Ms. Giordano is clearly a choreographer committed to constructing a personal dance vocabulary.”  -Gia Kourlas, The New York Times.

Where Your Support Goes: 
It goes without saying that the impact of your support is invaluable.
Your donation will be used to contribute to:
Artistic Pay: This project will provide the opportunity for three dancers to experience the making of a professional dance video as well as display their expertise in the technique. It is vital we provide them with adequate compensation for their time. This includes time spent not only during the shoot, but the hours of preparation and planning Marie-Christine will input need to be accounted for as well. 
Location: The filming will take place at Gibney, in one of their spacious, newly renovated studios. While we are excited to be in a new studio, it comes at a cost. Your help will give us literal space to move in! 
Videographer/Editing: We are working with the fabulous film team at Gibney. We will pay for their services which include both filming and editing of the video. Marie-Christine will be present and deeply involved in all editing sessions.

<h3><strong>The Play</strong></h3>
<p>John Lennon was born during a Nazi air raid on Liverpool, an omen of things to come as tumultuous events would shape his young life. Abandoned by his father, he's ripped away from his devoted mother to be raised by his aunt. Depressed, he's saved by a guitar strummer named Paul McCartney and 1950’s Rock 'n Roll.</p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>I fell in love with The Beatles in junior high. I was one of <i>those</i> fans.  I devoured books about the band, and constantly quoted their lyrics. I loved their music, their idealism and their humor.</p>
<p>So I was surprised to learn that John Lennon had suffered terrible losses as a child. Personal tragedies can be devastating at any age, but all the more so for a young person. I became fascinated by John's story, by the influences, the family and friends that nurtured and guided him.</p>
<p>What I found was a powerful cast of characters, all doing the best they could under the pressure of extremely difficult circumstances. But more than that, I found patterns of behavior, and a universal story that applies to all of us. That's the heart of our play ""Long Lost John.""</p>

<p><b><i>Start with 1 part Marlo Hunter </i></b></p><p>In 2008, award-winning director &amp; choreographer, <b>Marlo Hunter</b>’s site-specific theater company,<a href=""http://www.eatingtheirwords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <i>Eating Their Words</i></a><i><a href=""http://www.eatingtheirwords.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a>,</i> was leading a new wave of immersive projects in New York City theater. Combining her two passions, developing new plays and experiencing great food, Marlo partnered with notable playwrights and chefs throughout New York City to produce one-night-only events, inviting foodie and theater-loving audiences alike to exquisite three-course meals matched with three great plays. After two years of producing these events, working with Pulitzer, Tony and James Beard award-winning playwrights, actors, and chefs, Marlo dreamed of expanding her vision from a one-night-only event into a full production.</p><p><b><i>Add 1 part Sasha Eden </i></b></p><p>In 2011, Marlo met actor &amp; producer, <b>Sasha Eden</b>, co-founder of the critically acclaimed Off-Broadway company, <a href=""http://www.wetproductions.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a><a href=""http://www.wetproductions.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>WET Productions.</i> </a>Marlo had attended a number of Sasha's productions, and was inspired by her creation of bold new work and her commitment to gender parity. By following the mission of WET, to produce media that challenges female stereotypes and advocates for equality, Sasha had furthered the careers of numerous women artists in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Upon meeting Marlo, Sasha was struck by her talent, entrepreneurial spirit and keen artistic eye. They began to crack open the idea for an expanded version of <i>Eating Their Word</i>s: what if the series of short plays could coalesce into one larger story with a connective arc? What if the theater were designed to operate as a restaurant, thereby building the conceit within a naturalistic framework? What if the audience was submerged within the play itself, dining on a tasting menu that serves as a muse for the stories unfolding around them? And lastly, a non-negotiable: what if, at the center of it all, there was a <i>female</i> chef?</p><p><b><i>Add 1 part Chef Carla Hall </i></b></p><p>And so it happened that in 2013, while Sasha was watching <i>Top Chef</i>, it dawned on her that Chef Carla Hall, her favorite contestant ever, would be the ideal match for this project. Nimble, savvy, collaborative, full of creativity, Carla was perfect. Serendipitously, two weeks later, Sasha met Carla on an empty subway car in the middle of the day. Feeling as if she was struck by lightening (in a good way), Sasha introduced herself to Carla. As fortune would have it Carla shared Marlo and Sasha's dream to merge the theatrical and culinary arts…. and so the collaboration began.</p><p><b><i>Add 3 cups each of Courtney Baron, Hilary Bettis and Daniel Pearle &amp; stir vigorously</i></b></p><p>This past spring, after an extensive search, Sasha and Marlo invited playwrights Courtney Baron, Hilary Bettis, &amp; Daniel Pearle to join the creative team. Each writer is matched with a course on Carla’s menu, and their plays are inspired by the essence of the food in that given course. These plays will reflect the different economic, emotional, and historical perspectives found in this restaurant, from patrons, to front and back of house staff. And, of course, Carla's menu tells a story in tandem with the plays. </p><p><b><i>Now let it simmer...</i></b></p><p><b></b></p><p>
</p><p>Our team spent four days in a creative think tank this past spring getting to know one another as collaborators, <b>and now we are off to build the play during our summer workshop.</b><br/></p><p>Building this play requires that we work with one another through a series of workshops, as the plays and the food

</div></div>","Hi
friends! We're so excited to launch this project and share it with you! This is the most expansive, out-of-the box artistic endeavor we have
ever worked on and we need YOUR help to make it happen!! Please check out what it’s all about and support us:

The Theatrical Culinary Project is an immersive play and dining
experience featuring culinary sensation, co-host of The Chew & Top Chef finalist, Carla
Hall 
Created by director Marlo Hunter and actor & producer Sasha Eden 


Set in a restaurant, the lines of reality and fiction are
blurred as the audience dines on a four-course meal while submerged in a
multi-layered play written by           award-winning playwrights:Courtney
Baron (MCC’s A Very Common Procedure) Hilary Bettis (NNPN’s Ghosts of Lote Bravo) Daniel
Pearle (LCT3’s A Kid Like Jake)Currently in development with an upcoming two-week workshop July 28th-August 7th, the goal is an immersive production in a tailor-made venue that ignites all five senses and fuses the theatrical and culinary arts into one cohesive experience. Read our artists' bios


Start with 1 part Marlo Hunter In 2008, award-winning director & choreographer, Marlo Hunter’s site-specific theater company, Eating Their Words, was leading a new wave of immersive projects in New York City theater. Combining her two passions, developing new plays and experiencing great food, Marlo partnered with notable playwrights and chefs throughout New York City to produce one-night-only events, inviting foodie and theater-loving audiences alike to exquisite three-course meals matched with three great plays. After two years of producing these events, working with Pulitzer, Tony and James Beard award-winning playwrights, actors, and chefs, Marlo dreamed of expanding her vision from a one-night-only event into a full production.Add 1 part Sasha Eden In 2011, Marlo met actor & producer, Sasha Eden, co-founder of the critically acclaimed Off-Broadway company, WET Productions. Marlo had attended a number of Sasha's productions, and was inspired by her creation of bold new work and her commitment to gender parity. By following the mission of WET, to produce media that challenges female stereotypes and advocates for equality, Sasha had furthered the careers of numerous women artists in the entertainment industry.Upon meeting Marlo, Sasha was struck by her talent, entrepreneurial spirit and keen artistic eye. They began to crack open the idea for an expanded version of Eating Their Words: what if the series of short plays could coalesce into one larger story with a connective arc? What if the theater were designed to operate as a restaurant, thereby building the conceit within a naturalistic framework? What if the audience was submerged within the play itself, dining on a tasting menu that serves as a muse for the stories unfolding around them? And lastly, a non-negotiable: what if, at the center of it all, there was a female chef?Add 1 part Chef Carla Hall And so it happened that in 2013, while Sasha was watching Top Chef, it dawned on her that Chef Carla Hall, her favorite contestant ever, would be the ideal match for this project. Nimble, savvy, collaborative, full of creativity, Carla was perfect. Serendipitously, two weeks later, Sasha met Carla on an empty subway car in the middle of the day. Feeling as if she was struck by lightening (in a good way), Sasha introduced herself to Carla. As fortune would have it Carla shared Marlo and Sasha's dream to merge the theatrical and culinary arts…. and so the collaboration began.Add 3 cups each of Courtney Baron, Hilary Bettis and Daniel Pearle & stir vigorouslyThis past spring, after an extensive search, Sasha and Marlo invited playwrights Courtney Baron, Hilary Bettis, & Daniel Pearle to join the creative team. Each writer is matched with a course on Carla’s menu, and their plays are inspired by the essence of the food in that given course. These plays will reflect the different economic, emotional, and historical perspectives found in this restaurant, from patrons, to front and back of house staff. And, of course, Carla's menu tells a story in tandem with the plays. Now let it simmer...
Our team spent four days in a creative think tank this past spring getting to know one another as collaborators, and now we are off to build the play during our summer workshop.Building this play requires that we work with one another through a series of workshops, as the plays and the food
are integrated to tell one story.  Our upcoming two-week summer workshop process will begin on July 28th with a residency at SPACE on
Ryder Farm, a non-profit arts organization in Brewster, NY. SPACE provides
a retreat outside of the city, for artists to live and develop new work. The Theatrical Culinary Project was
awarded a five-day residency at SPACE, where we will focus exclusively on
the development of the scripts. Following Ryder Farm we will return to New York
City to integrate Carla's food and menu into the structure of the plays, work
with an ensemble cast, continue script development, rehearse with our entire
team, prep for a four course meal and reading, and close with an intimate
presentation for a handful of audience members, to assess the impact the immersive experience has on the piece. By September our cast size will be solidified, we will understand the type of space that will enhance the storytelling, have a solid estimate of food and service costs, and an estimated timeline for continued development, all of which will enable us to create a marketing and business plan for building partnerships that will help us move The Theatrical Culinary Project forward. The Theatrical Culinary Project  is built by a team of 22 generous people, with a belief in a
common artistic goal. The budget for the summer workshop requires a lean minimum of $45,000 to build.  Following the workshop we will need to raise an additional $25,000 to cover costs for continued development. We turn to you, our invaluable community of supporters, champions, partners and friends, to help us raise the first $30,000 on Indiegogo and propel us toward our overall goal!Our workshop budget covers: 
Artists' fees for 22 people
Insurance
Food & Supplies
Printing of scripts
Transportation
Ryder Farm supplementary fees 
Venue 1: A commercial kitchen with a dining room

Venue 2: A rehearsal space

<br/><h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
Our goal is to raise $5,000. These funds will allow us to pay our creative team and to fund the creation of the physical production (set and props, costumes, theater expenses). We have already secured the performance and rehearsal spaces and a portion of the fees for the artists. We are committed to giving our artists the funding and resources to be as creative as they wish, and are channeling our efforts to allow them to express themselves as fully as they can, so that they may breathe life and energy into Saviana's text in a way that does the play justice.<br/><br/>We are working with a small budget and everyone is dedicated to 
making this production the best that it can be. We believe very deeply 
that everything we are putting into this production will allow the play 
to have a continued life on stage, so that everything that is being put 
into the play now is an investment in the future of this 
thought-provoking piece.<br/><br/>Our perks are geared towards allowing our funders to experience USELESS, to be involved in the production and to join us in celebrating the fruits of this labor.<br/><br/>Please note that all donations are tax deductible in the United States.<br/><br/>
</div> <div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Like the characters in our play, many of us are immigrants. As a collective, we have origins in Romania, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Italy, Belgium, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Canada and the United States. We are moved and delighted and challenged by USELESS, and we would like our community to have the opportunity to experience it as well.<br/><br/>At the core of the play is a dark story of characters who have been coerced or duped into selling pieces of themselves, or into selling others, in order to lift themselves out of their grim realities and to fulfill their dreams. <br/><br/>While the events in the play are fictional, they are taken from experiences that are all too real: according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, human trafficking is the third most profitable illicit trade, after that of arms and drugs. It generates
about $217 billion US in revenue annually, and is linked to other organized crime
- human smuggling, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Astoundingly, victims come from 127 countries and are transported to and used in 135 of the world's 196 countries (""International Laws to Combat Human Trafficking,"" 2004).<span> </span><br/><br/>While we are telling a story of struggles that many of us face every 
day, i.e., meeting financial commitments, fulling dreams, we are doing 
it through the lens of characters who make specific choices and are 
trapped into situations that few of us can imagine. It is important to us that the
characters in the play are not portrayed as villains or heroes. Saviana explores the human
experience in its rich complexity, seeing the light in the dark sides of the
mind, and the darkness in the moments of beauty. Ultimately, she is conveying
the message that making a loving human connection may be the only way to fight
violence and evil acts, and to prove that humanity is USEFUL.<br/> 
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3> <p>Our investment in USELESS is substantial. Many of us have been working on the play for three years, including multiple readings and workshops at the Lark Play Development Center, Ensemble Studio Theatre and Queens Theatre. We are investing so much of ourselves in this work because we are passionately committed to it and would like to accomplish something noteworthy with it.</p>
<p>Because we don't have angel investors and are raising all of the funds for this production ourselves in a limited time span, we are in a challenging but exciting position to lock arms with our community in order to make USELESS come to life.

<p>Orestes, has just slain his mother, Clytaemnestra, for the murder of his father, Agamemnon. When the Furies want Orestes’s blood to pay for the crime of murdering his mother, the gods have other plans. This original, musical adaptation of the tragedy follows Orestes as he attempts to flee the vengeance of the formidable Furies, encountering gods such as Athena and Apollo along the way.</p>
<p>The Furies combines haunting, original music with beautiful dance in this unique adaptation. This daring and ambitious work combines imaginative lighting, a strong ensemble, and a well-balanced fusion of music and speech to create a visually and aurally striking performance.

<h2><strong>The Original “Alternative Facts”</strong></h2>
<p>“If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.”<br/>-Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Our show begins in a church basement, where disgraced spies, along with the unwitting audience, gather for a support group meeting. The action soon shifts to Frankfurt Airport, where a mysterious Iraqi defector claims he built secret Iraqi bio-weapons labs. At CIA headquarters, our other characters are contending with their own ambitions, rash decisions, inflexible bosses, unrequited affections and unremitting boredom, when a fax arrives from Germany, and with it a golden opportunity. If the defector's story holds up, it will be the ticket out of the basement and into a corner office. It's all fun and games until the looming cataclysm changes everything.</p>

</div><div>
<h2><strong>The Making of a Musical</strong></h2>
<p>The creation of Baghdaddy began in 2006, when producer Charlie Fink read his old friend J.T. Allen's unproduced screenplay, ""Curveball"". Charlie concluded the only way people could accept this incredible true story if it were a musical comedy. As Oscar Wilde famously said, ""if you want to tell people the truth make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you"". In 2010 Marshall Pailet (Claudio Quest, Triassic Parq) &amp; A.D. Penedo (The Three Times She Knocked) wrote a successful one act version of <i>Baghdaddy (</i>then called <i>Who's Your Baghdaddy? or How I Started the Iraq War) </i>that won ""Best Show"" at the DC Fringe Festival. But for years afterward, the show stubbornly resisted several attempts to re-write it as a full length Broadway style musical. Then the authors had an idea that transformed the show: tell the story inside a support group that has been formed by the disgraced spies who passed along the false intel that was used to justify the invasion of Iraq. The characters now tell their story inside of the group, inventively conjuring each scene in the spare church basement to search for redemption. </p>
<p>In September, 2015, The New Musical Foundation presented a limited 10 week engagement of <i>Baghdaddy </i>at the off-Broadway Actor's Temple. Critics and audiences loved the show. The creative team vowed to bring it back. Little did we know today's environment would make the original alternative facts so relevant again.</p>
<p>More of our rave reviews:</p>

</div></div>","The Original “Alternative Facts”
“If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.”-Oscar Wilde
Our show begins in a church basement, where disgraced spies, along with the unwitting audience, gather for a support group meeting. The action soon shifts to Frankfurt Airport, where a mysterious Iraqi defector claims he built secret Iraqi bio-weapons labs. At CIA headquarters, our other characters are contending with their own ambitions, rash decisions, inflexible bosses, unrequited affections and unremitting boredom, when a fax arrives from Germany, and with it a golden opportunity. If the defector's story holds up, it will be the ticket out of the basement and into a corner office. It's all fun and games until the looming cataclysm changes everything.

Art is resistance, and this is a substantial work of art, leveraging the talents of dozens of artists who can't do their work without you.

The Making of a Musical
The creation of Baghdaddy began in 2006, when producer Charlie Fink read his old friend J.T. Allen's unproduced screenplay, ""Curveball"". Charlie concluded the only way people could accept this incredible true story if it were a musical comedy. As Oscar Wilde famously said, ""if you want to tell people the truth make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you"". In 2010 Marshall Pailet (Claudio Quest, Triassic Parq) & A.D. Penedo (The Three Times She Knocked) wrote a successful one act version of Baghdaddy (then called Who's Your Baghdaddy? or How I Started the Iraq War) that won ""Best Show"" at the DC Fringe Festival. But for years afterward, the show stubbornly resisted several attempts to re-write it as a full length Broadway style musical. Then the authors had an idea that transformed the show: tell the story inside a support group that has been formed by the disgraced spies who passed along the false intel that was used to justify the invasion of Iraq. The characters now tell their story inside of the group, inventively conjuring each scene in the spare church basement to search for redemption. 
In September, 2015, The New Musical Foundation presented a limited 10 week engagement of Baghdaddy at the off-Broadway Actor's Temple. Critics and audiences loved the show. The creative team vowed to bring it back. Little did we know today's environment would make the original alternative facts so relevant again.

<br/><p><b><i>Why is theatre important and why is this play important?</i></b></p>
<p>Live theatre challenges. Live theatre raises heartbeats and raises questions. Live theatre promotes change. Live theatre entertains. <b><i>5863</i></b> gives you an opportunity to ask yourself what you truly care about. We have the choice of how we would like to live our lives, even in prison. And you have a choice to support live theatre! To experience <b><i>5863</i></b> and to see theatre! To be a part of expression and freedom.</p>
<p>Through our research on the stories of rape and abuse throughout the prison systems in America, we felt it was important to raise questions in <b><i>5863</i></b> regarding basic human rights.  We will be giving back a percentage of our ticket sales to Prison Activist, which supports prisoners by giving resources to all inmates no matter what. </p>

<p>Funding will also go towards our design team – these are only paying jobs if we raise the money to pay them. A set which can be used again as we look ahead to future theatre festivals. The <b><i>5863</i></b> image, which has been printed into posters and postcards for promotional material in order to sell tickets. All the other little things add up too: props, costumes, make-up (it ain’t cheap making our handsome actor look like a prisoner), videography. Did we mention this is a multi-media piece? Because it is! And that adds to the bill- filming/editing, recording voice-over. It’s not as expensive as shooting a movie, but the little things add up.</p>

Through our research on the stories of rape and abuse throughout the prison systems in America, we felt it was important to raise questions in 5863 regarding basic human rights.  We will be giving back a percentage of our ticket sales to Prison Activist, which supports prisoners by giving resources to all inmates no matter what. 

Funding will also go towards our design team – these are only paying jobs if we raise the money to pay them. A set which can be used again as we look ahead to future theatre festivals. The 5863 image, which has been printed into posters and postcards for promotional material in order to sell tickets. All the other little things add up too: props, costumes, make-up (it ain’t cheap making our handsome actor look like a prisoner), videography. Did we mention this is a multi-media piece? Because it is! And that adds to the bill- filming/editing, recording voice-over. It’s not as expensive as shooting a movie, but the little things add up.

If you can’t donate, you can help spread the word by sharing on FB, coming to the show, telling friends, or forward that email! 
We look forward to sharing this experience with you. Thank you for your energy and generous donations.

5863 opens April 24 at the Eclectic Company Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Throughout our careers at Wesleyan University, we have been lucky enough to work on excellent theatrical productions in various roles, including performing, stage managing, production assisting, costuming, directing, and choreographing. As we come to the end  of our time at Wesleyan, we want to employ all of our accumulated theater experience, and also stretch our boundaries just a little bit, by producing a show from the ground up. Our vision is to create an entirely student run, i<span>ndependently produced, full-length outdoor production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Our goal is to create a traditional-style Shakespearean show, that maintains the integrity of the text as written, while simultaneously striving to create an atmosphere which is social, joyful, and highly entertaining, making the play more accessible to a contemporary audience without distracting from the importance of the language itself. Our hope is that by independently producing Midsummer, we will learn what it really takes to put on a show from the bottom up. We are also excited to create an artistic piece that is exclusively ours, with no limits or regulations on our creative processes. We know that this will be challenging, and we embrace it. In anticipating the challenges that will surely arise as we make the transition from college life to the real world (especially pursuing careers in theater), we hope that this smaller-scale endeavor will be a valuable learning experience.</span> </div><div>Our production is scheduled for Friday April 24th, Saturday April 25th, and Sunday April 26th at 6PM in the Russell House Garden at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.

<p>The work
proposes a fictional crossroad between two artistic personalities, Mexican
painter Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) and the American-born writer Sylvia Plath
(1932-1963). The play is an encounter that never happened in reality. The
audience confronts the intense experiences of these women in the same space.
They will find biographical details and references of their lives, but above
all, their relationship with art, love, and death. The play will reveal pieces
of their paths marked by a fatal destiny.</p>
<p>Frida's life
was defined by pain and love. While recovering in bed from a terrible
automobile accident  suffered at an early age, she discovers painting and
earns a prominent place in Mexican Art.  Powerful  love and belief in
the revolution connects her with Diego Rivera, world famous muralist whom
became her husband. Marked by a stormy relationship and intense emotional and
physical pain that never fades away, Frida dies at age 47.</p>
<p>Sylvia
published her first poem at age eight. Under a beautiful and seemingly perfect
life reflected in her verses, underlies darkness and struggle with feelings
of self-destruction that haunted her. She married the English poet Ted Hughes,
an intense and tumultuous marriage that crumbled despite having two children together.  Sylvia
had always struggled with finding her own identity and oscillated between
moments of intense joy with moments of deep darkness.  At age 30, she commits suicide.</p>
<p>An
extraordinary encounter of two icons of Contemporary Art, in which they share
the most intimate and passionate moments of their lives. </p>

<p>We’re thrilled about these opportunities -- they’re a chance to encounter lots of people who have never seen our work before.

<p>We’ve sat down and worked out a budget for what we’re calling our summer season. Here’s where the money from this campaign will go:</p>
<p>-$2200 will cover the creation and premiere of THE TOP in May. We’ve been hard at work putting the finishing touches on this piece, which has been in and out of development for the past two year. We’re working with our longtime designer Andrew Thompson and we’ve brought on the inimitable Mel Krodman as a performer. Money from this campaign will help cover artist fees, equipment rental, and rehearsal space. </p>
<p>-$1000 will cover the remount and presentation of Abbot Adam: Evensong in June. We’re honored to have been selected to present a piece as part of Ars Nova’s ANT Fest. An annual showcase of new work and emerging talent, ANT Fest is an incredible opportunity to work with one of NYC’s most exciting off-broadway companies. Money from this campaign will help cover artist fees, and technical equipment rentals and transport.</p>
<p>-$2000 will cover our tour of THE TOP to Chicago. We’re lucky enough to be presenting this piece at Links Hall. Though this piece has no set, touring it will still require a lot of logistics: travel, housing, and food. Money from this campaign will cover these touring expenses as well as artist fees. </p>
<p>-$500 will help us cover the processing fees for this crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To thank you for your support, we've got some exciting perks related to these pieces in the right-hand column. Including, but not limited to: exclusive music and sound compositions from the Abbot Adam cycle, dinner with No Face, a personalized video version of THE TOP, and special blessings from Sisters Sibyl and Sistine.</span></p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>This campaign will help us take full advantage of three different chances to show our work to new audiences. With your support, we’ll have the time and space to devote ourselves fully to making each show the best it can be. We’re experienced at self-producing, having worked consistently in Philadelphia for almost 5 years. Now we’re at a critical juncture in our work together, beginning to partner with presenters to share our work with their audiences. Your support at this time would help us leverage this exposure into more opportunities to perform.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>It’s not easy to self-produce your work. It takes diligence, planning, and focus. And that’s just the fun part (actually making the show). Self-producing also requires a lot of administrative work: booking space, planning rehearsals, coordinating load-ins and strikes, and of course, fundraising to make all of the above happen. With this campaign, we’re hoping that the knowledge that we have the money we need to cover our expenses will give us more time to focus on doing what needs to be done to make the show a success.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $3,000 to cover the costs of putting on Almost, Maine, the first ever production of Four Walls and a Stage.</p>
<p>While everyone involved in this production is a working professional in her field, this is a labor of love and a passion project for us as we lay the foundation for the future of our company.</p>
<p>We are doing this for a little as possible while maintaining a commitment to honor everyone's hard work, passion, and talent in telling this story.</p>
<p>From the filmmaker who shot our funding video to our amazing lighting designer whose resume left our jaws on the floor, we have been incredibly fortunate to have so many industry professionals support us in donating their time and talents for little to nothing in return. However, we still need funding to cover costs that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance Rights</li>
<li>Theatre Rental Fee</li>
<li>Printing Costs (posters, postcards, programs, etc.)</li>
<li>Sets (design, materials, labor, etc.)</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Music Rights</li>
<li>Lights (design, equipment)</li>
<li>Fundraising Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>We have put together some perks for different levels of donation as a small token of our gratitude. No matter what you are able to donate, every little bit helps, and every little bit means a whole lot to us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Representation matters.</p>
<p>Almost, Maine is a beautiful story that has been performed countless times. However, like most love stories, it focuses primarily on heterosexual couples. Most of what we see in the media of LGBTQ+ individuals is a very narrow representation, especially with lesbians. As lesbians, we may have a bias here, but we also have a heightened sensitivity to this issue.</p>
<p>With your contribution, you are supporting the LGBTQ+ community and helping to give us a platform to have our stories seen and heard. We believe in the power of art to make meaningful, impactful, positive changes in the world and in individuals.</p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to have funds left over after this production, it will be used to further develop and advance Four Walls and a Stage in our commitment to human-centric stories focusing on women and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford to donate, no worries! As a group of Los Angeles artists, we get it. You can still help us spread the word about this campaign and our company, and we would love it if you to came to see Almost, Maine at the Chromolume Theatre on March 9th, 10th, or 11th.</p>

If we are new friends, let me describe myself for you.
My name is Buck.
I am a writer and performer
of plays and poetry.
A storyteller.
Sometimes, to tell 
favorite stories, 
oldest jokes,
and newest tales,
we have to invent some things along the way...
This campaign is lovingly spread to my friends
in search of support for production costs for The One About Us,
a solo performance on a ladder, coming to Boulder in May 2018.
This includes the cost of parts and labor for the engineers to design and build this
9 foot endlessly looping ladder.That's right - this campaign is funding the build of a special ladder, 
which I am going to climb for the entire performance.
It needs to be a loop on gears, 
and it needs to be specially designed, engineered, and built!
 
The design funded by this campaign is WHOLLY UNIQUE
- as much a work of art as a working machine.

In other words...
Your help goes towards the cost to
make the ladder a reality,
source costumes,

<h3>BACKGROUND &amp; PURPOSE</h3>
<p>My name is Taylor Blaze Lindemann, and I am a Senior Honors BFA Theatre major at Millikin University. I have been working on this project for about two years now, which will culminate this semester in a two performance fully-mounted run on April 27th and 28th.</p>
<p>My reasons for starting this campaign is simple; I want this to be the absolute best production it can possibly be, but there are some things that a college student can't afford on a college students budget. Securing a performance space, costuming, make up, props, and various other necessary aspects of the show all come at a price, a price I cannot independently meet without the help of others.</p>
<p>All donations to this campaign will go towards funding the production, which I will use as frugally as possible. Any and all overhead from the production, including any donations at the door, will be promptly donated to Theatre for Young Audiences/USA, a national service organization dedicated to expanding, promoting, and encouraging professional theatre for young people of diverse backgrounds, while also innovating and advancing the art form with them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the production, there are multiple costs as I identified above, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible venue cost </li>
<li>Make-up, hair dye, and other cosmetics for the performers</li>
<li>Costuming the Actors, including specialty items such as masks</li>
<li>Necessary props</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated before, any and all overhead or proceeds from this fundraiser or the production itself will be donated to TYA/USA.</p>
<p>PERKS! While I can't offer a lot, I can promise these small rewards for your generous donations:</p>
<p><strong>$5</strong> - A personalized thank you e-mail from me, as well as priority entry for your choice of show night, either April 27th or 28th. Priority entry is first come first serve basis.</p>
<p><b>$10</b> - Personalized e-mail, priority entry, AND a limited edition Prince Hal coozie, with the following logo:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517007296/s6uehra9f76sxbqoimot.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>$25 </strong>- Priority Entry, a pair of limited edition Prince Hal coozies, and a personalized video message from the cast.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This project will give many student theatrical artists an opportunity to work within an avant-garde style not typically explored on a college campus, as well as creating performance and design opportunities that wouldn't otherwise be available to them. It will also introduce it's audience to a new style of theatre which is growing in popularity, and immerse the audience in a world they may or may not be familiar with, expanding cultural understanding and community involvement with varying lifestyles. </p>
<p>This could truly make a difference in the Millikin and Decatur theatre communities, and show aspiring producers, directors, and performers in these communities that it is possible to create compelling theatre on your own. Thank you, for any help you can give. It means more than you know.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Created in 2017 by Anna Pillot, Emerging Choreographers Project both features original works by up and coming choreographers, as well as provides free access to concert dance for the New York Capital Region community. Each performance is concluded with a talk back where the audience can engage in a dialogue with the choreographers and performers. </p>
<p>For the past three years, ECP has been made possible in part due to funds from the Decentralization Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature and administered by The Arts Center of the Capital Region. Due to a break in funding after three years, for 2020 we are looking elsewhere to generate the financial support we need. The project continues to grow year over year, and we need your support to make it all happen.</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>After a successful run in New York City, we're taking our production to the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, renowned as the largest international arts festival in the world. We are raising <strong>$17,298</strong> to bring Hitler's Tasters to Europe. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Play</h3>
<p>Hitler’s Tasters is a dark comedy about the young women who have the “honor” of being Adolph Hitler’s food tasters. Based on true events, the play explores the way girls navigate sexuality, friendship, patriotism and poison during the Third Reich.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mark Travis Rivera has been choreographing for over ten years. He is the founder of marked dance project, a contemporary dance company for disabled and non-disabled dancers. Now creating under the banner of Mark Travis Dance-- a contemporary-based group of storytellers, Mark is creating his first work since relocating to Oakland, CA for the Queering Dance Festival sponsored by Shawl-Anderson Dance Center. </p>
<p>His new work, <i>Disclosure </i> will tackle the stigma and shame associated with HIV. According to the Center for Disease Control, Latino men accounted for 90 percent of new HIV infections among Latinos in 2016, and 88 percent of these were among Latino gay and bisexual men. African American men accounted for three-quarters of new HIV infections among African Americans in 2016, and 80 percent of these were among African American gay and bisexual men. <i>Disclosure</i> will explore the story of revealing one's diagnosis to a lover and the fear that stems from isolation, rejection, and abandonment.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mark is offering (2) dancers a $15 travel stipend per rehearsal (5 rehearsals total); plus an honorarium of $300 for time spent rehearsing and $150 honorarium for (3) performances</li>
<li>Costumes: $75</li>
<li>Space rental: $75 </li>
<li>Bringing the total cost to: <strong>$1,500. </strong>  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow Mark to create a new work that speaks to an issue that is prevailing in our country-- stigma and shame around one's HIV status. It's time to de-stigmatize HIV and inform people about the virus and note that it doesn't make one less worthy of love and belonging. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The subject matter may upset some people </li>
<li>Fundraising $1,500 is a lot of money but Mark has successfully fundraise in the past and believe in his vision for <i>Disclosure. </i>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>Mark recognizes that not everyone can contribute financially but spreading the word about the campaign would be appreciated. </li></ul>

Your contribution will allow Mark to create a new work that speaks to an issue that is prevailing in our country-- stigma and shame around one's HIV status. It's time to de-stigmatize HIV and inform people about the virus and note that it doesn't make one less worthy of love and belonging. 

Risks & Challenges

The subject matter may upset some people 
Fundraising $1,500 is a lot of money but Mark has successfully fundraise in the past and believe in his vision for Disclosure.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a very ambitious and important project for our company.  We have been working on it since 2009, and   we are so excited to finally share it with audiences!  It features a diverse creative team of international artists   who will share their incredible talents with Toronto youth across the city through teaching free workshops. They will also help foster an appreciation for Japanese artists through  their stunning performances.  This play  employs a unique set made entirely of paper, as well as one of a kind puppets, and live drumming rarely seen   on stages in Canada.  As one of the only companies in Toronto committed to performing Japanese stories, this production provides an important outlet to introduce Japanese culture to larger audiences, and to celebrate the life and work of this important  writer.  It is also the chance to create a piece of theatre that can travel to Japan where we can make more connections, and encourage more exchange and communication between our two countries.     <br/></p>

<p><strong>Maine Playwrights Festival</strong><br/><strong>April 25 - May 5, 2013</strong><br/><strong>St. Lawrence Center for the Arts, Portland</strong></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Acorn Productions started the Maine Playwrights Festival as part of our mission to nurture theater artists. Now in its 12th year, the MPF is Maine's premiere incubator for new plays. Over the years we have been proud to present hundreds of world premiere plays, some of which have gone on to be produced at Festivals in New York and elsewhere. For playwrights, this is an invaluable opportunity to see their words interpreted by directors and actors and see how audiences react. For the actors it is a unique chance to originate characters that will set the standard for future productions of the work. For the audience it is an introduction to emerging and established playwrights who live and write here in Maine. Who knows...some day one of these playwrights could be accepting a prestigious award for one of their plays and you can say ""I was there when they got their start at the Maine Playwrights Festival!""</p>
Your contribution toward our $3,000 goal helps make it possible for Acorn to provide this important service to our community by helping with overhead costs for this vibrant and exciting new works festival.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our $3,000 indiegogo campaign goal bridges the gap between our anticipated expenses and our anticipated ticket sales and sponsorship revenue. This funding will be divided among all the essential aspects of the Festival: publicity, technical and directorial staff, tech materials (such as costumes, props, paint, lighting gel, and glowtape for backstage safety), and venue rental fees.</p>
<p>Your contribution is important to us, but we don't want that to be the end of your association with the Festival. We want you to see the plays you support, so we are offering rewards ranging from a ticket to a performance for donations of $50 to all-access passes (attend any and all performances and meet the cast) for donations of $250 and up, and even a chance to appear on stage during the Festival for donations of $1000 or more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is essential as we bridge the gap between what it costs to put the Maine Playwrights Festival on and what we bring in from ticket sales. Donations of all sizes matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your $25 donation prints ~50 playbills to tell our audience about the plays and playwrights.</li>
<li>Your $50 donation purchases ~5 sheets of lighting gel to paint the stage with color.</li>
<li>Your $100 donation purchases an ad to spread the word about the Festival and fill the house.</li>
<li>Your $300 donation covers the rental cost for one performance.</li>
<li>Your $500 donation covers much of the cost to design and print publicity materials for the festival.</li>

For 15 years, Yehoodi.com has been providing, free of charge, an online home for the lindy hop community.  We’ve run discussion forums, live events like the Basie Centennial, streaming online swing radio, and audio/video podcasts like the Yehoodi Talk Show, Hey Mr. Jesse and SwingNation.
In all of that time, we have never asked for a dime from our members and viewers.  Today is the first time on all those years we are asking the lindy hop community for support. 
Last year, we went to the International Lindy Hop Championships in Washington DC and produced our first live on-site dance competition show. Using basic production equipment and a skeleton crew, we were able to put on a high quality production that had 23,000+ views over the weekend, with viewers logging in from Korea, Sweden, Australia and many more countries. We heard from hundreds of you how much you enjoyed the live broadcast and the video archive later.  
This year, we think we can do even better. We have an opportunity to create a television-quality, high definition video production from ILHC.  But we need your help.
 Here’s what we need:


bad ass equipment


a killer production team

 Luckily, we are close to having both. But we need additional funding to get this production going. 
Bad Ass Video Production Tools
The NewTek Tricaster 40 is a state-of-the-art compact video switcher and live production box.  It’s like what we currently use for ""SwingNation,"" but much, much better.  It can:


pull in live footage from up to 4 different HD cameras, 


display HD quality video, 


play pre-recorded footage,


handle titles, transitions, ""picture-in-picture"" and more like a champ

In short, it will enable us to show ILHC -- and any other swing event in the future -- with HD television quality production values.
To take full advantage of this system, we will also need at least one HD camera capable of interfacing with the Tricaster. 
A Killer Production Team
As we demonstrated at ILHC and continue to do so on our weekly show ""SwingNation,"" we can put out a high quality video production on a shoestring. Our full production crew includes:

Producer Manu ""Spuds"" Smith
Managing Editor Rik ""Rikomatic"" Panganiban
Co-host Nicole ""Zuckerpunch"" Zuckerman
Videographer Jim Thorpe 
We have had two seasons of shows to develop our pre-, live and post-production chops, and we think we work pretty darn well together. Your support will make it possible for all of us to be in DC for ILHC.

<p> </p>
<p>I studied theatre, got degrees in it, performed in NYC, Chicago, Minnesota, Seattle, etc. now I find that my passion lies in sharing my knowledge and experience with others.  I especially love it when I watch someone's personality come to life on the stage.  The friendships that we make in theatre are like none other and are lifelong.</p>

Jenny Newbry Waters is an actor who believes in exploring human nature at its most extreme and vulnerable moments, in order to illuminate universal truths. <em>Fool for Love </em>by Pulitizer Prize Winning playwright Sam Shepard, about the electricity of a volatile and unexpected relationship, provides plenty of fuel to fire our artistic energies.</p>
<p>Jenny has wanted to play May in <em>Fool for Love</em> ever since she tackled the opening scene for her first acting class in college. “These characters are vibrating with electricity,” Jenny says.  “It’s as if they have been struck by the lightning of those famous Mojave desert storms where the play takes place.  The electricity simultaneously binds them together and forces them apart, resulting in a snarling, messy, impassioned avalanche of stunts, driving recklessly to a conclusion that will leave you breathless.”</p>
<p><em>Fool for Love </em>runs Thursdays through Sundays, April 5<sup>th</sup> – 21<sup>st</sup> at Backdoor Theatre in Portland, Oregon. The show features local Portland actors Jenny Newbry Waters, Arthur Delaney, Tommy Harrington, and Brian MacEwan. Local actor and producer, Patrick J. Cox, is co-producing the show and local musician, Tobias Ryan, is serving as music director.</p>
<p>Patrick, Tobias, and Asae have worked together on various theatrical projects over the past four years, including Asae Dean Productions’ inaugural show, <em>How I Learned to Drive </em>by Paula Vogel<em>, </em>in September 2012<em>, </em>and <em>Cressida</em>, an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>, in January-February 2013.</p>

<h3>Featuring special guest artists Alec Baldwin, Kate Mulgrew and Anthony Rapp, Fundamental Theater Project shines a contemporary light on this classic tale.</h3><font size=""2"">
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>Fundamental Theater Project was launched in April 2010. Over the past year, we have collaborated with established industry professionals and emerging artists creating a trans-atlantic theater community focused on the fundamental attributes of theater. After a successful benefit reading of Hamlet in November 2010 starring Alec Baldwin and Kate Mulgrew, we are developing an 80-minute contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare’s classic that resonates with audiences today. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 2011 Edinburgh Fringe Festival marks our first international production. We need your help getting our company members ""across the pond.""</p>

<p><strong>A LOST GENERATION</strong></p>
<p>Every generation has had to pay the price for the mistakes of its predecessors: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/europe/02youth.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/europe/02youth.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/europe/...</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This New York Times article was the initial spark for centering our production of Hamlet around the idea the Lost Generation of today. A population of educated, eager young citizens are faced with the realities of the previous generation’s mistakes and coruptive practices. With this production, FTP discusses what our generation’s role is in the current economic and political climate? Do we take action? If so, what action do we take?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ELSINORE IN 3D</strong></p>
<p>Today nearly every movie released can be viewed in 3D, inviting the audience to share in the action onscreen. In our staging, Hamlet is physically surrounded by the company of actors, feeling the intimacy and pressure of the action as well as observing the manipulations of those around him. Incorporating a blend of film footage and projected images, we add another dimension to the audience’s experience of the text and physical action. In addition to our 2D images and 3D actors, we are hoping to produce some segments in 3D film.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PLAYERS</strong></p>
<p>Our production will feature a rotating cast of both established and emerging actors, including Spencer Aste, Kate Mulgrew, Nicola Murphy, Anthony Rapp, Sam Underwood, Jennifer Van Dyck, Jonathan Walker and a special appearance by Alec Baldwin as the Ghost of Hamlet’s Father. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p>
<p>Our total budget for the production is $80,000, of which we have already raised $20,000. Our goal is to raise $20,000 of the remaining $60,000 online to offset the cost of travel, accommodations and living expenses for the cast and company during the month of August in Edinburgh. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1,000 – Airfare for one company member from New York City to Edinburgh, Scotland</p>

After a successful benefit reading of Hamlet in November 2010 starring Alec Baldwin and Kate Mulgrew, we are developing an 80-minute contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare’s classic that resonates with audiences today. 
 
The 2011 Edinburgh Fringe Festival marks our first international production. We need your help getting our company members ""across the pond.""

A LOST GENERATION
Every generation has had to pay the price for the mistakes of its predecessors: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/europe/... 
 
This New York Times article was the initial spark for centering our production of Hamlet around the idea the Lost Generation of today. A population of educated, eager young citizens are faced with the realities of the previous generation’s mistakes and coruptive practices. With this production, FTP discusses what our generation’s role is in the current economic and political climate? Do we take action? If so, what action do we take?
 
ELSINORE IN 3D
Today nearly every movie released can be viewed in 3D, inviting the audience to share in the action onscreen. In our staging, Hamlet is physically surrounded by the company of actors, feeling the intimacy and pressure of the action as well as observing the manipulations of those around him. Incorporating a blend of film footage and projected images, we add another dimension to the audience’s experience of the text and physical action. In addition to our 2D images and 3D actors, we are hoping to produce some segments in 3D film.
 
THE PLAYERS
Our production will feature a rotating cast of both established and emerging actors, including Spencer Aste, Kate Mulgrew, Nicola Murphy, Anthony Rapp, Sam Underwood, Jennifer Van Dyck, Jonathan Walker and a special appearance by Alec Baldwin as the Ghost of Hamlet’s Father. 
 
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Our total budget for the production is $80,000, of which we have already raised $20,000. Our goal is to raise $20,000 of the remaining $60,000 online to offset the cost of travel, accommodations and living expenses for the cast and company during the month of August in Edinburgh. 
 
$1,000 – Airfare for one company member from New York City to Edinburgh, Scotland
$2,000 – Airfare and accommodations in Edinburgh for one company member
$2,750 – Airfare, accommodations and living expenses for one company member

<p><em>Persephone's Fall</em> is a massive undertaking with a cast of 4 musicians, 9 adult dancers, one child dancer, and many talented people helping with the overall design of the production. The music for this show is being composed and performed live by the immensely talented group <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/theghostsproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ghosts Project</a>.  Thus far, the development has been a wonderful collaborative experience, with each artist bringing a new layer and nuance to the final story.</p>
<p>The most well known version of the Persephone and Hades tale is very dark. We are telling a different version. There are interpretations of the myth in which Persephone chooses to travel to the Underworld, in which the focus is on the growth and development of Persephone from a protected child to a strong-willed woman, ultimately the Queen of the Underworld. That was the story that captured my imagination. I love studying human relationships and I felt this iteration had so many intriguing ones. We start our tale with a lonely and proud Demeter, one of the only deities left to dwell in the mortal world. We see her relationship with her beautiful young daughter and how it does not change as that daughter reaches adulthood. Demeter is overly protective, and is so often the case, that intense love begins to smother her daughter. When Persephone meets Hades she is intrigued and eager to step outside of her small world.</p>
<p>Hades himself is fascinating in that he is a strong, powerful figure, king over all of the Underworld. But what a lonely place over which to rule, full of ghosts and spirits. Just as Persephone needs room to breathe, Hades’s Underworld needs that touch of breath.  The Underworld has many sides to it, elements that Persephone must accept and understand in order to make her choice about whether to stay or go.</p>
<p>There’s the River of Souls overseen by Charon, and the glorious Elysian Fields. There’s the Furies, not keen on being supplanted by this woman, who challenge her to prove she is capable of ruling them. Finally there is Tartarus, where the souls of the wicked dwell in torment. Persephone cannot be merely an observer to these places, she has to understand them and accept them. She must make her choice to stay or go on her own terms. Ultimately she breaks the rules and finds a way to live in both worlds.</p>
<p>As fantastical as the setting is for this tale, and that setting is something we relish playing with, the tale itself is as simple as a woman finding balance in her life between the various loves and demands she bears.</p>
<p>We need your help to bring this story to the stage.  All funding will go directly to production costs. These costs include theater rental, costumes and masks, technical fees, and artist payments. We deeply appreciate any help you can give. Even the smallest donations add up! More than anything, we’d love your help spreading the word about the show. Without a vibrant audience, no story is truly complete!</p>

<p>Science is already having enormous impact on this question in two ways. First, we are learning things about the universe – and about ourselves – that call into question many longstanding assumptions about who we are. Second, this new knowledge has enabled us to make and do things that change us and our relationships with the world around us.</p>
<p>At Infinity Box Theatre Project, we are committed to using the power of theater to pose questions about the human consequences of science and technology. We provide a catalyst for conversation about what it means to be human in our rapidly changing world.</p>
<p><strong>Thought Experiments on the Question of Being Human</strong></p>
<p><em>Thought Experiments on the Question of Being Human</em> is a multi-year project where each year we team 5 scientists with 5 playwrights who together create short works examining that question.</p>
<p>The theme for 2013 is Robots and Artificial Intelligence. Our question this year is: “How might current and possible future innovations in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence change what it means to be human?”  We invited five scientists working with robots or AI and teamed each scientist with a local Seattle playwright. Their collaborations have led to the creation of five intriguing short plays, each of which provides a unique perspective on that question.</p>
<p>Each evening includes plays, followed by a scientist-led conversation, where the audience can explore the questions and issues raised by the plays about the impact robots and artificial intelligence may have on their lives.</p>
<p><em>Thought Experiments: Robots and AI</em> is scheduled for  June 13, 14, &amp; 15 at Town Hall, Seattle –  as Signature Program of the 2013 Seattle Science Festival..</p>
<p><strong>What we will do with the money?</strong></p>
<p>Simple:  Pay the rent.  As part of the Seattle Science Festival, we have kept our ticket prices very low so as many people as possible can come and participate.  If you can help us cover the rent (which is due in advance, by the way) we can use proceeds from ticket sales to pay the fine group of playwrights, directors and actors we have gathered to get these stories on stage. </p>

<h3>What is Guamanique?</h3>
<p>Guamanique is a nonprofit performing arts company from Puerto Rico.  Our mission is to promote Puerto Rican music, dances and traditions. We accomplish this through performances and shows designed for students, tourists and communities throughout the island.<br/><br/>It all started almost two decades ago, when a group of high school students, followed the lead of our founder and artistic director, Dr. Eduardo Calderon. Today, there are more than 30 active members and hundreds of young students have participated in our programs. <br/><br/>Internationally, we have represented Puerto Rico in festivals in 25 countries.  In these exchanges, we either perform in big metropolitan cities as well as in rural communities and villages. We participate in conferences, offer interviews to the media, take music and dance workshops and we teach Puerto Rican dances, usually to very large groups.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>What is the project about?</strong></h3>
<div>This year, Guamanique was invited to Ecuador, to perform along with folkdance groups from 6 Latin American countries. The tour will take place from the 8th to the 16th of June, 2013. <br/><br/>You might ask why is this so important for you to back it. We feel it is important for us to share our cultural heritage and identity. Thanks to exchanges like this one people from every continent have been in contact with our music, thousands have entered in the rhythmic challenge of the Bomba, or joined a crowd dancing our Plena through the streets. These experiences enrich both our personal lives and our professional development as well. <br/><br/>We have made many fundraising activities during the past few months. But because of government cuts and lack of funding opportunities in the arts, we haven't met our goal for everyone to get onboard. At this moment, we are $5,000 short. So that's the reason why we decided to launch this campaing. We are asking you to be part of this project. We need your help to accomplish it.<br/><br/>So that you know, all the accommodations, meals and transportation will be provided by the host organization. We just need to raise the necessary funds to complete the costs of traveling to Ecuador.<br/><br/><strong>Benefits</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will never be able to repay you for your support, but we came up with a few ideas to express our gratitude. Check the backers descriptions. <br/><br/>Plus, you'll have the great satisfaction of helping a cultural nonprofit with a serious and proven commitment with the youth.  <br/><br/>And one more thing, if you are in Puerto Rico or in the US, since we are a tax-exempt organization, your contribution can be deducted in your next tax returns. <br/><br/>We are counting with your support to make this tour to Ecuador a reality.</div></div>","What is Guamanique?

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Since 2008, we’ve traveled with over 65 American students to four countries, 21 cities, 45 communities, and performed for many audiences of
over 1,000. We create friendships throughout the world. We have emerged as the
first and only dance collective of university students at various competitive
dance conservatories dedicated to creating community across international
borders. In partnering with various groups in Central America, JUNTOS has
introduced an innovative method in which participants establish, maintain and
strengthen relationships through dance, both national and international. Simultaneously,
the company encourages and initiates growth of individual skills that create
leaders and persons dedicated to serving others. </p>

<p><b>What is Pandora’s Circus?</b></p>
<p><i>Do

opened? </i><br/></p>
<p>Pandora’s Circus is a Cirque Style Theater show about <span>Pandora, who opens the box and lets all of the
vengeful spirits into the world. They drag her to the Underworld, but not
before hope floats as a red balloon out of the box.<br/><br/>
Pandora finds herself in a world of never-ending
night full of strange characters that seem to ignore the rules and gravity and
physical limitations. Some Underworld creatures aid her in her quest to return
to the world of light and others seek to do her harm. In order to return, she
must overcome her fears and go through the trials she find in there. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pandora’s
Circus will spark the belief that anything is possible. There’s nothing like
the thrill of live aerialists on stage twisting into fabric and dropping to
inches above the ground, graceful acrobatic dances, and so much more. The show
tells a timeless story in a way that could never be conveyed with words. You
will be whisked away on a magical journey without ever leaving your seat.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""We have always felt that something is wrong,<br/>The backs of our minds have been awhir.<br/>Everything is infected by it,<br/>Everybody knows it,<br/>Everybody is possessed by wondering about it,<br/>At least sometimes.</p>
<p>What is it?<br/>What is <span class=""il"">wrong</span>?<br/>What is <span class=""il"">something</span>?<br/>What is is?<br/>We don't know.<br/>We haven't got a clue.""</p>
<p>Thus begins <em>Something Is Wrong,</em> written and directed by William Rasitsan-Powell, designed by Beata Rasitsan-Powell, and produced by the fledgling Naught, A Theatre Company.<em> </em>We begin with difficult questions that stare us in the face and refuse to move. These are the questions that lie underneath, that hide in the shadows, that flit around our heads in the night. </p>
<p>The play draws influence from the most ancient form of theatre: Greek Tragedy. We begin with a Chorus of men and women who are posessed and infected by these questions. They fight to keep their eyes open, to stare the questions in the face, but it proves to be too much for them:</p>
<p>""We are tired,<br/>We have bloodied our fists on the iron door,<br/>We have felt the ground slowly crumble beneath our feet.<br/>We have had enough of this.""</p>
<p>The Chorus decides that they must have been mistaken: that nothing is <span class=""il"">wrong</span>. That they should go home and stop worrying. All of them except one, that is: Thespis, who refuses to admit that nothing is <span class=""il"">wrong</span>. It is Thespis' determination to continue searching for answers that propels the play.</p>
<p>On the journey, we meet Daemon, the Chorus' protector against the pesky Thespis, and Iris, a magnetic spirit who is intrigued and mystified by the whole situation. We travel into the consuming void, to a cottage, through the desert, and to a Chinese tea-house in the search for what, if anything, is <span class=""il"">wrong</span>, and what, if anything, we can do.</p>
<p>The piece integrates poetic text, dance, original music and song to create and guide us through its mysterious setting. And yes, there will be blood. </p>
<p><span>“How hard is it, when everything encourages us to sleep, though we may look about us with conscious, clinging eyes, to wake and yet look about us as in a dream, with eyes that no longer know their function and whose gaze is turned inward.”</span></p>

CKDC started as a performance ensemble and quickly grew to a large organization of many artists with shared interests. In order to fund our projects and aspirations, CKDC began offering dance classes as an independent group in August of 2012. With the efforts and support of people like you we were able to find an awesome studio to call home. In our new studio, CKDC's classes are growing but we still can't raise enough money to rent a theater to perform our works.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to deepen my collaboration with a number of Multiple Sclerosis Societies in the South East and to explore the movement of people affected by MS. <br/>My most recent choreographic work has evolved around my mother's diagnosis with MS - 'You Remind Me' deals with my grief after my mother's initial diagnosis, while '12 Months On' is a portrayal of life with the disease, trying to deal with it and moving on with life at the same time. <br/>With this new project I would like to delve deeper into my work with the MS societies. Having already established a good working relationship with several of them through my Big Dance 2012 project 'Let's face the MS and dance' I would like to return to the studio with MS patients, this time with two perspectives: <br/>1. Continue the work from 'Let's face the MS and dance' by working on some of the specific elements that MS patients struggle with: balance, co-ordination and memory and thus helping them cope with their diagnosis and improve their relationship with their body. The aim of the workshops is to help the MS patients engage with dance in an environment where they feel safe and comfortable as this can benefit them both physically and mentally, showing them that everybody can benefit from dance, regardless of abilities. <br/>2. Research the MS patients as I work with them - looking at their movement, listening to their experiences, understanding their bodies - and take this back to the studio to develop new movement material derived from the workshops and create a new piece of work based on this material. <br/>Furthermore, I hope that the strong connection between the workshops and the new piece will encourage attendance from MS patients and their families, providing not only a cultural day out but also a new perspective on their illness.</p>

<h3>Key Facts about MS</h3>
<ul>
<li>More than 100,000 people in the UK have multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
<li>More women then men are diagnosed with MS</li>
<li>Multiple sclerosis is not inherited, but family members do have a slightly higher risk of developing MS </li>
<li>It is usually diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s</li>
<li>MS is a disease affecting the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)</li>
<li>Symptoms can come and go and can vary greatly in terms of severity</li>
<li>There may be periods of relapse of varying length and severity</li>
<li>Everyone's MS is different</li>
<li>MS is not a fatal condition</li>
<li>It is neither infectious nor contagious</li>
<li>Most people diagnosed with MS will not need to use a wheelchair on a regular basis</li>
<li>At present, there is no cure for MS but this certainly doesn't mean that the symptoms of MS cannot be treated</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need.... </h3>
<p>We need to be able to raise funds to ensure that we deliver high quality workshops. Working in partnership with local MS therapy centres and branches, we must ensure the work being delivered is of benefit to all participants.</p>
<p>By reaching our goals I will be able to ensure that dancers are paid for their development of this work, and invite industry professionals down to our work-in-progress sharing to get the work programmed into venues to continue raising awareness of MS and the effects it has on people who are diagnosed with the disease, their family and friends.</p>
<h3>&amp; What You Get....</h3>
<p>By donating to this casue, you will be contributing to the awareness raising of MS.<br/>You will be enabling people with MS to engage in movement classes which can have a positive effect on balance and co-ordination, which in turn aids everyday living. Things we take for granted like making a cup of coffee or getting into the bath can be an exhausting experience for some people with MS, and these classes aim to give people the ability to listen to their bodies; to be able to stand up if they have taken a fall; to be able to improve co-ordination to help increase their quality of life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having already produced 2 projects with people with MS, I am keen to further develop these projects (this time with funding) to ensure I can work with high quality artists who understand the importance of being able to interpret the movement material as well as the emotions of people with MS. Sensitivity to the nature of this project is key, whilst ensuring we can raise awareness of MS and the effects it has on people. We envisage that the project can develop into a touring piece of dance to be seen around the country by a large number of people. This engagement and awareness raising is fundamental in this project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people might not be able to contribute money, but there are many other ways you can get involved in this project. You might want to dedicate some time, material or even knowledge to developing this project and helping to raise awareness about MS and th effects it has on people with it, and also their famillies.<br/>You might also help us spread the word by sharing on twitter, facebook, a blog or website.<br/>Maybe you know someone with MS who would like to get involved in dance classes but isn't sure how to take the first step... Well, pass on the information and they can get in touch with us, even if its just for an informal chat about the project and what we hope to achieve.</p>

<p><em>What makes a ""classic""?</em></p>
<p><em>This fall, The Brewing Dept. is tackling two projects with Shakespeare at their core. Though they approach their source texts in radically different ways, these projects share a common goal: changing how we watch, perform, and think about the classics.</em></p>
<p><em>We're half way through our work this fall, and we can't wait to share what's next - find out more below!</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>

</div>
<p>Director Tom Kapusta needed you to help him edit the text of <i>Othello</i> for a contemporary production of Shakespeare's great tragedy. Through a series of blog posts on The Brewing Dept.'s website, Tom shared his ideas on <i>Othello</i>, his process for creating a performance, and his reasoning behind how he edited the text.  It's not too late to join in the conversation by visiting us <a href=""http://thebrewingdept.org/tbd-blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here on our blog</a> - and definitely comment to let him know what you think!</p>
<p>The project culminated in a public reading with a full cast on October 26th at The Alchemical Theatre Laboratory.  We were thrilled so many of you could come, and we look forward to the future of the project with TBD!</p>

<h3>WHAT'S STILL TO COME:</h3>
<h3>HamletGhosts</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As the second half of TBD's fall programming, we're excited to present <i>HamletGhosts, </i>an electrifying blend of pop culture and Shakespeare that tears apart <i>Hamlet,</i> text, and theater itself.</p>
<p>Through a series of vignettes, the cast of <i>HamletGhosts </i>takes a look at Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> and then makes something else.  Director Cody Holliday Haefner’s radical vision examines the legacy of Shakespeare in our society; mixing <i>Hamlet</i> with Lady Gaga, Yahoo answers, and personal narratives in a piece that forces the audience to question their own complicity in the acts of madness and violence played out in front of them.  </p>
<p>The performance will take place on <span>November 20th</span> at Dixon Place, but you can get a look at the rehearsals through our<i> HamletGhosts</i> web series (which you can be a part of - check out our perks!) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pmlbRwk0rM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>!</p>

</div></div>","THE QUESTION: 
What makes a ""classic""?
This fall, The Brewing Dept. is tackling two projects with Shakespeare at their core. Though they approach their source texts in radically different ways, these projects share a common goal: changing how we watch, perform, and think about the classics.
We're half way through our work this fall, and we can't wait to share what's next - find out more below!

WHAT WE'VE DONE:
(Director's Notes on) Othello




Director Tom Kapusta needed you to help him edit the text of Othello for a contemporary production of Shakespeare's great tragedy. Through a series of blog posts on The Brewing Dept.'s website, Tom shared his ideas on Othello, his process for creating a performance, and his reasoning behind how he edited the text.  It's not too late to join in the conversation by visiting us here on our blog - and definitely comment to let him know what you think!
The project culminated in a public reading with a full cast on October 26th at The Alchemical Theatre Laboratory.  We were thrilled so many of you could come, and we look forward to the future of the project with TBD!




WHAT'S STILL TO COME:
HamletGhosts


As the second half of TBD's fall programming, we're excited to present HamletGhosts, an electrifying blend of pop culture and Shakespeare that tears apart Hamlet, text, and theater itself.
Through a series of vignettes, the cast of HamletGhosts takes a look at Shakespeare’s Hamlet and then makes something else.  Director Cody Holliday Haefner’s radical vision examines the legacy of Shakespeare in our society; mixing Hamlet with Lady Gaga, Yahoo answers, and personal narratives in a piece that forces the audience to question their own complicity in the acts of madness and violence played out in front of them.  
The performance will take place on November 20th at Dixon Place, but you can get a look at the rehearsals through our HamletGhosts web series (which you can be a part of - check out our perks!) HERE!




WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:
 We're absolutely thrilled to have been able to cover the costs of mounting our reading of Othello last month - but we're only half way done!  Help us enable these artists and their unique visions by donating to help cover basic consts like: 
Rehearsal Space

<p>My name is Yvonne Winborne and I am a dance minor at the Pennsylvania State University.  I am excited to announce that I have been given the opportunity this summer to study dance in Dublin, Ireland while acquiring credits I need to complete my dance minor program!  <em>The program is 4 weeks long from May 10-June 10, 2013. </em></p>
<p>I have been dancing my whole life ever since I was a little girl.  Growing up I danced at my church and a small dance school in Philadelphia before I came to Penn State.  My freshman year I auditioned for the dance program and was accepted.  As my college career is slowing coming to an end (one more year to go!), I am trying to check different things off of my college bucket list.  One of my items on my list was to leave my mark at Penn State, and just this past year I believe that this has been accomplished by starting my own dance organization, AMBITIONS, my sophomore year with three of my fellow dancers and friends.  Over the past year we have grown tremendously and have received much support from the Penn State campus.  Also on my list is to go study abroad doing something I love, and with your help soon I'll be able to check this off my list too!</p>

<h3>Matt Penny a.k.a. Frank, the Mind-reading Hotdog<br/>
</h3>
<br/><p>Over the years I've been an actor, magician, musician, filmmaker, animator, stand-up comedian, playwright, 
director and part time Karma-sutra model.  I've performed as a living statue on the street and played in bands in pubs.  <br/></p>
<p>Mainly though, I'm a cleaner!</p>
<p>In hindsight, I really feel that I tried to do too much.  I was Jack of all and master of none, so last year I decided to concentrate on the two things that have been constant all my life.  Magic and playing the piano.</p>
<p>As far as the piano goes I have been a pushing a piano around the Perth Cultural Centre for most of the year, sometimes playing soundtracks for Charlie Chaplin movies on the big screen and other times just playing because its a beautiful day.  I love it and I'm getting better and better at it.<br/></p>
<p>Before arriving in Perth I was resident magician in TGI Fridays in Covent Garden and Planet Hollywood in Leicester Square.  As a child I always had a fascination in magic and performed shows for friends and family. <br/></p>
<p>Since arriving in Perth I have performed magic at countless cooperate functions, restaurants and birthday parties but my preference is to create stage shows.  Here's the list so far... <br/></p>
<p>The Magic Matt Show @ The Blue Room Theatre (2 week season)<br/></p>
<p>Spirit Fingers @ The Blue Room Theatre (nominated peoples choice, Blue Room Awards). (3 week season).<br/></p>
<p>Magic Matt and the Naked Assistant @ Fringe World</p>
<p>Magic Matt Fully Loaded @ Fringe World</p>
<p>Magic Matt's Magic Slam x 3 (a magic competition that always sells out)<br/></p>

</div></div>","Matt Penny a.k.a. Frank, the Mind-reading Hotdog

Over the years I've been an actor, magician, musician, filmmaker, animator, stand-up comedian, playwright, 
director and part time Karma-sutra model.  I've performed as a living statue on the street and played in bands in pubs.  
Mainly though, I'm a cleaner!
In hindsight, I really feel that I tried to do too much.  I was Jack of all and master of none, so last year I decided to concentrate on the two things that have been constant all my life.  Magic and playing the piano.
As far as the piano goes I have been a pushing a piano around the Perth Cultural Centre for most of the year, sometimes playing soundtracks for Charlie Chaplin movies on the big screen and other times just playing because its a beautiful day.  I love it and I'm getting better and better at it.
Before arriving in Perth I was resident magician in TGI Fridays in Covent Garden and Planet Hollywood in Leicester Square.  As a child I always had a fascination in magic and performed shows for friends and family. 
Since arriving in Perth I have performed magic at countless cooperate functions, restaurants and birthday parties but my preference is to create stage shows.  Here's the list so far... 
The Magic Matt Show @ The Blue Room Theatre (2 week season)
Spirit Fingers @ The Blue Room Theatre (nominated peoples choice, Blue Room Awards). (3 week season).
Magic Matt and the Naked Assistant @ Fringe World
Magic Matt Fully Loaded @ Fringe World
Magic Matt's Magic Slam x 3 (a magic competition that always sells out)
In 2013 Micro Magic won 'Peoples Choice for multi media' at Fringe World.In 2014 'Experiments in Mind-reading and Crowd Cohesion' was nominated for best Cabaret act at Fringe World. 

For the past couple of years I have been studying mind-reading.  At the last Perth Fringe World I performed my first mind-reading show ('Experiments in Mind-reading and Crowd Cohesion') and it was a great success.  Over 400 people came and watched, it was nominated for the best cabaret award and it really ignited my passion for magic again.  After 15 years of performing the same kind of stuff it was fantastic to be doing new stuff and having the audience actually gasp in amazement. 
But, like all things, I needed an angle.   I had a few ideas and I asked friends (you know who you are) for more ideas and then one day it happened.  I hit the jackpot.
FRANK, THE MIND-READING HOTDOG

I've checked the internet.  There are no other mind-reading hotdogs in the world!!!  I've cornered the market. The mind-reading I've been studying is pretty phenomenal.  It often freaks me out as well as the audience.  The beauty of having a hot dog perform mentalism is that we can all have some fun with it! 
Please help me take Frank on tour.  I've never asked for donations before and, hopefully, I'll never have to again.  I'm just looking for some starting capitol to get the ball rolling.  Once it's moving I'm confident that I can keep it moving.  
I'm hoping to take the show around the world next year but I will be starting with...
Perth Fringe World (Feb 2014)

Dunedin Fringe (March 2014)
Things that cost money are applications, air fares, accommodation and food.  This is what you would be contributing towards.
Hopefully I'll be able to bring Frank to a town near you and I actually thank you personally for your help.
So, if you enjoy a good show, please contribute, even the smallest donation helps.  Please share this campaign with your friends.  I'm sure they would love giving money to some random hotdog that they don't even know and can't even eat!

<p>On April 6, 1903, the city of Kishinev, the capital of the Russian province of Bessarabia erupted in violence. A horrific pogrom was organized, targeting the Jewish population of Kishinev. After three days of violence, 49 Jews were dead, 500 were wounded, 1300 homes and businesses were destroyed and 2000 families were left homeless.</p>
<p>The young Hebrew poet, Haim NahmanBialik went to Kishinev to talk to survivors and report on the pogrom. Bialik wrote one of his most famous poems, ‘In The City Of Slaughter’ in response to the Kishinev pogrom, using searing, powerful imagery to describe the horror that descended upon the Jewish residents of the city.</p>
<p>Eighty one years later, Delhi, the capital of the largest democracy in the world, India, was witness to a horror of even greater proportions. On October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India was shot dead by her Sikh bodyguards. In retaliation, an orgy of murder, rape and arson was unleashed upon the Sikh residents of Delhi in which more than 3000 lost their lives.</p>
<p>The poem, ‘Kultar’s Mime’, written by a young Sikh poet, drew upon eyewitness accounts of the Delhi pogrom to describe the sufferings of the Sikhs of Delhi, through the eyes of a group of young survivors.</p>
<p>There are uncanny similarities between the Kishinev and Delhi pogroms. Both targeted minority communities with violence following libel, innuendo and propaganda, designed to stoke fear and hatred.</p>
<p>Kultar’s Mime, the play, synthesizes the sufferings of innocent victims of organized violence, separated by thousands of miles, numerous years and insurmountable differences of religion, language and culture. Drawing upon the raw imagery of both poems, it tells a story of human suffering and courage, reminding us that in the end all innocent victims are the same, regardless of which God they worship and what tongues they speak.</p>
<p>The play is set in New York City. A collective of young Jewish artists, influenced by Bialik’s ‘In The City of Slaughter’ decides to commemorate the Kishinev Pogrom by organizing an art exhibition in which they intend to display paintings about the pogrom accompanied by a reading of the poem. As they get together and revisit Bialik’s poem, it occurs to them that it would be very powerful to honor the suffering of the innocent victims of Kishinev by shining the spotlight on other similar instances of organized violence that the world has largely forgotten. They decide to focus on the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 in Delhi and make it the subject of their exhibition, using words from the poem to augment the impact of the paintings they have created about the Delhi pogrom.</p>
<p>The Sikh Research Institute has partnered with Sarbpreet Singh 
and J.Mehr Kaur, the playwrights to produce ‘Kultar’s Mime’, which will 
be staged in Boston in September 2014 and NYC, NJ, Ottawa and Toronto in
 October 2014. All performances will be open to the public and no 
admission will be charged. An ensemble cast of professional Boston area 
actors has been assembled and rehearsals have started.

</div> <div> <h3>The Concept</h3> <p></p>
<p>Kultar’s Mime is an immersive theater experience, which draws upon poetry, painting and music to tell the story of four young children who were victims of the 1984 Delhi massacre.</p>
<p>The dialog draws heavily upon the poem of the same name, which was inspired by three works that appeared after the tragedy. The first was a booklet titled ‘Who are the Guilty’, a report commissioned by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a civil rights organization in India, which painstakingly documented the terrible crimes that were committed in Delhi after the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The second work was an article by Madhu Kishwar titled ‘Gangster Rule’, published in the Indian progressive magazine Manushi, which intrepidly documented the events of 1984 in sharp contrast with most mainstream media in India, which had been tightly muzzled by the government.

The Strive Theatre originally produced the play in January 2013, for a
week-long run in the beer garden of Nancy Spain's Bar on Barrack Street in Cork
City. It was written and directed by Strive co-founder, Ciarán MacArtain, and
designed by co-artistic director, Hanan Sheedy. The production was a great
success for us as a company and gave us a platform to co-produce Rory
McConville's ""The Frozen Field"" (directed by Jack Holland) with Pots
and Panic Theatre Co. in September 2013 in The Kino in Cork City. Our second
full production came as Hanan Sheedy created and directed ""Cassandra""
which was produced in October 2013 at the Granary Theatre. The
success and positive acclaim that ""Cassandra"" enjoyed has brought us
to the next step for our young company; to tour ""The Rooftops Of
Paris"" in Summer 2014. <br/><br/>
We are doing this because we feel that the play carries a very necessary

concerns the struggle of a young couple who've recently bought an apartment in
Cork City at the end of The Celtic Tiger. They journey into the recession
expecting their first child and exploring their new home and community. Cara,
while on mat. leave from a creche in the western suburbs, decorates their

in a bank on South Mall, and becomes close friends with his local publican, Tom
Bradley. The men share a great love of words and through Tom, the dormant
artist in Charlie is awakened. Charlie and Cara's journey gives us a
perspective on the relationships of young people in this country at this time;
Their relationship with each other, their society, their future and their own
true selves. It is a critique of recent Irish society and an attempt to ground
our time in the history and culture of our nation.<br/><br/>

<h2><strong>The Background</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past year, a lot of change has taken place in my life. As many of you know my family relocated to Savannah, GA in the summer of 2010, and I followed suit this past July. Leaving Athens was definitely not what I had wanted or even what I had planned for myself, however, God had something else in mind. He skillfully directed my path by closing and opening doors and providing me with opportunities that I never imagined I would have. I recently finished an internship at Savannah Christian Church with their Global Outreach department, and it was a wonderful and challenging experience. I was able to learn about how much time and effort is put in to ministry, and the joy and blessing that comes along with working towards something greater than myself. Throughout my internship, I was able to meet people from all across the globe, and it opened my eyes to how far-reaching the Gospel really is.</p>
<h2><strong>The Opportunity</strong></h2>
<p> I have been presented with a chance to go and intern with an amazing family in Poland for June, July and August of this year. I would be serving with Proem Ministries located in ZakoÅ›ciele (I am still learning to pronounce it) which is not far from Warsaw. If you would like more information about the ministry and what they do, please take a look at their website <a href=""http://www.proem.pl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.proem.pl</a>! Now I know Poland is a rather unusual place to go for an extended mission trip. Typically, one would go to a third world country where the physical and material poverty is prevalent. In Poland however, there is not as much physical poverty as there is spiritual. I was astounded when I learned that only 0.2% of the entire population is Evangelical Christian. Proem uses recreation, education, and inspiration to lead the people of Poland to a life-changing connection with Jesus Christ. You may be wondering what my role would be in all of this. I would be helping serve as a camp counselor, teaching a ballroom dance workshop, singing with the worship team, helping teach English using the Bible as a guide, and doing anything and everything that is necessary or needed at the time.</p>
<h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
<p>I am so thrilled about this opportunity, and I would like you to partner with me! First of all, I would like to ask you for prayer support. Pray that God would prepare my heart so that I may be effective in presenting the Gospel and showing love and compassion to everyone I encounter. Pray that God would be glorified through my words and actions. Pray that I would be confident and bold in proclaiming the truth in spite of my own fears and uncertainties. Pray also that the needed financial support would be provided. I need to raise an estimated $2,900 for the entire trip. The number is definitely intimidating to a college student, but if it is God’s desire for me to go, I am confident that He will provide the necessary resources.</p>
<p>I would be so grateful if you would prayerfully consider supporting me with your financial assistance. No amount is insignificant. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for considering helping me achieve what I feel God has called me to do! </p>

The Background
Over the past year, a lot of change has taken place in my life. As many of you know my family relocated to Savannah, GA in the summer of 2010, and I followed suit this past July. Leaving Athens was definitely not what I had wanted or even what I had planned for myself, however, God had something else in mind. He skillfully directed my path by closing and opening doors and providing me with opportunities that I never imagined I would have. I recently finished an internship at Savannah Christian Church with their Global Outreach department, and it was a wonderful and challenging experience.

<h2>Exciting update: Transcendent's upcoming production of TITUS ANDRONICUS is now in process of pending Actor's Equity Basic Showcase status!</h2>
<h2>About Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company (TETC)</h2>
<p>Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company is a new theatre company founded by Lindsay Bartlette Allen. This company is comprised of alumni from Theatre UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and New York theatre artists. Lindsay's vision for starting this company was to build a community of artists in New York that worked with the same rehearsal/ development process that she learned from her education at UAB under her training in experimental/ devised theater and ensemble building. </p>
<p>For Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company's first production, Lindsay has developed her own adaptation of Shakespeare's TITUS ANDRONICUS. She describes it as, ""...a 90-minute, highly-adapted, movement-driven take on Shakespeare's story that highlights the humanity behind the choices each character makes. In other words, this isn't a play about good vs. evil but a play about people who are faced with great tragedy and act out of revenge even when they know it might not be the ""right"" choice. We can all relate to this, right??"" Lindsay will also be directing this project. For more information about her work and experience visit <a href=""http://www.lindsaybartletteallen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lindsaybartletteallen.com</a>. </p>
<h3>Specific Funding Needs</h3>

About Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company (TETC)
Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company is a new theatre company founded by Lindsay Bartlette Allen. This company is comprised of alumni from Theatre UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and New York theatre artists. Lindsay's vision for starting this company was to build a community of artists in New York that worked with the same rehearsal/ development process that she learned from her education at UAB under her training in experimental/ devised theater and ensemble building. 
For Transcendent Ensemble Theatre Company's first production, Lindsay has developed her own adaptation of Shakespeare's TITUS ANDRONICUS. She describes it as, ""...a 90-minute, highly-adapted, movement-driven take on Shakespeare's story that highlights the humanity behind the choices each character makes. In other words, this isn't a play about good vs. evil but a play about people who are faced with great tragedy and act out of revenge even when they know it might not be the ""right"" choice. We can all relate to this, right??"" Lindsay will also be directing this project. For more information about her work and experience visit www.lindsaybartletteallen.com.

<h3>­­Hi. My name is Mariel Marshall. I believe in creating vibrant, creative communities; inspiring our youth through mentorship and training; sharing stories amongst young and old; and collaborating with a community to do it all. Oh yeah, and did I mention I make theatre.</h3>
<p>I grew up in Kincardine Ontario: population 6,725. It’s a beautiful little town with a lot of charm. It’s also the place I was inspired to start a career in the arts. I am now a Toronto based theatre artist and have been working professionally for over seven years. Returning home is about giving back to the community that fostered my development and sharing my love of theatre with a rural, hometown audience. </p>
<p>After convincing a couple of Toronto theatre folk to trek out of the big smoke to visit Kincardine, something strange and exciting happened. Like me, they fell in love with the community, the culture and people of the town. But after visiting a few historic sites throughout the community we realized that something vital was missing: the tradition of storytelling. With such a vibrant history and culture, we knew that we had to help. I told everyone I knew about the idea and together we formed a company of artists with a singular mission: to start a tradition of live, outdoor theatre in historic locals, to share stories amongst young and old, and to create a piece of theatre with the community, for the community. This is Sundown Theatre and we invite you to join our cause. Help inspire a culture of creativity as we bring to life a story of love, loss and transformation with our inaugural production: <em>The Selkie of Kincardine</em>.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Who is Sundown Theatre?</strong></div>
<p>Sundown Theatre is a collective of theatre artists from Toronto, Kincardine, Nova Scotia and afar, dedicated to re-imagining and reinvigorating live, outdoor performance in the small Ontario community of Kincardine. Each member of the collective brings a unique skillset to the project as theatre artists and producers with a wide body of work in the professional theatre scene.</p>
<p><strong>The Play: </strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to launch the company’s premiere production, <em>The Selkie of Kincardine </em>written by Claire Wynveen. This is an original play created for the performance site of Kincardine's lakeside bandstand: Dunsmoor Park. The piece will take place this August 12-25, 2013. Combining folk-mythology, a community youth choir and a bagpiper or two, this project will bring creativity, community-building and plenty of joy to the summer in a historic town. </p>
<p><em>The Selkie of Kincardine</em> is a tale told by a boisterous troupe of travelling players. The play will follow the story of a lonely fisherman who falls in love with a Selkie-lady named Ondine. A selkie is a mythological creature that can transform from a seal to human-form and is a common folk-tale in Scottish mythology. This piece is an opportunity to celebrate the community’s Scottish ancestry. With music and mythologies interwoven with local folklore, the piece will bring new awareness to our community's cultural backdrop.</p>
<p><strong>Youth Mentorship </strong></p>
<p>Sundown Theatre knows that in every art form beginners must start with models of those who have come before: the work we do today must create and inspire the artists and audiences of tomorrow. The Young Company is a professional training and mentorship program for aspiring artists between the ages of 13-19. It is the perfect vehicle to cultivate the community’s youth through training, mentorship and exposure to professional artists and theatre makers.  The training program will culminate in two weeks of performance on the company’s production, <em>The Selkie of Kincardine</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Support</strong></p>
<p>We are a company of artists with great ambitions and a shoestring budget. In order to make this project a success, we are calling on the Indiegogo community to help us raise $10,000. This money is critical in covering transportation, artist fees and production costs. We are a collective that operates on a not-for-profit structure, and all donations from this campaign are going directly to the project costs for The Selkie of Kincardine.  </p>
<p>We will be commemorating donations of $20 and above with an art-installation called “A Banner of a Thousand Names”.  This piece of banner-art will be painted by a local artist and will be displayed throughout the performance site in Dunmoor Park for the duration of the show. Show someone in your life you support the arts by donating in their name.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's an exciting time to be an artist in SE Minnesota. The arts are growing! Places like Rochester, Lanesboro, Winona, and many others are fostering wonderful art that rivals that seen anywhere else. The funds we raise from this campaign will go straight to the creation of more to add to that mix. Wherever you may be, wherever you may live or work, your generosity will have a direct impact on working artists and the blooming arts scene in SE Minnesota. This really is an incredible opportunity to not only help foster the art and artists in this part of the country, but to allow more patrons to participate in them. With your help, we truly believe we can accomplish that! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As with any artistic endeavor, we run a large financial risk. Our director has waived any stipend in support of using those funds for the show itself. Apart from raising funds to cover costs of the performances, providing our actor with a stipend is our primary goal. Her work will be greatly appreciated, and it's important to underscore how important her contributions and time really are. Regardless if In Heart Theatre is able to meet our goal, we will perform in May. The show must go on, but your support can help us put forth the best product possible. </div>

<p>The intention of running this crowd funding scheme is to bring you a high quality production of this play, with the best casting and design production to support this story, just like we had in New York.</p>
<p>With Alan King on board as director and his notable experience as director with his own theatre company Purple Heart and his long history as an actor and his work with Dublin's Youth Theatre. Alan directed Laoisa in the NY production of <strong><i>Waiting for Ikea </i></strong>by and with Georgina Mc Kevitt. Georgina and Laoisa were both nominated for Best Actress in the 1st Irish Theatre Festival for the play. Laoisa won the Best Actress Award at the same festival in 2010 </p>

<h3>Cleopatra in Ireland</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laoisa has proved her self in the US to be a formidable talent in both acting and playwriting, with 3 plays under her belt. For her work to be seen this side of the pond is important, as she hopes to continue to get her work produced and nurtured at home in Ireland.</li>
<li>Cleopatra was staged in Canada in late 2016 and in the Milwaukee Irish Festival where it won two Awards. So now with its debuts in North America its time to bring it on home to Dublin where it was conceived and where it needs to be seen!</li>
<li>
<strong>THE FEMALE PLAYWRIGHT</strong> Female Irish playwrights are under represented in Ireland and rarely produced according to recent statistics.  It is nearly impossible to get your plays even read by funded theater companies in Ireland, let alone produced. Companies have their own relationships with their own writers that they work with again and again, and many are under commission, so it is very hard to break through as a new writer in such a small community. Increasingly it seems the only way is to get your play produced is to produce it yourself.</li>
<li>
<strong>NEW WRITING</strong> is very important, and undervalued. Considered to be high risk by most established funded theaters, who produce only classics or commercial plays with guaranteed box office return and commercial appeal, instead of taking a risk with newer edgier pieces by new writers. Yet these new stories are important as they are recording how we live now, here at home in Ireland and who we are. This is a <strong>brand new play</strong>, it deals with themes of regret, redemption, forgiveness, loss and family conflict familiar to us all. Cleopatra is about love. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Laoisa is an Irish actor and playwright. To date, she has had 3 plays produced in New York City on important Off-Broadway stages but she has not had any of her plays produced in Ireland.<br/>In 2013, her debut  play, the compelling smash hit comedy, <i><strong>FOR LOVE</strong></i> opened at the legendary Irish Repertory Theatre, for a completely sold out run, the play received a coveted 5 ***** NY Times Critics Pick and went on to a mini tour of Ireland opening at The City of Culture Festival (2013) in Derry, then continuing on to Belfast, Waterford, two venues in Dublin and Galway. </p>
<p> <strong>The UK Times </strong>wrote-<strong><i>""The production comes with a purpose, certainly, but it doesn't sacrifice drama. Moreover, it represents a change of pace for the stage. It might reflect a form of femaleemancipation, but it is pro active in the liberation of theatre.""</i></strong></p>
<p>Recently Laoisa appeared in the title role in her brand new play, the critically acclaimed <strong><i>The Pigeon in The Taj Mahal</i></strong>. The play was produced by<a href=""https://irishrep.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> The Irish Repertory Theatre</a> for a two month run and recently closed on New Year's Eve 2016.

We survived two world wars, social revolutions, atomic family standards, and have seen the birth of the internet. This campaign however, is about a single social standard: How long should a man's hair be?The better part of the 20th century insisted on short clean-cut looks. Of which I've written a little bit about on the blog which birthed this campaign. But since the days of ""Get a haircut"" being shouted in the streets it's become more acceptable for men to have long hair, right? I don't know so I am asking you, the internet, to vote for what you think it should be. And I'm putting my own head up for the experiment. That's not cousin It in the photo or a hairy Cthulhu, that's ME. So come'on internets, make your voice known.Many of you reading this probably don't care, but y'know what? You don't have to care, vote anyways, it's FUN! Besides, aren't you at least curious how it'll all turn out?So here are the rules:
With the exception of the $1 level, each perk is a vote for my next hairstyle. I'm more than willing to try them all, but I only have one head, unless there's a second one nobody is telling me about, so I can only do one hairstyle.
Each perk also has some swag included, be it postcards or switchblade combs, and I do solemnly swear to do my utmost to ensure that each contributor receives their swag regardless of which hairstyle I end up with at the end.
Here's an easy guide:End of Campaign Scoring:
First level scoring. Each perk is labeled with either a [C] to cut my hair or an [S] to save my hair. At the end of the campaign C and S will be tallied separately. The category that raises the most money is considered the winner.
Second level scoring. From the winning category (either C or S) the perk that raises the most money, will be my new hairstyle.
OF YOUR CHOICE scoring. There are several perks that allow the contributor free reign when voting. If the hairstyle picked is an ""of your choice"" variety, those choices will be tallied separately and published on my website. The choice with the most votes will be the option taken.

<p><b>FLOATERS#3</b> is the last part of a triptych. It’s a laboratory to explore the senses, to recreate an environment for questions and emotions. Christine sets up the audience in the center of the space, receptors, witnessing the subjective perception of the physical reality. She creates a kinetic environment with a ritualistic men trio to explore the thematic of identity and alienation of human being. They displace and manipulate the perceptions. The intricacy of the structure emphasizes the uncertainty of individual identities and their reality in the physical space.</p>
<p>She’s been collaborating with composer, visual artists and dancers internationally to create <b>FLOATERS#3</b>, exploring the potential and the impacts that the various stimuli generate in space and in the body. </p>

Over the last 10 years, Christine Bonansea explored visual arts as well as physical performing techniques in collaboration with artist specialists from various fields (musician composer, visual artist, filmmaker). She’s been challenging the dynamics of live performance within the diversity of environment that she experienced in Europe, USA and Africa as an interpreter and choreographer.


FLOATERS#3 is the last part of a triptych. It’s a laboratory to explore the senses, to recreate an environment for questions and emotions. Christine sets up the audience in the center of the space, receptors, witnessing the subjective perception of the physical reality. She creates a kinetic environment with a ritualistic men trio to explore the thematic of identity and alienation of human being. They displace and manipulate the perceptions. The intricacy of the structure emphasizes the uncertainty of individual identities and their reality in the physical space.
She’s been collaborating with composer, visual artists and dancers internationally to create FLOATERS#3, exploring the potential and the impacts that the various stimuli generate in space and in the body. 
 


FLOATERS#3 NYC PREMIERE 
at DIXON PLACE 

Thursday, September 24 at 7:30pm 




A new cast will perform:



Choreographer, artistic director: Christine Bonansea


Dancers: Brandin Steffensen, Nicholas Bruder and Robert Kentucky 

Sound Composition and Performance: Voicehandler, Danishta Rivero and Jacob Felix Heule

Light and video design: Ian Winter and Olivia Ting.


This is a privilege to present this piece at DIXON PLACE in New York City, and  a great opportunity to invite the New York City dance community. FLOATERS#3 encountered a  frank success at the previous showings in Berlin and in San Francisco.



picture by Nailya BikmurzinaThe Indiegogo campaign is necessary to complete the cost of the production.  The dramaturgy as well as the choreography of FLOATERS#3 need to be reset in the theater with a new cast from New York City and San Francisco.We need you! We need $5000 to cover all the cost of the performance. It includes space rental, artists fees, material rental and airfare:
1. Space Rental: we plan 10 days of rehearsals in studio and in the theater. This is an important amount of money but necessary to reset the space and rehearse the choreography with the performers.
2.  Artist fees: the project comprises 1 choreographer, 3 dancer performers, 2 sound composers and performers and 1 production and touring manager.
3. Material Rental: we need to rent an extra video projector for the tech and show time.
4. Airfare: we need to cover the cost of 2 flight tickets from San Francisco for the sound composers and 1 flight ticket for one dancer from Toronto. 
5. Communication cost: we need to print postcards and posters for additional advertisement of the show.
If we cannot reach our goal, I will prioritize the flight tickets expenses and the artist fees.

<p>Over those first few days under the same roof and the months she spent in Madrid, Milena and I developed a friendship that later blossomed into a professional relationship with the birth of “Nikotine,” Milena’s first solo puppet show in collaboration with the Sofia-based company Atelier 313.  It was through Milena that I learned about the age-old tradition of puppetry in Bulgaria and met her fellow puppeteers and mentors, including the brilliant director Veselka Kuncheva and actor/puppeteer Hristo Takov. </p>
<p>I fell in love with the work of these highly professional artists and their typically Slavic bittersweet style of storytelling.  Once again I felt compelled to help, this time with touring the trio’s creations outside of their home and neighboring countries.  Our first steps were taken at the 2011 and 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festivals.  On the heels of the Fringe, I suggested that ""Nikotine"" be paired with the puppetry piece ""I, Sisyphus"" to create a single explosion of Bulgarian puppet theatre, and “An Evening of Bulgarian Puppetry” was born</p>
<p>Over the course of 2012/2013, we’ve managed to develop a solid tour of the United States for October/November 2013 with performances in Chicago (Theatre Wit), Austin (Salvage Vanguard Theater), Houston (Talento Bilingue Theater) and New York (DROM) with the possibility of adding a couple of additional cities.  This would be the first time any of these artists have been stateside, let alone performed their pieces in North America.  But in order to make these Bulgarian puppeteers’ dream a reality, we need to raise the funds necessary to cover the high cost of international touring.</p>
<p>In an age when money for the arts is so scarce, we want to build our crowdfunding campaign on transparency, so here you have it.  This is what we need the money for:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>International travel (Bulgaria/US): $4,000</li>
<li>Visas: $480</li>
<li>National travel (Chicago-Austin-Houston+one more city): $2500</li>
<li>Two weeks of groceries while on tour: $420</li>
</ol><p>The amount that we raise will determine how long we can stay as well as how many cities we can perform in.  If we raise the whole $7400, we are set for 15 days in the US to perform in as many as six cities.</p>
<p>The brilliantly honed tradition of Bulgarian puppetry is not well known outside of Eastern Europe, but it’s high time it was!  Your support will not only help us introduce new audiences to this unique art form, but it will also help launch three exceptional actor/puppeteer/writer/directors on the other side of the Atlantic. </p>
<p>Every little bit helps, so we hope we can count on adding you to our list of puppetry producers.   And even if you can’t support us financially, helping us spread the word about this crowdfunding campaign would also be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to learn about our project!  We hope to meet you at one of our upcoming shows!</p>
<p>Our double-bill consists of the pieces “Nikotine” by Milena Milanova and “I, Sisyphus” by Veselka Kuncheva:</p>
<p><em>Nikotine</em> Synopsis:</p>
<p>This adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s one act comedy presents a puppet version of Nikolay Nikotine, a man terrorized and traumatized by an overbearing wife. His conference on the ills of tobacco smoking, which his wife has forced him to give, quickly degenerates into a monologue about the trials and tribulations of being Nikolay Nikotine. Throughout his discourse Nikolay lies and tells the truth, loves and hates, sings and dances and speaks against one of his few remaining pleasures: smoking.</p>
<p>Praise for <em>Nikotine</em>:</p>
<p><em>“</em>Throughout, this is puppetry of a very high order indeed, and Milanova’s considerable skills outshine those of many highly competent puppet companies.”<br/> - Bill Dunlop, <em>Edinburgh Guide</em></p>
<p><em>I, Sisyphus</em> Synopsis:</p>
<p>“There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.""</p>
<p>-          “The Myth of Sisyphus”, Albert Camus</p>
<p>In the performance “I, Sisyphus” we explore the journey of man’s eternal return to himself. Ever since Antiquity, philosophers have pondered the absurdity of human behavior.  Whichever road one may take, whoever else one tries to become, whatever escape-routes one might venture, he always continues to return to himself. Human life is a repetition of one and the same action. Spiraling, same, predictable. And this constant action makes us meditate not on the meaning, but on the meaninglessness of human life.</p>

To give to finance a dream is to say you believe in something, in somebody, and we know that every single one of you has said that in your gift to Sylvani. So thank you!<br/><br/>We are getting ready now to ask for funds again. Sylvani will be 17 at the end of March, and this is probably her second to last summer doing intensives, while also preparing seriously to audition for either her first professional trainee, studio company, or apprentice position. <br/><br/>While she did audition for a few other intensives, she only seriously has considered returning to Joffrey or Oregon Ballet Theater, or, possibly, Texas Ballet Theater, and this is still a bit of a quandary.  There are good reasons for each of them, she has been to each of them, each is affiliated with a company she could potentially dance for one day, and each of them will give her some level of tuition scholarship/financial aid..meaning there is some level of interest in Sylvani. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Sylvani hopes to dance for the Joffrey Ballet as a professional, but at this point, we are looking at her best path to reach that goal. It may not be to return to Joffrey this summer for their intensive, but to instead go to the smaller OBT for their full 6 weeks, because she will be in their top level and receive more personal attention, while at Joffrey, she is likely to be in their second level in a larger class. <br/><br/>OBT has a second company, OBT2, that dancers must attend at least 4 weeks of the summer intensive to be considered for. The time overlap of the two programs does not allow Sylvani to do this while at the 5 week Joffrey program. <br/><br/>We are going to look into whether it is possible for her to change to Joffrey's later 3-week program, which would allow Sylvani to attend OBT's first 4 weeks, while still remaining under the eyes of Joffrey. <br/>If this is not possible, then Sylvani has decided that going to OBT's full 6-week program and then returning to Joffrey a year from now, at age 18, when she will be in their top pre-professional level and eligible to become a Trainee, is her best option for training, cost, and her ultimate chance at a professional career in ballet.<br/><br/><br/><br/><div><strong style=""color: #660099;"">This past summer at Joffrey was an incredible experience for her. Sylvani learned to be truly at home in the Big City--loving Chicago and everything about dancing in the Joffrey Tower. She learned so much! Then, because of a scholarship and a bit of other help, she was able to also attend the final two weeks of Oregon Ballet Theater's summer intensive in Portland, OR (two hours from home and with grandparents able to house and transport her). </strong></div><div><b>Sylvani saw immense improvement from both intensives, and was honored to dance the lead role in ""Snow White"" this fall over Thanksgiving weekend--requiring her to dance in every scene, partner with different ""dwarves"" as well as her ""Prince"", and truly take on a demanding acting as well as dance role. She danced every single day from right after school to after 8 pm, and on weekends sometimes both days too!  </b></div><b>It is now time to gear up for winter audition season, and it costs about $500 just to make the trip to Seattle for the audition weekend that includes Joffrey, as she is hoping to receive a scholarship. </b><div>

Sylvani fell in love with the company's combination of Contemporary and Classical ballet that speak to her sense of wanting to make change in the world with her art.<br/></p>

I am committed to it for life. It gives me joy to 
dance, and, I want to use dance 
to convey messages to the world. People listen to art, it touches their 
souls and it changes people.  I love ballet, and even that doesn’t quite cover it. It is actually a part of me, and that is only cliché because so many people say it.  It is true. Some people dance to pray. For me, it is how I connect with whatever spiritual power there may be in the world: It’s how we connect with each other. When we dance together, all grudges and biases are forgotten. I say all this at risk of sounding a little bit crazy, but in contrast, it seems ridiculous that something like a lack of money could stand in the way of all this.""</p>

<p><b>When Sylvani first saw ""The Nutcracker"" at 3 years old, she dreamed of being the Sugar Plum Fairy, and wanted to be a ballerina. </b>Her grandparents generously offered to pay for ballet lessons, and off she went!  Sylvani got much of her dance talent from her Grandma Barbara, and much of her Romanian beauty from her Grandma Liliane. See more about them on Sylvani's earlier campaigns, <b><a href=""http://igg.me/p/74538/x/421042"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Help Sylvani Dance</a></b>, and<b> <a href=""http://igg.me/p/706004/x/421042"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Help Sylvani Dance 2.0</a></b>. <br/></p>
<p>But unlike most little ballerinas, who put away their tutus a few years later for other things, Sylvani kept dancing, working harder and harder for that dream. She kept growing into a stronger dancer, and her dream grew stronger too!<br/></p>
<p><b>A year ago, at age 14, she got to put on the sparkling pink costume of the Sugar Plum Fairy as one of a triple cast of students to be chosen for this role!</b> <b>Her very first ballet dream had come true! </b><br/>

<p>The Artistic Director John Grensback, of Oregon Ballet Academy, where she trains nearly every day, and his friend Carl Corry, who is guest faculty once per year, danced with the <b><a href=""http://joffrey.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joffrey Ballet</a> </b>in the 70's and 80's. Together, they have inspired Sylvani, and she watches whatever she can of <b><a href=""https://youtu.be/-d9evcqRa9Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joffrey on YouTube</a></b>.  </p>
<p>There are so many ballet companies, and one never really knows where one might go. But Joffrey is the one she's talked of for years now.  She loves Joffrey's mix of Contemporary and Classical Ballet. She hopes to dance with Joffrey one day. <b>Both of these former Joffrey dancers have said she has a chance of doing exactly that, and that THIS is the summer she should go there to begin to be seen by them! </b><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""color: #660099;"">Ballet is Training...Lots of Training.</span></h3>
<p>Sylvani is turning 16 now. She has been studying ballet for 12 years. Every week during the school year, Sylvani takes class after school every day and on Saturdays 20 or more hours per week, in ballet technique, pointe, pas de deux, as well as tap, modern, jazz improv, Pilates and other dance forms.  She gets so much from Oregon Ballet Academy! And she manages to still get good grades, and have time with good friends.  <br/></p>
<p><b>But serious ballet students also must use their summers wisely. While other high school students take summer vacations, those who want a professional ballet career go to summer intensives with ballet companies or major schools</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1334490/files/20150328163151-IMG_7063.JPG?1427585511"" src="""" style=""width: 303.669px; height: 191px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1334530/files/20150328165038-10570275_10204524311493441_4236848857795751960_n.jpg?1427586638"" src="""" style=""width: 303.316px; height: 226px;""/></p>

<p>They improve their skills and strength, make contacts in the dance world, and learn more what it is to be a professional dancer. They then go back to the dorm and hang out with other young dancers all evening.  All week long, all day long, every day, several weeks. <b>It's ""full immersion"" in a way that just isn't possible during the school year.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Last summer, <a href=""http://igg.me/p/706004/x/421042"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thanks to help from so many of you</a>, Sylvani went to</b> <b><a href=""https://www.texasballettheater.org/content/summer-intensive-general-information"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Texas Ballet Theater</a></b> <b>in Dallas-Ft.

<p>I'm raising a family on a single, community college classified income.  It covers our bills, barely, but I've had to help with medical bills and other costs for two older daughters, one of whom is in college (on scholarships and grants mostly), and all costs for Sylvani's father, who has a learning disability and hasn't been able to find steady work.  Sylvani's incredibly generous grandparents (my parents) pay for all her regular ballet lessons, which I could never afford on my own.

</div></div>","Dear Friends and Supporters of Sylvani,You have helped her come so far!  We are humbled and grateful for all you have given, because we simply could not do this alone. To give to finance a dream is to say you believe in something, in somebody, and we know that every single one of you has said that in your gift to Sylvani. So thank you!We are getting ready now to ask for funds again. Sylvani will be 17 at the end of March, and this is probably her second to last summer doing intensives, while also preparing seriously to audition for either her first professional trainee, studio company, or apprentice position. While she did audition for a few other intensives, she only seriously has considered returning to Joffrey or Oregon Ballet Theater, or, possibly, Texas Ballet Theater, and this is still a bit of a quandary.  There are good reasons for each of them, she has been to each of them, each is affiliated with a company she could potentially dance for one day, and each of them will give her some level of tuition scholarship/financial aid..meaning there is some level of interest in Sylvani. Ultimately, Sylvani hopes to dance for the Joffrey Ballet as a professional, but at this point, we are looking at her best path to reach that goal. It may not be to return to Joffrey this summer for their intensive, but to instead go to the smaller OBT for their full 6 weeks, because she will be in their top level and receive more personal attention, while at Joffrey, she is likely to be in their second level in a larger class. OBT has a second company, OBT2, that dancers must attend at least 4 weeks of the summer intensive to be considered for. The time overlap of the two programs does not allow Sylvani to do this while at the 5 week Joffrey program. We are going to look into whether it is possible for her to change to Joffrey's later 3-week program, which would allow Sylvani to attend OBT's first 4 weeks, while still remaining under the eyes of Joffrey. If this is not possible, then Sylvani has decided that going to OBT's full 6-week program and then returning to Joffrey a year from now, at age 18, when she will be in their top pre-professional level and eligible to become a Trainee, is her best option for training, cost, and her ultimate chance at a professional career in ballet.This past summer at Joffrey was an incredible experience for her. Sylvani learned to be truly at home in the Big City--loving Chicago and everything about dancing in the Joffrey Tower. She learned so much! Then, because of a scholarship and a bit of other help, she was able to also attend the final two weeks of Oregon Ballet Theater's summer intensive in Portland, OR (two hours from home and with grandparents able to house and transport her). Sylvani saw immense improvement from both intensives, and was honored to dance the lead role in ""Snow White"" this fall over Thanksgiving weekend--requiring her to dance in every scene, partner with different ""dwarves"" as well as her ""Prince"", and truly take on a demanding acting as well as dance role. She danced every single day from right after school to after 8 pm, and on weekends sometimes both days too!  It is now time to gear up for winter audition season, and it costs about $500 just to make the trip to Seattle for the audition weekend that includes Joffrey, as she is hoping to receive a scholarship. 
For Sylvani, Ballet is Love...



Sylvani has the chance to go to Joffrey Ballet School in Chicago - Help Realize Her Dreams!!!
Synopsis-
(""Ballet Speak"" for the Short Version)


Sylvani has been studying ballet since she was just over 3, and now, at age 16, is nearing her dream of one day dancing professionally!  Sylvani's favorite ballet company is The Joffrey Ballet...she was inspired by her main teacher and his friend, both of whom danced with Joffrey in the 70's. Sylvani fell in love with the company's combination of Contemporary and Classical ballet that speak to her sense of wanting to make change in the world with her art.

  



This summer, Sylvani has the chance to go to Chicago, for Joffrey's International Summer Dance Intensive--5 weeks of dancing every day in the Joffrey Tower, where the company dancers themselves will be taking class!  Joffrey accepts students by audition only. There were 14 audition sites all over the US as well as Paris and London. Sylvani and her friends traveled to Seattle for auditions held at Pacific Northwest Ballet.Out of over 1000 students auditioning nationwide, Sylvani was one of 150 accepted into their top summer program, and also waitlisted for the year-round Joffrey Trainee program!  The summer program is taught by Joffrey School Artistic Directors Alexei Kremnev and Anna Reznik , and the Artistic Director of the Joffrey Ballet, Ashley Wheater, as well as a number of current dancers with the company and their regular teaching faculty.Joffrey Ballet is where she wants most to go, though she auditioned for and was accepted to several programs.  Sylvani hopes to dance with Joffrey one day--and that day is not too far off!  Her main teachers and mentors here at Oregon Ballet Academy have told her since she loves Joffrey so much, this is the year she needs to go there, because at age 16, this helps her make the connection for when she is ready to become a Trainee in the next year or two.
For a young aspiring professional dancer, this is not only important training, but also a major opportunity!  We have everything we need to help her, except the money!  


The total costs of the Joffrey International Summer Dance Intensive are $7425. 

With scholarships, savings, and air miles, we've gotten it down to $4675.  

It ""takes a village"" to raise a dancer! We're asking for $3675 here on Indiegogo, because Sylvani has applied for more scholarships, so we hope to have about $1000 from them. (UPDATE: Sylvani won the Anthony Quinn Foundation Scholarship, for high school students in the Arts needing pre-professional training while still in high school--out of over 550 applicants,they chose about 15 in all areas of the Arts. Sylvani was one of them, and won $800)



Sylvani has come so far since she began!

...Here's Sylvani's Story:




""If someone asked me why I spend so many hours at the studio, working 
so hard to perfect what may seem like miniscule details, I would ask if 
they knew what it felt like to be in love. 

I am committed to it for life. It gives me joy to 
dance, and, I want to use dance 
to convey messages to the world. People listen to art, it touches their 
souls and it changes people.  I love ballet, and even that doesn’t quite cover it. It is actually a part of me, and that is only cliché because so many people say it.  It is true. Some people dance to pray. For me, it is how I connect with whatever spiritual power there may be in the world: It’s how we connect with each other. When we dance together, all grudges and biases are forgotten. I say all this at risk of sounding a little bit crazy, but in contrast, it seems ridiculous that something like a lack of money could stand in the way of all this.""







Ballet is Dreams
(What all this training has done so far..)

Visions of Sugarplums                                                

When Sylvani first saw ""The Nutcracker"" at 3 years old, she dreamed of being the Sugar Plum Fairy, and wanted to be a ballerina. Her grandparents generously offered to pay for ballet lessons, and off she went!  Sylvani got much of her dance talent from her Grandma Barbara, and much of her Romanian beauty from her Grandma Liliane. See more about them on Sylvani's earlier campaigns, Help Sylvani Dance, and Help Sylvani Dance 2.0. 
But unlike most little ballerinas, who put away their tutus a few years later for other things, Sylvani kept dancing, working harder and harder for that dream. She kept growing into a stronger dancer, and her dream grew stronger too!
A year ago, at age 14, she got to put on the sparkling pink costume of the Sugar Plum Fairy as one of a triple cast of students to be chosen for this role! Her very first ballet dream had come true! 


    
                     This is Grandpa Ed, who was able to come see Sylvani dance one time...as the Sugar Plum Fairy. That was the last visit Sylvani had with her Grandpa Ed, as he passed away a year ago. April 17 was his ""yarzheit"" (one year passing). Grandpa Ed still is with Sylvani--he loved his ""Short Stuff"" and supported her dream.
Dreaming of Swans

In Sylvani's very first performance on stage, she was a Baby Swan. 
  When Sylvani was 6, she told me she was going to dance Odette/Odile in ""Swan Lake"".There was something about how she said this that let me know, this was serious!  Sylvani KNEW what she wanted to do with her life and she was GOING to make it happen! 




This past Thanksgiving, that HUGE dream came true! Sylvani was chosen as one of a triple cast at Oregon Ballet Academy to dance the role of Odette/Odile, the complex double role 
traditionally danced by the same dancer in ""Swan Lake"", choreographed by John Grensback.
Here is a clip from the Prologue, where the maiden Odette is cursed by an evil sorcerer to be a swan, and where, as the Swan Queen, she meets and falls in love with Prince Seigfried . (danced by Nathan Rowell)
    
Here is a clip from the grand ball where Odile fools the Prince into believing she is Odette.    It was a thrill for Sylvani to be able to perform these roles at only 15, and taught her so much!
                   
As challenging as it is to believe in ballet dreams, with all the things that can get in the way...as hard as the work is...as many times one might simply take an easier road...Sylvani has never waivered, her dreams do seem to come true, and she is more determined than ever to continue on this path to wherever it takes her.

Now Sylvani Dreams of Joffrey Ballet...








The Artistic Director John Grensback, of Oregon Ballet Academy, where she trains nearly every day, and his friend Carl Corry, who is guest faculty once per year, danced with the Joffrey Ballet in the 70's and 80's. Together, they have inspired Sylvani, and she watches whatever she can of Joffrey on YouTube.  
There are so many ballet companies, and one never really knows where one might go. But Joffrey is the one she's talked of for years now.  She loves Joffrey's mix of Contemporary and Classical Ballet. She hopes to dance with Joffrey one day. Both of these former Joffrey dancers have said she has a chance of doing exactly that, and that THIS is the summer she should go there to begin to be seen by them! 
Ballet is Training...Lots of Training.
Sylvani is turning 16 now. She has been studying ballet for 12 years. Every week during the school year, Sylvani takes class after school every day and on Saturdays 20 or more hours per week, in ballet technique, pointe, pas de deux, as well as tap, modern, jazz improv, Pilates and other dance forms.  She gets so much from Oregon Ballet Academy! And she manages to still get good grades, and have time with good friends.  
But serious ballet students also must use their summers wisely. While other high school students take summer vacations, those who want a professional ballet career go to summer intensives with ballet companies or major schools   

They improve their skills and strength, make contacts in the dance world, and learn more what it is to be a professional dancer. They then go back to the dorm and hang out with other young dancers all evening.  All week long, all day long, every day, several weeks. It's ""full immersion"" in a way that just isn't possible during the school year.

Last summer, thanks to help from so many of you, Sylvani went to Texas Ballet Theater in Dallas-Ft. Worth, for 5 weeks. There, she trained with former Houston Ballet Principals Kathryn Warakomsky and Tim O'Keefe, 

              and met famous Artistic Director and Choreographer, Ben Stevenson. These teachers are all former colleagues of John Grensback, Sylvani's Director and main ballet teacher in Oregon, who was Principal Dancer at Houston Ballet in the 80's. Other students from her home studio were there, and they all came back showing improvement and new bonds from having been immersed together. This bond and the intense work they did in Texas together helped them dance ""Swan Lake"" as choreographed by Mr. Grensback. We definitely saw Sylvani's growth when she returned from Texas!     

Ballet is Auditions!



Every winter, ballet companies and pre-professional schools hold audition tours in major cities around the US and other countries. Since we live in a small city, we had to travel to Portland or Seattle for auditions, so we had to plan carefully which programs Sylvani would audition for.  Not everyone gets in.  Auditions are like taking a ""master class"" with a top professional or even the Artistic Director of a company or school. Because the student is also ""auditioning the program"" to see if it feels like a good fit, we tried to get Sylvani to as many auditions as possible, Sylvani auditioned for many programs this year, including Joffrey Ballet Company, Bolshoi Ballet Academy, Ballet West, Oregon Ballet Theatre, University of North Carolina School of the Arts, Walnut Hill, Northwest Ballet Intensive, City Ballet of San Francisco,and Suzanne Farrell.  Some of these companies and programs offer year-round trainee, pre-professional, or second company programs to older high school students, with their summer intensive often being the ""audition"" for these. In some cases, Sylvani is considering these year-round programs for later in her training. 
Joffrey has three different summer programs, and the audition was conducted by the academy's Artistic Director, Alexei Kremnev, at Pacific Northwest Ballet's facility in Seattle.  The studio they used has large windows to the hallway, so many parents watched...other parents told me that he was watching Sylvani quite often!
There were 60 students in that audition in Seattle, and I learned that at many of the 14 national and international auditions, there were 100-200 dancers auditioning! 

Out of over 1000 students auditioning nationwide, Sylvani was one of 150 accepted into their top summer program, and also offered the opportunity for the year-round Joffrey Trainee program!  The summer program is taught by Joffrey School Artistic Directors Alexei Kremnev and Anna Reznik , and the Artistic Director of the Joffrey Ballet, Ashley Wheater, as well as a number of current dancers with the company and their regular teaching faculty. Taking class 
with current dancers, as well as those who have been soloists and principals for major companies, learning sometimes slightly different approaches to ""trouble spots"", being around them for impromptu learning moments, getting to spend time in the environment where they work...this helps a young student so much! So Why Joffrey?  Out of all the options, all the wonderful programs, trying to choose really came down to what Sylvani wants most...and that is Joffrey Ballet! Now is the time for her to go find out what they are like in person! 




Ballet Training costs $$$$ 

We are asking your help, because together, we can make a Ballerina!
I'm raising a family on a single, community college classified income.  It covers our bills, barely, but I've had to help with medical bills and other costs for two older daughters, one of whom is in college (on scholarships and grants mostly), and all costs for Sylvani's father, who has a learning disability and hasn't been able to find steady work.  Sylvani's incredibly generous grandparents (my parents) pay for all her regular ballet lessons, which I could never afford on my own. Sylvani's Grandpa Ed and Grandma Liliane gave her love and her beautiful look, and watch over her as she dances, may their memory be for a blessing.
     

I squeeze out money for ballet supplies, the endless pointe shoes, ballet slippers, tights, and leotards, as well as extra classes. All Sylvani ever asks for as birthday and holiday gifts are leotards and pointe shoes, or to go see a ballet. There simply isn't extra money lying around to send a talented daughter to these expensive summer ballet intensives, but they are necessary for her progress and training.  
We are doing all we can, but this ballerina on a mission needs your help!

Joffrey's cost for their 5-week International Summer Intensive is: 


Tuition: $2500
Room and Board: $3150
Activities Fee: $275
The total travel expenses are estimated at $1000, 

Pointe shoes, 5-7 pairs, leotards and tights for the required uniform, $500Total - $7425!!!



Here are Subtractions from that amount: 


Joffrey gave Sylvani a 50% tuition scholarship!  - $1250
Don earned and I saved $1000 for this summer:  - $1000
Using miles, we've reduced the travel expenses:  - $500

This puts us at $4675

Scholarships: Sylvani has applied for two outside scholarships, which support students still in high school who need pre-professional training. We are hopeful, and she is a finalist for one of them, so we are reducing the amount on this campaign by $1000. 


So we need to work together to raise $3675! 


If we raise more than we need and she gets a scholarship, any extra will go into a fund for more training, private coaching while at Joffrey, and an additional two weeks at Oregon Ballet Theatre in Portland, OR at the end of the summer (she's already gotten a 50% scholarship for that, and her grandparents will house her!)
If she doesn't get a scholarship, we may ask for more here, but we will also hold garage sales, rent out a room, whatever it takes...Sylvani needs this training! We need to Help Sylvani Dance to Joffrey! 
One day, you will see her on a stage and know that you helped her get there! 
So, if you can contribute any amount, she will send you her thanks in so many ways...check out the ""perks"" she's offering. Those pointe shoes she's holding here>>>  She'll sign one and mail it to you.
Or a photo or poster of her in that fabulous jump at the beach.



And always, always...she will think with gratitude of all the people who have helped her get this far and keep supporting her as she grows.

<b>
You're inside the sunken, pulverized body of the German-commissioned submarine, U-401, after fighting like hell for a country you're not sure you believe in anymore. It's the Spring of 1943. The world is at war above your head, but you're 200 meters below the surface of the ocean. 2 million pascals of force squeeze the vessel around you, conspiring to crush you beyond all recognition. You're surrounded by your dead fellow crewmen. The battery is dying. The oxygen is running out.<br/></b><b><br/>And there's a monster on board with you.</b>

<div>
<i><b>The Temple, or Lebensraum</b></i>, marks playwright Nat Cassidy's return to the world of H.P. Lovecraft after his one-man show, <i>I Am Providence</i>, which won the New York Innovative Theatre Award for Outstanding Solo Performance in 2011, and which Tor.com called: </div>
<div>
<blockquote><b>""[T]he most delightful thing we have ever seen anyone pull off on a stage, anywhere, ever ... An unexpectedly brilliant mediation on the use and function of horror, on H.P. Lovecraft himself, on the supernatural, on storytelling, on death, on hope. ... Creepy and magical enough to do old H.P. proud. ... I'm still thinking about it, days later.""</b></blockquote>
<br/>Updating Lovecraft's original story, which details the increasingly supernatural horrors experienced aboard a sunken submarine, to the middle of WWII (specifically, a time known as the ""Black Spring"" on account of the sudden and cataclysmic reversal of fortune experienced by Germany's once unstoppable U-Boat force), <i>The Temple</i> is also based on the logs and memoirs of the few U-Boat captains and crewmen that survived a war with an almost 80% casualty rate for German submariners. The play examines the severe tensions between the Nazi Party and the Kriesgmarine (the German Navy), the insanity of WWII and Naziism, and the engulfing madness one man experiences when put in the position of absolute power.</div>

THE MISSION


You're inside the sunken, pulverized body of the German-commissioned submarine, U-401, after fighting like hell for a country you're not sure you believe in anymore. It's the Spring of 1943. The world is at war above your head, but you're 200 meters below the surface of the ocean. 2 million pascals of force squeeze the vessel around you, conspiring to crush you beyond all recognition. You're surrounded by your dead fellow crewmen. The battery is dying. The oxygen is running out.And there's a monster on board with you.








The Temple, or Lebensraum, marks playwright Nat Cassidy's return to the world of H.P. Lovecraft after his one-man show, I Am Providence, which won the New York Innovative Theatre Award for Outstanding Solo Performance in 2011, and which Tor.com called: 

""[T]he most delightful thing we have ever seen anyone pull off on a stage, anywhere, ever ... An unexpectedly brilliant mediation on the use and function of horror, on H.P. Lovecraft himself, on the supernatural, on storytelling, on death, on hope. ... Creepy and magical enough to do old H.P. proud. ... I'm still thinking about it, days later.""
Updating Lovecraft's original story, which details the increasingly supernatural horrors experienced aboard a sunken submarine, to the middle of WWII (specifically, a time known as the ""Black Spring"" on account of the sudden and cataclysmic reversal of fortune experienced by Germany's once unstoppable U-Boat force), The Temple is also based on the logs and memoirs of the few U-Boat captains and crewmen that survived a war with an almost 80% casualty rate for German submariners. The play examines the severe tensions between the Nazi Party and the Kriesgmarine (the German Navy), the insanity of WWII and Naziism, and the engulfing madness one man experiences when put in the position of absolute power.


Please note: there will be a specific moment during the performance after which no audience members will be allowed out of the theatre. Ample warning will be given, and after that, there will be no turning back.

THE VESSEL

The Temple is thrilled and honored to be a part of the Brick Theater's first Resident Artist Program (BRAP). What does this mean? Basically, we get the theatre all to ourselves for two whole weeks. And what we plan to do with that freedom is pretty simple.

We're gonna build a submarine inside The Brick.


I mean, the theatrical approximation of a submarine, but still. Our plans involve reorienting the seating arrangement, building guardrails and hanging battens, even a periscope - doing all we can to give the audience as close to an authentic experience as possible ... while, of course, maintaining the level of comfort and escapability necessary to, y'know, enjoy a play.


But this means we need your help!

The money raised from this fundraising campaign will go almost exclusively towards paying our actors and our designers, all of whom have a hell of a job before them. Lights, sets, sound, costumes, gore, you name it. But we've got an extraordinary team and are about as excited as can possibly be to bring this incredibly unique and powerful adventure to you!




One of the costumes, rendered by our brilliant costumer, Ben Philipp.

So, please, check out our perks and consider donating. Any and all help is so hugely appreciated!! Even if it's just spreading the word!

<p>Beth Judah, a family-oriented
conservative synagogue in Ventnor, New Jersey, is preparing for our 8<sup>th</sup>
annual production of <i>Number the
Stars</i>.  Set in Denmark during World
War II, this musical adaptation of Lois Lowery’s Newberry Award winning middle
grade novel tells the story of a brave family’s sacrifice to save their Jewish
friends as the Nazis take control of the country.  Each year, Beth Judah
invites local schools to experience this poignant story and explore its themes
of courage, friendship, prejudice, family, and history. </p>
<p>Contributions will allow Beth Judah to
subsidize performances for schools who no longer have the resources to cover
the nominal ticket price.  In doing so,
we will offer many local students their first live theater experience, while
teaching the importance of tolerance and personalizing the horror of the
Holocaust.</p>
<p><b>Sharing the Message of Tolerance</b></p>
<p>Under pressure from budget cuts, our local schools are
having difficulties bringing their students to see the show, or bringing us to
their school to present the show there, even with our discounted student and
teacher ticket prices.  We are therefore
seeking $3,600 in contributions, which will allow us to offer scholarship funds

teachers alike have reported that the experience was as enjoyable as it was
educational.  Teachers who have brought
their classrooms regularly comment on the helpfulness of the lesson plans that
we provide, as well as the impact that the show and synagogue visit has had on

<p>In addition to its benefits as entertainment and as a

the Stars</i> brings another complimentary benefit to our audience.  Our venue for the show is Congregation Beth
Judah, a Conservative synagogue in Ventnor, New Jersey.  For many of the students who come to see the
show, this event marks the first time that they have seen or been inside a
synagogue, and we have found over the years that this expansion of student
horizons is beneficial to the development of tolerance for others.</p>
<p>Students who have the opportunity to see <i>Number the Stars</i> may remember new
historical facts, such as the role played by Danish Christians in saving their
Jewish friends and neighbors.  They may
recall seeing the Ark which holds Congregation Beth Judah’s Torah scrolls.  They may find themselves humming some of the
catchy tunes from the production’s memorable musical numbers.  Whatever the lasting impression of their

<p></p></div>","More Than a History Lesson
Beth Judah, a family-oriented
conservative synagogue in Ventnor, New Jersey, is preparing for our 8th
annual production of Number the
Stars.  Set in Denmark during World
War II, this musical adaptation of Lois Lowery’s Newberry Award winning middle
grade novel tells the story of a brave family’s sacrifice to save their Jewish
friends as the Nazis take control of the country.  Each year, Beth Judah
invites local schools to experience this poignant story and explore its themes
of courage, friendship, prejudice, family, and history. 
Contributions will allow Beth Judah to
subsidize performances for schools who no longer have the resources to cover
the nominal ticket price.  In doing so,
we will offer many local students their first live theater experience, while
teaching the importance of tolerance and personalizing the horror of the
Holocaust.
Sharing the Message of Tolerance
Under pressure from budget cuts, our local schools are
having difficulties bringing their students to see the show, or bringing us to
their school to present the show there, even with our discounted student and
teacher ticket prices.  We are therefore
seeking $3,600 in contributions, which will allow us to offer scholarship funds
so that students may continue to benefit from this wonderful experience
regardless of their school’s budget situation. 

We are offering exclusive gifts to contributors, including a
cast t-shirt, normally available only to cast and crew members; autographed
pictures of the talented Number the Stars
cast; and a DVD of the production, including performances by both Cast “A” and
Cast “B.”  With a donation of $360, you
will become an honorary cast member, receiving the t-shirt, autographed
picture, and DVD of both Cast “A” and Cast “B” performances.  In addition, you’ll have the satisfaction of
helping us share Number the Stars
with students who would otherwise not be able to see this important show.
