Below lies a detailed
personality profile of you, that is built by Internet giants and data brokers while
you are browsing the web. <br/>It’s not just anonymous data gathering, but detailed behavior
profiling that is linked to your identity. Why? Because when you created a “free”
account you accepted this practice. Even logging out, deleting cookies, 'private mode' or 'do-not-track' settings  do not prevent this tracking. You are personally identifiable. Everywhere.<br/></p>
The result is that Internet corporations possess detailed knowledge about your most intimate desires, beliefs
and behavior, which is <b>today already being used</b> for<br/><br/><ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Dynamic pricing</b> – Prices are adjusted according to your predicted      buying power i.e. your neighbor can pay less
     for the same product</li>
<li>
<b>Credit scoring</b> – Credit applications are rated based on
     your behavior pattern i.e. gambling online can ruin your scoring and chances for a loan<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Individual rating</b> – Insurances price individual plans based
     on your online profile i.e. retrieving infos about stroke or cancer can cause an increase</li>
<li>
<b>Personnel decisions</b> – Employers hire and promote staff depending
     on tracking profiles i.e. union support or health issues can be
     problematic</li>
<li>
<b>Search personalization </b>– Algorithms determine which info is ”relevant” <br/>i.e. they can omit (=censor) Republican news because you are a Democrat</li>
<li>
<b>Personalized ads</b> – Advertisers are bidding on your profile to target ads for manipulating your buying decisions based on your predicted intent <br/>

<p>Inappropriate “official”
access to sensitive data as well as hacker attacks are on the news almost daily. No data is safe. That’s why we feel especially personal data should not be gathered and stored without your
knowledge and explicit consent. <br/>eBlocker puts you back in control. You decide where you leave traces and see ads.<br/></p>

Since we couldn't find a tool that fully fit our needs we developed the idea of creating one. We wanted a very easy to use out of the box solution that doesn't have the disadvantages of other tools: <br/><b>The idea for the eBlocker was born. </b><br/> <br/>While
 trialling the eBlocker we've tried several browser plugins for ad- and 
tracker-blocking but we were always bound to a specific browser and 
needed extra software installation and configuration for IP 
anonymization. <br/>We've
 tried local proxies but they only work on specific operating systems, 
are difficult to configure and didn't work for our family members as 
they do not support individual settings. <br/>We
 thought Internet proxies might be a good idea but they usually decrease
 browsing speed and are mostly based in countries with lax privacy 
regulations. Most critically, we needed absolute trust as Internet 
proxies (or someone hacking them) can tap all data - which, obviously,
 would breach our definition of ""privacy"".<br/>Last
 but not least, we checked several DIY gateways only to find they are difficult to set up, are not capable of handling individual user 
settings, always encrypt all traffic of every family member via Tor and are simply too 
complicated for the regular user.<br/><br/>We wanted a solution that <b>works to plug &amp; play</b> right out of the box,  supports <b>individual settings</b> for each user as well as <b>all devices</b> in a network without any software installation or configuration.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438766714/lulvn0leuvd6rs8mcypp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Here is how we compare to other approaches.

<p>With much love we've<b> handmade a very limited number</b> of eBlockers that are ready to use. They come in a standard case with an eBlocker sticker and though they are not yet as polished as the final product - they deliver the exact same functionality. We will ship them 'plug and play' ready with all 
cabling and power supplies, all updates (including filter updates) and 
all new features are available to you until the end of 2016. After 2016 you can subscribe to our automatic update service for a small fee or manually update your eBlocker for free. <br/></p>
<p>Our flagship product <b>eBlocker Box4e</b> even comes with lifetime updates included.<br/></p>
<p>You'll get the <b>full comfort</b> of the future eBlocker <b>at a discount</b> as early as possible!</p>

Though the 'Early Access' eBlocker software doesn't contain all features of the final product just yet, the tracker- and ad-blocking components are already available as well as the automatic configuration. During this 'Early Access Phase' we would love your feedback on what we can improve so that we can prioritize our software development accordingly and add more functionality based on your needs. <br/>The 'Early Access Phase' will end December 31, 2015.<br/><br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","This campaign has ended. You can order your eBlocker at our online-shop: www.eblocker.com/shop





We are a start-up based in Hamburg, Germany. Our team of highly experienced developers and internet security professionals has worked together on our eBlocker project for almost two years. Our first prototypes are already in use and work great.
Get the feeling that online ads are following you? You just see the tip of the iceberg. Below lies a detailed
personality profile of you, that is built by Internet giants and data brokers while
you are browsing the web. It’s not just anonymous data gathering, but detailed behavior
profiling that is linked to your identity. Why? Because when you created a “free”
account you accepted this practice. Even logging out, deleting cookies, 'private mode' or 'do-not-track' settings  do not prevent this tracking. You are personally identifiable. Everywhere.
The result is that Internet corporations possess detailed knowledge about your most intimate desires, beliefs
and behavior, which is today already being used for


Dynamic pricing – Prices are adjusted according to your predicted      buying power i.e. your neighbor can pay less
     for the same product

Credit scoring – Credit applications are rated based on
     your behavior pattern i.e. gambling online can ruin your scoring and chances for a loan


Individual rating – Insurances price individual plans based
     on your online profile i.e. retrieving infos about stroke or cancer can cause an increase

Personnel decisions – Employers hire and promote staff depending
     on tracking profiles i.e. union support or health issues can be
     problematic

Search personalization – Algorithms determine which info is ”relevant” i.e. they can omit (=censor) Republican news because you are a Democrat

Personalized ads – Advertisers are bidding on your profile to target ads for manipulating your buying decisions based on your predicted intent 



Inappropriate “official”
access to sensitive data as well as hacker attacks are on the news almost daily. No data is safe. That’s why we feel especially personal data should not be gathered and stored without your
knowledge and explicit consent. eBlocker puts you back in control. You decide where you leave traces and see ads.

Today, the online industry claims “Data
is the new oil”.
We believe that “Privacy is the
new green”.
That’s why we built
eBlocker.


eBlocker is a small device that connects to your home network. It anonymizes your online behavior, blocks all ads and ensures that only the information you want to share is shared. eBlocker is constantly updated, recognizes all forms of tracking and protects the privacy of all users in your home network individually. It works with every connected device, browser and app. PC, Mac, iPad, smartTV, game console...We are privacy nerds who have been using different tools in the past to protect us from getting profiled while surfing the Web. Since we couldn't find a tool that fully fit our needs we developed the idea of creating one. We wanted a very easy to use out of the box solution that doesn't have the disadvantages of other tools: The idea for the eBlocker was born.  While
 trialling the eBlocker we've tried several browser plugins for ad- and 
tracker-blocking but we were always bound to a specific browser and 
needed extra software installation and configuration for IP 
anonymization. We've
 tried local proxies but they only work on specific operating systems, 
are difficult to configure and didn't work for our family members as 
they do not support individual settings. We
 thought Internet proxies might be a good idea but they usually decrease
 browsing speed and are mostly based in countries with lax privacy 
regulations. Most critically, we needed absolute trust as Internet 
proxies (or someone hacking them) can tap all data - which, obviously,
 would breach our definition of ""privacy"".Last
 but not least, we checked several DIY gateways only to find they are difficult to set up, are not capable of handling individual user 
settings, always encrypt all traffic of every family member via Tor and are simply too 
complicated for the regular user.We wanted a solution that works to plug & play right out of the box,  supports individual settings for each user as well as all devices in a network without any software installation or configuration.  Here is how we compare to other approaches. Even combining several existing tools does not yield to the ease of use and comprehensive protection our eBlocker will be offering very soon.We are in the final stages of product development in preparation for our initial launch by the end of the year. We have had fully functional MVP-prototypes (Minimal Viable Product) running in our own homes since December 2014 with great success and are now driving development in agile iterations.The core is now ready for the first public release and we are currently working on the automatic update service before we start the 'Early Access Phase' for techies by the end of September 2015. 
„I am enthusiastic.
Surprisingly, the eBlocker works after only 5 minutes … and instantly protects
my communication at home“  developer Blog (review in German) “…the
anonymization works instantly...”  security-insider.de (review in German) „eBlocker’s
easy setup and protection of all network devices, like smartphones, is
unparalleled to other solutions like Adblock or Ghostery that only work in some
browsers.” Willy Tech (review in German) 
“This
offering feels like a niche product that has potential to play well to techies
looking for a more comprehensive response to data collection, as well as others
who take privacy to a different level.”  Geektime (review in English) 
We are now ready to start limited pre-sales and 'Early Access Phase'As we are a small team, we love the idea of giving you access to our technology in an early state. This way you can access the eBlocker in the developmental stages and actively participate in identifying enhancements that will help us to improve. Your feedback and ideas will enable us to fine-tune the eBlocker so it delivers optimal functionality for everyone. During the 'Early Access Phase', early adopters who own a RASPBERRY PI or BANANA PI can install the eBlocker software on their devices themselves.YOU MAY ALSO USE:











Want to protect your Internet privacy straight away but are not a ""techie""?No problem!



With much love we've handmade a very limited number of eBlockers that are ready to use. They come in a standard case with an eBlocker sticker and though they are not yet as polished as the final product - they deliver the exact same functionality. We will ship them 'plug and play' ready with all 
cabling and power supplies, all updates (including filter updates) and 
all new features are available to you until the end of 2016. After 2016 you can subscribe to our automatic update service for a small fee or manually update your eBlocker for free. 
Our flagship product eBlocker Box4e even comes with lifetime updates included.
You'll get the full comfort of the future eBlocker at a discount as early as possible!







Though the 'Early Access' eBlocker software doesn't contain all features of the final product just yet, the tracker- and ad-blocking components are already available as well as the automatic configuration. During this 'Early Access Phase' we would love your feedback on what we can improve so that we can prioritize our software development accordingly and add more functionality based on your needs. The 'Early Access Phase' will end December 31, 2015.




Already implemented features (available in 'Early Access' release) 


Zero Installation (automatic configuration – needs IPv4 DHCP network)Alternative: Manual IPv4 configuration, if your network has no DHCP server.

Tracker-Blocking (third party tracker blocker) incl. link-tracker blocker

Ad-Blocking (third party ads) 


Whitelisting of individual websites (disables eBlocker for specific site)

Enabling/disabling of eBlocker for individual network devices

Enabling/disabling of Modules (i.e. Tracker- and Ad-Blocking modules)

Block Indicator (shows eBlocker status and how many URLs were blocked)


Controlbar (central user interface for easy access to whitelisting etc.)


Automatic Updates (core software, filter lists, all new features)





EFFECTIVE! AD-BLOCKING



EASY TO USE! CONTROLBAR


ADMINISTRATION INTERFACE







What should be the next features for your eBlocker?
Following features are not yet included in the first Early Access release. They will be released according to your priorities over time by automatic updates. 








Tor Support
     (this is currently in the works and will be released shortly) 

Multi-User Capability
     (eBlocker is run in Single-User mode in initial release) 

Enabling/disabling of eBlocker for individual apps 

Change of User-Agent
     (to disguise an iPad as a PC for the website – important for dynamic
     pricing based on certain devices/manufacturers) 

Parental Control
     (protect your kids from accessing sites not suited for minors)

SSL Support
     (all features for HTTPS websites)

Advanced User Interface (even nicer GUI) 






Alongside the
software development we are working on the final casing design, are talking to
case manufacturing and fulfillment firms and are selecting our suppliers along
the supply chain.

Currently we expect to be ready for a small series production
by the end of the year. 
There is still a lot of work to do and we love to hire more staff to develop business. Your support will help us to continue
our mission and get more talents on board.
In return we will deliver the easiest and most advanced privacy solution that will protect you and your
family from spying eyes. 
We want you to know that we have developed the eBlocker with passion for you and your family's privacy and so we believe in keeping costs as low
 as possible. 
Please like us and share with your friends to help get this 
project off the ground and give the world back the privacy protection we all deserve. #switchonprivacy












Thank you for supporting us!


We
 are very happy and thankful about your support and will honor you forever!
 

If desired and ok with your privacy preference, we'll put your name up 
on our 'Honors and Sponsors' blogpage and keep you posted about our 
progress.

<h3>In-depth with castAway™ Case’s Second Screen (one)</h3>
<p>Our journey began by seeking to find a solution to one of modern life’s most common problems: limited screen space on your smartphone. That’s why we first envisioned the castAway™ one (tablet screen) as the perfect companion for your device. </p>
<p><u><strong>Quick Facts</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>castAway™ case connects with any iOS or Android phone and continues to work even when detached from your smartphone.</li>
<li>Features a dual boot option that lets you quickly turn it into a larger keyboard, trackpad, or game controller for your phone.</li>
<li>It is fully-equipped with a hi-res capacitive touch screen, WiFi, Bluetooth, front and back-facing cameras, &amp; audio jack.</li>
<li>Integrated SD slot allows you to expand storage and offload photos from your phone</li>
<li>The built-in battery can do double duty and be used to boost your smartphone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the castAway™ case as a perfectly sized tablet that pairs with your smartphone. It’s an anywhere computer that runs the latest version of Chromium via our own implementation.</p>
<p>We intend to seek certification with Google LLC. Both the tablet and your iOS or Android smartphone run our app, code-named MultiTask+™, which pairs the two and enables them to communicate over encrypted WiFi and Bluetooth channels. </p>
<p>The castAway™ one (tablet screen) allows you to open multiple apps at once, copy/paste, and access files and photos from either screen.  Our app, code-named MultiTask+™, for iOS and Android, is the software experience that enables you to connect your smartphone to your castAway™ case with simple commands and shortcuts. </p>
<p>A neat feature of the castAway™ case is that you can detach your tablet from your phone, and it will continue to function as a standalone device while continuing to communicate with your phone over WiFi. </p>
<p>Created by <a href=""https://www.kenmages.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ken Mages</a>, a 40-year veteran of the electronics industry, the castAway™ case is your second screen. Ken brought on a skilled product designer, Joe Jasinski,  former director of industrial design at Dell, along with two former executives from Microsoft and Intel to create this fantastic device.</p>
<h3>Behind the Design &amp; Technology of castAway™</h3>
<p><u><strong>By Design</strong></u> - The castAway™ case design uses an ingenious patent-pending universal magnetic hinge.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/372551453?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><u><strong>Magic Magnets</strong></u> - We spent months exploring unique ways to create a hinge that would give 360° range of motion, fixed positions (flat, back to back, laptop, tented), and the ability to detach and go. We were obsessed with keeping the design simple, slim, and as Joe likes to say, have that ""Snap, Crackle, &amp; Pop"" that will make it a treat to use. </p>
<p>The magic part of the hinge is on the second screen tablet side. When the tablet is detached from your smartphone, your phone will look and feel like it would in any other high-end protective case. The hinge design also simplifies the task of supporting the myriad of smartphones.</p>
<p>The smartphone side of the case is a custom fit for each major model type. That said, there are many unique (lower volume) phones for which we are developing a universal case back that works with the hinge. The castAway™ case will be available in 3 model sizes:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">one/S with a 5.8” screen for smartphones with screens of similar size</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">one/L with a 6.3” screen for smartphones with screens of similar size</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">one/XL with a 6.9” screen for smartphones with screens of similar size</p>
<p><u><strong>Power Boost</strong></u> - Smartphone out of gas? 38% of people say that battery life is the second biggest criteria when selecting a new smartphone. The castAway™ case has a comparable battery life to your smartphone. We designed the castAway™ case to be able to boost your smartphone using a small accessory cable. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Making hardware is difficult, but our team has decades of experience.

Why We're Using Indiegogo

We've built the prototype and moving into the manufacturing production phase.  We need your help to bring it to the world. When you contribute to our campaign, you will get an early-bird unit for a fantastic price, and you'll help us build something everyone needs: a powerful second screen for the smartphone you already own and love!
How Can You Help? 
Help Build the Buzz - Our Indiegogo campaign was a huge success, and we want to extend a warm thanks to our backers.  We are thrilled with everyone's passion and interest.  We hope to reach $1 Million in sales by the time we start shipping.  If we can do that, we can afford to make a couple of other case material options available as upgrades.  What could they be? You tell us.  To help us get there, we are setting some stretch objectives and a referral program to help motivate the base!   
Stretch Goals

Top Refer - receive a castAway™ case bundle (any size) 

Click Here to learn how to get credit for your referrals. 

Challenges
Making hardware is difficult, but our team has decades of experience. One unexpected wrinkle in our plan was the spread of the Coronavirus throughout the world; which will have an affect on parts of our supply chain. As of February 2020, we plan shipping the Case & Mods (minus the One Tablet Screen) by August and the castAway™ one by October. 
Going forward, there could always be extenuating issues that could slow down the delivery, but we believe our products will be available as expected.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Soap Mesh is
a technology we have created that allows two or more Soap devices the ability
to create a Soap Mesh Cluster. What is a Soap Mesh Cluster? The closest example
to a Soap Cluster is most similar to what is known as a Beowulf cluster.  So Soap Mesh will allow two or more Soap
devices to work together wirelessly as one super computer adding advantages of
computing power, storage, security and even creates greater coverage and range
of all the wireless connectivity in Soap.

<p>Every time
you add a Soap device to your collective it gets bigger, faster and stronger.  This also has the added benefit of never
needing to throw out Soap! The older ones will always beneficial to the hive!</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 38px;"">Soap Mobile</span><br/></p>

 TopSoap Mesh 
Soap Mesh is
a technology we have created that allows two or more Soap devices the ability
to create a Soap Mesh Cluster. What is a Soap Mesh Cluster? The closest example
to a Soap Cluster is most similar to what is known as a Beowulf cluster.  So Soap Mesh will allow two or more Soap
devices to work together wirelessly as one super computer adding advantages of
computing power, storage, security and even creates greater coverage and range
of all the wireless connectivity in Soap. 

Every time
you add a Soap device to your collective it gets bigger, faster and stronger.  This also has the added benefit of never
needing to throw out Soap! The older ones will always beneficial to the hive!Soap Mobile

Soap will be developing mobile apps for the iOS7, iOS8 and Android. We don't have any firm time frames but a Windows mobile app will also be developed (we may do it more quickly if we reach our stretch goal).Soap AccessoriesSoap with no rope - Wireless EthernetA wireless 802.11AC USB/RJ45 jack allows a wireless link from Soap to the WAN on your router.  No ethernet cord required!Soap Dish - Wireless Charge Pad

choice. When we do, please respond and let us know the correct address where
you would like your Soap shipped.If I don't get the upgrade do I get access to the Soap Media App?  Yes all backers from IndieGoGo/KickStarter will receive the Soap Media App on their Soap devices.

Purchase Options


Runcible Babbage

The Babbage model is designed for the stylish experimenter and for the early adopter alike. This is a full-spec Runcible brain with a durable, organic feeling back made from reclaimed ocean plastic fished out of the Great Pacific Plastic Island.
Runcible Lovelace

The limited edition Lovelace model is designed for the Aficionado. This is a full-spec Runcible brain with an iconic, unique, solid wood back made from local, sustainably harvested madrone wood in Mendocino County, California.


Runcible BacksLike a smartphone case, Runcible backs are easily interchangeable. Simply twist the back a 1/8 turn to remove it.All backs are responsibly sourced from sustainable & reclaimed hardwoods in Mendocino, California, or reclaimed plastics from the Great Pacific Plastic Island.Choose One or Collect All Four:Madrone - sustainably sourced and crafted in Mendocino, California.Black Acacia - sustainable sourced and crafted in Mendocino, California.Reclaimed Ocean Plastic - fished from the Great Pacific Plastic Island and recycled into an organic feeling back.Sinker Redwood - truly unique and extremely limited quantities.Sinker Redwood comes from old growth redwood trunks which fell into Northern California rivers from natural causes, one hundred years ago or more. Over time, minerals from the water penetrate the wood creating a truly unique, unmistakable look and feel. A ban is now in place preventing any more sinker redwoods from being extracted from the river. With the help of master craftsmen in Mendocino, Runcible secured a limited quantity of sinker redwood to produce one hundred collector quality Runcible backs.

Runcible AppsRuncible will initially ship with apps for...
Photography and photo editing in collaboration with lite.ly

Music playback
Various clocks faces
Star-gazing
Maps and exploration
Time and date management
Telephony
Both Monohm and partners are working hard on other apps as well but have not yet announced final timelines. Rest assured, we're building Runcible for the sole purpose of creating new and unique experiences.Additionally, anyone with a bit of software development skills can create apps in HTML5 + JavaScript or as native APK packages. Documentation and tutorials will be available with the Dev Kit as well as to the general public when Runcible ships.
Open Source Hardware & Software
Runcible is repairable and upgradeable. Both hardware and software are fully open source. GPIO headers are exposed for easy installation of custom hardware.
""It's like a supercharged RaspberryPi in your pocket... expandable, repairable, upgradeable and fully open source.""

Turn your Runcible into anything your heart desires.


Open source hardware schematics will be available when the device ships.
Runcible runs BuniOS, a fully open source version of Android 5.1 built to run HTML5 and native apps at blazing speeds.

Background
We have spent the last year designing, re-designing, and sourcing components for this initial Runcible release.  While this device isn’t yet the polished, “available at the Apple store” kind of consumer electronic we know it will one day be, it is already useful, playful, powerful and truly something new.  
This version of Runcible features a Snapdragon 410 Quad-core processor, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, 1GB RAM, 8GB eMMC 5.0 Flash storage, Rear-facing Camera, BuniOS (based on the Android 5.1), and exposed GPIO  and USB Host for further expansion and innovation by us but also by YOU.  Note that LTE/4g connectivity is a goal but not a certainty for this version (see ""challenges"" below).If LTE doesn't make it into this initial version, it will be a simple upgrade shortly afterwards, not a replacement!
Funds from this campaign will go to further polish and hone the process of creating Runcible as scale in a sustainable, responsible way.  We are keeping it local.  The wood backs are made with sustainably harvested and reclaimed wood from Mendocino County, California.  The device will be built right here in the Bay Area by people who live and work here.
Every dollar this initial release generates will go toward making Runcible cooler, better, and more broadly available.

And for the seniors we love, well it helps them remain independent by tracking their routine everyday movements without being invaded or distracted by invasive video gadgets and pendant gizmos.</p><p><strong>What is it?</strong></p><p>At first glance, the STAY'nTOUCH sensor looks like an ordinary night light.

And for the seniors we love, well it helps them remain independent by tracking their routine everyday movements without being invaded or distracted by invasive video gadgets and pendant gizmos.What is it?At first glance, the STAY'nTOUCH sensor looks like an ordinary night light. However, it's much more than that.  It's motion sensor detects your parents’ routine movements and transmits what's going on to an app on your phone.  It can detect movement within a range of about three meters, so it's not a problem if the closest plug is across the room or down the hallway.

Recharging the SIMPIZ between 3-15 minutes will provide enough juice to fully charge these popular devices:       Living in the modern world, we’re constantly on our smartphones 24/7 — but the problem is most smartphone batteries can't keep up with our lifestyle and the way we use our phones. So, we’re forced to rely on portable chargers to get through the day.  But as most of us can attest, when you need portable batteries the most, like a night out on the town or a quick weekend vacation, you forget to recharge them! So either you leave it behind or you unknowingly bring along a dead portable power bank. We’ve all been there. And we know the frustration. But that aggravation is coming to an end with the SIMPIZ.
 
WE HAVE CREATED 4 VERSIONS! 
**After the campaign ends, you will be able to select one for your hub+dock**
 

 





The SIMPIZ was created for those who are too busy to waste precious hours waiting on a portable charger! SIMPIZ is the fastest portable charger that only needs 3 minutes to charge up enough juice to power a phone. 3 minutes won't fully charge the SIMPIZ, but it's enough power for your phone! 



 

Even if you forget to recharge it overnight, the SIMPIZ only takes 18 minutes to power up, so you can get out the door faster than ever before.
With SIMPIZ's 9000mAh capacity, it can charge most smartphones three times or more after only 18! You're ready to go and conquer the world, knowing SIMPIZ can keep your phone juiced.
 
 [Prototype Demo]



18 - 21 minutes is the normal charging time, it just depends on how much you have already depleted the battery. 



The SIMPIZ also features QC 2.0 output speed to charge QC-compatible phones quickly and easily.

SIMPIZ has an amazing versatile and convenient hub + dock station that allows you to recharge the SIMPIZ while simultaneously charging multiple devices , like your smart phone and tablet. With the hub + dock’s three output ports to charge all your devices, it keeps everything all in one place and reduces outlet use. All your cables and devices will be neatly placed on a surface thanks to SIMPIZ. Lost cables and dead phones will be a thing of the past.
 
  


Instead of fiddling with cables the SIMPIZ hub + dock only takes a quick second to plug in. It's simple and efficient. The dock also features a blue light indicator that blinks while charging and turns solid when the SIMPIZ is fully charged.
 



Safe to use for charging SIMPIZ and your phone. 
SIMPIZ is also one of the longest-lasting batteries, double the cycle life of standard portable batteries. We use special high-efficiency battery cells that are able to handle the power of DUBI 1.0™ and QC 2.0. The result is a speedy two-way charging not found in other chargers.

</h3>
<p>Social Hub is a new type of social media aggregator that does
what no other competitor can. We’ve gone out of our way to separate the wheat

networks on the planet: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Why these three?</p>
<p><b>Facebook</b> is the
most popular social media platform in the world, with 1.23 billion monthly
active users, accounting for 20% of all mobile internet traffic in the US and

<p><b>Twitter </b>is the
world leader for exchanging short text-based messages online. They have
captured a unique functionality and audience appeal not covered by any other
social media platform.</p>
<p><b>Instagram </b>is the
largest photo and video sharing social media platform, with 15 million pictures
shared in 2013.</p>
<p>Together, these three form the primary pillars of modern
social media use. Social Hub brings them together, and adds comprehensive

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Social Hub has the ability to completely change the way the world uses social media, but we can’t get there without your support. Right now, we have two major priorities:</p>
<p>1.  Finishing development of an upgraded version of the Social Hub 2.0 platform that will seamlessly incorporate all our features and trump all competitors on the market. Goal: $300,000</p>
<p>2.  Develop an aggressive marketing campaign through strategic search engine optimization on Google and other search engines, building up enough of a customer base to keep us afloat and sustainably growing. Goal: $360,000 per month. </p>
<p><u>Total operating costs for first year: $4,620,000</u></p>
<p>We are monetized primarily through third party advertising, and some additional features. The app will remain forever free to download and use, but we will have inexpensive advanced features and upgrades available. Users will be able to disable advertising for $2.99 per year, or activate other features like birthday reminders and analytics for 99 cents apiece. </p>
<p>We are offering equity in the company in exchange for the initial funds we need to ensure our success. Communication is a perpetual need, and any technology which can promise an easier and more fluid way to communicate is a smart investment for people who understand the direction this area of the market is moving. By investing with us, you are investing in the networking abilities and quality of relationships of our entire species. We expect to be able to pay back the principle investment in as little as six months.</p>

disappearing any time soon, so we are very confident in the eventual success of

<p>The <a href=""http://www.gigastrandos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Gigastrand OS Site"">Gigastrand OS</a> is a self-supporting PC operating system designed with superior cross-platform compatibility but is safer and less expensive to operate than other systems.</p>
<p><span><strong>What the heck is an Operating System (OS)?<br/></strong>An operating system is software that runs other programs (apps). Examples of operating systems are Microsoft Windows (TM), Android, and Ubuntu.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by Cross-platform?</strong><br/>The Gigastrand OS will be capable of running software from other systems including RedHat (RPM) Packages, Microsoft Windows (TM) software and apps, and some Android apps out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by Self-Supporting OS? </strong><br/>When you have a problem with your computer, who do you call? Microsoft or your PC manufacturer?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Chances are, that you call your PC manufacturer for support or perhaps some third party. Neither of these seem like the ideal choice to support software developed by someone else. After all, in the example of Microsoft Windows, Microsoft developed the software, wouldn't they be a better choice to support it?</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","The elevator pitchMany of you know the limitations and frustrations of various device software. You can't finish a spreadsheet on your tablet that you started on your PC; You can't pull up the same web sites on your phone as you do your laptop; and jumping from device to device is like having to speak multiple languages. We intend to solve all that.
The Gigastrand OS is a self-supporting PC operating system designed with superior cross-platform compatibility but is safer and less expensive to operate than other systems.
What the heck is an Operating System (OS)?An operating system is software that runs other programs (apps). Examples of operating systems are Microsoft Windows (TM), Android, and Ubuntu.
What do you mean by Cross-platform?The Gigastrand OS will be capable of running software from other systems including RedHat (RPM) Packages, Microsoft Windows (TM) software and apps, and some Android apps out of the box.
What do you mean by Self-Supporting OS? When you have a problem with your computer, who do you call? Microsoft or your PC manufacturer?


Chances are, that you call your PC manufacturer for support or perhaps some third party. Neither of these seem like the ideal choice to support software developed by someone else. After all, in the example of Microsoft Windows, Microsoft developed the software, wouldn't they be a better choice to support it?


Our goal with the Self-Supporting OS Concept is to utilize various technologies to make the Gigastrand OS provide all of the support from systems and services contained within the operating system itself rather than outside sources or third parties. That means you, your users, or your help-desk staff do not need to be fluent in Linux to get help when they need it and to keep things running smoothly.




Ok, so what is the Gigastrand OS?
Gigastrand International is creating a commercial, Linux-based Operating System specifically designed to aid the users of other systems to transition into the world of Linux. We are partnering with Linux distribution and software developers to create a Linux distribution that is not only up to our high user-friendliness standards but will incorporate brand new technologies. The Gigastrand Operating System will:

Be easy to use
Be purpose-built to aid users in the transition to Linux
Come pre-loaded with all the essential software
Make it easy to install additional software
Have built-in Microsoft Compatibility
Include self-support resources
Include end-user support resources
Give back to the open-source community and the technologies that support the Gigastrand OS.

Platforms
The Gigastrand OS will run on several platforms allowing the end user to use all of their devices the same.


PCs
Laptops
Tablets
Game Boxes
Set-top boxes
Many more....

Gigastrand OS Versions
We are planning 3 versions of the Gigastrand OS. Free, Open, and Premium
The Free Edition will be just that: free. It will include basic software, basic support, and come in 32 bit only. This will be available for download to the public. You can also download the BETA 3 for this version at gigastrandos.com/beta.htm



 The Open Version (above) will feature premium software, basic support and come in your choice of 32 or 64 bit for about $8. This will be distributed through Linux4Everyone in single disc packages.



The Premium Version (above) will have premium software, premium support, and come in both 32 and 64 bit versions. This will be sold in a retail package for about $48.






Community-EnhancedWe believe that those who work so hard to bring us quality open source software deserve to be compensated for their efforts. Therefore, this will be a commercial distribution with much of the profit going to support the free and open source software that supports the OS. 

The Project Today The Gigastrand OS of 2013 is an OS that is stable, useful, and easy to use while providing structured support for users, OEMs, and contributors. We have developed the OS to BETA 3.The end goal is to develop the OS to a finished product - Free, Open, and Premium in both 32 and 64 bit versions.
 

What We Need the Money For
On our own, we have managed to raise about 4% ($1600) of our total development costs which has gotten us to the Free Edition BETA 3. We have reached a stage in our development where we will be developing and testing the Open and Premium editions. Because of the premium features and software in these editions the development costs increase substantially.
If we reach our goal, here is a breakdown as to where the dollars will go for the OS development.
Development Expense (Including developer payroll) - $20,000
Legal stuff (including software licenses and legal fees) - $8,000
Hardware (including additional PCs, tablets, and servers) - $4,000
Facilities and utilities (lights, rent, internet) - $2,000
Promotion, fulfillment, and Distribution - $4,000
Fees (from Indiegogo, credit card, and misc) - $2,000
 
Total - $40,000



If we raise - then we will...
Indegogo allows us to keep the money we raise - even if we do not make it all the way to goal. If we raise all $40,000 (fully funded) we will...



be able to develop all software to its full potential
have end-user support systems developed in full
have solutions for laptops, servers, and PCs by March 1, 2014
have Game Boxes by May 1, 2014
be into the development of smart TV set-top boxes and tablets by September 1, 2014
have Linux video security systems developed in 2014

If we raise $20,000 (Half-funded) we will...

be able to develop all software to its full potential
have end-user support systems developed in full
have solutions for laptops, servers, and PCs by May 1, 2014
have Game Boxes by October 1, 2013

If we raise $10,000 (Quarter-funded) we will...

be able to develop all software to its full potential
have partial end-user support systems developed
have solutions for laptops, servers, and PCs by May 1, 2014

If we raise the minimum $4,000 (Tenth-funded) we will...

be able to develop the Open and Premium Editions of the OS.
cover some software licensing for development

Money raised over and above the $40,000 will be used to help fund Linux advocacy programs and distribute free products at Linux4Everyone.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>KeMice is a revolutionary keyboard</h1>
<h1>1.KeMice is small to take away with you.</h1>
<h1>2.KeMice has two parts, typing more comfortable.</h1>
<h1>3.KeMice makes the mouse built-in the  keyboard.</h1>
<p>KeMice team thanks for your checking our new project. Please check above video to get more details about how we make you free. And thanks again to all contributions, because these would never have been made without your support.- Abner Lee</p>
<h1><strong>About KeMice-</strong></h1>
<p><strong>KeMice is a simple Keyboard with built-in <strong>Mouse</strong>, for <strong>working </strong>comfortably  and  taking with you almost everywhere!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why<strong> should</strong> Kemice be a Revolutionary keyboard ?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Firstly :</strong></em> For example the iPad / iPhone / Android mobile equipment virtual keyboard or some bluetooth keyboards are tiny ( keys' size should be smaller), wrong typing is easy to happen, and you feel impatient to type letters on such small screen for a long time. This is the first reason why we designed KeMice keyboard.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/607/822/326d707d9d020ce7015d7d5ae63967a2_large.jpg?1369130455"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><strong>Functioning through bluetooth:</strong></h1>
<p>However KeMice offers a convenient working solution to help you type easily with Ipads or tablets -</p>
<p>1. Kemice keyboard with standard size keys and enough space beween keys.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/810/54df534f0ed4f8883ab3d15a068cd1d1_large.jpg?1368806064"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/097/654b87f2cad135d7dc378c2b400f00ba_large.jpg?1368772964"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>2.To make the standard key size and enough space between keys , KeMice has removed functional keys (F1 -F12), and removed the number keys as well. So it is more convenient for taking together with you anywhere.</p>
<p>The common bluetooth keyboard is with all function keys:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/029/e524de5d123d81bf231f699338be94e2_large.jpg?1368771505"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>KeMice keyboard just has necessary letter keys (A - Z)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/117/609525e6035915dd5b9f909383980431_large.jpg?1368773912"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/070/a1daeb499e8b2c01cfe52f264204ac46_large.jpg?1368772310"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>How to input numerals and mnotations with KeMice?</p>
<p>For input of numerals and notations, there is a hotkey on right part. Only need to press the hotkey, and it will show your needs ( function keys F1-F12)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/180/512e19e6e344f70bc8ff90b48a05982e_large.jpg?1368776531"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 261px;""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Secondly :</em></strong> All most the existing keyboards, including any virtual /ergonomic keyboards, it needs your both hands together all the time to type. You will feel tired after working long time.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/607/851/cb1bf4c117be4779f3f803195adc4bff_large.jpg?1369133772"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>However, KeMice as an innovative keyboard, it has been designed into two sperated parts ( one part for left hand typing, another part for right hand typing).</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/216/71100119aad495da9355543648c1606e_large.jpg?1368778222"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For it has two sperated parts, you could have many different postures freely as you like.</p>
<h1>1)</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/604/484/55f60cfba250a1b3765f97e57da32a29_large.jpg?1369029586"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>2)</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/604/596/2d4e43e82c05709051d1ed720b6b3c25_large.jpg?1369034361"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>4)</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/604/645/e8631125382a12c5bd46d9adbd51b5d0_large.jpg?1369037997"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/604/713/6de8c3015c105e02c9df4420decf0ec0_large.jpg?1369042892"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>KeMice keyboard is also suitable for iPhone:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/604/955/1e66b74b3a68b6b3bbac5044266bebef_large.jpg?1369056355"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Thirdly:</em></strong> From now on, working with KeMice keyboard, there is no need of another mouse, of hands to shift on keyboard constantly, because the mouse has been built in the right hand part of KeMice keyboard.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/605/297/37c116eb92afdab234c6796b2486af2b_large.jpg?1369065313"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>---When typing, it works as a keyboard:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/605/430/94d5ee0ccdb7febf63cdee0d1cb63671_large.jpg?1369068400"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>---When moving, it works as a mouse:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/605/493/c399508fed997348de8fa2cc09e76246_large.jpg?1369069557"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>KeMice is a keyboard of excellent quality</strong></p>
<p>For we are the big fans of apple products, we are pursuing best designs for each detail .</p>
<p><strong>Craftsmanship</strong></p>
<p>1. With CNC machine to produce, also with solid billets of aircraft grade aluminum material for the KeMice keyboard, not any through molding or casting production process.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/598/688/623df46202e8ad43077164a62300942d_large.jpg?1368802672"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2. First-rate finishing color</strong></p>
<p>KeMice is not only a keybaord but also a good artwork after you touched it by yourself. White or Black finish color for choosing. We are cooperating with some specialized metal finishing companies to help achieve the first -rate finishing color that you could find on Apple's unibody Macbook Pro's and iMacs - its hand buffed, glass bead blasted, electro-chemically micropolished, hard anodized and sealed.</p>

<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Top Question:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:How it works?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong></p>
<p>This question should be most important quation you will ask.</p>
<p>1.KeMice keyboard with left part + right part ,the two parts are independent.</p>
<p>2.Left part just for typing letters,it should be connected with your Ipad/ Iphone ....via bluetooth device.</p>
<p>3. Right part is not only for typing,it works together with left part while you need whole keyboard to typing.The RIGHT PART also could be as a MOUSE while you need.</p>
<p><strong>Q:How the right part works not only as a keyboard but also as a mouse?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Also it should be connected with your Ipad / Iphone...Via bluetooth device.</p>
<p>Mouse has built-in right part, we design a infrared ray induction switch on right part of keyboard .When you show a catching / moving action to right part, it could be works as a mouse .Letter “<strong>J</strong>”- it stands for mouse left location ; Letter “<strong>K</strong>” - it stands for mouse right location.When typing, it works as keyboard, when moving, it works as a mouse.No need mouse work together with any more, from today.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is KeMice charged for right part as mouse ?</strong></p>

About KeMice-
KeMice is a simple Keyboard with built-in Mouse, for working comfortably  and  taking with you almost everywhere!
Why should Kemice be a Revolutionary keyboard ?
Firstly : For example the iPad / iPhone / Android mobile equipment virtual keyboard or some bluetooth keyboards are tiny ( keys' size should be smaller), wrong typing is easy to happen, and you feel impatient to type letters on such small screen for a long time. This is the first reason why we designed KeMice keyboard.

Functioning through bluetooth:
However KeMice offers a convenient working solution to help you type easily with Ipads or tablets -
1. Kemice keyboard with standard size keys and enough space beween keys.


2.To make the standard key size and enough space between keys , KeMice has removed functional keys (F1 -F12), and removed the number keys as well. So it is more convenient for taking together with you anywhere.
The common bluetooth keyboard is with all function keys:

KeMice keyboard just has necessary letter keys (A - Z)


How to input numerals and mnotations with KeMice?
For input of numerals and notations, there is a hotkey on right part. Only need to press the hotkey, and it will show your needs ( function keys F1-F12)

Secondly : All most the existing keyboards, including any virtual /ergonomic keyboards, it needs your both hands together all the time to type. You will feel tired after working long time.

However, KeMice as an innovative keyboard, it has been designed into two sperated parts ( one part for left hand typing, another part for right hand typing).

For it has two sperated parts, you could have many different postures freely as you like.
1)

2)

3)

4)

5)

KeMice keyboard is also suitable for iPhone:

Thirdly: From now on, working with KeMice keyboard, there is no need of another mouse, of hands to shift on keyboard constantly, because the mouse has been built in the right hand part of KeMice keyboard.

---When typing, it works as a keyboard:

---When moving, it works as a mouse:

KeMice is a keyboard of excellent quality
For we are the big fans of apple products, we are pursuing best designs for each detail .
Craftsmanship
1. With CNC machine to produce, also with solid billets of aircraft grade aluminum material for the KeMice keyboard, not any through molding or casting production process.

2. First-rate finishing color
KeMice is not only a keybaord but also a good artwork after you touched it by yourself. White or Black finish color for choosing. We are cooperating with some specialized metal finishing companies to help achieve the first -rate finishing color that you could find on Apple's unibody Macbook Pro's and iMacs - its hand buffed, glass bead blasted, electro-chemically micropolished, hard anodized and sealed.

One day, Giora spotted Oded on a television program, where Oded was showcasing a mobile video game he had created that was controlled via head gestures. A lightbulb went off.</p><p>Giora saw the potential beyond gaming. With a bit of chutzpah, he was able to track down Oded by calling the TV station, and challenged him to use his knowledge of gesture recognition to create a touch-free phone.</p><p>Together they founded Sesame and built the Sesame software technology.</p><p>Sesame is committed to setting a new standard in assistive technologies.

<p>Sesame is the first completely touch-free smartphone technology that is controlled entirely through head movements and voice control, without any additional custom hardware requirements.</p>

<p>We leveraged advancements in computer vision, user experience, and voice recognition to build a completely accessible, hands-free mobile solution.</p>
<p>Currently, Sesame provides touch-free accessibility for Google’s existing Nexus 5 smartphone.

<h3>How do I order a Sesame smartphone?</h3>
<p>We are currently taking pre-orders via Indiegogo so hop on over there and place your order today!</p>
<h3>When can I expect to receive my Sesame smartphone?</h3>
<p>We are putting the final touches on the phone and going through one more round of testing before we send out the phone. Our projected ship date is Feb 1, 2015 and we are confident we’ll be able to meet our goal.</p>
<h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
<p>Shipping is free to anywhere in the USA. If you would like us to ship to you internationally, please refer to our shipping guide.</p>
<h3>Return Policy</h3>
<p>We want you to be 100% happy with your Sesame Phone. If you discover you cannot use the phone due to your physical limitation, simply send it back and we will give you a full refund. Shipping on us! 
(* We will not accept the phone if it is damaged or broken)</p>
<h3>Will the Sesame smartphone work for me?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Sesame phone works by tracking small head movements which are translated into a “cursor” that appears on the screen of the phone. Since your head movements are what controls the cursor, then some movement of the head is required. As a test, can you perform slight “yes” and “no” gestures with your head? If so, then you should have no problem being tracked and controlling the device. Our goal is to ensure the phone works for as broad a set of users as possible and as such we are continuously testing the device to meet that goal.</p>
<h3>What will I be able to do on the phone?</h3>
<p>Anything that can be done today using touch can be done on the Sesame smartphone without any touch required. Our users make phone calls, send texts, browse the internet, watch videos on Youtube, socialize on Facebook and even play Angry Birds and Candy Crash.</p>
<h3>What about apps that I download?</h3>
<p>When you use a Sesame Enable smartphone you have instant touch-free access to just about any app that you download from the Google Play store. No additional set-up required. The same technology that controls the cursor on the phone extends to any app that you download. Imagine that — a whole world of applications that can work for you! We’re pretty excited about the idea.</p>
<h3>What if the Sesame smartphone doesn’t work for me?</h3>
<p>One of our founding principles is to create a phone that works for people of all physical abilities. Unfortunately, our solution won’t work for every single person. So we offer a full, money-back guarantee if you are unhappy with your device. We will even cover the shipping costs to send the phone back to us.
(* We will not accept the phone if it is damaged or broken)</p>
<h3>How can I turn on and off the device if it’s in sleep mode? Especially if I can’t use my hands at all?</h3>
<p>Just say “Open Sesame” and the phone will turn on and start tracking immediately. If you say, “Close Sesame” you can similarly turn the phone off. If Open Sesame doesn’t work for you, the catchphrase can be customized to your liking.</p>
<h3>Do I need to use a stand with my Sesame smartphone?</h3>
<p>Depending on where you plan to use your Sesame smartphone, you may find a stand to be helpful. We don’t sell stands directly, but we’ve provided a list of different stands that work with our phone. This list isn’t all-inclusive, so if you already have a stand at home, there’s a good chance it will work with the Sesame as well.</p>
<h3>Tutorial Videos</h3>
<p>By the time we send out phones video tutorials on how to work the phone will be up and running</p>
<h3>There are so many more uses for this amazing technology! Driving, cooking, playing an instrument… Why aren’t you getting it out to everyone???</h3>
<p>We get asked this a lot. There are many amazing and innovative companies out there who are using gesture recognition technology in the fields of gaming, entertainment, and other common mass uses. We feel the focus on the disability market is both a mission and an expertise developed by daily visiting different people with disabilities. Nevertheless, as is with many accessibility solutions, once perfected where the need is high and real, it can disseminate to other more widespread uses. Just like a wheelchair ramp is also enabling for baby carriages, bicycles, shopping trolleys, etc.</p>

DESIGNED BY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES,

FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

Designed by a quadriplegic, the head-motion activated mobile device brings the cellphone revolution to a population that has until now been excluded - people with Spinal Chord Injuries, ALS, Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, and other disabilities that impair the use of the hands and arms.
A Sesame Phone can do all the things a regular smartphone can do, entirely hands-free, providing independence through limitless connectivity.
As seen on:
                           



             
                 

                         



THE STORY OF SESAME 
Sesame Enable was founded by Giora Livne, a quadriplegic for the past nine years, and Oded Ben Dov, an app developer and computer vision expert.Giora, an electrical power engineer with a maker sensibility, is always coming up with solutions to improve his life. One day, Giora spotted Oded on a television program, where Oded was showcasing a mobile video game he had created that was controlled via head gestures. A lightbulb went off.Giora saw the potential beyond gaming. With a bit of chutzpah, he was able to track down Oded by calling the TV station, and challenged him to use his knowledge of gesture recognition to create a touch-free phone.Together they founded Sesame and built the Sesame software technology.Sesame is committed to setting a new standard in assistive technologies. Our team is driven by a deep belief in equality and universal accessibility, and in developing meaningful devices and ideas.            Sesame participated in A3i - the world’s first accelerator for startups that benefit people with disabilities  - made possible through the partnership of PresenTense, Beit Issie Shapiro and the Ruderman Family Foundation.      Sesame later joined Raanana's hub for entrepreneurs - Hubanana - and is actively supported by it's community



WHAT IS SESAME? 
Sesame is the first completely touch-free smartphone technology that is controlled entirely through head movements and voice control, without any additional custom hardware requirements.
When you receive your Sesame-powered phone, you'll receive a Google Nexus 5 phone preloaded with our software layer and able to work out-of-the-box, touch-free.


We leveraged advancements in computer vision, user experience, and voice recognition to build a completely accessible, hands-free mobile solution.
Currently, Sesame provides touch-free accessibility for Google’s existing Nexus 5 smartphone. We chose to support this device exclusively in the beginning due to its specific hardware specifications, and plan to support other Android devices in the future which meet Sesame’s unique requirements.

THE GREATER POTENTIAL

The Sesame Phone provides those with limited use of their hands independence and privacy in using a smartphone.
But moreover, with existing Smart Home and Internet-of-Things technology, the Sesame Phone provides access to tens of physical devices through the same Touch-Free interface.

Thermostats, lights, TV's, A/C, locks, shades and so much can now be controlled again by people with limited movement. 




OPEN, SESAME




Since Sesame runs on a standard Android OS, you get access to the millions of apps on Google Play - all completely touch-free! No special setup is required to operate a new app. This means you can tweet, post, share, send instant message, read, play, and be in on the conversation around the latest app.



SO EASY, EVEN A CHILD CAN USE IT

Our goal from the beginning has been to design a phone that can work for the widest range possible of users, regardless of their physical abilities or age. Some of our most dedicated users are kids!
 


You can customize your Sesame Phone so that even people who can only move their heads slightly can benefit from the phone.





WHAT YOU GET

When you receive your Sesame-powered Android Nexus 5 smartphone, here’s what comes with it:

Google Nexus 5 smartphone
USB charging cables
Stereo earbuds
Sesame software pre-installed and ready to use touch-free

The Sesame takes great care in ensuring that your Sesame experience goes off without a hitch! All Sesame-powered Google Nexus 5 smartphones we ship will be preconfigured for simplicity. 






TECHNOLOGY BEHIND SESAME

• Google Nexus 5: The Sesame user interface is built into a modified Nexus 5. This model of Android device was selected because it meets the specific functional requirements of the Sesame user interface, however in the future we will continue to add support for additional devices.
• Computer Vision: Through advanced computer vision algorithms, the Sesame Phone tracks your head movements with extreme precision, utilizing only the existing, front-facing camera.  
• Voice Commands: To enable a true touch-free experience, even when the phone is off, just say ""Open Sesame"" and it will turn on and start tracking head movements.
• Built on Android: We've built on the market-leader Android platform, and made it touch-free accessible system wide through integration with the operating system. You can fully navigate through the phone menu, open applications, write messages, play games, make calls and more!
• Works out of the box: When you get a Sesame Phone, you are getting a device that has already been pre-installed and specially customized to provide the best touch-free experience, right from the first launch.



WHERE WE ARE TODAY

For the past two years we’ve been working non-stop to get the Sesame Phone ready for production. We've experimented with different hardware solutions, tested out a variety of algorithms, and tried out all versions with a broad range of users.
After testing many devices in earlier versions, we are now launching with the Google Nexus 5, because of its superior performance and appropriate size. We are now ready to get the phone out into the world.
The demand is real. With 10 beta testers, and many others already requesting the device, the need for Sesame is already clear.






WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

We are currently in the final stretch of bringing this life-changing product to market.
We have a final working prototype, but are still putting the finishing touches on its software development and design.
Your funds will help us finalize the product and get the word out to everyone who can benefit from the device.
Furthermore, your support will help us demonstrate to large mobile operators and hardware manufacturers that there is a strong demand for supporting people with disabilities.

5th Perk: $10,000 Contributor receives a $20,000
discount on the purchase of a new Nightwind II Hybrid
Drone.   UAS, Inc. is developing this new version of its two meter wingspan electric
UAV. It will be powered by a new alcohol
fuel cell with backup batteries. The new hybrid powerplant will  allow the drone to stay aloft for up to 12
hours. The additional electricity from
the fuel cells will power an improved sensor suite on board the  aircraft.   Open to U.S. citizens only.    Nightwind II The ImpactThe
commercial drone has been in use around the World for more than eight years
(90% of Japan’s crop dusting is now done by drones).  However, by  2015
the commercial UAV will begin common use in the U.S.A.  The operational
efficiency, cost savings and increased safety are eagerly anticipated by the people in many
industries and public endeavors.In
the last five years the UAS, Inc. team members have developed very small form factor mapping cameras for
use in small (6 ft wingspan) drones.    We have engaged in the development of two
new powerplants for the same small
UAVs; including multi-fuel internal combustion with Ricardo Engineering and the new fuel cell technology with MTI.
According to an AUVSI [Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International] study, in the ten years following 2015, the UAV industry will generate $82
Billion in economic impact and 100,000 new jobs nationwide.  People and companies who get involved now
will have a tremendous advantage as the industry grows.  A careful company that makes public safety
and privacy a prime concern will have an advantage in the years to come.

 In 2011, The National

According to studies done by the National Highway Transportation Safety

Unfortunately, the statistics are not just

that he was texting and driving before the wreck. My life, along with many

<h2>FROG BOMBERS</h2>
<h3>The tiny, terrible trolls have taken control of the swamp! Help Freddy &amp; friends bomb the trolls &amp; collect the lilly pads.</h3>
<p>Frog Bombers is a fun, addictive mobile game with a message: Keep Moving Forward. The story begins when Freddy decides to take back the swamp from the tiny, terrible trolls. Every fly Freddy catches turns into a bomb. Different bombs have different powers, creating an exciting and ever-evolving gaming experience. By bombing the trolls and collecting the lilly pads, Freddy can build a lilly pad bridge to rescue Princess Penelope.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>I am a motivational speaker. My favorite motto is ""Keep Moving Forward."" I love to share it with all the groups I speak to, both students and adults. To better illustrate my motto, I came up with a variety of projects, none of which stuck, including a misguided (according to my wife) attempt to build a lifesize Sasquatch out of LEGOs. Ironically, deciding to develop a game app (with absolutely no prior experience) turned out to be the most authentic Keep Moving Forward project I could have chosen! </p>
<p>In July of 2010, I met an app programmer at a conference in Georgia. He offered to help me turn one of my books into an app. In true ADD fashion, I sat on that offer for about two years. Finally, last fall, I called him with some ideas. I then flew down to North Carolina for two days, bringing 12 different app ideas along for the trip. Poor guy! He didn't know what hit him!</p>
<p>After wading through all the ideas, and a number of brainstorming sessions, Freddy the Frog Bomber was born.</p>

<p>Over the course of the months that followed, I worked on developing the storyline and the visuals for Frog Bombers while the programmer diligently worked on the programming. </p>
<p>The game began to take shape: Levels. Special effects. Fancy bombs. Fun sounds. Finally, we got to a point where a few people could beta test the fruits of all our labors. The response was very positive, but the game is still far from where it needs to be to realize our vision.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">And that's where you come in!</span></p>
<h3>I need $15,000 in funding to finish developing the game and make it a truly awesome gaming experience. The funding will also allow me to create versions for iPad and Android, and to have a marketing budget.</h3>
<p>In return, I have some awesome PERKS - posters, t-shirts, e-books, and more! Even just $1 helps, and I will send you a personal email to say THANK YOU!</p>

Why are we doing this?

Because, like most of you out there, we're fed up with our cables being destroyed. Beaten by our bags, being trodden on, our pet's teeth, and by life.Let's face it, we just need something stronger.Oh yeah, did we mention it was tangle proof? Because of its tough braided exterior, its incredibly difficult to get this into accidental knots.World Powerlifting Champion wanted to put it's strength to the test...We put our IronWire to the ultimate test to see if it could compete with the strength of the current Powerlifting World Champion, Dave Watts! Has the IronWire met its match? Let the battle commence....We thought we'd try our luck in a tug-of-war....
We are proud to bring you Echo’s $10 IronWire - the strongest and most efficient cable on the market, with the best price and a fantastic warranty to match. The cable comes extra long, tangle-free and like all our products is MFi certified and fully compatible with all Apple devices that use a Lightning connector. We have even added some fancy LED lights that flash when your device is fully charged.

Echo’s IronWire is available exclusively on Indiegogo, and our campaign will only run for 60 days. Get yours now while they’re available at this exclusive price.

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Purpose of Campaign?</span></h1>
<div>
<b>This campaign is to raise money for <u>prototyping</u> a real physical Microverter™.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> RXN™ Electric Private Limited is a startup company registered in India and Microverter™ shall be the first product. Microverter™ is still in the prototyping stage. Wait! Don't leave right away.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Concept or Reality?</span></h1>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Microverter™  is not simply an idea or a concept. It is a sophisticated combination of electrical, mechanical and thermal model built and simulated successfully on computer. </span></div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So what? What's the big deal with simulations?</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">In today's world of product designing, simulations are everything! The way in which  new products are designed has come a long way from partial hit and trial method to complete computer aided design. It is highly unlikely that after manufacturing  the characteristics of the real physical system will differ  from that of the simulation. <b>A successfully simulated computer model is just a second away from the finish line!</b>

<p></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Is the Work Real?</span></h1>
<div>Yes it is! Now that you appreciate the value of computer simulations, ascertaining the existence of such work is but obvious. However, there is no simple way to disclose the simulation results while still retaining all the confidential data. Also it is not easy to explain the results to non-technical people.  So we have instead provided several  snap shots that would depict the intensity of work that has been done. Please keep in mind that the flashy-rainbow-coloured photos that you will see below  are a result of massive investment of time and not simply paper and paint combined with a wild imagination!<p></p>

This campaign is to raise money for prototyping a real physical Microverter™. RXN™ Electric Private Limited is a startup company registered in India and Microverter™ shall be the first product. Microverter™ is still in the prototyping stage. Wait! Don't leave right away.


Concept or Reality?
Microverter™  is not simply an idea or a concept. It is a sophisticated combination of electrical, mechanical and thermal model built and simulated successfully on computer. 
So what? What's the big deal with simulations?
In today's world of product designing, simulations are everything! The way in which  new products are designed has come a long way from partial hit and trial method to complete computer aided design. It is highly unlikely that after manufacturing  the characteristics of the real physical system will differ  from that of the simulation. A successfully simulated computer model is just a second away from the finish line!




Is the Work Real?
Yes it is! Now that you appreciate the value of computer simulations, ascertaining the existence of such work is but obvious. However, there is no simple way to disclose the simulation results while still retaining all the confidential data. Also it is not easy to explain the results to non-technical people.  So we have instead provided several  snap shots that would depict the intensity of work that has been done. Please keep in mind that the flashy-rainbow-coloured photos that you will see below  are a result of massive investment of time and not simply paper and paint combined with a wild imagination!



Microverter™  Thermal System
The figure below shows a simplified exploded view of Microverter's thermal system. Two phase thermal conductor with low pressure liquid coolant results in an extremely low profile, compact and efficient design.






Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analysis
CFD helps analyse and optimize the path of air flow and the temperature rise of the system under consideration. The figures below depict the fluid path and the temperature rise of the cooling system inside Microverter. These are only a few of over a hundred simulations performed!





PCB Layout Showing the Internal Layers
PCB layout is the second last step (assembly being the last) in the manufacturing process of electronics circuit.



3D View of Populated PCB



Top Layer of PCB Showing Thermal Vias

Unlike most PCBs where electrical performance is of primary concern, Microverter's PCB is optimized for both thermal and electrical performance. Trade off between the two is best decided by experience!





 Timeline
Microverter™, as you may see below, has been a long marathon race and not a 100 meter sprint!



What Next?

We are working nights out to get Microverter™  to the market as soon as possible. If priced correctly, Microverter™ clearly has the DNA of disruptive innovation. The following is an approximate figure of post campaign activities



September 2015  PCB manufacturing, component procurement, purchase of  testing instruments and lab setup. 

November 2015   Complete and optimize the electronic model for mass production.

December 2015   Complete and optimize the thermal system for mass production.

January 2016       Manufacture fully functional designs. Launch of INDIEGOGO campaign for marketing of Microverter™.

February 2016     Contact distributors and open  service centers.

March 2016          Mass production of Microverter™.

April 2016            Regular Shipping and distribution begins.  



I must remind that this is a prototyping campaign. The price are therefore roughly 3x lower than retail.

Tentative Price 
Conventional inverters are priced anything between 150$ to 300$. Microverter will be priced at par with the existing market to give a tough competition.



Microverter™ Lite       175$ to 200$ (Retail)

Microverter™              220$ to 250$ (Retail)
Microverter™ Lite will be a reduced functionality version of Microverter. It will not feature Over Drive Mode, Water Level Detection and Anti Sulfation. It will have a simplified LED display.





Fund Utilization
Apart from a  small portion of money (14%) which will be kept aside as  margin capital, rest of the fund will be used entirely for purchasing materials required for prototyping. Prices are quoted for up to three times redesign/modification and testing.







About Us
MRINAL MANI  has a Bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronics from Delhi College of Engineering. He has a vast  experience in power-electronics and control systems and has already completed two major projects on compact inverter design as a part of his course work. He is the oldest member in the team. 



NAG MANI  has a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication form Delhi College of Engineering. He has hands on experience in embedded system and digital electronics.



SHIVAM DAWER  has an integrated Masters degree in Mathematics and Computing form the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. He has been the manager and vice president of team events of AIESEC - Delhi.


Help Us!
We have worked to our best of capability and have put in the time and effort that a true startup deserves. One of the team members has even refused campus placement offer and has been working throughout to make Microverter come alive. Over here, declining a placement offer after having graduated  is nothing short of madness! Fortunately or unfortunately it appears that we are mad!

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Can I use more than one temperature sensor?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use upto 30 sensors with one gateway. These will all show on your smartphone.</p>
<h3>Does it work with iPhone, iPad, Android phone/tablet?</h3>
<p>Yes, our apps work on both IOS 3 or higher and Android 2.1 or higher. They work both on tablets and phones.</p>
<h3>Does it show Fahrenheit, Celcius, Kelvin?</h3>
<p>The app allows you to set the desired quantity, so you can easily adapt to what you like.</p>
<h3>How does my smartphone connect to the temperature sensor?</h3>
<p>The temperature sensor talks wirelessly to the provided internet gateway. The gateway is connected with an Ethernet cable to your DSL or Cable modem. Your smartphone gets the measured temperatures from our server.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">How far can the temperature sensor be removed from the gateway?</span></h3>
<p>We use a so called low-power ISM transceiver, which allows the signal to travel for about 150 feet (50m) depending on environment (walls, floors etc). Since we use a low frequency and low data-rate compared to wifi, the signal goes very well through walls and floors.</p>
<h3>What is the battery life of the temperature sensor and what type of battery is used?</h3>
<p>We use a standard CR2032 cell, which you can buy at any supermarket. Battery life is about a year and the battery can easily be replaced with a new one.</p>
<h3>Is the temperature sensor water-proof?</h3>
<p>Yes, but it is not qualified IP67 or something like that. We advice to put the sensor no deeper than 1 foot (30 cm).</p>

been very interested in the idea of <a href=""http://www.google.com/glass/start/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Glass</a> since it’s inception and have
recently been selected to participate in the Google Glass Explorer (beta)
program.  This program represents a major

My name
is Aaron Barrett.  I am a husband,
father, and Airman in the US Air Force. I was raised in the Navy and all along
the east coast and I am proud to call North Carolina my home.  I am 9 credit hours from my Baccalaureate of

Maintenance Technology.  I am also a
Remotely Piloted Aircraft Maintenance Craftsman Stationed in Grand Forks North
Dakota.
The Project
I have
been very interested in the idea of Google Glass since it’s inception and have
recently been selected to participate in the Google Glass Explorer (beta)
program.  This program represents a major
change in how we see the world both literally and figuratively, and increases
our ability to chronicle the story of our lives in a familiar and meaningful
way.  I believe that Google Glass can
directly lead to change for the better in our world today by showing what
humanity sees compared to what I usually see as a person.

provider in four different categories: Customer Support, Pricing, Hosting &amp;
Server Options, and Security &amp; Privacy</p>
<p>We found there were a total of ZERO people that felt
satisfied or better in all four categories. Only 3% of the participants were
satisfied or better with at least three of the categories.</p>
<p><u>What is going on here?</u></p>
<p>Have we just accepted these sub-standard options that
hosting companies are offering us?</p>
<p><u>In short, <b>YES</b>.</u></p>
<p>Hosting plans do not cater to the client at the level they
are able to and this is a problem that we unfortunately have come to accept
among hosting providers.</p>
<p>The reason we all have such low expectations for our hosting
providers is because they are all the same. The web hosting industry quickly
became a rinse-and-repeat business. The remote access that servers provide
allow hosting companies to simply copy the same old format that everyone has
been offering for year. This results in standardized options and prices, poor
customer service and basic privacy and security.</p>
<p><u>We at CenTex decided to put an end to this.</u></p>
<p><b>How Centex Began</b></p>
<p>We launched CenTex Hosting less than a year ago in Round Rock,
Texas. We created CenTex Hosting with the idea that the customer will always come
first, no matter where our business takes us. We launched CenTex as an
experiment to see if placing the customer ahead of everything would actually
work.</p>
<p>We knew that we could have taken the “easy” route and simply
follow the same blueprint that virtually all other hosting companies do:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Set up the basic servers</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Offer basic package</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Price them as industry average rates</p>
<p>We would have been successful doing that, just like so many
other have but that is not what we set out to do. We set out to make an
improvement in people’s hosting plans; and we weren’t going to be able to do
that if we aimed for the industry standard like everyone else.</p>
<p>CenTex is the type of company that would much rather fail at
trying something different than succeed at being middle-of-the-road average.
Doing that is the only way that we can offer you better options with your
hosting providers.</p>
<p><b>Enter Self-Hosting</b></p>
<p>Self Hosting plans have been offered from some hosting
companies but they weren’t investing into them as much as they needed to. It is
a great option that was being ignored because it didn’t fit the “standard” model
that so many companies are using.</p>
<p>We wanted to end that. We wanted to expand on this idea and
take it beyond the attempts we have seen before. </p>
<p><b>Our Result?</b></p>
<p>It took off like a rocket and was a tremendous success. It
was clear within the first month that we have hit on a gold mine. We saw demand
for our servers shoot up through the roof.</p>
<p><b>Which Brings us to
Now</b></p>
<p>The huge spike in demand was great for our company, but now
we are unable to keep up with it anymore. That’s why we are here, looking for
investors that will allow us to expand and offer are services to meet the high
demand.</p>
<p>We don’t have the space to keep up with the demand. As much
as we would love to give our self-hosting package to everyone, we simply do not
have the server capacity to do that.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>This is why we are
asking for your help!</b></p>
<p>With a simple donation, we will be able to begin the
creation of our second hosting location. This will allow us to double our
customer base, quickly grow to accommodate our new improvements, and continue
on the path of becoming the leading hosting company in the area and allow us to
extend our reach to even more people that are in need of a better hosting
solution.</p>
<p><b>What is the money
breakdown?</b></p>
<p>Here is what the funds will go toward:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>$7,200 will go towards setting up a new data

<p><span>·<span>

</span></span>$3,000 will be spent on IP ranges</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>$6,000 x 2 will be used to finance two New Dell
Servers</p>
<p>Notice there is nothing in the budget for advertising?
That’s because we don’t need it. The demand for our servers is already higher
than we can handle. We want to accommodate everyone as quickly as possible, but
we want to allow our donors the first chance at it.</p>
<p>That’s why we have put together four packages for our donors
that will allow you to claim first priority when our servers are up and running.</p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>Proven Model</b></p>
<p>There is no risk involved here. We are simply going to
replicate the already-successful model that has allowed us to take CenTex to
the level it is at today. It’s simply a matter of scaling up something that we
already know is in demand and proven to work.</p>
<p><b>Further Expansion</b></p>
<p>Although this campaign will be used to help start the 2<sup>nd</sup>
branch of CenTex Hosting in Austin, TX, which we will then convert into our
main data center, we won’t stop there. We want to continue expanding for as
long as the demand is there. Our projections show that we should expect to see
an increase in demand after we launch our 10<sup>th</sup> server and beyond.</p>
<p>This means more job creation, we will be able to keep up
with the growing demand, and most importantly, we will always be focused on
improving our services for our existing customers. This will allow us to
continue to offer you an improved experience with us and allow us to continue
our expansion as we grow.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Nicholas Merrill and I am starting a new non-profit organization called <a href=""https://www.calyxinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Calyx Institute</a>.  I have a bit of a track record of fighting for the right to privacy on the Internet, and I have a plan to radically transform the way the Telecommunications industry works.</p>
<p>The Calyx Institute is named after my former Internet Service Provider (Calyx Internet Access) which I started in NYC in 1994, and which became the plaintiff in the original <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/national-security/doe-v-holder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"">challenge against the constitutionality of National Security Letters</a> in the USA Patriot Act beginning in 2004, known as Doe v. Ashcroft, Doe v. Mukasey, Doe v. Gonzales and finally Doe v. Holder.</p>
<p>It all started when I received a National Security Letter from the FBI demanding a long list of information about one of my ISPs clients. With the ACLU’s help, I fought the FBI and DOJ in federal court for six years, under gag order. I was forbidden, under threat of imprisonment, from telling anyone that I had received the letter or that I was the plaintiff in the case.    It was only in 2010 that I was finally able to identify myself.  In 2007, despite the gag order I wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post called ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"">My National Security Letter Gag Order</a>"".  Later, after I was un-gagged, I wrote <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-the-patriot-act-stripped-me-of-my-free-speech-rights/2011/10/20/gIQAXB53GM_story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"">a follow-up op-ed</a> also in the Washington Post talking about my experience.</p>
<p>Soon after, I began to do media appearances and interviews. My first television appearance talking about the case was <a href=""http://www.democracynow.org/2010/8/11/gagged_for_6_years_nick_merrill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"">on Democracy Now.</a></p>
<p>During the years I was under the gag order, I realized there was a need for an organization to reform the telecommunications industry’s approach to user privacy and freedom of expression. This project aims to turn that realization into reality.</p>
<p>During those years I developed a strong relationship with organizations like the ACLU and EFF, and I realized that they want to do a lot more to protect our rights online. But without an ally in the telecom world, their hands are tied. Calyx will be the ally public interest organizations need in the telecom world to help them fight for users’ constitutional rights.</p>
<p>This project’s goal is to raise funds for my nonprofit organization, Calyx Institute, which will launch a privacy-focused Internet Service Provider and mobile phone service using end-to-end encryption technology.  The software is already under development by another nonprofit foundation called LEAP who has given Calyx the green light to be the first commercial provider. The money we raise will go towards setting up a datacenter and implementing the first mass market deployment of this new Internet communications platform, and in a second stage, a mobile phone platform.</p>
<p>Through other partnerships, we are poised to offer Internet service in 70 markets in the US using wireless spectrum which we will bundle with end-to-end encrypted <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"">Virtual Private Network</a> (VPN) technology in order to keep the customer's data as private as possible. The next products on the roadmap include hosted email and cloud storage/sync systems that utilize public key cryptography so that only the user possesses the key required to decrypt their email or files. This means that the provider (Calyx) will not be able to read your email or files even if it wanted to.  And if Calyx can’t read it, it can’t be targeted by unconstitutional surveillance tactics.</p>
<p>The goal the organization has set for itself is to use every legal and technical means available to protect the privacy of customer data. As I said in the <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57412225-281/this-internet-provider-pledges-to-put-your-privacy-first-always/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57412225-281/this-internet-provider-pledges-to-put-your-privacy-first-always/"">recent article about my project on CNET</a>, ""It's a really urgent problem that is crying out for a solution.” Please help us by becoming a part of that solution.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Calyx Institute needs to raise at least $1-million for a bare-bones launch; $2-million would get things up and running quicker.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards building a small datacenter here in NYC where Calyx is headquartered, and to setting up the associated infrastructure of Internet connections, peering, back-end software infrastructure and some basic salaries for a skeleton staff.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, we will use what we do raise to do as much as we can with whatever we can raise.  I have a lot of experience running a business on a shoe-string budget, as I started my original ISP with only $10,000 of initial funds.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable because it creates a much needed alternative to existing commercial telcos; the ones we all know and most people are unsatisfied with.</p>
<p>In addition, it will develop open-source technology and policies that any ISP or mobile provider can use, which will create a public benefit.</p>
<p>I think this is the sort of transformative and disruptive project that could reverberate nationally and beyond.</p>
<p>This is your opportunity to radically change the landscape of telecommunications in America today, and hopefully in the world tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position to contribute financially, I understand.  Things are tough out there these days.  </p>
<p>What you can do if you want to support this effort is to get the word out and make some noise about this fundraising campaign!</p>
<p>Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word, use Twitter, use Facebook and other social media, or just tell people who you know that would be interested.</p>

</div></div>","Please allow me to  introduce myself
I'm Mark Huijs from the Netherlands. My dream is to get everybody a Grippee. For half a year now, I've been working with friends and even my mom, to get you a Grippee. We’ve been busy creating different models, checking production possibilities, getting the patent, making the website, etc.
This campaign is very important to us, because it gives us the chance to make the perfect start. For us: strength is in numbers: to make Grippee affordable to everyone.. and that's what we want!!
So please support me, my friends (and my mom) and get yourself a Grippee!
 
What We Need & What You Get
No matter how small, We can use every contribution! As we already ordered the first production batch of Grippee's, You will always get your return on investment. But more important: the more investors we get, the cheaper production will be. Which means:   the more we can give back to you!
Our promise to you is to give you at least what’s in the perk, and hopefully more!!
The world needs Grippee!

Use your phone as supposed to... with one hand
No more need for those ugly bumpers
No more falling phones
Change your style as you go
Start using your phone with one hand!!

<p>We're Loren and Tina Spendlove. We lived and worked in Mozambique and Angola for nearly 5 years and gained a great love and appreciation for Africa and its wonderful people. We have a great deal of experience bringing products to market in the United States through traditional means. This is our first crowd-funding project, and we're launching it because we don't just want to bring another product to market. We want Zuva to make a difference in the lives of people like those we met in Mozambique, and feel that it has the potential to do so. We have 5 adult children, and 8 grandchildren!</p>

Well now you can...

Our idea is an exciting new mobile app that uses clever image recognition technology. It allows potential customers or clients to find your brand and connect with you by simply taking a photo of your logo on a smartphone.
Why Cliqit…
You spend so much money on branding and have your logo on all your products and marketing material so why not let it work harder for you?
After a user has taken a photo of your logo it will take them directly to your personalised profile page on Cliqit. Giving them direct access to all your social media and a link to your website.
The user now has a quick and easy way of finding you, even if they are really bad at remembering names or just don’t want the hassle of manually searching on social media.
Our app benefits everyone from large global organisations to small indie bands who want potential customers or followers to be able to connect with them.
As a brand you will also be able to advertise your latest offers, promos or anything else you want your followers to see all. You could also use the app to give discounts or maybe use a logo for a teaser campaign to generate a buzz on your next up and coming product or offer...the possibilities are endless!
We are also looking to offer you first hand valuable data that tells you how many people are searching your logo. This will tell you if your recent marketing campaign has worked or where you need to concentrate more of your efforts to get a bigger following. Analytics that can save you throwing money at campaigns that are not working!! #winning

<h3>""What is PaddockScene and why should I care?""</h3>
<p>It is estimated that nearly 1 in 10 people consider themselves automotive enthusiasts. With that kind of audience, it makes sense that there are thousands of events for every kind of gearhead.</p>
<p>Finding automotive events should be easy. Think online shopping-easy. Like shopping, there are loads of event options of various styles and costs, right? You can go to a car show, an auction, a track day, a race... you just have to find them. How hard can it be? As it turns out, it is far more difficult than it should be! So, I've set out to fix this. </p>
<p>PaddockScene (<a href=""http://www.PaddockScene.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.PaddockScene.com</a>) is an online event center for automotive addicts that puts the races and shows you want to find all in one place. It's like a TV Guide and social platform for real car and motorcycle events. Search for and discover everything from national pro races to local shows in your neighborhood.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""Get on with it already...""</h3>
<p>During the 2012 calendar year, I worked on a simple, yet arduous, personal project using Excel and Google Calendar to remind myself when automotive events I liked were coming up. I wanted to simplify the automotive landscape by taking the dozens of schedules online, and thousands of scattered events, and drop them into one complete place - sorted by special criteria and location. </p>
<p>Early on, it occured to me that these spreadsheets and reminders could actually be useful to everyone else, by sharing the calendar and opening it up for contributions from people like you. To do that effectively, I decided to build a website called PaddockScene.com.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""And this is different how??""</h3>
<p>Unlike a few other sites that just list the dates of a select few races, PaddockScene is completely independent, and can highlight events for <em>all</em> car and bike enthusiasts. The site will include every level of competition, including non-competitive local gatherings. You will find pro races like Rolex Series racing or MotoGP. Even if an event happens outside the US, you can find when it will air on TV. You will also find amateur-level racing, like track days, club racing, or autocrosses. And of course, the festival events and shows, like your local ""Cars &amp; Coffee"" gatherings and auto shows. </p>
<p>PaddockScene spans car culture. The design of the site lets you choose your own interests to find out what is happening nationally OR locally to you. I understand that every enthusiast is interested in different things; that is why the site is a custom design using a proven content management system that lets you decide what you are looking for. It does this by filtering and sorting categories and event types. </p>
<p>While the website will be free for all users, building one is not. PaddockScene is getting some very expensive custom features that enhance your user experience. If you donate, you will help keep the development team true to the launch timeline. PaddockScene is tracked to go live in June of this year! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""I am skeptical... can you really pull this off?""</h3>
<p>Yes. This is a simple idea! Maybe it has crossed your mind as you skimmed a bunch of websites for local tracks and car clubs, and thought ""there has to be a better way!"" You were right. Other industries, like music, have already capitalized on the idea of making upcoming concerts more visible and accessible, based on bands and venues you like. It's brilliant, and now I know when my favorite bands are playing near me. </p>
<p>For example, say you like rally racing: right now, you would have to go to a<em> minimum </em>of 5 different websites to see what's happening in the world of rally. Try SPEED for WRC TV highlights, Rally America for pro events, SCCA and NASA for club events, and Global RallyCross for closed course. That doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all the owners clubs that organize TSD (time-speed-distance) rallies, hillclimbs, and international off-road competitions like Dakar and Baja.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can head over to PaddockScene, sort by ""Rally"" as a filter or search term, and find everything going on in your specific region, or even nationally.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""You can't know when ALL these events are happening, can you?""</h3>
<p>Okay, the truth is, I don't know everything. But, I do promise to launch the site with at least 50 professional racing series that you can attend in the U.S. or watch on TV. Even after dedicating too many lost nights to fancy spreadsheets, organizing and categorizing dates and types of events (some of which I had never even heard of), I know there is much more to do. </p>
<p>Here is another promise: YOU, the user, will be able to help. If you find an event that you plan to attend that is not on the website, add it yourself. You will be empowered to upload events that have yet to be created on the site. It makes sense to do this, too, because once an event is live you can share it with your friends and other users and actually help grow that event. It's a win-win for the event organizers and the attendees. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""Do you have any experience managing projects?""</h3>
<p>Why yes, I do! In fact, I know more than a a thing or two about project management and marketing. I spent over three years working at a Fortune 50 automaker. With only a small team, we created and managed over 200 events per year in line with strategy and budget. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""You say this is a simple idea. How far along is it?""</h3>
<p>The idea is simple, but the execution is not. There are many stages of development, many of which are very complex. The good news is that most of them are already completed:</p>

<h3>""I'm a grump and don't like new things. What say you?""</h3>
<p>There are a lot of ""old boys clubs"" out there today - especially local clubs - that like the way things operate but also bemoan the fact that there is a lack of fresh blood coming in to sustain their group. Ten year old websites that can't be found just don't cut it anymore. In an age where community engagement is instant, it is time to play by new rules to make organizations and events more accessible to a new generation of car enthusiasts.

<p>There are five separate revenue channels that I have identified as viable, cost-effective options.

<p>I am opening communication channels to work closely with race directors, marketing managers (series and venues), and club coordinators to make sure the best events are always successfully promoted. I have a history of doing this well in a previous career.</p>

<p>My goal is to be as transparent as possible throughout the campaign.

<p>What I am NOT trying to do is ask you to pay for my pipedream. Campaigns fail because of a lack of value to the investor (""buy me a Lamborghini;"" ""pay for my vacation;"" etc). I see tremendous value in the PaddockScene platform and I sincerely hope I've conveyed a genuine benefit so that future users are comfortable supporting it.

<p>If you are a little hesitant to give anything, ask me questions. I love skeptics. They keep me challenged and on my toes. If you can't tell, I am one myself. I will post all the questions I get and update the campaign frequently.</p>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
</div></div>","""What is PaddockScene and why should I care?""
It is estimated that nearly 1 in 10 people consider themselves automotive enthusiasts. With that kind of audience, it makes sense that there are thousands of events for every kind of gearhead.
Finding automotive events should be easy. Think online shopping-easy. Like shopping, there are loads of event options of various styles and costs, right? You can go to a car show, an auction, a track day, a race... you just have to find them. How hard can it be? As it turns out, it is far more difficult than it should be! So, I've set out to fix this. 
PaddockScene (www.PaddockScene.com) is an online event center for automotive addicts that puts the races and shows you want to find all in one place. It's like a TV Guide and social platform for real car and motorcycle events. Search for and discover everything from national pro races to local shows in your neighborhood.
 
""Get on with it already...""
During the 2012 calendar year, I worked on a simple, yet arduous, personal project using Excel and Google Calendar to remind myself when automotive events I liked were coming up. I wanted to simplify the automotive landscape by taking the dozens of schedules online, and thousands of scattered events, and drop them into one complete place - sorted by special criteria and location. 
Early on, it occured to me that these spreadsheets and reminders could actually be useful to everyone else, by sharing the calendar and opening it up for contributions from people like you. To do that effectively, I decided to build a website called PaddockScene.com.
 
""And this is different how??""
Unlike a few other sites that just list the dates of a select few races, PaddockScene is completely independent, and can highlight events for all car and bike enthusiasts. The site will include every level of competition, including non-competitive local gatherings. You will find pro races like Rolex Series racing or MotoGP. Even if an event happens outside the US, you can find when it will air on TV. You will also find amateur-level racing, like track days, club racing, or autocrosses. And of course, the festival events and shows, like your local ""Cars & Coffee"" gatherings and auto shows. 
PaddockScene spans car culture. The design of the site lets you choose your own interests to find out what is happening nationally OR locally to you. I understand that every enthusiast is interested in different things; that is why the site is a custom design using a proven content management system that lets you decide what you are looking for. It does this by filtering and sorting categories and event types. 
While the website will be free for all users, building one is not. PaddockScene is getting some very expensive custom features that enhance your user experience. If you donate, you will help keep the development team true to the launch timeline. PaddockScene is tracked to go live in June of this year! 


 
""I am skeptical... can you really pull this off?""
Yes. This is a simple idea! Maybe it has crossed your mind as you skimmed a bunch of websites for local tracks and car clubs, and thought ""there has to be a better way!"" You were right. Other industries, like music, have already capitalized on the idea of making upcoming concerts more visible and accessible, based on bands and venues you like. It's brilliant, and now I know when my favorite bands are playing near me. 
For example, say you like rally racing: right now, you would have to go to a minimum of 5 different websites to see what's happening in the world of rally. Try SPEED for WRC TV highlights, Rally America for pro events, SCCA and NASA for club events, and Global RallyCross for closed course. That doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of all the owners clubs that organize TSD (time-speed-distance) rallies, hillclimbs, and international off-road competitions like Dakar and Baja.
Alternatively, you can head over to PaddockScene, sort by ""Rally"" as a filter or search term, and find everything going on in your specific region, or even nationally.
 
""You can't know when ALL these events are happening, can you?""
Okay, the truth is, I don't know everything.

</div></div>","WELCOME!
Thanks for visiting our campaign page, we are the juabar team and we're excited to share our story with you. We are a team of designers and researchers who came together as students at the California College of the Arts. Last summer Olivia, Eric and Anna (see us below) conducted research in Tanzania on how solar could provide clean energy options for 90% of the population who currently lack access to electricity.

 (Pictured: Anna Acquistapace, Rachel Gant, Sachi DeCou, Eric Persha, Olivia Nava)

From that research we conceived of ""juabar - Community Power Hub."" Juabar is a solar-powered mobile phone charging station. Mobile phones are the only form of telecommunications for many Tanzanians, and we believe mobile technology will lead the demand for clean energy solutions.Today, only 10% of the Tanzanian population has access to grid electricity, yet an astounding 60% of the population owns a mobile phone. This is amazing to us and where we feel we can meet a clear need.
Juabar starts as a mobile phone charging station but is designed to adapt and grow based on community needs, from mobile charging to a wifi hub to a micro-utility for off-grid communities.

An intial prototype of the juabar is sponsored by CCA's Center for Art and Public Life IMPACT Social Entrepreneurship award in collaboration with the Appropriate Rural Technology Institute outside of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (TZ). With your help we can expand our reach and bring juabar solar opportunities to additional communities, both in TZ and beyond.
We are seeking funds to expand the reach of juabar to additional communities and organziations while we are on the ground in TZ. The impact of juabar is far reaching, from offering off grid communities access to solar energy solutions, to closing the global digital divide by increasing access to communications resources and economic opportunities.

(Pictured: Olivia conducting research during juabar's 2011 trip to Dar es Salaam)
Your donations will fund additional solar components for each juabar and the development of training and financing mechanisms to facilitate long term impact. We are raising funds for the creation of four additional juabars. No matter what, your funds will be used toward the furtherance of juabar, whether they go to purchase a solar panel or the nuts and bolts to mount it, it's all important.
Your donations are much appreciated and your support goes a long way toward the creation of solar opportunities. We love you even if you can't afford to donate! Please spread the word about juabar.

<h3>Maintaining multiple resumes is difficult</h3>
<p>The best way to land an interview is to have a resume that focuses on your experience and skills that best fit the job description. Making a ""one size fits all"" resume isn't the optimal way to catch an employer's attention. Attaché makes this easy by storing all of your credentials in a master document. When it comes time to publish a resume, you get to pick the best information for the position.</p>
<p>Keeping your resumes up to date is easy because all of your published resumes on Attaché reference your account's master document. Meaning, you only need to make changes to your master document for all of your resumes to be up to date. No more keeping track of locally saved Word documents.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We already have a prototype up and running</h3>
<p><span>To see a proof of concept, we have a prototype up and running right now at </span><a href=""http://www.attacheinc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.attacheinc.com</a><span> (best viewed in Google Chrome). Sign up and start using our service. Every account is given one free resume to publish online, but you can print out as many as you like. Be sure to give us your feedback!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Change how your resume looks with a single click</h3>
<p><img alt=""the multiple styles of your attache resume"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/rZdlw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Attaché breaks down the development process by separating the the work of inputing new information and the work of designing your resume. Once you've picked the information that you want to publish, you can choose the design that best suits you. We have three designs at the moment, but with your donations we plan on commissioning more.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Save as a PDF, print, or publish to the web</h3>
<p><img alt=""attache's publish to web feature"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/RWXWi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Once you've picked your information and a style, you can choose to save your resume as a PDF, print it out, or publish it to the web. When you publish it online, we host your resume on a page that puts your information front and center. You won't find any ads here. We wanted to make a page that you would feel confident sending off to an employer or putting on your business card.</span></p>
<h3>We want to make sharing your resume as easy as handing off your business card </h3>
<h3><img alt=""mobile app"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/CK7wm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><span>We already have a mobile app in development, which will give you access to the published resumes you have on your Attaché account. That means when a moment of opportunity strikes, sending off your resume will be as easy pulling out your phone.</span></p>
<h3>Why we need your help, Indiegogo</h3>
<p>While we've been working on this project, we've received feedback on many ways to improve Attaché. We've also noticed that expanding our application will be expensive, as there are many costs we need to consider:</p>
<p><strong>Improved hosting</strong></p>
<p>We currently have our prototype and SQL database, but we want to handle heavier traffic load and constant up time, so we need to purchase superior (and far more expensive) hosting services.</p>
<p><strong>Hooking in with LinkedIn's API</strong></p>
<p>We want to remove any barrier to entry to begin using Attaché, and since LinkedIn is a web service many use to list their credentials, we want to make importing that info into a stylized resume as easy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Commissioning more premium styles &amp; </strong><strong>Attaché Designer</strong></p>
<p>We currently have three CSS styles right now, but we want to expand our library and offer more choices to style your resumes. We also want to offer those who are particularly creative the ability to design and customize their own style with the Attaché Designer. We'll need your donations to make it a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping Attaché free</strong></p>
<p>Probably the most important reason why we're holding this campaign is because we want Attaché to be available to everyone. With the current unemployment rate at 7.8%, it's obvious why we want Attaché to stay free. We want it to be more than a web service; we want it to be a tool that simplifies resume development and maintenance.</p>

</div></div>","Maintaining multiple resumes is difficult
The best way to land an interview is to have a resume that focuses on your experience and skills that best fit the job description. Making a ""one size fits all"" resume isn't the optimal way to catch an employer's attention. Attaché makes this easy by storing all of your credentials in a master document. When it comes time to publish a resume, you get to pick the best information for the position.
Keeping your resumes up to date is easy because all of your published resumes on Attaché reference your account's master document. Meaning, you only need to make changes to your master document for all of your resumes to be up to date. No more keeping track of locally saved Word documents.


We already have a prototype up and running
To see a proof of concept, we have a prototype up and running right now at www.attacheinc.com (best viewed in Google Chrome). Sign up and start using our service. Every account is given one free resume to publish online, but you can print out as many as you like. Be sure to give us your feedback!


Change how your resume looks with a single click

Attaché breaks down the development process by separating the the work of inputing new information and the work of designing your resume. Once you've picked the information that you want to publish, you can choose the design that best suits you. We have three designs at the moment, but with your donations we plan on commissioning more.


Save as a PDF, print, or publish to the web

Once you've picked your information and a style, you can choose to save your resume as a PDF, print it out, or publish it to the web. When you publish it online, we host your resume on a page that puts your information front and center. You won't find any ads here. We wanted to make a page that you would feel confident sending off to an employer or putting on your business card.
We want to make sharing your resume as easy as handing off your business card 

We already have a mobile app in development, which will give you access to the published resumes you have on your Attaché account. That means when a moment of opportunity strikes, sending off your resume will be as easy pulling out your phone.
Why we need your help, Indiegogo
While we've been working on this project, we've received feedback on many ways to improve Attaché. We've also noticed that expanding our application will be expensive, as there are many costs we need to consider:
Improved hosting
We currently have our prototype and SQL database, but we want to handle heavier traffic load and constant up time, so we need to purchase superior (and far more expensive) hosting services.
Hooking in with LinkedIn's API
We want to remove any barrier to entry to begin using Attaché, and since LinkedIn is a web service many use to list their credentials, we want to make importing that info into a stylized resume as easy as possible.
Commissioning more premium styles & Attaché Designer
We currently have three CSS styles right now, but we want to expand our library and offer more choices to style your resumes. We also want to offer those who are particularly creative the ability to design and customize their own style with the Attaché Designer. We'll need your donations to make it a reality.
Keeping Attaché free
Probably the most important reason why we're holding this campaign is because we want Attaché to be available to everyone. With the current unemployment rate at 7.8%, it's obvious why we want Attaché to stay free. We want it to be more than a web service; we want it to be a tool that simplifies resume development and maintenance.

into the main controller, which accordingly order actuators to take the
matching action.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/402315/files/20140301044521-Company_profile2.jpg?1393677921"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Vision:</span></h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The vision

About Touch Sticker Technology (TST):Touch sticker technology is a patented new human-object interface that is
capable of transforming all non-conductive surfaces with limited thickness
(wood, glass, etc.) into touch sensors or screens.Despite of its huge impact
on all peoples' lives, it is considered one of the simplest innovations amongnon-conductive all sensing and screening technologies. Only by sticking transparent stickers
placed on opposite side of operation interface, it invisibly turns non-conductive materials into touch surfaces that can interact with human contact. materials into touch surfaces that can interact with human contact.The idea mainly
relies on the effect of electrostatic energy inside the human body. When
physical contact occurs between human body and any insulating surface like
wood, plastic glass, marble or textile, these stickers sense the position and
movement of the human contact and thus transmit it though Wi-Fi environment
into the main controller, which accordingly order actuators to take the
matching action.Vision:The vision
of ViViFi is to turn your everyday interactions with technology as
simple as one touch, giving you an unforgettable touch experience.
Providing the
market with interactive surfaces by converting any device to touch
sensitive surface which will interact
with real-time touches in an innovative way better than the existing
touch systems available today.Mission:
In order to
create a unique touch experience for its customers, vivifi's touch sticker
technology which will be applied on, electrical switches, interactive
advertising, E-Learning tools, smart homes, interactive furniture, automobiles
sensors, and touch menus.Where we areWe are raising U$D 1,000,000 in order to build our production facility in Malaysia, and importing Machines from USA, and other machines we will have to construct specially for our unique technology.

Where The Money Will Go

The $1,000,000 we raise will roughly break down like this:

$474,700 - Production machinery and equipment (General machinery, Welding machinery, soldering machinery, Painting machinery, Lab equipment, CNC machinery, Design equipment).
$590,000 - Converting electrical circuits into microchips (Logic analyzer, 1Ghz Digital oscilloscope, Function generator, Spectrum analyzer, PCB line, Software, Design, Fabrication).

What we have for youCheck out our amazing gifts, signed switches, lessons, signed certificates by the inventor himself, and much more!

What investments have we secured?
“We have successfully closed a $70K round from outside investors, which we used to convert our idea to prototype and then to a product.""Why is ViViFi interesting for investors?

“International trends are heading towards controlling everything around us through touch technologies, and ViViFi’s touch sticker technology is a world innovation in this field. It’s the future of touch technology, this is how you’ll be able to convert any non-conductive surface with limited thickness into touch interactive surfaces! 

We are looking forward to penetrating the African, North American and European markets, through dealership with large technology manufacturers. We focus on the big market of mobile, touch screens and other technology manufacturers, who all potentially want to use touch sensors in their products. This includes automobile manufacturers, home appliances manufacturers, and others.
We hold local patents and are working on all relevant international patents. Having the inventor of the new Touch Sticker Technology in-house is also a success factor of ViViFi. We have all the keys of the game and invite interested investors to see our business plan for more info.”

It's the first modular music keyboard designed to turn your audio workstation into a traveling creative studio - just pack it up and go.And, whether you're a pro or beginner, learning, playing and creating music should be a fun, exciting and inspiring experience.

Our frustration.
When you're on the road, it's either impossible or inconvenient to bring along your entire kit and set up. Equipment is large, clunky and setup is a hassle - not to mention all of the cords to get your kit just the way you like it.
Other mini keyboards have tiny keys - awful for big hands - or rubber touchpads that just don't have the right feel, and durability issues.
And, for people who want to learn how to play music, lessons can be expensive, time consuming and intimidating. Online tutorials are often confusing, boring and not interactive at all.
That's why we created Keys.
Keys is the first music keyboard and MIDI controller that's completely modular, linking together through magnetic technology, called AMON. It's a musician and producer's dream, featuring:

Keys with full scale width for superior touch and control you can feel
Works with iOS, Android, and any program that supports USB-MIDI
8-hour battery life for continuous playing
Rich and vibrant LED lit keys to breathe life into your performances
Change sounds and octaves with a wave of your hand
Two apps for beginners to learn their favorite songs




We aren't the only ones who think Keys is amazing.
Stretch goal reached!We hit $125K thanks to all of our backers, and will include a designer felt travel bag with each Keys ordered during this campaign.Keys is modular.
You can expand to a full sized keyboard in seconds - without cords - by simply magnetically linking multiple Keys together, and easily breakdown to pack Keys away in your backpack. And, with 8 hours of battery life you can take Keys anywhere and get nearly a full day of playing.



Works with your favorite apps.
Keys is also fully USB-MIDI compliant and works with iOS and Android devices, along with hundreds of apps such as GarageBand, Ableton, and more, so you can plug in and get set up quickly and easily.



Size and portability matter.
Keys is built to be compact, travel friendly and durable. We use plastic reinforced with PCB and built Keys on top of a solid metal baseplate to add durability and rigidity. We also stripped out all of the unnecessary keyboard features that just take up space and go unused. And, at only one pound it's light enough to bring anywhere.

Full scale keys.
From the stunning illuminated keys to full scale key width, spacing and feel, every aspect of Keys was carefully considered by our creative and engineering team.

And, each key features velocity sensors to expand on the sounds you can make, creating a more rich user experience than touchpads.


You've never seen anything like this in a keyboard.
Keys is equipped with next-generation gesture recognition technology so you can adjust octaves and control tones just by waving your hand above the keyboard.


Keys' built-in LEDs support hundreds of thousands of rich, vibrant colors transforming your music making experience into something out of Tron.



What if I'm not a musician or DJ?
Not to worry! We created two awesome applications for iOS called Learn and Play to help anyone (yes that includes you!) learn theory, how to read sheet music and how to play their favorite songs.


Never sit through another boring tutorial.
Our groundbreaking Play app lets you immediately play hit songs ""Guitar Hero"" style like a pro regardless of skill level.
The ""Rock Band"" of keyboards.Select from a number of instrument sounds, three difficulty levels, and two play modes. Notes can either flow across the screen right to left ""Guitar Hero"" style, or fall vertically.  When a note appears it will light up a corresponding key on the keyboard for you to play.
Choose from classical songs to the hits
Play includes 20 great songs to start and access to buy hundreds more
See what songs your friends are playing within the app
Get your stats and see how well you played at the end of each song
Rock out in free play mode, or set a tempo in practice mode


 
Our Learn app lets you master playing music and learning theory at your own pace.

<p>We started with the 4 products that every outdoor enthusiast needs: Waterproof storage, solar power, battery power and a flashlight. Then we analyzed all the products on the market. We saw so many options for each individual item, but nothing that created an all-in-one solution. This was a major problem that we wanted to solve. Getting outdoors is about enjoying activities, family, friends and of course nature, so we wanted our solution to be something convenient that would enhance the experience for all outdoor enthusiasts. </p>
<p>Our vision was simple: A world where our need to be connected to a power source does not limit our passion to explore and enjoy the outdoors. So we created our company RokPak with one goal: to create innovative technology products for outdoor enthusiasts around the world.<br/><br/><b>BATTERY SYSTEM - Not all batteries are created equal.</b>We only use the highest quality batteries that are custom made for RokPak. They include a PCM (protection circuit module) built into the battery pack. This will prevent a Li-Ion battery pack from overcharging or over-discharging. Not many battery packs on the market integrate a separate PCM on the battery, but we do. It's important to us that we provide the highest quality and safest battery products on the market for our customers.</p>

We started with the 4 products that every outdoor enthusiast needs: Waterproof storage, solar power, battery power and a flashlight. Then we analyzed all the products on the market. We saw so many options for each individual item, but nothing that created an all-in-one solution. This was a major problem that we wanted to solve. Getting outdoors is about enjoying activities, family, friends and of course nature, so we wanted our solution to be something convenient that would enhance the experience for all outdoor enthusiasts. 
Our vision was simple: A world where our need to be connected to a power source does not limit our passion to explore and enjoy the outdoors. So we created our company RokPak with one goal: to create innovative technology products for outdoor enthusiasts around the world.BATTERY SYSTEM - Not all batteries are created equal.We only use the highest quality batteries that are custom made for RokPak. They include a PCM (protection circuit module) built into the battery pack. This will prevent a Li-Ion battery pack from overcharging or over-discharging. Not many battery packs on the market integrate a separate PCM on the battery, but we do. It's important to us that we provide the highest quality and safest battery products on the market for our customers.


























The RokPak Pioneer series is available in three colors, camouflage, safety orange, and marine blue. The colors represent a perfect combination to cover all outdoor people.















RokPak was formed by a passionate father son team with a combined 30 years experience in manufacturing and product design. From concept to final product we have taken our time to make sure we developed the perfect product. Along the way our team has grown including many outdoor enthusiasts who have tested the RokPak Pioneer Series to the extreme. From backcountry skiing in the middle of nowhere Canada to jumping off 30ft. cliffs while Canyoning, the RokPak held up to these extreme conditions. It was also put to the test fishing, hunting, kayaking, sailing, mountain biking, and many other activities.





Our logo represents the RokPak family. Each peak stands for one of the 5 family members who started the company. 


Our product will be delivered in September 2016.

Easy-Slyde .::.</b></p><p>The way the <b>ONEPOCKET</b> has been designed it was done in such a manner that the iPhone sits behind the magic wallet and that was one of the challenging parts of our project since there was no space to make a hole for the back camera lenses. Initially we thought about making a hole for the lenses within the magic wallet compartments as others do, however with the cards inside the space would have been covered either way. Therefore we needed to find another solution and, after several days brainstorming, we came up with the “easy-slide” idea. To use your camera in this case, you can simply slide you iPhone through the slick and purpose built design and, there it is, the lenses are free and you can take your picture with no troubles. The system works perfectly.</p><p>On the top of the <b>ONEPOCKET</b> there is a locking system which will allow it to hold your iPhone on a safe and secure manner though, to avoid it sliding out accidently. However, at the same time, it will also allow you to slide it out whenever necessary too.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/474249/files/20140331143640-easyslide_com_seta.png?1396301800"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>.::.

In January 2014 we sold a car to finance the construction of the injection mold. Now only US$ 3000 is missing, which will be used to cover the costs of packaging, production and assembly for the ONEPOCKET project become reality.If you like our idea and wish to put your hands on a genuine ONEPOCKET, please help us to spread the word by sharing this webpage within your social network. The higher the number of people interested in, the higher will be the chances of this product becoming a reality.Our pages and social networks:FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramYoutubeVimeoThe ONEPOCKET idea is to keep your iPhone protected and, by allowing you to keep the contents of your wallet together with it. The ONEPOCKET will also help to minimize the chances of leaving important belongings behind as everything you need will be in one place and will also fit in one single pocket!.::. Easy-Slyde .::.The way the ONEPOCKET has been designed it was done in such a manner that the iPhone sits behind the magic wallet and that was one of the challenging parts of our project since there was no space to make a hole for the back camera lenses. Initially we thought about making a hole for the lenses within the magic wallet compartments as others do, however with the cards inside the space would have been covered either way. Therefore we needed to find another solution and, after several days brainstorming, we came up with the “easy-slide” idea. To use your camera in this case, you can simply slide you iPhone through the slick and purpose built design and, there it is, the lenses are free and you can take your picture with no troubles. The system works perfectly.On the top of the ONEPOCKET there is a locking system which will allow it to hold your iPhone on a safe and secure manner though, to avoid it sliding out accidently. However, at the same time, it will also allow you to slide it out whenever necessary too..::. Extra Features .::.The ONEPOCKET also features two hooks allowing you to attach your keys, pen drives, arm straps or whatever else you need. The ONEPOCKET also counts with two lateral openings for easy access to the volume and silent key controls and also one on top for the power button. In addition to it you will be able to use earphones with it and charge your iPhone without the need to take it out.The ONEPOCKET will even work as a stand for your iPhone allowing you to watch your favorite movies or place those so anticipated Facetime and Skype video calls..::. Colors .::.The ONEPOCKET will be available in two colours: black piano and snow white.Differently from our prototypes, which have a matt finish, the final ONEPOCKET piece will be polished and clean..::. Why should you choose the ONEPOCKET? .::.We must say that the ONEPOCKET is not the only kind of iPhone case to try on the wallet idea. However, the so called “iWallets” out there are very limited and can hold at their best two or three cards and maybe a couple of notes. Therefore our product is unique and unprecedented in the sense that it is a more versatile, complete and well thought idea and more improved version of any case or iWallet that are now or have been available in the markets across the world.Marrying the ONEPOCKET idea with the magic wallet concept using of elastics to hold it together you can carry around up to ten or more cards and notes without any prejudice to its function of case or stand either.ONEPOCKET is up to 37% thinner than average leather wallets and the iPhone together.  .::. Material .::.Being against animal cruelty, we have chosen not to use leather and have made the ONEPOCKET with ABS plastic, which has allowed us to create a very detailed, smart and clever design. The ABS also provided us with the resistance and flexibility we needed to protect you iPhone from inevitable falls..::. Prototypes .::.During the period of creation and tests, we made several ONEPOCKET prototypes.We started with an initial version made from cupboard and adhesive tape. We followed it with a soft material and after a few days of tests we saw that, despite of the proven functionality of the idea, we really would need a premium material and for that reason we agreed on using plastic.From then onwards we started its design by using a 3D software and from the first to the final 3D print the initial product has found its way and the perfect design to meet our needs. There have been many, many tests for that!.::. Background .::.In the beginning of 2013, the three friends Danilo Lombardi, Rodrigo Vinciprova e Emmanuel Rodrigues came up with an idea, why not to combine the popular ""Magic Wallet"" with an iPhone case? And the ONEPOCKET project was born! After months of hard working, what was a simple concept became reality through a 100% functional prototype printed on a high resolution 3D printer. Six months ago we tried to fund ONEPOCKET on Kickstarter (another crowd funding site), but we have no success, so we stopped, rethink our campaign, though about all we did wrong and here we are, trying again, much more experienced and lots of steps ahead compared to where we were six months ago.Through Kickstarter campaign, Caio Masi knew the product and was passionate about the idea and the ONEPOCKET concept. Caio became a partner and knowing the high cost involved to build the injection mold, Caio sold his car and used the money to finance the machining of the mold.Now ONEPOCKET team has four members who, for the last 16 months, have spent a lot of time brainstorming about the product, have made several drafts, prototypes, tests and finally have agreed on a final product at a price that is definitely worth your money.Today the machining of the mold is already in progress and the delivery of the first ONEPOCKET's batch will happen on July 10th. We are very happy to get it this far with our idea and we count on your help supporting us in this last stage of our project. Thank you folks for your support!ONEPOCKET: more than a case, more than a wallet.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Paw-PC moves your entire desktop to the cloud, and allows you to access it wherever you have an internet connection, and on most devices - Finally, you can have what you need when you need it. That capability has some wonderful benefits right away. For example: You can start writing a memo on your home computer, revise it on your phone or tablet at your favorite coffee shop, and then send it from your office computer. This allows your busy schedule and technology to meet. You can save money on software and stop wasting time e-mailing things to yourself or checking to make sure your storage syncs. Paw PC is more than just storage and software.  Almost any computer that can access the internet can be used to run Paw PC and that means that the computer you have now could be the last one you ever need. As you move your processing capability, memory, and hard drive space into the cloud the computing power of the device in front you matters less. Plus, Paw PC comes with excellent customer support to keep it running smoothly. Your Paw PC will get better and better as it supports more and different types of programs and media, as well as the ability to easily share things with others - like documents, music, and movies.  Paw PC means less waste, less software and hardware purchases, and less frustration from inaccessible data and software.<br/><br/>Turning your desktop into a Paw PC means that you’ll feel at home in front of almost any computing device such as a desktop, mobile device, public computer, or work location. It means you won’t need to buy multiple versions of software just so you can access them on your home desktop, a personal laptop, or a work location.<br/><strong><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong> <br/>What we need is more hardware to be able to provide service for more users.

<p>We know that it can be a little worrisome to contribute to something that may not reach its funding goal so here are two things that should ease your concern. 1) We set our goal low because a lot of our requirements are based on how many people we're supporting. We really want to start providing this fantastic resource to more people. However, 2) even if we don't meet our goal we have the resources to start providing services to a handful of users and leverage any contributions to be able to support more. What it really comes down to is if you support us we've made sure we can support you.   <br/><strong><br/>The Impact</strong> <br/>Your data will be backed up and secure, your computer can run faster and you can get to your desktop anywhere.  All these benefits can impact your life in a big way, depending upon how you use them.  For example, as a student you won’t have to worry about losing that precious term paper and you won’t need to e-mail it to yourself to keep it safe. For the mobile worker, it can be wonderful to have all the tools from your desktop right there on your mobile device. Once you start using a computer that is always there we think you will find more benefits every day. Our goal with Paw PC is to create the tools we need to move more of our computing into the cloud. It will be a long term project and we are working constantly to add more features. In the long run it is possible it can be instrumental in driving down the cost of computers as we know them and at the same time increase our expectations of what computers can do for us.

We've come a long way! From an idea to a workable product.



I was excited at the thought of building something that would help solve an age old problem that we all can relate to, “Losing our things.” From a concept scribbled on a piece of envelope to a workable real world product,  we've come a long way!  But we're just getting started and we need your help to bring Verti Smart Tags to the masses...........


Keeping track of what's important to you!

Meet the CarMinder, small device that can help cares about the safety of children. CarMinder is an hands free Bluetooth speaker and alert system that designed to provide notification to check the car before you leave, that no kid or valuable has been left inside the vehicle. The system is designed to be easily installed in any vehicle, The device is installable in a cigarette lighter socket . The device also has charging ports for additional USB items, such as cellular phones.                                          
                
The user may sync their alert system via Bluetooth technology to their smartphone and use the free app provided to receive an additional alert from the smartphone. 

                   
      
The system has a wide selection of languages to choose from. When the user leaves the car or steps outside a certain radius of the vehicle and the car is turned off, a speaker will provide a vocal alarm. This alarm is designed to alert the user to check the inside of the vehicle to see if a child has been left behind. the alert volume is fixed and loud where the notification can be heard. When the car is turned off, the audio notification is sounded, but in addition, a reminder is sent to the smartphone if the user has downloaded the free application. This allows the user to receive notifications in several ways to ensure that a child is not left behind. If the user does not confirm that they have received the reminder, SMS message will be sent to a pre-programmed contact person  with GPS coordinates of the device (if Gps activated).

<p>A bidet toilet has functions

warm water to effect cleaning by forward flushing, rearward rinsing, and
drying. It is the best choice which is convenient and takes care of females in
menstrual cycle, females during pregnancy, people with constipation, people
with hemorrhoid, old people, children, and disables etc. Furthermore, it is
evident from clinical medicine that hemorrhoid may be reduced and defecation
may get smoother if anus is rinsed with warm water for 3 to 5 minutes after
defecation every day. Bidet toilet, which is designed of warm water rinsing, is
resulted in response to requirement of modern human beings in daily life.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4><b>Features of Intelligent Voice

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>My family and I are here on Indiegogo because we love music.  We 
listen to music as we cook in the kitchen, as we eat in the dining room,
 as we work in the office and the garage, even in our bedrooms.  We use 
internet radio services like Pandora and Spotify to keep our music 
fresh.  We needed a 
way to use a single computer, laptop, or MP3 player to play music 
throughout the house.  This would allow us to listen to internet radio as
 we move throughout the house without the need for a computer in every 
room.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Moxivo was born. Moxivo is a set 
audio cables that connect an audio source to stereo receivers using your
 existing phone land line.  It’s simple, effective, cheap, and easy to 
use.  Alternatives like built in speaker wiring and wireless transmission
 networks can cost thousands of dollars and can be complicated to use.</p>
<p>Please note that to use Moxivo, your home must be wired with a 
phone line that you are not using for a telephone, fax, internet, or anything 
else.  For the growing percentage of the population that uses cell phones 
instead of a land line, this won’t be problem.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

After completing a successful Kickstarter Campaign, we've had a lot of people asking where they can buy Moxivo. That's why we're here on Indiegogo giving everyone a second chance to take back their phone line!Please note that Moxivo cannot be used in conjunction with a land-line telephone, fax system, or phone-line internet like DSL.


Music in Every Room

Play music from a single audio source throughout your home. Listen to internet radio without moving the computer, or entertain a house full of guests with a single mp3 player.Remote ControlPlay music from a computer and control your music from anywhere using free mobile apps like ""Retune"" or ""Remote"".Keep What You HavePurchasing a wireless audio system is an expensive option, and the selection is narrow compared to wired speakers. With Moxivo, use the stereos and speakers you already have to create a multiroom audio system instead of buying a wireless set.Choose Your Cables
Cables A, B, and C are for analog systems used by most DVD players, MP3 players, headphones, and stereos and can be used in any combination. Order one cable for each stereo you have and one for your audio source.Cable D is for digital systems (i.e. Dolby Digital) over phone lines. Analog systems cannot be used in conjunction with digital systems.

<p>To make use of the graphics LCD, Erik Zalm's Marlin and 128k flash are recommendet. This means that the Sanguinololu/Melzi should be equipped with an ATmega1284P device.

Why Stealth Nighthawk F-117A
Stealth Nighthawk F-117A is an easy to use multi media center device, small and fancy design twice as big as a regular USB stick.
Because our device does not have internal storage, you are free to use your own micro SD-Card, where you can expand this upto 32GB.
You can share your media files from your network to the device through WiFi-N. So you don't have to pull a networking cable through your room.
On Stealth Nighthawk F-117A you can attach your hard drive or other expansions through a powered USB HUB. The device is plug and play for your television and once it is inserted in the HDMI slot of your TV, it will be invisible just like a real Stealth Nighthawk F-117.
With the device it is possible to automatic create a index of all your media files that are availble througout your networks and devices.
What’s in the box

<b>Short Summary</b><p></p>
<p>G-LINK
is a niche electronics company creating high end AV products for the four and
five star hotels. </p>
<p>We recently
introduced Obsess, the world’s first Wireless HDMI Media Console for
smartphones and tablets.  Obsess allows you to wirelessly play videos,
movies, games, music and more on any HDTV right from your phone or tablet.</p>
<p>We are
seeking to raise capital to bring Obsess to the consumer market.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>More About G-Link</b></p>
<p>G-LINK
is the AV hospitality division of Communications Integrators Inc (CII). 
CII has been in business for 25 years.  Originally specializing in
furniture power and communication, CII rapidly moved into the Hotel AV market
with the volcanic rise of personal electronics. </p>
<p>G-LINK’s
original products were connectivity panels that allowed guests to connect their
laptops, MP3 players, camcorders or portable game consoles to the in-room
HDTV.  G-LINK shifted focus to tablets and smartphones to keep pace with
travelers’ mobile lifestyles.</p>
<p>Our
expertise lies in our ability to create a very simple and hassle free user
experience.  At G-LINK we recognize the average hotel guest will probably
spend less than a minute trying to make in-room technology work before giving
up.  We focus on intuitive ways to make things happen.  This mindset
has led to a number of guest room innovations.  We introduced the
industry’s first auto sensing and auto switching HDMI media panel.  This
enables guests to put their content on the screen simply by plugging their
device into a G-LINK panel.  The G-LINK device detects the input and
automatically turns on the TV and switches the TV to the correct input.
 Your movies, your videos, your games are instantly presented in life
sized clarity on the in-room HDTV. </p>
<p>The
Obsess HDMI Media Console is equally intuitive.  Simply plug in your
device, choose your movie and press play.  Obsess does the rest.  The
HDTV will turn on and play your movie in big, beautiful HD
vibrancy. </p>
<p>G-LINK’s
easy to use mentality lends itself well to the consumer market.  The
Obsess Wireless HDMI Media Console can be set up in less than five
minutes.  It requires no networking knowledge or additional
equipment.  Simply plug it into the wall, connect the receiver to the TV
and you're ready to go.  It couldn’t get any easier.  </p>

<b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><b>The Campaign</b></p>
<p>G-LINK is seeking funding to help adapt
their Wireless HDMI Media Consoles to the consumer market.  The funds will
be used to develop packaging and marketing material to push the G-LINK brand
into consumer retail.</p>
<p>We hope to raise at least $250,000 in this campaign.  We will use the capital to create a consumer
specific product and package (with consumer centric messaging, new receiver and
updated inputs). We will also increase our sales, marketing and communications,
and build stock for initial sales and sell in.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What It Means To Us</b></p>
<p>A successful campaign will help us move and
market in a direction we never thought possible until now.  This funding
will create new products and new positions for the consumer market.  We
will require, Industrial Design, Graphic Design and Engineering here in the
US.  We will expand our sales force and enter into an incredibly exciting,
fast paced consumer retail market.</p>
<p>We believe that our hospitality niche is a
giant benefit.  In essence, each guest room is a little showroom for our
product.  Each guest who uses Obsess becomes a fan.  We know we
have an exciting product.  Thousands of guests can’t be wrong.  We
hope this product will become iconic.  We hope 20 years from now people
will look back and say, “I remember when that product took off!” </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What It Means To You</b></p>
<p>We hope
you can get as excited about this product as we are.  We hope you want to
be part of a major change in entertainment.  </p>
<p><b>About the Perks</b></p>
<p>In addition to the Obsess, we are offering some of our other products for those who would like to contribute in any way possible.</p>

HDTV will turn on and play your movie in big, beautiful HD
vibrancy. 
G-LINK’s
easy to use mentality lends itself well to the consumer market.  The
Obsess Wireless HDMI Media Console can be set up in less than five
minutes.  It requires no networking knowledge or additional
equipment.  Simply plug it into the wall, connect the receiver to the TV
and you're ready to go.  It couldn’t get any easier.  





The Campaign
G-LINK is seeking funding to help adapt
their Wireless HDMI Media Consoles to the consumer market.  The funds will
be used to develop packaging and marketing material to push the G-LINK brand
into consumer retail.
We hope to raise at least $250,000 in this campaign.  We will use the capital to create a consumer
specific product and package (with consumer centric messaging, new receiver and
updated inputs). We will also increase our sales, marketing and communications,
and build stock for initial sales and sell in.

What It Means To Us
A successful campaign will help us move and
market in a direction we never thought possible until now.  This funding
will create new products and new positions for the consumer market.  We
will require, Industrial Design, Graphic Design and Engineering here in the
US.  We will expand our sales force and enter into an incredibly exciting,
fast paced consumer retail market.
We believe that our hospitality niche is a
giant benefit.  In essence, each guest room is a little showroom for our
product.  Each guest who uses Obsess becomes a fan.  We know we
have an exciting product.  Thousands of guests can’t be wrong.  We
hope this product will become iconic.  We hope 20 years from now people
will look back and say, “I remember when that product took off!” 

What It Means To You
We hope
you can get as excited about this product as we are.  We hope you want to
be part of a major change in entertainment.  
About the Perks
In addition to the Obsess, we are offering some of our other products for those who would like to contribute in any way possible.
Essentials Executive Desk Power Hub: Provides 2 AC outlets and 2 USB charging ports in an elegant package specifically designed to be placed on the desk.

</p><h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>WataSensor is fundamentally changing the security market by
delivering a simple to use, low cost, and easy to install security appliance
based on a patented revolutionary sensing technology for the residential and
automotive markets. Unlike IP Camera based security devices that depend on
line-of-sight or unreliable motion detectors, the WA1 from WataSensor can
detect a door/window opening, or glass breaking anywhere in
the house or car. WA1 does not need to see the event or require expensive
sensors on the doors or windows. It can
detect it even when it happens at the other end of your house, records it and
sends alert to your smart phone.  There
is no need to add wiring to install WA1 in your home or car. Simply wirelessly connect
it to your smart phone over the internet and you are installed and protected. Only one device is
needed to protect your entire house or car.</p><p>The key to WA1 is our sensor technology which is now field proven with an earlier version of the product.  We have incorporated everything learned and added exciting new features to create the WA1.</p><p>We will deliver a unique security solution that is capable of protecting your family and your property in your car or home.  Please take a look and I am sure you will agree that having a WA1 will give you peace of mind knowing that everything you care about is protected and can be easily monitored from your smartphone . </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are targeting to raise $100,000 for manufacturing tooling
for WA1 and to complete development of our smart phone applications.  We have already delivered an early version of
our appliance so most of the technology hurdles are behind us.  We have also identified our volume
manufacturing partner so once we have funding we can precede rapidly to production.</p>
<p>From receipt of funds we will have early production units in
four months and full production three months later.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>By delivering low cost, easy to use portable security
appliances we can help protect the 90+% of homes that are not secured. Because our appliance is not “built-in” you
can take it with you when you move to a new apartment or house.  You can also use it to protect your car by
taking it with you and leaving it anywhere in your car, out of sight, even in
the trunk or glove box.  </p>
<p>According to the FBI, we can expect one in every thirty-six
homes in the United States to be burglarized this year resulting in an average
loss of $1,675.  That means a home
burglary happens once every 15 seconds. 
It is really not a question of if you will have a break-in but
when.  Auto theft is one every 45 seconds
in United States.  Unfortunately home and
car security systems are expensive, difficult to install, and require monthly
service fees.  Many cannot afford this
expense and they just hope they will be lucky.</p>
<p>WataSensor provides a low cost, easy to use alternative to
protect your family and your property. </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We understand that many of the people who need us most just can’t
contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Please tell your friends about WataSensor and
our portable security appliance.  Help us
to protect your family and property by bringing this revolutionary product to
market.</p>

<p><strong>How long is thewarranty on Halo?</strong></p>
<p>We are offering a 1-year warranty. Warranty is only for exchange of a defective unit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there any stretch goal for backers (ie. pouch, extra mAh, colored LED, etc. )</strong></p>
<p>There are stretch goals, you can check it in the story page.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><a name=""tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technical</a></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How long it takes to completely charge the halo with the built-in solar panel?</strong></p>
<p>The capacity of Halo is 20,000mAh or 74Wh, which is quite high, so it will take some time to fully charge Halo only with the solar charger. But you can get enough power to fully charge the iPhone in a few hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the solar panel charge the battery in low light and cloudy conditions? Changeable weather often results in strong sunlight, cloud cover and gloomy daylight all in the same day. Is Halo’s solar panel capable of (re)charging its battery in these conditions? </strong></p>
<p>The ""Solar"" indicator will light green if the solar panel is working. The panel even works in the house. However, the efficiency may be different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is Halo capable of pass thru charging? </strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If Halo’s battery is low/spent can the solar panel generate juice and pass it through the battery to power its USB ports? Or does the battery require fully recharging first?</strong></p>
<p>The battery shall be recharged first if the power is low.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I heard that using micro USB to charge the device is much slower than using Type C cable.</strong></p>
<p>The charging speed depends on the voltage and current of the output, not just the type. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the maximum standby hours of fully charged Halo.</strong></p>
<p>The standby time is quite long (months) if it's fully charged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I still use the wireless charger capability of the product while having a phone case?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'm using it right now, iPhone X with a case. But the case shouldn't be too thick, 1mm thickness should work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am wondering if it’s possible to increase the full charge-discharge cycles to 1000 ?</strong></p>
<p>The 500 full charge-discharge cycles spec is quite good score actually, even for iPhone or MacBook batteries. I may take 3 years to get 500 cycles since the capacity is 20,000mAh. It can powers your iPhone for 7 times at one cycle. And the battery is still good after after 500 cycle, just the capacity will be a bit lower (may be lower than 85%).</p>

GeneralTechnicalPayment and Shipping 
 

General
 


How long is thewarranty on Halo?
We are offering a 1-year warranty. Warranty is only for exchange of a defective unit. 
 
Is there any stretch goal for backers (ie. pouch, extra mAh, colored LED, etc. )
There are stretch goals, you can check it in the story page.
 
Technical
 
How long it takes to completely charge the halo with the built-in solar panel?
The capacity of Halo is 20,000mAh or 74Wh, which is quite high, so it will take some time to fully charge Halo only with the solar charger. But you can get enough power to fully charge the iPhone in a few hours.
 
Will the solar panel charge the battery in low light and cloudy conditions? Changeable weather often results in strong sunlight, cloud cover and gloomy daylight all in the same day. Is Halo’s solar panel capable of (re)charging its battery in these conditions? 
The ""Solar"" indicator will light green if the solar panel is working. The panel even works in the house. However, the efficiency may be different.
 
Is Halo capable of pass thru charging? 
Yes.
 
If Halo’s battery is low/spent can the solar panel generate juice and pass it through the battery to power its USB ports? Or does the battery require fully recharging first?
The battery shall be recharged first if the power is low.
 
I heard that using micro USB to charge the device is much slower than using Type C cable.
The charging speed depends on the voltage and current of the output, not just the type. 
 
What is the maximum standby hours of fully charged Halo.
The standby time is quite long (months) if it's fully charged.
 
Can I still use the wireless charger capability of the product while having a phone case?
Yes, I'm using it right now, iPhone X with a case. But the case shouldn't be too thick, 1mm thickness should work.
 
I am wondering if it’s possible to increase the full charge-discharge cycles to 1000 ?
The 500 full charge-discharge cycles spec is quite good score actually, even for iPhone or MacBook batteries. I may take 3 years to get 500 cycles since the capacity is 20,000mAh. It can powers your iPhone for 7 times at one cycle. And the battery is still good after after 500 cycle, just the capacity will be a bit lower (may be lower than 85%).

Using touch apps with a mouse can be frustrating since they are designed to work with a touchscreen. The Windows Store on your PC and laptop offers thousand of touch apps that you use on your smartphone and tablet everyday. DuoPad extends that experience onto your PC and laptop.

<p>Using the DuoPad is just like using any mouse or desktop trackpad. <b>Ergonomics are not compromised</b> as when using a desktop touch screen.

Using touch apps with a mouse can be frustrating since they are designed to work with a touchscreen. The Windows Store on your PC and laptop offers thousand of touch apps that you use on your smartphone and tablet everyday. DuoPad extends that experience onto your PC and laptop. With DuoPad, you still have a full-featured trackpad mode allowing you to navigate, as you would with a mouse, when using traditional desktop applications.DuoPad's name was inspired from what makes it stand-out from all other trackpads – it's amazing capacity to intelligently operate in two modes. 
It knows which apps you are running and switches modes automatically from desktop applications to touch apps. 
It makes your Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 PC or Laptop run seamlessly with every kind of software. 


Toggle nimbly between a traditional trackpad experience and DuoPad’s touch screen mode automatically, based on your needs.
DuoPad is amazingly accurate and responsive. Your hand gestures on it's surface appear identically and simultaneously on your monitor, with no delay. 


Using the DuoPad is just like using any mouse or desktop trackpad. Ergonomics are not compromised as when using a desktop touch screen. Especially when working for periods of time longer than a few minutes, the sheer weight of your hand and arm can really tire you quickly as you are constantly raising your hand to touch the vertical monitor. 



It’s easy to configure DuoPad to control exactly how you work and play on your PC. Define custom actions, choose your personal DuoPad Touch Mode display color from dozens of options, and even specify your transparency/opacity preferences.



In Trackpad Mode, the DuoPad is a precision Multi-touch Trackpad like the one on your laptop and includes the same standard functions and gestures you're already accustom to. Like the mouse, it moves the arrow cursor on the screen and also has left and right  click buttons so you can access the same drop down menus as you would with a mouse. Tap, tap to drag and double tap are also fully supported.
  

The DuoPad gives your laptop a Touchscreen Mode for your favorite touch apps, and a larger Multi-touch Trackpad for mouse cursor control and standard trackpad gestures when you use your desktop applications. 
 

The DuoPad is a powerful tool for many uses. It offers a superior trackpad experience, but goes one better by bringing all the fun and productivity of your favourite touch applications to any desktop or laptop monitor. Enjoy games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, Candy Crush Saga and many more other games using touch, just as you would on your tablet or smartphone. The latest version of Microsoft Office supports touch, making it a breeze to zoom in and out, move and edit items quickly with the touch of your fingers. You also have your physical keyboard to let you type with speed and comfort. So it all becomes productivity heaven with Office on your PC or Laptop.  In trackpad mode, DuoPad works like your mouse and gives you full control of your desktop applications that are designed to be used with the mouse cursor.  THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORTERS FOR REACHING OUR INITIAL GOAL! LETS TRY TO MAKE IT TO OUR STRETCH GOAL!   Are you a Windows 7 user?  When you upgrade to 10 you will be ready to use the DuoPad! And you can also upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8 or 8.1 to use the DuoPad!   We have been working closely over the last 2 years with a company specializing in electronics design and manufacturing to make sure that we can make the DuoPad a high quality product at the right price. However, problems can evolve at any stage during  manufacturing, therefore we have developed relations with experts that will assist us with every step of the DuoPad manufacturing process.
We have two manufacturers capable of producing the DuoPad. One manufacturer is better suited for a lower volume production and the other can produce in higher volume. We would like to sell as many DuoPads as our early adopters desire, but we have also planned and are able to satisfy any demand that will come for this new and exciting product. For reference, there are more than 200 million Windows 8, 8.1 PCs in use today that could benefit from the enhanced DuoPad features.The DuoPad includes software that has been in development for a few years already, so the software part is close to ship ready stage. Adjustments to the software will be required when the DuoPad makes it off the production line, however these adjustments will be minor. And our experienced software development team has produced commercial grade products in the past.

</div></div></div>","SPUD is a completely new type of product: the world’s first large AND portable display. SPUD is the only HD, 24-inch display with the awesome benefit of ultra-portability. It collapses just like an umbrella to the size and weight of a paperback book - making it ideal for anyone on the go. When expanded, SPUD uses custom optics combined with the latest DLP technology to produce the sharp, bright image that you need. Either with an HDMI cable or wireless adapter, SPUD can be connected to a smartphone, tablet, or laptop - no matter where you are! From watching movies on the go to being more productive while away from your office, SPUD optimizes the visual experience on practically any device.Just for our earliest community of supporters we are offering discounted pricing from the $549 projected retail price.NBC's the Today Show highlighted our SPUD prototype as a 2017 Tech Trend!SPUD pops-up to a huge, 24-inch diagonal display. When fully expanded, the device is 21 inches wide, 11 inches high, 14 inches deep (61 cm diagonal, 53 cm wide, 28 cm high, 36 cm deep).  The 24-inch display is the size of a large desk monitor, with almost 4x more screen area than a 13-inch laptop screen, and 23x more screen area than a 5.1-inch smartphone! The screen is also highly durable. Unlike breakable glass screens, SPUD uses a flexible polymer that can’t get cracked or chipped. If you happen to get it dirty, it’s washable. Further, the attached casing keeps your SPUD protected as you take it wherever life takes you. Plus, you can mount SPUD on a tripod (standard tripod mount 1/4-20 UNC threads) and position the screen any way you need it!When SPUD is collapsed, it’s about the size of a book: 5.64 inches wide, 2.17 inches high, 7.52 inches long (17 cm wide, 5.5 cm high, 19 cm long).Because of SPUD’s lightweight (less than 3 pounds) and compact form factor, when collapsed, it fits in your purse, backpack, laptop bag, or even your jacket pockets! Take SPUD anywhere!One of the most exciting things about SPUD is the many different ways that you can use it. For entertainment, SPUD is basically a portable TV or movie screen.Whether you’re traveling, camping, hanging out with friends at a coffee shop, or just lounging around your house, it’s the big screen you can use anywhere.    For work, having a dual-screen setup is great for productivity, but you can also use it for presentations and as a collaboration tool. It’s great for trade shows, sales visits, or any kind of field work.  SPUD gives you that flexibility you need no matter the situation. And it’s great because it’s a complete solution in a small package that you can take anywhere! SPUD combines a projector and projector screen into a complete, easy-to-use system. Unlike a traditional projector, SPUD does not need dim lighting, a wall, or a long projection distance. With our innovations, you can use your SPUD anywhere, with confidence. Three patent-pending innovations make this possible:The Projection Screen  SPUD uses the only projection screen designed to fully collapse. The screen material has been carefully crafted by our team to optimize image quality while minimizing screen wrinkles.   SPUD Screen vs Other Projector Screens:The Collapsible Design  The arms “pop-up” like a ruggedized umbrella, making setup a one-step process. The cover over the arms blocks out ambient light and helps to maximize brightness and contrast.  The Custom Optics  The optical design enables SPUD to project a high quality image over a much shorter distance than a standard projector. When you want the simplicity of a wired connection, just use an HDMI cable to connect SPUD to any HDMI-compatible device. No additional setup is required!When you want wireless (e.g. Chromecast, Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter, Fire TV Stick, Roku Stick), just plug your wireless adapter’s HDMI port into the SPUD HDMI port and the power for the adapter into SPUD’s USB port. No wires needed to stream your favorite content!Easily select the brightness you want (between 350-785 nits) using the convenient brightness dial.        SPUD is a whole new type of product: the first collapsible display! To bring SPUD to life, our team has a diverse range of expertise across product development, optical engineering (telescope, lasers, projectors!), mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and manufacturing.

What You Get</b></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Printing the mySelfie using Shapeways or similar online services costs us 7€ per piece (9€ if coloured); but the raw material costs is probaly just around a few eurocents! So we need either industrial scale production to reduce costs, or to buy our own printer to print the myselfies on demand.<br/>
</li>
<li>We need a professional printer, priced 1500$ and above, else we get bad results: green = industrial printer, blue = cheap printer,  black = professional FDM printer:</li>

<li>If we can't reach the
     planned goal, we will use available funds to buy a cheap
     FDM printer and print simplified version of the mySelfie;
     ""simpliefied"" means that it will be a little more squared and

<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no risks
     envisaged in the project: </li>
<li>we daily use a mySelfie
     printed by Shapeways professional printers, so we know the design is working fine; </li>
<li>we successfully printed a
     mySelfie using a Ultimaker2 FDM printer (thanks to the she-exhibitor at
     MakerFaire Rome 2014), with good results (only a slightly reduction of
     sharp angles is needed for better results)</li>
<li>We successfully tested
     mySelfie on several “official” tripods and several phones with no issues.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><p></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help</b></p>
<ul>
<li>By sure you know people
     interested on a cheap keyring allowing shooting selfies; but maybe they
     don’t know mySelfie and Indiegogo! Share this project with them if you
     want the campaign to finish sooner and have your mySelfie in your pocket as
     soon as possible! </li>

<br/><p><b>Cosa chiediamo e cosa ottieni in cambio</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Stampare un mySelfie con servizi di stampa 3d online come Shapeways ci costa <b>7 euro a pezzo</b> (9 se a colori); ma di materiale saranno pochi centesimi di euro! Abbiamo quindi bisogno di una <b>produzione industriale su larga scala</b> per <b>ridurre drasticamente i prezzi</b>, o di acquistare una stampante 3d per stamparci i mySelfie in proprio su richiesta.<br/>
</li>
<li>Produrre industrialmente oggetti in plastica tramite pressofusione richiede <b>ordini minimi di migliaia di pezzi (e migliaia di euro)</b>. Quindi dobbiamo raccogliere almeno 3000 euro per poter produrre 3000 pezzi pagandolo <b>1 euro l'uno</b>

</div><p></p></div>","Short Summary
(versione italiana in fondo alla pagina)Bored of taking selfies of jut
yourself and... your arm?
You want to take a REAL
selfie, or a selfie together with your friends?
But who will hold the camera?
Your keyring!Pick it from your pocket, place it on a flat
surface, put the phone in it, and take your selfie. You don't even need to detach
the mySelfie from your bunch of keys. And you can even screw it on a standard camera tripod thanks to its standard Whitworth screw.Use it together with iSmile remote contro for better selfies!
What We Need &
What You Get
Printing the mySelfie using Shapeways or similar online services costs us 7€ per piece (9€ if coloured); but the raw material costs is probaly just around a few eurocents! So we need either industrial scale production to reduce costs, or to buy our own printer to print the myselfies on demand.

We need a professional printer, priced 1500$ and above, else we get bad results: green = industrial printer, blue = cheap printer,  black = professional FDM printer:






Producing plastic objects by industrial injection molding requires a minimum order of some THOUSANDS of pieces (and some thousands of euros). So we need your help to raise up 3000 € to get 3000 pieces printed at 1€ each.

Those of you who will more believe in us by donating 20$ will also receive the on-demand print of our new project, the micro-tripod for pocket cameras:


It is as small as a crayon, but it is a fully functional camera tripod with foldable legs, movable head and standard whitworth screw compatible with all cameras... and with mySelfie!

What if our campaign fails?

If we can't reach the
     planned goal, we will use available funds to buy a cheap
     FDM printer and print simplified version of the mySelfie;
     ""simpliefied"" means that it will be a little more squared and
     linear than the one you see in pictures, to make it compatible with cheaper FDM printers.
The Impact

Every one carries a
     keyring and a smartphone in his pockets. He just lacks the “missin ring”,
     the mySelfie keyring! 
No more
     dirty/scratched/fallen phones while taking group selfies!
We presented mySelfie
     (with name “techno keyrings”) at MakerFaire Rome 2014 with great success,
     even at 3€ cost; we plan to sell it for 2€ or less.





Risks &
Challenges

There are no risks
     envisaged in the project: 
we daily use a mySelfie
     printed by Shapeways professional printers, so we know the design is working fine; 
we successfully printed a
     mySelfie using a Ultimaker2 FDM printer (thanks to the she-exhibitor at
     MakerFaire Rome 2014), with good results (only a slightly reduction of
     sharp angles is needed for better results)
We successfully tested
     mySelfie on several “official” tripods and several phones with no issues.

Other Ways You Can
Help

By sure you know people
     interested on a cheap keyring allowing shooting selfies; but maybe they
     don’t know mySelfie and Indiegogo! Share this project with them if you
     want the campaign to finish sooner and have your mySelfie in your pocket as
     soon as possible! 
VERSIONE ITALIANA
Sommario
Stanco di fare autoscatti di te stesso da solo... e del tuo braccio?
Vuoi farti un VERO autoscatto senza dover reggere il telefono in mano, o insieme ai tuoi amici? Ma chi reggerà il telefono?
Il tuo portachiavi!



Lo prendi dalla tasca, lo appoggi su una superficie piana, ci incastri il telefono e ti fai un selfie. Non devi nemmeno sfilare il mySelfie dal portachiavi, è già pronto all'uso. E volendo puoi persino avvitarlo a un treppiede professionale, grazie all'attacco Whitworth standard di cui è dotato.

Usalo col micro-telecomando iSmile per la massima comodità!


Cosa chiediamo e cosa ottieni in cambio

Stampare un mySelfie con servizi di stampa 3d online come Shapeways ci costa 7 euro a pezzo (9 se a colori); ma di materiale saranno pochi centesimi di euro! Abbiamo quindi bisogno di una produzione industriale su larga scala per ridurre drasticamente i prezzi, o di acquistare una stampante 3d per stamparci i mySelfie in proprio su richiesta.

Produrre industrialmente oggetti in plastica tramite pressofusione richiede ordini minimi di migliaia di pezzi (e migliaia di euro). Quindi dobbiamo raccogliere almeno 3000 euro per poter produrre 3000 pezzi pagandolo 1 euro l'uno

Ai più generosi che sosterranno la campagna con una donazione di 20 euro invieremo anche il prototipo del nostro nuovo progetto: il micro-treppiede per macchina fotografica:



E' più piccolo di un pennarello, ma è un treppiede completo di zampe ripiegabili, testa orientabile e attacco standard Whitworth compatibile con qualunque macchina fotografica... e col mySelfie!

E se non ci riusciamo?
Se non riuscissimo a raggiungere la quota prevista, anche una somma inferiore sarebbe sufficiente per acquistare una stampante 3d a filamento (FDM), magari una versione ecnomica; questo ci obbligherebbe a produrre una versione un po' semplificata del mySelfie, ma solo nel senso che dovrebbe essere un po' più squadrata e lineare, per via dei limiti fisici di queste stampanti economiche.

Gli impatti 

Gli impatti di questa mia invenzione saranno devastanti! :-) Milioni (miliardi?) di persone hanno in tasca un cellulare e un portachiavi; il mySelfie è l'anello mancante che li unisce, e viene incontro alla moda del momento del ""selfie"", un tempo noto come ""autoscatto"".
Mai più cellulari sporchi/graffiati/caduti nell'appoggiarli su un muretto per fare un autoscatto!
Abbiamo presentato il proptotipo del mySelfie al MakerFaire Rome 2014 con grande successo, persino se venduto a 3 euro; l'idea sarebbe di venderlo a 2 euro, se non addirittura 1.
