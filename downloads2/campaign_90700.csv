<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: Hello Siri! Exciting news, you guys have been asking for it and now it’s here. EnJai™ now works with <strong>Apple iOS</strong>! We’ve looked into making the integration and adjusted the compatibility to work with iPhone models: 3GS, 4, 4S, and the new iPhone 5 running iOS 5 or greater.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled at shenYon to continuously strive to make our products simpler and better for our users, and now by expanding our compatibility with Apple’s iOS we’re one step closer.</p>

<h1><strong>It’s Time To Break Free!...and now it's as easy as Downloading an App for FREE.</strong></h1>
<p><strong>EnJai™ is the first ever Dual-Functioning, WIRELESS, WATERPROOF </strong>Earbuds. It's completely customizable with our EnJai™ Mobile App. EnJai™ connects to Android devices, such as Smartphones, with our transceiver which easily attaches through the audio jack seamlessly allowing RF waves to connect. While designing EnJai™ both hardware and software, we strove to create a simplistic yet customizable Earbud that would allow you to live the active lifestyle and not have to worry about the nuisance of cords holding you back from your everyday activities. </p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMIZE WITH </strong><strong>EnJai™ MOBILE</strong><strong> APP</strong></p>
<p>Our app makes <strong>EnJai™ </strong>Earbuds even simpler to use. With categories such as Phone, Music, Battery, Voice Recognition &amp; Volume Control there’s nothing you can’t adjust to your preferred settings. Everything is completely <em>CUSTOMIZABLE!</em></p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p>Aside from the obvious adjustments you can make by turning or tapping on your <strong>EnJai™ Earbuds </strong>to adjust <strong>Volume</strong>, and ending/receiving calls…you can now customize your settings on your <strong>EnJai™ </strong>Mobile App. For example, in your phone section, just simply tap on the Phone Icon, which will then direct you to your “Left” &amp; “Right” Earbud settings for <strong>EnJai™</strong>. Because each individual unit works separately, you choose by selecting which Earbud you’d like to receive <strong>Incoming calls</strong> from. Options for that could be: <em>left, right, or both</em>! With <strong>Outgoing calls</strong> you can select either your <em>left</em> or <em>right</em> Earbud to activate the <strong>Voice Recognition</strong> feature. It’s as easy as one tap.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/321/150f9c85d0246ffd7bdfd30ceb9fb0d6_large.png?1338949636"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Not only are you able to make and receive phone calls with <strong>EnJai™ </strong>you can also listen to your favorite <strong>Music.</strong> With our “Patent Pending” technology <strong>EnJai™ </strong>allows you to use its <strong>Dual-Functioning Wireless</strong> feature by listening to music on one Earbud while taking a call on the other. Simply tap the Music Icon, and decide which Earbud you’d like to listen to <strong>Music</strong> from: <em>left, right, or both!</em> Once you’ve done that you can also choose to turn the “Fade Out” button on/off. By turning on this feature you choose to fade your music volume out when a call is incoming.</p>
<p>Depending on what your activity is you can navigate through your playlists and continuously listen to your music while Running, Swimming and Biking…you name it, you can do it with <strong>EnJai™.</strong></p>

<p>Our <strong>Voice Recognition</strong> feature let’s you dial anyone by name or number in your contact list by double tapping the top of your <strong>EnJai™ Earbuds. </strong>Want to play your favorite song without going through your phone? Well, now you can! Just double tap your <strong>EnJai™ Earbuds </strong>and say “Play Lady Gaga Poker Face”. Without skipping a beat you can multifunction with ease. Other functions of our App include checking your Battery Levels &amp; Volume Controls for each <strong>EnJai™ </strong>Earbud.</p>

<h1><strong>Where We're At:</strong></h1>
<p>I’ve spent over the last 3 years of my life doing Research &amp; Development, and I can finally say we’re ready for <strong>EnJai™ </strong>to be in everyone’s ears. We have a functioning prototype and it works. It's been extremely important for us at shenYon to make sure we have the best of the best on our team. </p>
<p>We've enlisted top mechanical engineers to work on our Industrial Design, software developers to give our users the best user experience on Android, and seasoned hardware development consultants that have worked with high profile firms such as IBM, Motorola, and LifeFitness to bring products to market. We've taken the necessary steps to make sure we have a realistic timeline in order to get all the approvals and final production prototypes complete (yes, we need all those approvals before we can ship out to our backers). </p>
<p>With your support, we can bring <strong>EnJai™ Earbuds</strong> to the market for the world to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Within our development timeframe, we'll be able to do the following: </strong></p>
<p>-Order the injection molds and production tooling: a huge one-time investment</p>
<p>-Convert our prototypes to production ready models, with all the regulatory and mandated approvals needed</p>
<p>-Place our first production orders (we need to know how many to make, and more is better)</p>
<p>-We are working with manufacturing firm with lots of experience in Consumer Devices, they've manufactured for some of the top Fortune 500 companies to date</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. How long does the battery last?    A.</strong> The rechargeable battery keeps <strong>EnJai™ </strong>going for 5hrs+ while in use, and a standby of close to 8-10hrs. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Is it waterproof?    A. EnJai™ Earbuds</strong> are water resistant; you can go swimming a full Olympic size pool away from the transceiver as well as fully submerge <strong>EnJai™ </strong>in water. You can even take your very important calls right in the shower. We're working on getting the certification level to a point where you can go at least 12ft/3.6 Meters deep with them in your ear (IPX58 As defined in International Standard IEC 60529).</p>
<p><strong>Q. How does it charge?    A.</strong> We include a special USB cable with our unit box. You can charge <strong>EnJai™ </strong>using your computer, car charger, or any wall outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Q. What are RF Waves?</strong> <strong>A.</strong> RF Waves stand for Radio Frequency, which is a rate of oscillation that ranges from multiple levels that correspond to the frequency of radio, and their alternating currents which carry radio signals.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Why do you need a transceiver? A.</strong> Having the wireless functionality was difficult to achieve in a sense that we needed to generate enough space in a small device that would contain all of the electronics to implement the RF link to the two wireless Earbuds. With Bluetooth it would simply interfere with the ability to have each unit work on it’s own. We didn’t want to run the risk of <strong>EnJai™ </strong>not syncing properly, and there being a delay in audio.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>Easy Setup</h3>
<p>Tethercell is extremely simple to install. First, remove a single AA-battery from whichever device you choose.  Next, make sure that Tethercell already has a AAA battery installed within it, then replace the removed AA battery with Tethercell. No matter how many AA batteries are required to run the device, you only need one Tethercell. After the Tethercell is snug in the battery compartment, turn on the device, fire up the Tetherboard app after downloading it free from the App store and you're ready to connect from any iOS or Android device that is Bluetooth Smart compatible.</p>

<p>You can think of The Tethercell App as your Tethercell control center. From the Tethercell App you can easily connect to and control all active Tethercells in range straight from this intuitive interface which will be freely downloadable for supported devices. Tethercells have been tested to communicate with an iPhone 4S up to 100 feet away in an open field.</p><p></p><p><span><b>iOS</b></span></p><p>The <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tethercell/id597294115?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tethercell iOS App</a> will be compatible with all Bluetooth Smart-enabled (i.e. Bluetooth 4.0) iOS smartphones and tablets. </p><p><span><b>Android</b></span></p><p>The <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tetherboard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tethercell Android App</a> will be compatible with all Bluetooth Smart-enabled (i.e. Bluetooth 4.0) Android smartphones and tablets running Android 4.3 or 4.4. This includes over 160 devices already in the market.</p>
<p>We’re designing Tethercell so that you can connect to a number of Tethercells instantaneously (we've tested up to four at once with good performance). No configuration processes, connections to maintain within your home network or other required hardware components. Once you have the app on your smartphone or tablet you’re ready to go. And since Tethercell only requires your smartphone or tablet for connectivity, connecting to Tethercell on the go is just as easy as connecting at home.</p>

<h1>Intelligent Design</h1>
<p>We believe that a lot of everyday products are begging to be re-examined and re-designed. As design engineers, we initially approached this project as a packaging problem, not too dissimilar from how you'd approach the ground up design of a new rocket engine or launch vehicle. While it may not be rocket science, our team's 20 years of collective experience in that field certainly came in handy during the conceptual and protoytpe design phase of Tethercell.</p>

<h1><strong>The Functional Prototypes</strong></h1>
<p>To date, we've been through two major prototyping phases (and several design iterations within each phase). The first phase included a Windows-based application that communicated with a Tethercell that was true to the required final product dimensions. The second phase included an iOS application that executed all required control functions (except for the timer and device password functions) as well as a Tethercell that was built to the required final product dimensions.</p>

<p><strong>High Quality Partnerships</strong></p>
<p>We of course could not have done this without the support of our friends, family and a few key partnerships. One partnership in particular was made with Brinton Engineering LLC, a premiere RF and embedded electrical systems R&amp;D shop in Menlo Park, CA. Brinton is providing electrical design and prototyping support for the Tethercell electrical board.</p>
<h1>Why We're Doing This</h1>
<p>We believe in intelligent design, thinking outside the box and challenging set norms. With that said, we saw an opportunity to innovate around a commodity product that is a part of everyone's life. Yes, many are working to increase the energy density of batteries, while others are developing more efficient rechargeable batteries. With Tethercell we chose to go in a different direction. The result has been a challenging project that has landed us on IndieGoGo for support so that we may take this idea to the next level!</p>
<h1>Production and Fulfillment Schedule</h1>
<p>One of the many things we've learned as hardware engineers is that things take longer than expected. With this notion in mind, we've carefully thought through our production and delivery schedule and are confident that we can meet all of the project milestones listed below. Developing high-quality hardware, software, and firmware is a time-consuming venture; the milestone dates below are realistic; to suggest anything less would be dishonest, and we prefer to be as upfront about these things as we can possibly be. We will of course keep you posted on our progress.</p>

<h1>Privacy and Security</h1>
<p>Tethercell has been designed with privacy in mind. From the beginning we've included a feature to allow users to enter a personal code in order to connect to Tethercell. In the first functional prototype this feature was called ""FAMILY ID."" In the second functional prototype, as well as with with the final product, we are using the same underlying functionality, but are calling it ""Device Password."" In the final version of the app, when a Tethercell is discovered for the first time, the user will be prompted to establish a device password. From there on out no other Tetherboard user will be able to connect to that Tethercell unless they too know the established device password.</p>
<h1>Tech Details</h1>
<p>Tethercell is the same size and length as a typical AA-battery, which power approximately 60% of primary battery-operated devices. You’ll notice that Tethercell is powered by a AAA battery, which allows room for the embedded intelligence that we’ve packed into a really tight space. Don’t worry - your devices will still have the power they need to function when just one of the AAs is substituted with the AAA-powered Tethercell.  The electronic brains embedded within the Tethercell contains a lot of cutting-edged electronics based upon the TI CC2540 microcontroller. Packed with a current sensing OP-AMP comparator, temperature sensor, N-channel MOSFET (capable of switching up to 5A), 1.5 to 3V boost converter and embeddeded 8051 microcontroller, Tethercell represents a veritable untapped playground of potential.</p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Tethercell will have many user-definable modes of operation. Powering the on-board Bluetooth radio consumes a very small amount of current (~20mA). However, the radio operates on a low duty cycle, meaning that it doesn't transmit for very long and ideally spends most of it's time asleep. Users will be able to tailor the behavior of their Tethercells via the Tetherboard App using simple iOS style App controls. For usage cases requiring simply turning on or off items in use and then going to sleep, the Tethercell's quiescent power consumption enables the device to run for approximately six to twelve months on a single AAA battery. In general, the device has been demonstrated to provide months of reliable use in real world testing. Needless to say, the battery life is highly dependent upon how the device is configured and how much power the host device draws.</p>
<p>Tethercell utilizes Bluetooth 4.0, the new low power Bluetooth protocol that will play a big part in the Internet of Things. With Bluetooth Smart Ready the range of use with Tethercell should extend to about 60 feet through one wall. As stated earlier, we have conducted some open field tests where we demonstrated connectivity at distances over 100 feet. As with any RF device, environment plays a significant role in the performance of Tethercell. We are confident in stating these range figures as we routinely exceed them in testing.</p>
<h1>What is Bluetooth Low Energy?</h1>
<p>Bluetooth Low Energy, as the name suggests, is the lower energy version of Bluetooth, the popular wireless radio technology. Bluetooth Low Energy was the enabling technology that made Tethercell possible; Bluetooth Low Energy, more commonly referred to as Bluetooth Smart Ready, requires significantly less power for operation than other traditional radio options. This technology will benefit a number of industries as many hardware developers are actively seeking solutions to shrink devices into increasingly smaller form-factors and power those devices for longer periods of time from equally small power sources.<em> </em></p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Tethercell uses a AAA battery in place of a AA battery.  How does this affect battery life? </strong></p>
<p>A: A good quality AAA battery has about 1/2 to 1/3 the capacity of a AA battery.  As a result, the AAA battery will run down first, at which point the app will notify you that it's time to refresh the AAA cell.  Tethercell will cut off the circuit if the AAA battery discharges to such an extent that it could otherwise reverse charge and present a hazard.  After refreshing the AAA cell, the device will continue to operate and the remaining life in the AA cells can be used until they are drained.  Approximately 1/2 of the capacity of the AAA cell is used for the Bluetooth connection for 1 year of quiescent connectivity, leaving the remaining juice for the device it is installed in.  Of course, for high drain devices, you'll probably be changing or recharging the AAA cell well before the 1 year mark. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use rechargeable batteries with Tethercell?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes! Tethercell performs best with rechargable cells because of their low internal resistance, especially in high drain devices.  We have tested Tethercell with Sanyo Eneloop XX batteries with exceptional results.  In one test, a AAA cell charged to 1350 mAH capacity; paired with rechargeable AA cells, Tethercell really shines, and the life deficit is easily overcome, gaining you unprecendented functionality.  We recommend NiMH Low Self Discharge cells (like Eneloop) for maximum performance.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I recharge my AAA cells while they are installed in Tethercell?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes!  We have successfully cycled NiMH cells on a La Crosse BC-700 charger multiple times, even at the 700 mAH setting!  Tethercell supports the typical Charge/Discharge-Test/and Charge-Refresh functions common to NiCad and NiMh style chargers.   </p>
<p><strong>Q: Are you planning to make AAA, 9V, and other cell versions in the future?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, we have been working on reducing the size of the circuitry to facilitate embedding it in a AAA battery as well as a 9V.  The larger cells are less of a challenge since the electronics present less of a percentage of the available real-estate, and we have a better power budget to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  How did you come up with the idea for Tethercell?</strong></p>
<p>A: Trey, one of the co-founders, struggled with inconveniences associated with the many toys and battery powered devices that made their way into his life once he had kids.  Tethercell was born out of a desire to disable nuisance toys, conveniently enable parental overide for cordless mice, keyboards and the like, turn on a baby monitor without entering his son's room, and finding the TV remotes that seemed to to wander off a little too often when his toddlers took a liking to them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  Is Tethercell made in the USA?</strong></p>
<p>A:  We are making every effort to manufacture the most critical components of Tethercell close to home to ease logistics.  We received many offers from US based suppliers to help us achieve that goal. </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Does Tethercell need to have an active BT connection for the timers to work?</strong></p>
<p>A:  No, after setting a timing routine from the Tethercell app, the information is wirelessly communicated to the embedded micro-controler within Tethercell.  Even after a connection is terminated, the programmed timers will continue to function. </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Will Tethercell work if it's installed in a metallic enclosure device, like a Mag-Lite?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes and no.  We have tested Tethercell in an aluminum bodied AA sized flashlight.  Although the device will connect, it needs to be in very close proximity to the transmitter (ie. phone or tablet).  Once pared, it unfortunately suffers from very limited range (~ a few feet) because the aluminum impedes the RF transmissions to the antenna on-board Tethercell. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Tethercell work with motorized devices?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, Tethercell can switch up to 5A of current, which is sufficient for most motorized devices.  For high drain devices of this sort, we highly recommend using rechargeable chemistry batteries (NiMH or NiCad) as they have low internal resistance and therefore will not cause a noticable drop in performance.  They also are also more economical since the AAA cell does have reduced capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  Does Tethercell let you know when the AA batteries (if installed) are running low?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, Tethercell is only capable of monitoring and reporting the charge status of the AAA cell contained within it.</p>

Easy Setup
Tethercell is extremely simple to install. First, remove a single AA-battery from whichever device you choose.  Next, make sure that Tethercell already has a AAA battery installed within it, then replace the removed AA battery with Tethercell. No matter how many AA batteries are required to run the device, you only need one Tethercell. After the Tethercell is snug in the battery compartment, turn on the device, fire up the Tetherboard app after downloading it free from the App store and you're ready to connect from any iOS or Android device that is Bluetooth Smart compatible.


The Tethercell App (for iOS and Android)
You can think of The Tethercell App as your Tethercell control center. From the Tethercell App you can easily connect to and control all active Tethercells in range straight from this intuitive interface which will be freely downloadable for supported devices. Tethercells have been tested to communicate with an iPhone 4S up to 100 feet away in an open field.iOSThe Tethercell iOS App will be compatible with all Bluetooth Smart-enabled (i.e. Bluetooth 4.0) iOS smartphones and tablets. AndroidThe Tethercell Android App will be compatible with all Bluetooth Smart-enabled (i.e. Bluetooth 4.0) Android smartphones and tablets running Android 4.3 or 4.4. This includes over 160 devices already in the market.
We’re designing Tethercell so that you can connect to a number of Tethercells instantaneously (we've tested up to four at once with good performance). No configuration processes, connections to maintain within your home network or other required hardware components. Once you have the app on your smartphone or tablet you’re ready to go.

A: Yes, Tethercell can switch up to 5A of current, which is sufficient for most motorized devices.  For high drain devices of this sort, we highly recommend using rechargeable chemistry batteries (NiMH or NiCad) as they have low internal resistance and therefore will not cause a noticable drop in performance.  They also are also more economical since the AAA cell does have reduced capacity.
Q:  Does Tethercell let you know when the AA batteries (if installed) are running low?
A: No, Tethercell is only capable of monitoring and reporting the charge status of the AAA cell contained within it.

you ever been running and wished your earphones would just stay in
your ears? Do you ride a motorcycle and struggle to keep your
earphones or earplugs in when wearing a helmet? Do you find that your
earphones hurt your ears after a while? Earcandi is a reusable,
silicone based polymer that moulds around your earphones giving you a
customised fit and ensures that they stay in your ears - 100%
guaranteed, no matter what. Earcandi was born out of a desire for
functional sports earphones that don't fall out or dislodge when
engaging in physical activity. We have developed a solution to the
problem of earphones falling out for when you need to focus on your
sport and not mess around putting your earbuds back in your ears
every 5 minutes.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Essentially,
anything generic that fits in the ear can be customised with
Earcandi. Because your ear shape is as unique as your fingerprint
there is no ,'one size fits all' option that works fully. The cool
thing about Earcandi is that in the same way as we are customising
our phones with apps and printing stuff on our desktop in 3D, it's
now possible to get away from the uncomfortable generic earphones
with poor functionality and upgrade to something blueprinted exactly
for you.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Colours of Earcandi are available to Indiegogo supporters are as follows:</span></p><p>Purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, black and white.</p><p>Sennheiser CX400 earphones are available in Black or white.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183982/files/20131108061409-02_earcandi_putty.jpg?1383920049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><b></b> </p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183985/files/20131108061557-05_how_it_works_header.jpg?1383920157"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Well, it's pretty simple. Earcandi kind of looks like play-doh, but you get a white part and a coloured part. Take the two parts out of their respective packaging and mix them together for about a minute - this sets in motion the curing process. Insert your earphones into your ears, split the resulting mix in two and just push it in around your earphones (or just in your ears for earplugs). Leave it for ten minutes to set, take them out and voila, Earcandi custom moulded earphones!</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The
medical grade silicone polymer we use produces a soft, flexible and

you get with Earcandi, allowing you to play your music at lower
volumes which reduces the chance of damaging your hearing by having
to crank up the volume. For this reason audiologists will all
emphasize there is no substitute for custom earphones. The silicone
easily bonds to any earphones and will retain its shape permanently,
giving you a soft, sturdy and comfortable set of custom earphones

Regular
custom moulded earphones/monitors have been around for a while now,
but for the majority of people they are prohibitively expensive.
Earcandi are the first of their kind and solve the problem of cost by
cutting out expensive elements of production such as visits to
specialists for ear castings and injection moulding systems.We think
we've struck a good balance with the Earcandi system - better than
the 'one size fits all' approach of regular earbuds, but a fraction
of the cost of expensive in-ear monitors.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183987/files/20131108061634-06_how_it_works_image.jpg?1383920194"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183992/files/20131108062044-07_who_can_use_earcandi_header.jpg?1383920444"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Although sport is a huge part of our market, it isn't the only application for Earcandi and our unique Sonicone material can be used for a variety of other things as well.

We're both pretty active people and participate in quite a few different sports - running, cycling, mountain biking, triathlon, snowboarding, climbing and kickboxing to name a few. Like many people we knew, we were completely fed up of our earphones constantly falling out whenever we did any kind of sport. Between us we'd tried all of the sports-fit styles, ear-buds and even these weird little cone things, (which either fell out or hurt our ears after about 10 minutes). We'd pretty much given up on being able to listen to music when we were moving around with any kind of intensity until Lloyd started messing around with a squidgy wax earplug whilst on holiday in Norway. Fast forward past Steve's kitchen, combining stinky bathroom sealant and various other bits and bobs and we hooked up with a medical silicone manufacturer who helped us formulate a much safer, softer and more colourful version of the original, smelly prototype. To this day, the first pair moulded have never fallen out, no matter what, not once - and we reckon that's pretty good going considering how often we find ourselves upside down when we should be the right way up. We're a young company trying to find our feet in the world of business, (the jeans and hoodies get some odd looks at meetings), but we reckon if we can do what we do well, offer our product at a reasonable price and look after and listen to our customers we should be alright.

Programmers may spend even 80% of their time on reading other programmers’ code, therefore improving code readability is the best way to raise productivity of programmers.Making programmers lives easier, our platform will attract programmers attention and get more free content (functions) developed and shared with others.Other Ways You Can Help

<p><em><strong>Hurrican Isaac reminds us all of the urgency for backup power during an emergency.  Help us put mobile power where people need it most.</strong></em></p>
<h1>
<strong>What's a Crisis Mapper? </strong> </h1>
<p>During emergencies, natural disasters, in conflict zones or other crises, people on the scene need charged phones to tell the world what's going on.  <a href=""http://www.crisismappers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crisis Mappers</a> tweet &amp; text in real time from crisis areas to create maps which emergency responders use to target help to those most in need.   <a href=""http://crisismappers.net/page/intro-to-crisismapping"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get more info on crisis mapping here</a>.</p>
<p>Crisis mapping is often most valuable where there is <strong>no reliable electrical grid to power mobile phones</strong>, where at risk populations are most vulnerable, and powered mobile phones <strong>could save lives</strong>.  Over half a billion mobile phone users worldwide live <strong>completely</strong> off the grid, and another <strong>three-quarters of a billion</strong> people struggle to find reliable electricity.  </p>
<h1><strong>Ok...let's keep them connected.</strong></h1>
<p>Tremont Electric will partner with <a href=""http://crisismappers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CrisisMappers.net</a> to identify people off the grid in developing nations with the most extreme and urgent needs for mobile power.  With help from Indiegogo, we'll fill that need with the nPower® PEG.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.npowerpeg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The nPower® PEG </a>is the world's first passive kinetic energy charger for personal hand-held devices. Placed in a bag, tied to a belt, mounted on a motorcycle, or hanging from an animal, the nPower® PEG harnesses the kinetic energy of walking, running, jogging, hiking, storing it for use when you need it most - off the grid. The patented nPower® PEG placed second at the <a href=""http://www.npowerpeg.com/press-releases/2-uncategorised/39-tremont-electric-wins-2nd-place-at-the-2010-international-consumer-electronics-association-i-stage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 Consumer Electronics Show i-Stage competition for innovation</a>, and won the <a href=""http://www.npowerpeg.com/blog/138-npower-peg-wins-silver-medal-at-edison-awards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2012 Edison Award Silver Medal for Power Generation</a>.

<h1><strong>What's a crisis map look like?  </strong></h1>
<p>Here's an example - <a href=""http://ushahidi.internewskenya.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a crisis map put together by journalists in Kenya</a>. </p>

<p>You can click on the various spots on the map for details from the reports delivered through mobile devices.  Our project will produce similar maps, but from the clean kinetic energy of the reporters themselves.  Groups receiving PEGs will run simulated crisis mapping incidents, resulting in an online map thick with data that <strong>backers can watch grow</strong>.</p>

<p>If we reach our goal, 100 nPower® PEG mobile chargers will be hand-delivered to Crisis Mapper projects in high-risk populations off the grid, so they can report, map, record, and observe, powered by their own kinetic energy.  <a href=""http://crisismappers.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CrisisMappers.net</a> has reached out to its network of over 4000 people worldwide to identify an initial group of projects off the grid that need mobile power.  Here are some sample requests for nPower® PEGs technology, that will be used to help power projects as diverse as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food security in<strong> Sudan &amp; South Sudan</strong>
</li>
<li>Studying health care patterns in <strong>Haiti</strong>
</li>
<li>Monitoring nutrition in rural <strong>Uganda</strong>
</li>
<li>Tracking nomadic at-risk populations in <strong>Darfur</strong>
</li>
</ul><p>If the IndieGoGo community exceeds our goal, we will continue to work with The International Network of Crisis Mappers to identify more projects that need mobile power, and send them more PEGs.  </p>
<h1>Budget - the more raised, the more people get mobile power</h1>
<p>The minimum budget for our project is $40,000, which breaks down pretty simple.  100 PEGs cost $17,000.  Shipping, travel, logistics and training for delivery of PEGs to 4 separate projects in 4 separate countries will be minimum $5,000 per trip, x4 = $20,000.  The subtotal is $37,000, and adding Indiegogo fees brings us to $40,000.  Once the PEGs are in place, Crisis Mappers will use crowdsourcing software already in place to create the map that we can all follow as it grows. That's it!  </p>
<p><em>If we raise more than our goal, more crisis mappers will get mobile power.  Simple as that.</em></p>
<h1>Perks - Watch the crisis maps grow online. Plus T-shirts, PEG pics from the field, or your own PEG!</h1>
<p><strong>ALL BACKERS, starting at the $10 level</strong>, will be notified by email when the FIRST project goes live online, so you can watch the resulting kinetic energy powered crisis map in real time from your laptop, tablet, or phone. All backers also receive photos from delivery of nPower® PEGs to the field.</p>
<p><strong>At $25</strong>, you'll be notified when ALL field tests go live, so you can decide which kinetic energy powered crisis map to watch online. You'll also receive a photo, nPower® sticker, and an nPower® magnet.</p>
<p><strong>At $100</strong>, you'll receive all of the items above, plus a limited edition nPower® PEG t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>At $250</strong>, you are fully funding one nPower® PEG for a crisis mapper, including the shipping &amp; delivery, plus you get all the other stuff - t-shirt, sticker, photo, magnet, notifications.</p>
<p><strong>At $500</strong>, you get your own nPower® PEG, including shipping to you, so you can charge your devices off the grid, too. The rest goes to fund and deliver a PEG to a crisis mapper, plus you get all the other stuff - t-shirt, sticker, photo, magnet, notifications.</p>
<h2>Let's power some Crisis Mappers.</h2></div>","UPDATE:
Hurrican Isaac reminds us all of the urgency for backup power during an emergency.  Help us put mobile power where people need it most.

What's a Crisis Mapper?  
During emergencies, natural disasters, in conflict zones or other crises, people on the scene need charged phones to tell the world what's going on.  Crisis Mappers tweet & text in real time from crisis areas to create maps which emergency responders use to target help to those most in need.   Get more info on crisis mapping here.
Crisis mapping is often most valuable where there is no reliable electrical grid to power mobile phones, where at risk populations are most vulnerable, and powered mobile phones could save lives.  Over half a billion mobile phone users worldwide live completely off the grid, and another three-quarters of a billion people struggle to find reliable electricity.  
Ok...let's keep them connected.
Tremont Electric will partner with CrisisMappers.net to identify people off the grid in developing nations with the most extreme and urgent needs for mobile power.  With help from Indiegogo, we'll fill that need with the nPower® PEG.
The nPower® PEG is the world's first passive kinetic energy charger for personal hand-held devices. Placed in a bag, tied to a belt, mounted on a motorcycle, or hanging from an animal, the nPower® PEG harnesses the kinetic energy of walking, running, jogging, hiking, storing it for use when you need it most - off the grid. The patented nPower® PEG placed second at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show i-Stage competition for innovation, and won the 2012 Edison Award Silver Medal for Power Generation. Here's a video of the nPower® PEG at work on a SXSW Startup bus.  This June, SmartPlanet called the nPower® PEG the ""best charging device ever."" 
What's a crisis map look like?  
Here's an example - a crisis map put together by journalists in Kenya. 

You can click on the various spots on the map for details from the reports delivered through mobile devices.  Our project will produce similar maps, but from the clean kinetic energy of the reporters themselves.  Groups receiving PEGs will run simulated crisis mapping incidents, resulting in an online map thick with data that backers can watch grow.
So who are you guys?
Tremont Electric is a Triple Bottom Line Green Plus certified clean energy startup in Cleveland, Ohio, makers of the nPower® PEG, dedicated to making kinetic energy a part of the clean energy future for us all.  Here's the Tremont Electric team - our founder, and inventor of the nPower® technology, Aaron LeMieux, and his wife, VP of Marketing Jill LeMieux, are in the above video.  The International Network of Crisis Mappers is the largest and most active international community of observers, policymakers, journalists, scholars, hackers and skilled volunteers engaged at the intersection between humanitarian crises, technology and crisis mapping.  Jen Ziemke, who's also in the video, is a co-founder of CrisisMappers.net.

I can't wait to watch this project grow online! Where will the mobile power go?
If we reach our goal, 100 nPower® PEG mobile chargers will be hand-delivered to Crisis Mapper projects in high-risk populations off the grid, so they can report, map, record, and observe, powered by their own kinetic energy.  CrisisMappers.net has reached out to its network of over 4000 people worldwide to identify an initial group of projects off the grid that need mobile power.  Here are some sample requests for nPower® PEGs technology, that will be used to help power projects as diverse as:

Food security in Sudan & South Sudan

Studying health care patterns in Haiti

Monitoring nutrition in rural Uganda

Tracking nomadic at-risk populations in Darfur

If the IndieGoGo community exceeds our goal, we will continue to work with The International Network of Crisis Mappers to identify more projects that need mobile power, and send them more PEGs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of high school seniors at <a href=""http://www.bayschoolsf.org/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Bay School of San Francisco</a>. Each Bay senior completes a Senior Signature Project, which is a project chosen by the senior and is similar in scope to an undergraduate thesis. For the past year or so, we've been researching 3D printing technologies and have noticed a gaping hole in the current industry. Namely, there are no consumer model printers that use selective laser melting (SLM) technology. This technology is used for industrial applications to print sturdy metal parts. We want to bring SLM 3D printing into the homes of individual designers, engineers, makers, and artists.</p>
<p>To do this, we will design and build an SLM 3D printer specifically designed to be easy to reproduce and use. We will open source both the plans and the software for the printer. The Bay School allocates a limited amount of funds for each Senior Signature Project. Our project requires additional funds because our budget exceeds that limit. That's where you come in.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $5000 in funding in order to build our prototype. This will cover material costs and manufacturing costs. In addition, we need about $2000 to cover the cost of the printing material (stainless steel powder) to test the printer, showcase its capabilities, and fulfill all of the perks.</p>
<p>As a gift for donating, we will allow you to submit your 3D models for us to print. This will also serve to show people the power and accuracy of this technology. We will print just about anything that you want, with a few exceptions. The rules are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>No hollow cavities. Given the way our printer will work, they will end up full of steel powder with no good way to empty it.</li>
<li>No ultra thin (&lt;.5 millimeters) walls.</li>
<li>The resolution of the printer is 100 cubic microns. You shouldn't have to worry about this for most objects, but it's something to keep in mind.</li>
<li>All items have to conform to the IndieGoGo rules (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms</a>), as well as all local, state, and US laws.</li>
<li>In order for us to fulfill your perks, you must give us an STL file(s) to print, and a valid shipping address (with the country included). Please make sure to pick the correct perk for your shipping address. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you need inspiration for things to print, we have a large list of ideas <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kW_ncpRVhhGurQxFvCA3R8DX0lsk86fcI4MRjOI6WKY/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>SLM 3D printers have the potential to revolutionize the way we view consumer products. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people who would benefit from the use of an SLM 3D printer can't get access to one. </p>
<p>That's what this project is seeking to change.</p>
<p>Currently, most consumer products are made and distributed through manufacturing firms. A designer comes up with a product, and then either tries to pitch it to an existing company or start their own. Either option takes lots of time and money and serves only to put up barriers between product designers and the end user. Then, months later, the product gets shipped to stores and online retailers, where a user can then buy it. That's a minimum of two middlemen between the designer and the user, costing both of them time and money. </p>
<p>Now imagine what would happen if everyone had access to a 3D printer. The process would look something like this: </p>
<p></p>

We are a group of high school seniors at The Bay School of San Francisco. Each Bay senior completes a Senior Signature Project, which is a project chosen by the senior and is similar in scope to an undergraduate thesis. For the past year or so, we've been researching 3D printing technologies and have noticed a gaping hole in the current industry. Namely, there are no consumer model printers that use selective laser melting (SLM) technology. This technology is used for industrial applications to print sturdy metal parts. We want to bring SLM 3D printing into the homes of individual designers, engineers, makers, and artists.
To do this, we will design and build an SLM 3D printer specifically designed to be easy to reproduce and use. We will open source both the plans and the software for the printer. The Bay School allocates a limited amount of funds for each Senior Signature Project. Our project requires additional funds because our budget exceeds that limit. That's where you come in.


What We Need & What You Get
We need about $5000 in funding in order to build our prototype. This will cover material costs and manufacturing costs. In addition, we need about $2000 to cover the cost of the printing material (stainless steel powder) to test the printer, showcase its capabilities, and fulfill all of the perks.
As a gift for donating, we will allow you to submit your 3D models for us to print. This will also serve to show people the power and accuracy of this technology. We will print just about anything that you want, with a few exceptions. The rules are as follows:


No hollow cavities. Given the way our printer will work, they will end up full of steel powder with no good way to empty it.
No ultra thin (<.5 millimeters) walls.
The resolution of the printer is 100 cubic microns. You shouldn't have to worry about this for most objects, but it's something to keep in mind.
All items have to conform to the IndieGoGo rules (http://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms), as well as all local, state, and US laws.
In order for us to fulfill your perks, you must give us an STL file(s) to print, and a valid shipping address (with the country included). Please make sure to pick the correct perk for your shipping address. 

If you need inspiration for things to print, we have a large list of ideas here.


The Impact
SLM 3D printers have the potential to revolutionize the way we view consumer products. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people who would benefit from the use of an SLM 3D printer can't get access to one. 
That's what this project is seeking to change.
Currently, most consumer products are made and distributed through manufacturing firms. A designer comes up with a product, and then either tries to pitch it to an existing company or start their own. Either option takes lots of time and money and serves only to put up barriers between product designers and the end user. Then, months later, the product gets shipped to stores and online retailers, where a user can then buy it. That's a minimum of two middlemen between the designer and the user, costing both of them time and money. 
Now imagine what would happen if everyone had access to a 3D printer. The process would look something like this: 



A designer comes up with a product, then posts it online, either for free or for a small fee. 


Then, a user can download the design and print it on a 3D printer, either their own, a friend's, or maybe even some future equivalent of Kinko's.

<p>We would be happy to help, just send us a note!</p>
<p><b>How

<p>Simply multiply the number of units that you
want by the cost.  We do have discounts for 3 and 10 packs.</p>
<p><b>What
is the S-Mount mount in the videos?</b></p>
<p>These are hand made prototypes of the final design.  The
production versions will look even better as they will be created with
professional tooling.</p>
<p><b>How
long did you spend developing the S-Mount mount?</b></p>
<p>I started with the idea four years ago.  Over 45 different prototype variations, and
hundreds of designs were completed to get to this final product.</p>
<p><b>Will
the magnets hurt my tablet?</b></p>
<p>No, the magnets will not interfere with any part
of your tablet or phone and will not erase the memory.</p>
<p><b>How
much weight will this design hold?</b></p>
<p>We do not have an exact weight specification,
although we have tested the design with large 12.2” tablets and they held VERY firm.  The tablet is EXTREMELY hard to slide do to our proprietary rubber surface, yet can be removed by simply pulling outward. </p>
<p><b>Can
the tablet fall off the mount?</b></p>
<p>Anything

used this design with large 12.2” tablets, and were very aggressive in trying to
get them to “pop-off” with HARD button pressing, they stayed put with no
issues.</p>
<p><b>What

<p>We sell extra metallic adapter pads for only $4 each on

<p><b>Is
the metallic adapter pad that goes on the rear of the tablet reusable?</b></p>
<p>No.  It
uses a strong adhesive that will not hurt the tablet, but the metallic pad will bend upon removal.  We sell extra
replacement metallic adapter pads for only $4 each on Indiegogo.</p>
<p><b>What
if I move and want to remove the S-Mount?</b></p>
<p>If using the 3M double stick tape, simply use a putty knife to slowly pry it from the surface. If you screwed it to the surface, peel back the rubber and unscrew the
mount.  A small amount of patch/paint to
cover the holes and you are good to go. </p>

We just received a great review from Forbes!  Check it out here: Forbes reviews the S-Mount



""Testing showed the tablets were secure and that it was almost impossible to pull a tablet off the S-Mount when exerting downward or shear force. However, when the tablet was removed using a pealing motion it came off the mount quite easily.""
Doug Olenick - Forbes Magazine


THE INTUITIVE SLIM DOCKING STATION...The S-Mount is an easy way to wall mount, use, and show off any tablet or smart phone.  Remove your device instantly, then slip it into your favorite carrying case. With super easy installation, you can quickly free your home from clutter.





How easy is it to install?  VERY easy!  Check out the installation in under a minute!






Our VERY high strength Neodymium magnets are located behind the rubber face, these grab onto the thin metal adapter that is attached to the tablet (This will not hurt the tablet).  The rubber face protects the tablet from scratching, but also provides the benefit of keeping the tablet from sliding, or being easily moved from side-to-side, up or down...yet it can be pulled straight outward.

The metallic pad that is attached to the rear of the tablet is very thin (so you can use your carrying case).  It is attached to the tablet with 3M double sided adhesive, this is very strong and will not fall off, yet it can be removed if desired.  The metallic pad is attracted to the magnets in the wall plate, which holds the two together.








Looks like a wall plate

Designed to blend easily into any home, the finished installation is a very clean appearance.





Super Thin!


The S-Mount is easily installed on any surface, allowing control where you want.  At only 1/4” thick, the tablet looks like is floating just slightly off the wall, for a very clean appearance. 



Tablet can go in any direction

The high power magnets, combined with the custom rubber face, allows the panel to be placed at any angle and then easily rotated.




Super Safe, your tablet will NOT fall off!



A custom rubber face protects your device from slipping and keeps it in place, plus it's easy to clean. 





Mount Anywhere, even on a mirror!


The options for attaching your tablet are endless.  






Fits ANY tablet or smart phone!




Continue to use your favorite case!

<h2>Rebel or Conform.</h2>
<p>Ever looked at those incredible RAW video cameras and dreamed of using one? I think everyone who has seen the footage coming out of those cameras has felt the same way. But, one look at the price, and you begin to realize that it's way out of reach for the rest of us in the 99%.</p>
<p>Recently, some reasonably priced cameras have made a lot of news, because of their low price and great quality. But trying to obtain one is a different matter.

<p><strong>How is this possible?</strong></p>
<p>All cameras are basically made of three parts: a lens, a camera sensor, and a processor that converts the images into files that you can view and edit. Building a RAW camera is simply a matter of replicating that process.</p>
<p>We take a machine vision camera (a fancy name for industrial cameras) and mate it with a fast, wide angle lens, and route the output from the camera to your choice of computer. Yes a computer...but you wont find this to be a problem - the cables we are using can be upwards of 30 feet long!</p>
<p>Our camera captures the RAW data, then the capture application on the computer debayers it...and produces DNG files that can be edited in Davinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere, Final Cut, or Lightroom.</p>
<p><strong>There has to me more, right?</strong></p>
<p>Sensor choice and lens choice are the reasons that this fundraiser is happening. We have seen footage from the manufacturer...and we know the two sensors we are candidating for our prototype are fantastic. In this initial fundraiser, we are seeking to complete the budget prototype. If our goal is totally blown away, we will add a sensor for testing that costs an additionl $500, as well as adding a miniature pc (4""x4"") that mounts to the camera monitor to be used as a capture device, so you can be as mobile as possible. You are going to have to deal with some sort of cable, but as we said, a 30 to 45 foot cable gives you a lot of flexibility, and the smaller overall size of the camera itself will have great advantages when being rigged on motorized sliders or remote controlled gimbal mounts.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>How You Can Help and What's In It for You.</strong></p>

Ever looked at those incredible RAW video cameras and dreamed of using one? I think everyone who has seen the footage coming out of those cameras has felt the same way. But, one look at the price, and you begin to realize that it's way out of reach for the rest of us in the 99%.

<strong>What Can BodyWave Do for You?</strong> </h3>
<p>Your brain is the most powerful and valuable asset you possess. Everything in our lives is governed by the brain. Everything. It's our <em>inner universe™. </em>Yet we can't control it when we're under stress, distracted, or overhwelmed.

<p>This is just the beginning! We're developing apps to turn your cell phone on or off by mind alone. External control of home electronics is just around the corner as well -- all from your brain and off the wrist!</p>
<p>We also think that 3D control on X, Y, and Z axises are just around the corner too. Think: forward, back, left, right, up, and down. Think it and it's done.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Story &amp; Where We Are Today</strong></h3>
<p>As a former educator, I dedicated myself to finding a solution for people with attention deficit or ADHD. In my quest for a solution, I discovered that NASA was using brain wave feedback technology to train astronauts to achieve better attention on long missions. Over 11 years, our focused team enhanced the feedback technology and constructed many prototype units to develop Play Attention, a complete education attention training system that has improved the lives of thousands of people worldwide.</p>
<p>We've had a lot of momentum with the Play Attention system. Professionals use it in doctors’ offices, psychologists' offices, traumatic brain injury hospitals, universities, schools, homes, and learning centers. In recent years, special versions utilizing the BodyWave arm band have been developed for specific industries and applications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>NASA</li>
<li>NASCAR</li>
<li>The nuclear power industry</li>
<li>Educational training for ADHD</li>
<li>Olympic teams</li>
</ul><p>These projects are just the tip of the iceberg! </p>
<h3><strong>Project Goals</strong></h3>
<p>The use of headsets in monitoring brain waves has been around for decades, but no one wants to wear a silly headset to interface with their computer, smart phone, or tablet.</p>
<p>Making brain wave monitoring usable and discreet has been a tremendous challenge and the greatest barrier to ubiquitous use. We saw a critical challenge in producing a body-based brain monitor. We did it with BodyWave, an armband or ankle worn device that monitors brain activity through the body. Its industrial design doesn’t get us to the critical level of making it discreet and usable by everyone.</p>
<p>So, our challenge is to miniaturize our industrial model down to a wristband device that will control applications on one’s iPhone, PC, Android, or tablet via Bluetooth. We can already do this with our industrial model, but mass producing the wristband is obviously the next step to brain/computer interfaces and the future of human/machine computer use. </p>

<li>Want to control animations on your iPhone or Android? Can do!</li>
<li>Train your brain for peak performance? Absolutely!</li>
<li>Data tracking to guide you to your personal goals? You bet!</li>
<li>Meditate? Control stress? It’s all at your fingertips – or should we say wrist!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>The BodyWave Solution </strong></h3>
<p>BodyWave is a wristband brainwave monitor that allows you to control apps and games on your iPhone, Android, or PC all by mind alone. It also teaches you to  reduce stress, improve memory and even pay attention! To do this, BodyWave monitors your brainwaves in real-time and sends them to your smart phone or tablet via Bluetooth. These data are translated into apps showing you how well your brain is performing and also translates your brainwaves into instructions to interact with apps on your iOS or Android device.</p>
<h3><em>Real time brain activity through the body</em></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freerlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ScreenShotMonitorApp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your brain is your most valuable asset. Brain fitness is as important or more important than physical fitness. Here's what's cool about BodyWave: every time you use BodyWave with one of our applications, you’re strengthening your brain. Your mind faster, stronger, more focused, and able to do things you never thought imaginable. All of our apps record your data to provide you with easy to read progress reports for continued success.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>BodyWave measures electrical activity in the brain commonly referred to as brain waves. The brain continuously produces four or more distinct speeds or frequencies of brain waves. Although these different brain waves are produced simultaneously and in combination, a person’s state of consciousness depends on the dominant (strongest) frequency band at each time. These brain waves are a wealth of information.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/HN76mkoiwqI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""In the Lab""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freerlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/VidplayerLink.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></a></p>
<p>BodyWave uses 3 little sensors to monitor the tiny electrical outputs generated by your brain’s activity even though it's far away from you brain.  You don't wear a silly looking headset you wouldn't get caught dead in!</p>
<p>Think heart rate monitor when you go jogging. Now think brain monitor as you work, play, or relax. As your brain shifts between states like attention, stress,  and relaxation, BodyWave's algorithms show you those changes in real time, just like a heart rate monitor can provide information about your physical activity. Just as you use a heart rate monitor to improve your fitness, BodyWave can help you improve your brain fitness. And much more.</p>
<p> The fact that no intrusive or invasive headset must be worn to collect brain activity makes BodyWave incredibly useful to achieve peak performance, meditation, or to use it with one’s Droid or iPhone totally discretely -- even while sitting on a crowded train -- if we move it to the wristband form factor.</p>

<strong>The BodyWave Team</strong> </h3>
<p>Peter Freer, MEd, BSEd, created, patented, and produced BodyWave technology. U.S. Patent No. 8,209,004 on June 26, 2012. Mr. Freer has presented at the National Space Society on behalf of NASA. He has also presented the technology to the International Atomic Energy Agency at the United Nations in Vienna, Austria. He is co-author of a white paper on human performance management with the scientists of the IAEA.</p>
<p>Our passion is to see BodyWave become the ubiquitous computer/brain interface that will optimize human performance, reduce stress, and eventually allow mental control of one’s PC, tablet, iPhone, or Android device. Freer’s work in the fields of ADHD and human performance have led to many features in the media.</p>

<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Right now the system is more expensive than it should be for ubiquitous use. We understand that we must have a grass roots movement to improve the technology, make it less expensive, and introduce it to the public for ubiquitous use. While the sports arm band is a vast improvement over awkward headsets, we want the BodyWave’s benefits to be available to everyone. The future of BodyWave brain to computer interface is to place the technology into every electronic device that interacts with humans from automobiles to televisions. </p>
<h3>
<strong>What Will Your Pledges Be Used for?</strong> </h3>
<p>We are going to take the arm band and miniaturize it to a wristband form factor. This will allow you to wear the BodyWave more frequently, even less intrusively and it will be better suited to a wide range of activities and environments.</p>
<p>We will reduce the costs of the unit by designing it for mass production and utilization of less expensive off the shelf parts where appropriate.

<p>There are many charities that use soccer as a tool for social change, but unfortunately many of us soccer players are completely unaware of them and their amazing work. From Africa to right in our own backyards, they are working on preventing the spread of HIV, ending homelessness and many other worthy causes... all via the universal vehicle of soccer.</p>
<p>So for us, making every game count takes on a whole new meaning: what if every soccer player could have a social impact while playing the game they love so much?</p>

<p>Mehdi, Jeremy and PG</p>
<p>We are a team of 3 co-founders, amazing interns and countless hardcore supporters, all passionate about soccer, design and technology. You will always find us either playing soccer on the San Francisco fields (or around the world actually), engaging with users, supporting amazing charities and their causes or hard at work building Jogabo at our <a href=""http://www.parisoma.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: #00abea; font-weight: normal;"">PARISOMA</a> co-working space.</p>
<p>We have played the game since we were kids, worked in soccer and founded previous soccer startups. We have built websites, mobile apps and even physical products, from a simple bottle opener, a sports team organization app, to part of a space station coupling mechanism. But what we are passionate about is soccer, so we decided to dedicate our lives to making the game more beautiful.</p>

<p>For the past year, we have met players face to face, from the townships of Cape town, the parks of London, the canchas of Madrid, the streets of Buenos Aires, all the way to good old San Francisco. We have already built multiple working prototypes on the web and we just completed an HTML5 version of the app that we use to test and iterate feature ideas. The design of the app is now 95% complete so we are pretty much ready to go.</p>
<p>We have quit our respective jobs and put in all of our personal funds into this project. Our lives have basically revolved around Jogabo since we started. We have been at it all day, every day pretty much. We wouldn’t have done it if we weren’t passionate but we need your help now.</p>

<p>We plan on launching the native apps in January but our backers will able to start using the HTML5 app in Beta at the end of the campaign. Here is what we have left on our plate before then:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""padding: 6px 0;"">Iphone and Android native app development - We are going to integrate our HTML5 app, on both IOS and Android so you can download it from you phone store and leverage some native features like push notifications, access to your phone camera or contact book.</li>
<li style=""padding: 6px 0;"">Performance improvement of the app - we want it to be snappy and quick because like most people we don't like to wait.</li>
<li style=""padding: 6px 0;"">Full coverage testing to reduce future bugs - this is nerds stuff but we have to get it done so that nothing breaks in the future.</li>
<li style=""padding: 6px 0;"">Broader support for other platforms for the mobile version. Right now it looks pretty good in Safari mobile and most Android browsers but we need to make sure it works on most other browsers like Chrome and Firefox.</li>
<li style=""padding: 6px 0;"">UI/UX Design iterations to improve the user experience. Some of the flows require more user testing to get them just right, and here what we really need is more ""real world"" testing. These will be small details but it's what makes the difference.</li>

<div id=""q01"">
<b>When is the app going live?</b>
<p>The official launch of the native iOS and Android App is planned for January. This will be the basic version for our initial goal. That said, our Indiegogo backers will get early access to the HTML5 (mobile web) version as soon as the campaign is over if we reach our initial goal. This won’t have all the features yet but pretty much everything you will need to use it and get the experience.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q02"">
<b>What phones will it be available for?</b>
<p>The money raised from the initial goal on Indiegogo will allow us to build a native App for iOS and Android. But since we are also building a mobile web version, you’ll be able to access it from any devices (windows phone, blackberry...) through your browser and it will feel just like that app, with a few things missing. We are building it with the latest phone capabilities in mind and are really pushing the limits of these technologies so it might not be as snappy on some of the older phones.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q03"">
<b>How much will the app cost?</b>
<p>You are going to like this one.....absolutely nothing. It’s free! Not that we think it is worth $0 but we believe that access to the core of the app functionality should stay open to all. In the future though, we will add some premium features to the app which will only be available for paying customers.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q04"">
<b>Will I be able to access the app from my computer?</b>
<p>Kind of… you will be able to interact with the game page, handle your RSVPs and perform some sharing from your computer when opening invitation links via email. It will be a bit like Instagram at the beginning but this is for the short term. We do have plans for a more complete website later on.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q05"">
<b>Will this be available in my city?</b>
<p>Heck yeah. It will be available worldwide, just like Foursquare. You will be able to add your own venues/fields wherever you are in the world.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q06"">
<b>It looks like it’s all in English for now. Will it be available in other languages?</b>
<p>We are building it in English but it’s ready for multi-language support. All we need is to translate it and make sure it all looks good so Spanish, French and Portuguese will be next up pretty quickly. We actually built an application that will help us crowdsource the translation of the app so if you feel like helping… giddy up!</p>
</div>
<div id=""q07"">
<b>What's the difference between HTML5 and iOS/Android native app?</b>
<p>An HTML5 app is essentially a web app built with JavaScript, to allow the app to perform dynamically. It works interactively to make it feel like an ""app"", but it is running in a web browser. Because it is running in a browser, it has some limitation on what the app is capable of doing, and can not access some api (push notifications, contact book, ...).</p>
<p>A native app is an app written to a specific platform like iOS or Android. Native apps have access to all the features exposed by the native APIs, which is typically most of the functionality of the device. It is ""Native"" because the code you write is essentially written for that platform.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q08"">
<b>What if nobody is playing around me with Jogabo? What if there are no game organized in my city on the App?</b>
<p>Don’t worry, the whole idea behind the new app is that it can be used even if you are the only one using it in your city. You will be able to track your activity and stats of the games you are already playing in, just like when you Check-in on Foursquare. You can also invite your friends easily so you can banter with them and maybe whoever organizes your games can start setting them up using the app. If you are in this situation, you should be proud. It means you are a pioneer and you will have started the local community in your city.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q09"">
<b>Will I be able to use it even if I play in a league or a club?</b>
<p>Yep. Every game! The idea is that it lets you track all your soccer activity so you can look back and discover all sorts of playing habits and stats.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q10"">
<b>How will the stats thing work?</b>
<p>Some stats will need to be entered manually (the number of goals you scored for instance) but we are working hard to make it really easy and fun to do so. Some will be tracked automatically, and some will be tracked as you play but you will have to wait and see to learn more about this last past… Ooooh the secret stretch goals ;)</p>
</div>
<div id=""q11"">
<b>What about the goalkeepers and defender?</b>
<p>Jeremy himself is a goalie, so rest assured we didn’t forget about this. There are other stats that are relevant for players in those positions like “WDL ratios”, “Goals for/against” and we are always open to suggestions for more as we keep improving the product (clean sheets?). We have talked about a “Fantasy style” point system as well but one step at a time.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q12"">
<b>Won’t people just cheat and lie about their stats?</b>
<p>Like any system, it can be gamed. The way we see it is that most people will use it to track their real stats and compete with their friends and most people don’t lie to themselves or their friends. We weren’t going to sacrifice the user experience just to prevent some outliers from cheating but there are some things we will be able to do in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q13"">
<b>How will you measure “hustle”?</b>
<p>Hush, hush for now... Keep an eye open for the stretch goals!</p>
</div>
<div id=""q14"">
<b>I couldn't care less about stats. Why would I want to keep track of them?</b>
<p>Fair enough but we think this app might change your mind actually. Friendly competition is a great way to motivate yourself and we will try to make it fun. Once you get your first MVP/MOTM, you will see, it gets a little bit addictive.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q15"">
<b>Is this only going to be for soccer?</b>
<p>Yeah, that’s right... soccer only. We want to make it awesome for one sport not so-so for a bunch of them. There are many other reasons for our choice and we will write a blog post about them soon.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q17"">
<b>How do you pronounce Jogabo?</b>
<p>Give it a try!</p>
</div>
<div id=""q18"">
<b>I love your project, but don’t have much money to pledge, how can I help?</b>
<p>We surely could use your help to spread the word to your friends and on social networks by sharing the link of the campaign. If you are up for more, we’ve actually put together an ambassador program so you can help throughout the campaign. Check it out here <a href=""http://bombonera.jogabo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: #00abea; font-weight: normal;"" target=""blank"">http://bombonera.jogabo.com</a></p>
</div>
<div id=""q19"">
<b>I don’t really play soccer, why should I fund your campaign?</b>
<p>Our mission goes beyond soccer. In an era when everything is digital and happens online, we want to bring people together in the real world. We believe that our app can improve the lives of people by making them more social and healthy. We also support and work closely with charities supporting causes such as homelessness, HIV/AIDS, education… We believe that our app will empower players to help raise awareness and funds for such charities through their playing.</p>
</div>
<div id=""q20"">
<b>What is Indiegogo?</b>
<p>Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform. Here is a simplistic way of explaining it:</p>
<p>We have a cool project that we dedicated time and money to get where we are. We need financial support to complete it. You like our project. You make a pledge to support us. You pick a cool reward in exchange. We finalize our App. We launch it. We send you the reward you chose. We thank you for making it possible (because you are awesome!). You feel part of the adventure and made a difference.</p>

Jogabo is like “Foursquare meets Nike+"" for soccer.

Our mission at Jogabo is to inspire and empower the world to play soccer, in an exciting and social new way...
Jogabo provides you with insights about you and your friends’ soccer playing activity, your stats and the overall soccer community around you.
It makes soccer an entirely new social experience, inspiring you to play more and encouraging you to join unique games you would otherwise be unaware of.
We want to make the game more BEAUTIFUL and more SOCIAL, the way we believe it was meant to be and take it even further.





Why should we stay so blind about our playing history? Why should we only depend on a few friends to play? Why should we limit ourselves to certain playing days and times? Why should we feel obliged to join leagues to guarantee ourselves regular playing time?





Whether you record your stats in an organized game in the app or you simply check-in to any game you already play in, Jogabo will let you track all your games and stats.

You no longer have to be a pro-athlete to get your stats. Jogabo lets you track your activity and stats so you can visualize your performance and record all your soccer history. Just like being in the MLS, EPL or in a World Cup.

Log your practices, games with friends, random pickups or even league games you play in. Our main check-in feature makes logging your games and stats quick and easy. Before you know it, you’ll have a complete picture of your soccer playing history.



For the first time you are going to have access to a complete picture of your playing history. Jogabo allows you to analyze that history and discover playing habits you would otherwise never know about.

Use the Jogabo insights out of simple curiosity to discover some fun facts about your game. Or use it to compare your stats against past performances, see your progress and achieve personal goals. Are you on a goal scoring streak? What is the most consecutive weeks you have played in a row? How is your hustle evolving?




A little friendly competition can be just the thing to keep you on your toes and keep you motivated to play. Bring your friends, teammates and other players in on the fun by connecting with them on Jogabo even if they are not playing in the same games or even in the same city. Compare stats, share progress, and cheer each other on.

Soon you’ll be able to set your groups and your leaderboard will keep you all on your toes, so you’ll always know how you stack up, no matter where you play.
Friends will help keep you motivated. Stoke the competition by sending direct messages.



When you're looking for a game, Jogabo shows you personalized game recommendations or players looking to play based on your friends and your playing history.

When traveling, discover the best places to play and immediately take part in the local community. Find the most relevant game for you wherever you are based on your current location.

Everywhere you go there are hundreds or game happening, plenty of which missing players. You are just not aware of them, even when your friends are playing in them. The app will notify you when games around you are missing players or when your friends are playing.




The beautiful game is all about the people you play with. Follow your friends and players you enjoyed playing with so you can keep up to date with their activities and banter with them even when they are in other cities.

When you had a good game, you want the world to know about it! We’ll already share your achievement in real-time to your followers but with your permission, we will also allow you to push it out to your social networks. 100th goal celebration anyone?

Find out when people you follow or have already played with join games or are looking for extra players. Suddenly, all sorts of new playing opportunities are right there for you to take advantage of.



SO EASY, GAMES ALMOST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES !

Celebrate your progress and stay motivated by earning Jogabo badges for daily, weekly, even lifetime achievements. When you achieve a new goal, or your activity is extra impressive, we’ll award you with a badge! Score.
Knowing how close you are to reaching your goals gives you the motivation to reach them and aim higher.
To start, pledge now and get the Early Backer Badge on your profile in the App so that everyone knows that Jogabo exist because of you!

The backer badge will be placed near your headshot on your profile and in other places around the app. It is a little bit like the “verified” on Twitter and Facebook.



Early notification (Think Speedy boarding on airplanes)When a new public game is created, an spot opens up in a game in your area or someone drops out of a game where you are on the waiting list for, you will receive a notification before non premium members.

More detailed statsYou will get to compare your stats back for longer period of times. We will also give you an in depth breakdown analysis of your stats (find out who you play with the most, who you tend to win or lose with, how your stats look like by position or field size...).

Get an early access to all our new features!We will be rolling out improvements and new features on an ongoing basis. Being a premium member will give you early access to all of those as they come out. You will even be able to give us early feedback and actually shape the future of the app.

So keep an eye out here as we will describe other premium features when we unlock new stretch goals.

Remember back in the days when Facebook was only available to a few Universities? Well while the others will be talking about Jogabo on Facebook and Twitter, you will have it in your hands and you will be taking it out for a spin.

GET THE EARLY ACCESSWE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE JOGABO
As part of the deal, you will be allowed to invite your friends to the app and really establish yourself as an early adopter.
The app won’t be 100% finished and there will be things that aren’t just like we would like them but that’s part of the excitement. You will actually see things before they are finished and you will be able to influence how the features will work.




There are many charities that use soccer as a tool for social change, but unfortunately many of us soccer players are completely unaware of them and their amazing work. From Africa to right in our own backyards, they are working on preventing the spread of HIV, ending homelessness and many other worthy causes... all via the universal vehicle of soccer.
So for us, making every game count takes on a whole new meaning: what if every soccer player could have a social impact while playing the game they love so much?

That’s why we are making it possible for you to dedicate the games you play and your stats to a cause. We see this as a way for you to become an ambassador for some of these charities and to raise awareness about them to your followers on the App and your friends on social networks.



We are building Jogabo for the entire soccer community. For the casual player looking for a kickaround and in need of motivation, but also the competitive player always looking to play more and to keep track of their progress. Whether you are just a player or the guy that always organizes. Whether you play pickup, casual games with friends or regular league games.
Oh and did we tell you that it will be available worldwide... yeah that’s right! So go ahead and travel the world with your cleats, those games will count too. One game, one love, one community... anywhere you go!



A special “Backer” badge on your profile page in the app so that everyone knows Jogabo exists because of you. As a huge thank you, we will also add you to the list of backers on the recognition page of our website, on our Indiegogo timeline and give you a social media shoutout.
We'll give you early access to the mobile web version of the app at the end of the campaign and 2 years of premium features once we introduce them (approx. value $100).

Oh yeah, keep an eye out here as we will be introducing some pretty exciting stretch goals as we get closer to reaching our initial goal. But first let's make sure we get this project funded so we can develop the solid base of the app.




Mehdi, Jeremy and PG
We are a team of 3 co-founders, amazing interns and countless hardcore supporters, all passionate about soccer, design and technology. You will always find us either playing soccer on the San Francisco fields (or around the world actually), engaging with users, supporting amazing charities and their causes or hard at work building Jogabo at our PARISOMA co-working space.
We have played the game since we were kids, worked in soccer and founded previous soccer startups. We have built websites, mobile apps and even physical products, from a simple bottle opener, a sports team organization app, to part of a space station coupling mechanism. But what we are passionate about is soccer, so we decided to dedicate our lives to making the game more beautiful.



For the past year, we have met players face to face, from the townships of Cape town, the parks of London, the canchas of Madrid, the streets of Buenos Aires, all the way to good old San Francisco. We have already built multiple working prototypes on the web and we just completed an HTML5 version of the app that we use to test and iterate feature ideas. The design of the app is now 95% complete so we are pretty much ready to go.
We have quit our respective jobs and put in all of our personal funds into this project. Our lives have basically revolved around Jogabo since we started. We have been at it all day, every day pretty much. We wouldn’t have done it if we weren’t passionate but we need your help now.



We plan on launching the native apps in January but our backers will able to start using the HTML5 app in Beta at the end of the campaign. Here is what we have left on our plate before then:

Iphone and Android native app development - We are going to integrate our HTML5 app, on both IOS and Android so you can download it from you phone store and leverage some native features like push notifications, access to your phone camera or contact book.
Performance improvement of the app - we want it to be snappy and quick because like most people we don't like to wait.
Full coverage testing to reduce future bugs - this is nerds stuff but we have to get it done so that nothing breaks in the future.
Broader support for other platforms for the mobile version. Right now it looks pretty good in Safari mobile and most Android browsers but we need to make sure it works on most other browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
UI/UX Design iterations to improve the user experience. Some of the flows require more user testing to get them just right, and here what we really need is more ""real world"" testing. These will be small details but it's what makes the difference.




A few months ago we released a video called the Future of Soccer, and you were thousands asking us how you could get involved to help make this happen.
You were players, passionate about the beautiful game. Men and women from all over the world. You were amateurs, ex pros and even international superstars.
That’s why we are starting this Indiegogo campaign. We believe that beyond the app, Jogabo is a movement. So we wanted to make YOU part of this great journey, this adventure to change the way we play the beautiful game.

I love your project, but don’t have much money to pledge, how can I help?

What is Indiegogo?
Who made the music I can hear in all the Jogabo videos?


When is the app going live?
The official launch of the native iOS and Android App is planned for January. This will be the basic version for our initial goal. That said, our Indiegogo backers will get early access to the HTML5 (mobile web) version as soon as the campaign is over if we reach our initial goal. This won’t have all the features yet but pretty much everything you will need to use it and get the experience.


What phones will it be available for?
The money raised from the initial goal on Indiegogo will allow us to build a native App for iOS and Android. But since we are also building a mobile web version, you’ll be able to access it from any devices (windows phone, blackberry...) through your browser and it will feel just like that app, with a few things missing. We are building it with the latest phone capabilities in mind and are really pushing the limits of these technologies so it might not be as snappy on some of the older phones.


How much will the app cost?
You are going to like this one.....absolutely nothing. It’s free! Not that we think it is worth $0 but we believe that access to the core of the app functionality should stay open to all. In the future though, we will add some premium features to the app which will only be available for paying customers.


Will I be able to access the app from my computer?
Kind of… you will be able to interact with the game page, handle your RSVPs and perform some sharing from your computer when opening invitation links via email. It will be a bit like Instagram at the beginning but this is for the short term. We do have plans for a more complete website later on.


Will this be available in my city?
Heck yeah. It will be available worldwide, just like Foursquare. You will be able to add your own venues/fields wherever you are in the world.


It looks like it’s all in English for now. Will it be available in other languages?
We are building it in English but it’s ready for multi-language support. All we need is to translate it and make sure it all looks good so Spanish, French and Portuguese will be next up pretty quickly. We actually built an application that will help us crowdsource the translation of the app so if you feel like helping… giddy up!


What's the difference between HTML5 and iOS/Android native app?
An HTML5 app is essentially a web app built with JavaScript, to allow the app to perform dynamically. It works interactively to make it feel like an ""app"", but it is running in a web browser. Because it is running in a browser, it has some limitation on what the app is capable of doing, and can not access some api (push notifications, contact book, ...).
A native app is an app written to a specific platform like iOS or Android. Native apps have access to all the features exposed by the native APIs, which is typically most of the functionality of the device. It is ""Native"" because the code you write is essentially written for that platform.


What if nobody is playing around me with Jogabo? What if there are no game organized in my city on the App?
Don’t worry, the whole idea behind the new app is that it can be used even if you are the only one using it in your city. You will be able to track your activity and stats of the games you are already playing in, just like when you Check-in on Foursquare. You can also invite your friends easily so you can banter with them and maybe whoever organizes your games can start setting them up using the app. If you are in this situation, you should be proud. It means you are a pioneer and you will have started the local community in your city.


Will I be able to use it even if I play in a league or a club?
Yep. Every game! The idea is that it lets you track all your soccer activity so you can look back and discover all sorts of playing habits and stats.


How will the stats thing work?
Some stats will need to be entered manually (the number of goals you scored for instance) but we are working hard to make it really easy and fun to do so. Some will be tracked automatically, and some will be tracked as you play but you will have to wait and see to learn more about this last past… Ooooh the secret stretch goals ;)


What about the goalkeepers and defender?
Jeremy himself is a goalie, so rest assured we didn’t forget about this. There are other stats that are relevant for players in those positions like “WDL ratios”, “Goals for/against” and we are always open to suggestions for more as we keep improving the product (clean sheets?). We have talked about a “Fantasy style” point system as well but one step at a time.


Won’t people just cheat and lie about their stats?
Like any system, it can be gamed. The way we see it is that most people will use it to track their real stats and compete with their friends and most people don’t lie to themselves or their friends. We weren’t going to sacrifice the user experience just to prevent some outliers from cheating but there are some things we will be able to do in the future.


How will you measure “hustle”?
Hush, hush for now... Keep an eye open for the stretch goals!


I couldn't care less about stats. Why would I want to keep track of them?
Fair enough but we think this app might change your mind actually. Friendly competition is a great way to motivate yourself and we will try to make it fun. Once you get your first MVP/MOTM, you will see, it gets a little bit addictive.


Is this only going to be for soccer?
Yeah, that’s right... soccer only. We want to make it awesome for one sport not so-so for a bunch of them. There are many other reasons for our choice and we will write a blog post about them soon.


How do you pronounce Jogabo?
Give it a try!


I love your project, but don’t have much money to pledge, how can I help?
We surely could use your help to spread the word to your friends and on social networks by sharing the link of the campaign. If you are up for more, we’ve actually put together an ambassador program so you can help throughout the campaign. Check it out here http://bombonera.jogabo.com


I don’t really play soccer, why should I fund your campaign?
Our mission goes beyond soccer. In an era when everything is digital and happens online, we want to bring people together in the real world. We believe that our app can improve the lives of people by making them more social and healthy. We also support and work closely with charities supporting causes such as homelessness, HIV/AIDS, education… We believe that our app will empower players to help raise awareness and funds for such charities through their playing.


What is Indiegogo?
Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform. Here is a simplistic way of explaining it:
We have a cool project that we dedicated time and money to get where we are. We need financial support to complete it. You like our project. You make a pledge to support us. You pick a cool reward in exchange. We finalize our App. We launch it. We send you the reward you chose. We thank you for making it possible (because you are awesome!). You feel part of the adventure and made a difference.


Who made the music I can hear in all the Jogabo videos?
It's our dear friend Allure, an electro producer from Paris. You can listen to his album on iTunes and find him on Facebook.

Of course there are sever tracking devices out there but the one developed works on three technologies. The technologies are WiFi, GSM (like your mobile phone) and GPS. Why three different technologies? We wanted our products be more than just lost luggage from the airlines. We wanted to be a means of tracking you loved ones when they go off on an adventure where there is no cell communication. We wanted to make it possible to track your belongings if you sea freighted around the world. We also wanted to make it possible for two or more adventure seekers to find each other if they got separated simply by exchanging serial numbers in the app. KONAS is much more than tracking your luggage with the airlines.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/742940/files/20140725033710-TEAM3.jpg?1406284630"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>As well as the tracking chip we also had to develop a waterproof case to house the chip, artificial intelligence that would allow the chip to decide which technology to use and also to turn it's self off while in flight to meet FAA regulations.

We also had to design the luggage and backpacks in such a way that the tracing device is safe and secure and also easy to reach for  recharging the 60 day life battery, while maintaining the standard of ultralight gear.</p><p></p><p></p>
<h1><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h1>
<p></p><p>Where does all the money go? Let us answer that but first let me
tell you where KONAS is today.</p>
<p>We
now have our full production facility for both the tracking chip and the
luggage. We have two distribution centers, our main plant in Riga, Latvia and
our distribution center in Dubai, UAE.</p>
<p>The
money we are seeking now will go directly to finishing the application for your
smartphone, mobile device and desktop. Why does it take 50,000 to build an
application? It doesn't! We ran the production margins thin so that we could
bring you the best perks at the best price. This means that many more perks
must be taken so that we can reach our development cost, not to mention the
taxes and other cost associated with fund raising. We also did not want to put
ourselves in a situation where we offer perks that are financially impossible
to execute on. </p><p>Here is the breakdown:</p><p>$30,000 - Goes to completing and testing the APP</p><p>$20,000 - Goes to fulfilling the perks</p>
<p>So
what do you get? When you purchase a set of luggage from KONAS this will
literally be the last set of luggage you will ever purchase. We have spent a
lot of time developing our luggage and we are the only company confident enough
to offer a double lifetime warranty. See our FaQ's. You will also be the only
people to have this model. After our campaign we are destroying the molds so
this is a very limited edition model.</p>
<p>What
about backpacks? We have developed super strong, light weight gear. We are all
backpackers and travelers at KONAS (except our IT guy ;) but we love him
anyway) we know what is necessary and how much abuse these packs will take. We
offer a 5 year warranty on our backpacks, all of our backpacks feature rip stop,
most with hydration systems and ultralight material.</p>
<p>What
else? You will be getting KONAS products at a highly discounted price for this
campaign. We will not offer these prices again. This pricing structure is set
up for us to finalize our products and ship to you! All of the items that we
offer on this page are limited edition. They will also sport the Indigogo logo
so you can always remember that you were a founding member of KONAS. </p>
<p>Here
is the big one. The application. We are going to try and keep this a free
service although the cost of purchasing data packages through carriers is very
expensive. Our chips constantly ping GSM towers and satellites depending on the
situation which combined with several thousand devices doing this at the same
time equals a pretty big data plan! For those who helped KONAS to get to the
final stage of production and delivery, you will receive this service free for
life unconditionally. Even if we have to make it paid service in the future,
you will still have it free.</p>
<p>You
will also remain our our founder’s page life. We will not take this page down
it is our way of thank you and staying humble by remembering how we reached
this level. 1-65$ you will be listed on our bronze section, 150-400$ you will
be listed as a gold founder and everything above 400$ you will be listed as a
platinum founder!</p><p></p>
<h1><b>The Truth</b></h1>
<p>In 2012 the airlines
were responsible for losing more than 26,000,000 pieces of luggage.</p>
<p>2 years later that
number has increased to 40,000,000 by the year 2019 the number of bags lost but
the airlines is expected to reach in excess of 70,000,000.</p>
<p>The problem is
worsening and costing the airline industry a total of $2.6 billion just to
track down the owners. This is a direct influence in the rising cost of airline
travel.</p>
<p>The stress and cost
impact on the airline passengers is something that you cannot put a number too.
The feeling of not having your luggage or even not knowing where it is can be
terrifying.</p>
<h1><b>What's the Risk</b></h1>
<p></p><p>We have spent that last two years in R&amp;D to get to this
point and minimize the risk.</p>
<p>Is
there still a risk? Yes. </p>
<p>With
any venture there is inherent risk. The risks we face are not getting the
funding which will not stop us but will add a tremendous amount of time to our
development time.</p>
<p>If
we do reach our funding goal our biggest risk is, not delivering on time. In
software development you can always run into a snag. We have mitigated this
risk by employing some brilliant minds from Harvard and MIT. We will keep you
informed the whole step of the way. If we reach our goal we will deliver on our
promise no matter what it takes. We take our reputation very seriously not to
mention our future.</p>
<p>As
far as production is concerned. We already have our production line set up and
capable of producing several thousand pieces of luggage per month.  We
will limit our limited edition run to only those who support us on
Indigogo. </p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<p>To
finish the application and software we need three months which puts us in
November. The luggage, backpacks and tracking chip will take us 50 days, which
we will run simultaneously with the software development. We are shooting to
have everything delivered by Christmas this Year! Is it worth the wait? Yes if
you want the best gear on the planet with the best warranty on the planet!</p><p></p>

of you out there may have seen or maybe even already have a battery back up
power supply for your phone.  The problem most of the time is that they
are big, heavy and an extra thing to carry around that is just not practical to
have with you at all times.  In addition, they normally have all these
cables you carry with you to make sure you can connect it to your phone.
 If you forget or lose your cable, you are still without power!  
Well, we set out to make a COMPACT, EASY TO USE, SLEEK and JUST PLAIN SEXY
On-The-Go charger that you wouldn’t even know was in your pocket till you need
it. No extra wires to make it fit your phone.. just plug it into your phone at
the time you need it most for a boost of power to get you through that
important moment when you need your phone most! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/199217/files/20131115043715-PowerPebble-SalesSheet1a.jpg?1384519035"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

MyPowerPebble over others? </b></p>
<p>Like
many of you, we have purchased other products that have back up power for our
phones but found that for one reason or another, we did not carry them with us.
It doesn't matter if its because its too big, bulky, ugly, heavy, or have too
many parts you can lose, the point is.. you don't have them with you so they
can not do what they are intended to do!  MyPowerPebble is that perfect
balance of Sleek &amp; Stylish Compact Design with the right amount
of power to get you through the important times when you need it most.
 Why? Because you will have it with you, since it’s small and comfortable

fantastic product that will be used as intended! </p>

The Fayetteville Free Library is excited to offer a new public service—the FFL Fab Lab. What exactly is a fab lab? According to Neil Gershenfeld, the Director of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms and author of Fab: the Coming Revolution on Your Desktop-From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication, a fab lab is “a collection of commercially available machines and parts linked by software and processes developed for making things (Gershenfeld, 12).” At the foundation of the FFL's Fab Lab will be a MakerBot Thing-o-Matic 3D printer, made available to the library through a generous donation from Express Computer Services.
The Impact
Over the past fifty years, the manner in which we process information has changed. New technological developments have changed the way we interact with information, allowing us to become ""creators"" rather than just ""consumers."" There are few places that currently provide FREE community access to new, innovative creation technology like 3D printers. The public library provides a safe and accessible space where anyone in the community can interact, understand and develop through use of this technology.The FFL is encouraging local innovation, collaboration, and education through offering this new public service. We are documenting the process so that other libraries across the country can replicate it, making their own free, public access Fab Labs.
What We Need
We are asking for $20,000. This money will go towards purchasing more technology for the FFL Fab Lab (more MakerBot's, a CNC Router, Lazor Cutter, and MAC Lab), ABS plastic for our MakerBot (to help keep this service FREE for the public), as well as bring in experts to give lectures and share their experience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a small team with a dream. We wish to start an AFFORDABLE 3d printing service. A 3d printing service is a website and/or company that accepts 3d files and uses 3d printers to build a physical model of the object that you can touch and hold. There are many 3d printing services online but none of them are reasonably priced. Because it is such a neat Idea and there are a small enough amount of them to keep the demand high, they are able to charge exorbitantly high fees for their services. We plan on charging little more than the cost for the plastic to make the models out of. On another note, I have wished for a personal 3d printer for a very long time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>If we make our $2500 goal it will go to:</p>
<p>$2000 for 2 3d printers</p>
<p>$500 to have a website designed to sell services from</p>
<p>$1500 is the bare minimum we can make it on. Plastic to make the models from will cost us at least $20 a pound and to keep up with demand we would have to get additional printers so <strong>the higher over the goal we can get, the better</strong>! $5000 would be wonderful, 10,000 even better.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will explore alternate routes to getting the necissary funds. Your contributions will be used to supplement those funds if it comes to that. All backers will have the option of recieving a one time email letting them know when the website is up (this doesnt mean monthly and this doesnt mean we will give it out. You will recieve ONE email if you choose to).</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>We're Mario and Dennis, and we are making Zoftilo Voice Chat. </strong>If you're reading this, you have probably used some, or many of the available voice chat software today. Some better some worse. Our main goal with this project, is to create a voice chat client and server, that is easy to use, free for personal usage, and at a minimum capable of running on <strong>Linux</strong>, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We are two swedish guys developing softare on our spare time. We simply love playing online games, as well as developing games and applications. We have used many ""VOIP"" voice over IP applications over the years. And of course rented servers for our gaming needs. Sometimes ending up abit frustrated, not able to find a simple solution working on several platforms. We wish people to be able to play games and collaborate in any project, while talking to their friends using the <strong>operating system of their choice!</strong> It's also very important to us, to support Linux as a viable gaming platform in the future.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<div>
<p>The money will cover our costs for hardware, development tools and keeping them up to date. This means: software, development licenses, computer hardware, and additional assets. If you are generous we will try to make Zoftilo client versions for Android and IOS. Anything extra goes into developing games for Linux and Mac OS X. If there is (against all odds) anything left after that, we will probably have to buy something nice to our very patient wifes and children, who lets us spend so many hours in the evenings, with what we love to do.</p>
<p>Planned beta release is end of may 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal with this campaign. We will still finish Zoftilo. And we will still try to finish it for as many platforms as possible. However, it will take longer, and we will not be able to make client versions for Android and IOS.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support means:</p>
<p>Helping us create Zoftilo, will not just support a free multi platform voice chat, you will also encourage and help us creating future multiplayer games for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Our long term goal, and great passion, is to <strong>make Linux known as a strong and viable gaming platform.</strong></p>

name is Derrick Samuels. I been inventing and creating tech devices and
platforms since 2004. I’m fascinated with technology and how it can benefit
people. My area of expertise is gaming, but I often venture into an array of
other technological areas. In 2012 I was working on my OTON X game console,
which can create game levels or games without programmer’s coding. So one day I
wanted to take a picture of the OTON prototype consoles from various angles. I
wanted a full 360 degree view in one continuous shot. Right at that moment I
had an idea! What if I could design a device that would hover to provide a
hands-free perspective while taking pictures or videos, support PC functions,
and just for kicks, support video augmentation and virtual reality gaming? The
OTON AyR was born! Now here’s where you come in. To reach the full 360 AyR
hover version, we must build the base model we are proposing. Today, we are
offering the OTON AyR PC for developers and early adopter units on

Fortunately, a brilliant solution is on its way.

Duo 2.0 is the only cable you ever need to help you get out of this dilemma. With the groundbreaking integration of the charging cable and a Lightning socket, Duo 2 is not just a charging cable but also an audio transmitter. You don’t need to throw the dice to choose between charging and music from now on, Duo 2 allows you to do both in one go!

There is indeed a wealth of splitters out there aimed to solve the listening and charging dilemma with the new iPhone, yet they’re far from ideal as all of them require an additional cable to make things work. Such cumbersome approach simply ruins the minimalist design of iPhone.
Compared to other adaptors and cables, Duo 2 is far more handier and portable than those on the market; not to mention it’s made out of top-notch materials. It offers you the most convenient way to charge and listen to music at the same time. With Duo 2, you can embrace the simplicity of life!""We tried it for a while and we totally loved it.

The best part: we delivered Vufine to our 1400 backers. We believe in making our technology as simple as possible to help users take advantage of their favorite devices hands-free and at an affordable price.   Introducing Vufine+Built upon the invaluable feedback from our backers, we’re back with Vufine+: the next evolution in wearable displays. Vufine+ has a larger, more versatile display and a totally redefined docking station. Like our first unit, Vufine+ is able to connect to most major smartphones, laptops, tablets, drones and cameras to provide a second monitor or mirrored display for the user. This connection is achieved through the included micro-to-full HDMI cable and, depending on the device, appropriate HDMI adaptor.    The Screen:With Vufine+ we wanted to make the screen larger and more versatile. Our first campaign taught us just how many users were connecting Vufine with tablets or with smartphones displaying in portrait. With Vufine+ we made sure that no matter what device you’ve connected you are getting the largest display possible. Display Modes:Vufine+ offers 3 different display modes to allow users to optimize the display no matter what device they are using. The new Zoom Mode has increased the size of portrait displays and 4:3 landscape displays by 77% and the new Fit Mode expands 16:9 landscape by 33% with the Standard Mode designed specifically for unaltered 16:9 viewing.

Fit: The new Fit Mode has increased landscape by 33%

Zoom: The new Zoom Mode has increased the size of portrait displays by 77%

Standard: Designed specifically for unaltered 16:9 viewing. 

The Docking Station: Lastly, we completely redesigned the docking station. We know a new, larger display is only as good as the ability to position it to comfort. The new docking station utilizes a ball joint and pivoting arm to allow users a whole new way to adjust Vufine+ to ensure the best, most comfortable viewing angle.Accessories:By retaining the shape of Vufine, we were able to make Vufine+ compatible with all of the current Vufine accessories so users are able to further personalize their viewing experience.

Simply download the Loc8er app to your mobile phone and instantly connect to your child’s Loc8er:Mobile. From here you can manage your child’s pre-set call list to ensure that they don’t receive any unwanted calls or texts and set call time limits to prevent any unexpected call charges. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li><span style="""">Set up parameters around local parks and play areas to alert you when your child leaves the area, or watch your children walk home from school or a friend's house and see that they get home safe. <br/><br/></span></li>

<li>
<p>Most importantly; fun games for children, in a cool design.
Location based games using GPS, such as treasure hunts.
Reward games for checking in at certain leisure facilities to
encourage physical activity. Interactive games with friends
and the inclusion of Oyster cards for traveling to and from
school. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>We made 15 proof-of-concept prototypes (AS SHOWN BELOW) in 2007 to prove
 the technology could co-exist (it looks more like 1977 than 2007!) 
HOWEVER!! The new designs are infinitely more futuristic.  Visit 
loc8ermobile.com where you and your kids can add to the final product 
design - we want your input!  Ultimately, you, the people, will have an

<h3>The Team</h3> <p>You've already met Dean in the Video, he's the inventor. Back in 2004 he had the idea for Loc8er after a string of child abductions in the UK. </p>

<p>We ran market research projects consisting of
focus groups, surveys and interviews to discuss issues around child safety and the need for child safety products. Although there
appeared to be plenty of devices available to service this market, parents weren’t buying the products and we wanted to
know why. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>It quickly became clear that there was a substantial market but the products available were not designed with children in mind. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The biggest criticism of all was that none of the products would directly
appeal to children, and this would limit their desire to have one. “There is nothing in it for them”. </span></p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>We set about designing the product with the help of local schools working and saving to get the product made. With the help of a few Savvy investors and brave friends we raised enough money to develop and test prototypes. <p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>During this time Loc8er picked up industry interest, and we have been fortunate enough to attract support from Siemens and network operators. <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Its a big task ahead of us, global child safety coupled with mobile phone technology has the potential to grow fast.  </span></p>

Its been a long ten years but by the skin of our teeth we have finally developed prototypes for a wearable communication device for children. 



Although it appears that there are plenty of devices available to service this market, there is nothing out there that kids would enjoy owning. We want to do something about that and have some fun! 
We were even able to secure a few patents along the way.








The Loc8er:Mobile product is designed to enable parents to have
contact with their children while at the same time addressing
concerns about mobile phone safety.





It offers voice communication to a list of pre-set numbers. Simply download the Loc8er app to your mobile phone and instantly connect to your child’s Loc8er:Mobile. From here you can manage your child’s pre-set call list to ensure that they don’t receive any unwanted calls or texts and set call time limits to prevent any unexpected call charges. 

Set up parameters around local parks and play areas to alert you when your child leaves the area, or watch your children walk home from school or a friend's house and see that they get home safe. 
Set up alerts for your child if they need you in an emergency; to either call numbers in sequence until the call is answered or call a specific family member, friend or carer if you're not going to be available. 
Activate or deactivate alerts to suit your own needs, for instance, removal alerts to tell you if the device is released, cut off or slipped off, or set timers for the device to switch off during school hours and turn back on again after school. 



Most importantly; fun games for children, in a cool design.
Location based games using GPS, such as treasure hunts.
Reward games for checking in at certain leisure facilities to
encourage physical activity. Interactive games with friends
and the inclusion of Oyster cards for traveling to and from
school. 

We made 15 proof-of-concept prototypes (AS SHOWN BELOW) in 2007 to prove
 the technology could co-exist (it looks more like 1977 than 2007!) 
HOWEVER!! The new designs are infinitely more futuristic.  Visit 
loc8ermobile.com where you and your kids can add to the final product 
design - we want your input!  Ultimately, you, the people, will have an 
input in to our design! (And by people, we mean kids!)








Progress so far
We have taken the product to network operators, they like it and want to go ahead with trials. If this is successful then we can start selling through their retail stores and they will help us provide the service. 
So now, we need to make 30 units for the trials and fund the business in getting to market. 
This is where you come in...We need to raise $10,000 to develop the product for trials with the Network Operators.  Once trials are completed, the minimum order will be 15,000 units.  This will help us to grow the business over two years of trading to the point where it has 40,000 customers.
By helping us, you can be one of the first owners (well, your children will) of a Loc8er:Mobile. 


Where the money goes
The bulk of the money will go towards designing the product that will be put forward for trials with Network Operators, with whom we have had a relationship for 10 years. 
1) Product and Software DevelopmentWe have developed and tested prototypes and now need to prepare the product for mass production and develop the software to provide the service. 
2) Prepare for LaunchWhile we complete the final version of the product we will build on our existing relationships with mobile network operators. Our projections are based on selling 40,000 units in the first three years, a single network operator could deliver this figure easily. We will encourage retailers to run pilots too. We will also be running our own trials with customers, and starting to build awareness in the marketplace.

With your support we will endeavour to have your child wearing a Loc8er:Mobile by November 2015. 

The Team You've already met Dean in the Video, he's the inventor. Back in 2004 he had the idea for Loc8er after a string of child abductions in the UK. 

















We ran market research projects consisting of
focus groups, surveys and interviews to discuss issues around child safety and the need for child safety products. Although there
appeared to be plenty of devices available to service this market, parents weren’t buying the products and we wanted to
know why. 







It quickly became clear that there was a substantial market but the products available were not designed with children in mind. The biggest criticism of all was that none of the products would directly
appeal to children, and this would limit their desire to have one. “There is nothing in it for them”. 



We set about designing the product with the help of local schools working and saving to get the product made. With the help of a few Savvy investors and brave friends we raised enough money to develop and test prototypes. 



During this time Loc8er picked up industry interest, and we have been fortunate enough to attract support from Siemens and network operators. 
Its a big task ahead of us, global child safety coupled with mobile phone technology has the potential to grow fast.  
But with thorough knowledge of the industry, the support of key backers and your help we are ready to go to the next step. 
A bit about DeanDean is ex British Parachute Regiment,  after leaving the army he spent some time as an amateur boxer, winning the England ABA Nationals (Novice) in 2001. He now teaches boxing and personal training, but Loc8er is his ultimate passion and he absolutely will not stop! 







A bit about meI was a vet nurse after leaving school, but decided to move into dog grooming so I could work for myself. I had a great Salon which I was able to sell so I could move to London. 
In London I worked in publishing in sales and marketing until Dean had the idea for Loc8er and we moved to Edinburgh to oversee the development of the product.

Risks are just related to manufacturers and lead time of components, but we have already started with the orders of the firsts parts.</p></div>","We are proud to present a small and innovative device that will allow you to double the battery life of your smartphone. Thanks to its smart electronics and its awesome design you won’t need to take care about the battery of your smartphone anymore.   Witty is a beautiful plug-in adapt to every USB charger, where behind a fresh and endearing design lies an innovative technology.With its electronic flow controller it allows you to intelligently manage the charging of your smartphone by disconnecting it via an electromechanical switch when the charge is complete, in order to preserve the useful life of your battery.                                                     
 We at Witty care about the environment and for this reason we have chosen to make it in ABS, a material that can be recycled.If only 10% of the world population would use Witty, we could obtain a reduction of thrown away batteries for 11.500 Tons a year. Here you can see the life's difference between a device charged with help of Witty and one without. Let’s make an example considering that as Apple says “A battery capacity under the threshold of the 80%” has to be changed.   With a 3000mAh battery, the annual degradation is about 12%. Damage that leads the remaining capacity to 2640mAh after one year, to about 2323mAh after two, 2044mAh after three, 1799mAh after four and to about 1583mAh after five years. On the other hand, with Witty a 3000mAh battery will get an annual degradation of only 6%. Improvement that would be reflected into the remaining battery capacity year by year. 2820mAh after one year, 2650mAh after two, 2491mAh after three, 2342mAh after four and about 2201mAh after five years.                                                    
 Thanks to the intelligent charge controller, Witty is able to monitor the current flow and understand when your smartphone's battery is charged. Thus, when the current absorbed by your smartphone drops below a certain threshold, Witty will disconnect your phone from the battery charger through its electromechanical switch.Theoretically,to properly charge the smartphone battery up to 100% is need a voltage of 4.2V.In reality,the manufacturers overload the batteries with voltages up to 4.36V in order to have a more performing smartphone in the morning. This, however, leads to a fast aging of the battery capacity. As you can see in Table I, it is noted that when you charge the battery at 4.2V we can enjoy about 500 charging cycles, while overloading it at 4.25V the number of cycles is reduced to 350, in which however you have a 5-10% more charge per cycle.In Picture I, you can graphically see how end-of-charge voltage greatly affects battery capacity. [Tables courtesy of BatteryUniversity]  Witty does not prevent the battery from reaching the end-of-charge voltage set by the manufacturer but avoids it from being subjected to this voltage for all the hours in which the smartphone is left charging with the 100% battery. Therefore, Witty eliminates most of the overcharge by avoiding premature aging.Here you can see a test lab made with an iPhone updated to iOS 13.3. [ITA Subtitles Version]                                                  
 Sony on its website :“ Remember that the battery will be damaged if you leave your device charging for a long time after reaching 100%”.   Unofficial batteries do not allow high performances. They also may have insufficient safety provisions and rely on charger to finish charging. Witty helps your brand to perform over time.  A non performing battery leads us to replace it after less than a couple of years. An original smartphone's spare part can cost up to 75€ and 105€ for iPad.After  20,000€ collected we will add a new reward with CORAL Witty .                                                               Our MissionFor two years we have proposed to improve the quality life of smartphone users and to reduce the enormous pollution due to the excessive amount of battery thrown away and not disposed of by developing a product that combines an innovative technology to an incredible design. Why Indiegogo?We have choosen Indiegogo to launch our product and to build a well-structured company.

This is why we set out to design one portable device that encompasses multiple charging solutions for any situation.While working on what was soon to be ChargePool, we realized that our device was “pooling” in multiple sources of energy to keep the phone charged, and the name “ChargePool” came to life.Our first prototype was made of corrugated board that was taped together. It was the size of a rock, yet it did not have a place for the wires within.  One year--dozens of prototypes, tons of discussions (arguments),some intense engineering and design--later,ChargePool was finally pocket friendly, and it did everything we wanted it to do. Today, we are proud to present one portable devicethat combines multiple charging solutions, ChargePool.  Participate in the ChargePool referral contest Step 1: In order to take part in the referral contest, you must have an Indiegogo account and back Chargepool.*Due to Indiegogo’s privacy policy, Chargepool will ONLY receive the name and email address of people who back their campaign.Step 2: Simply log in to Indiegogo, if you have not already, or create an account by signing up with the usual process. Then, visit the campaign page on Indiegogo and look to the right of the main video for the “Link” button (See image below)Step 3: Click the “Link” button.

<h3>Project Development</h3>
<div>When we were brainstorming product opportunities, we realized that all of us have experienced cramped muscles, awkward stretching and texting with our phone two feet from our face. A few of us had even rigged up an elaborate system of cords or power strips in our couch and on our bed. We knew there had to be a better way to solve this issue. It needed to be sturdy, compatible with any device, have a long cord, and be slim and easy to slide in between seat cushions. Thus the Couchlet™ was born!<br/>

<h3>Risk and challenges</h3>
<p>Couchlet™ is a high design product that demands high quality. It has several components that are being produced by different suppliers and must come together to create the final product. We are on a mission to set ourselves and our backers up to win through production, quality control, and logistics systems. However, there are always risks. Here are the places we see the biggest ones:</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing</b></p>
<p>There are so many variables that almost always you hit bumps in the road. We have commercialized well over 80 products, and all of them have had tough moments. In the “real” world, products are in development for often up to 2-3 years before they launch. Crowdfunding has created a unique situation where consumers are expecting things to hit very tight deadlines that truly are difficult to perfectly predict. We have done our best to account for unexpected delays, and will do our best to handle the bumps, but there is always a chance we could hit a snag bigger than we plan for.</p>
<p><b>Product Adjustments</b></p>
<p>We have made prototypes of the Couchlet™, but as it makes its way to final production release, there may be adjustments to the design required by manufacturing and cost considerations. We are committed to providing an awesome product that our backers love. We will let you know of any changes that we need to make and why.</p>
<p><b>Fulfillment timing</b></p>
<p>Once the product is ready for production we have to get them made and shipped to us before we can ship them to our backers. Depending on our volumes, and acts of God, we may experience delays in getting all the units shipped. We will scale up with the intention of shipping all of the units from the campaign between November and December, but there is a limit to how high our capacity can go with our selected supplier. In addition, customs can slow things down, as well as defective shipments. We will keep you apprised as things develop and let you know where things stand. We appreciate your support more than we can say, and also thank you for your patience as we work hard to fulfill our perks.</p>

<li>
<strong>Where is Couchlet™ made?</strong><br/>Couchlet™ was designed in Columbus, Ohio. It will be manufactured in China. </li>
<li>
<strong>When are the perks expected to ship?</strong><br/>We expect to begin shipping in early December 2015. Not all perks will be shipped this soon, as we will ship in the order that purchases are received.</li>
<li>
<strong>What is the Warranty?</strong><br/>We provide a limited warranty that guarantees you receive your Couchlet™ free of manufacturing defects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Can I change or cancel my perk?</strong><br/>Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust your perk selection. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that contributions made on indiegogo are also non-refundable.</li>
<li>
<strong>How much will shipping cost?</strong><br/>Shipping will cost approximately $3 per unit domestically for up to 10 units. Shipping to Canada and Mexico will cost approximately $10 for the first unit and $3 for each additional unit. International shipping will cost approximately $15 for the first unit and $3 for each additional unit. Shipping will be handled at the end of the campaign.</li>

<strong>Is there any risk or fire hazard associated with this product?</strong><br/>The Couchlet™ is low voltage, so it is just as safe as the USB charger that comes with your phone.</li>
<li>
<strong>How does the Couchlet charge two devices with one cable?</strong><br/>The Couchlet™ has two USB hubs, so if two devices are plugged in the power will be split in half. If you are charging an iPad, you will want to use your iPad cable to ensure that you have enough power to charge it. If only one device is plugged in, the power will not be split and the device will charge at normal speed.</li>

The electrical outlet is hardly ever in a convenient position, and you probably know what it's like to sit in an awkward position because your cord isn't long enough.

The Couchlet™: Power where you want it.Presenting the USB Couchlet™, the USB port that is exactly where you need it. 

Sitting on the couch while your phone is charging? 


The Couchlet™ nests between cushions. 


Having trouble reaching your charger from the bed? 
The Couchlet™ has a folding arm that wedges under your mattress. 

The Couchlet™'s wedge-shaped design means that it fits between or under cushions and mattresses so that you can barely even see it. The fold out leg gives you extra stability and the ability to slide the Couchlet™ onto the outside of your furniture. 

Each Couchlet™ comes with a detachable 6-foot USB cable that uses your current wall charger for power. The Couchlet™ is low voltage, so it's just as safe as the charging cord that comes with your phone.

</div></figure><p>PenSe is a simple, elegant device that protects Apple Pencil and its components from both damage and loss. While the current iPhone, iPad and MacBook all employ an anodized unibody aluminum design, Apple’s Pencil does not. Its white silicon plastic body is far more susceptible to daily wear and accidental damage. PenSe’s anodized unibody aluminum design ensures a more portable and durable Pencil.</p>

<p>Designed to take a beating PenSe is machined from a single piece of cold rolled, aircraft grade aluminum. Its unibody design is extremely strong, abrasion resistant, and easy to grip. PenSe keeps Pencil safe while preserving the look and feel of an Apple product.</p>

Funded on Kickstarter, moved to Indiegogo.
We at PenSe are super excited to announce that we have wrapped up a successful Kickstarter this morning!  Now we're hoping Indiegogo will help us raise more and do more, not just for a great new Apple accessory, but also for the greater good (learn more at bottom of page).  
  PenSe has been reviewed by these organizations.

Mission

PenSe's goal is to create something that is more than simply a pen case. PenSe is a ""functional case"" for the Apple Pencil. By definition, a functional case keeps a product safe, especially while it's in use, and is developed from the point of view of use. Anything else is just a sleeve or pencil bag.

Simple & Elegant



PenSe is a simple, elegant device that protects Apple Pencil and its components from both damage and loss. While the current iPhone, iPad and MacBook all employ an anodized unibody aluminum design, Apple’s Pencil does not. Its white silicon plastic body is far more susceptible to daily wear and accidental damage. PenSe’s anodized unibody aluminum design ensures a more portable and durable Pencil.
Magnetically Compatible

 
With fourteen high strength neodymium magnets, your Pencil isn’t going anywhere. PenSe allows you to attach Pencil to any magnetized surface on your iPad Pro, Apple Smart Cover, or new Smart Keyboard.
Protection

 
Designed to take a beating PenSe is machined from a single piece of cold rolled, aircraft grade aluminum. Its unibody design is extremely strong, abrasion resistant, and easy to grip. PenSe keeps Pencil safe while preserving the look and feel of an Apple product.
Superior Grip

 
PenSe makes the Apple pencil experience better, the added circumference weight and grip are remarkably satisfying, granting a greater degree of control.
Minimal


Convenient

 
 With PenSe Magnetically attached to your iPad, it's far less likely to be run into. And if someone does happen to catch your cord while charging, PenSe (much like Apple's Magnetic MacBook chargers) will simply disconnect, and save your iPad from crashing to the floor.
Precision Machining 

 
PenSe is CNC-machined on medical & aerospace grade Swiss lathes from one solid piece of 6061 T aluminum, right here in Massachusetts at a world renowned precision parts manufacturer. Our manufacturer's high performance standards ensure that all PenSe components fit together perfectly.
We take quality very seriously. With each PenSe component holding a minimum tolerance of one ten thousandth of an inch. Together with our CM we have arranged a barrage of quality control tests, to be performed on every component, during every batch and assembly.
Beautifully Bostonian
Pense was born in Boston, one of the great innovation capitals of the world. We took everything we love about this city and put it into our work, and thus the city is reflected in Pense. 
Pense is no stranger to coffee shops, cold winters, and weather-beaten hands.


 It blends seamlessly into the community of thinkers, and never feels out of place where creativity is flowing.

So for $60, we are offering a new PenSe anodized in Bernie's own light blue.… Well, all but 1% will be anodized. This Laser engraved PenSewill read ""IndieGo Vote for Bernie Sanders."" (Yup, we will bern right through the anodization.)  Appostasy will be donating 30% of this special pledge to Bernie Sanders' campaign.*
We are making PenSe right here in America and it's something we are proud of. We want to continue to be proud of what ""Made in America"" means, for the next 4 years and beyond.

<p>One of the biggest and most renowned electronics device manufacturers in the world, Flextronics is currently working with us to setup the production line. </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>From showing a working form-factor demo at CES Las Vegas in Jan' 2016 to getting close to shipping now, Bixi has come a long way. This has been made possible with a talented team, seed-funding and strong world leaders as partners for R&amp;D and production.</p>
<p>At the time of launch of this campaign, we have already received first tooling results from manufacturing and they look good. We have sent those Bixis to our Alpha Testers across the world who have already appreciated the build quality.</p>
<p>We seem to be on-target for the first pre-series delivery early January. However, there are always risks that can delay the process of getting Bixi in (front of) your hands. These could be unexpected events on the production line such as delays by a supplier to deliver a component on time or some minor yet important product enhancements to be done.</p>
<p>Even when we start shipping, there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from the factory or shipping them to you. We are taking measures though to prevent such issues.</p>
<p>We are committed to provide with you an exceptional user-experience with Bixi and are striving hard to achieve on time delivery. By pledging in our campaign, you have become part of our journey and we will be communicating regularly on the progress to get Bixi delivered to you.</p>

For example, once configured, you can swipe right to call home, double-tap in air to accept a call (Android only), wave down to play/pause music and single-tap to switch from one use case to another (like music to phone).
20. Do you plan adding other devices and apps?
Our mission is to continually extend the number of apps and devices through natively integrating them with Bixi.
At the end of the campaign we'll open a special community page to let you propose a specific integration and upvote the ones that you prefer.
21. How is Bixi able to control Wi-Fi based objects like Philips Hue, Lifx, GoPro etc?
Bixi connects via Bluetooth low-energy to your phones/tablets & PCs. Control of wi-fi based objects like lights, gopro uses the Bixi-App running in background on your phone as a bridge.
The App is continuously listening but does not consume power due to the use of the latest Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1 protocol.
22. Can Bixi work under powerful direct light on it ?
Yes it works very well in powerful direct light - kitchen light and even power sun light. Check out the demo video on the kickstarter page.
23. Can Bixi work in complete darkness ?
Yes Bixi equally works well in complete darkness. Check out our demo video on the kickstarter page.
24. How do i change from one fucntion to another (one app to another / one device to another / one app to another device or vice-versa)
You can change from one function to another using a simple gesture.",38.0,4,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The Mu System...

Meet the Mu System - the world's thinnest international charger, brought to you from Made in Mind, the team that created the original UK folding charger. 






The Mu System is compatible with all makes and models of smartphone, tablets, MP3 players and pretty much all USB-charged devices. The Mu System consists of two parts: a power block with USB connector and separate plug attachments that are suitable for every socket type worldwide. Specifically: 



The Brit - pocket-sized and portable, this plug will reduce your overall UK plug size by over 70%. Say goodbye to bulky UK chargers!




The American - pocket-sized with fold-away pins, the streamlined design plugs flat against the socket and is the perfect travel companion.

The European - portable, with a 90 degree rotation , this plug head enables you to charge the products you love with a stylish twist.



The Aussie - down under travelling with a charger made easy with our smart, configurative design. It couldn't be simpler!




Simply swap on the plug head for the country you are in and plug in to the mains socket to charge your devices.

Why the Mu System...

The Mu System is a must-have for any frequent traveler. The design suits all lifestyles - it's small, light, and the components are easy to switch between. 





Buy the complete Mu System so that you always have the plug you need, wherever you are. 





If you don't travel, don't worry. You can buy the Mu with a single plug head of your choice and along with it comes our award-wining charging experience. Light, compact and stylish. And tiny!




How the Mu System works...

The Mu System has been designed to work with a simple, patented, click-on and click-off swapping of the plug heads. Ideal if you want a slimline, lightweight charger for day-to-day use, or if you need international variants to suit a travelling lifestyle. Simple, practical, beautiful.





UK & plug type G countries, including Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates.

Our Rewards...
A short summary of our rewards are outlined below. For more information, please refer to the pledges on the right-hand side of our page. 












Our Story...

The Mu was the brainchild of Min-Kyu Choi. He experienced the problem of the UK plug size in 2009 while studying at the Royal College of Art when his laptop was scratched in his bag by its charger.
He started working on a solution.




With an initial sketch in hand, Min-Kyu joined forces with Matthew Judkins, a then recent graduate from Imperial College. Made in Mind was born and they set about moving the sketch forward and towards becoming a product.
The original, and UK-focused, Mu was released in 2012 and was an instant hit with design enthusiasts and gadget fans.
Since then, Min-Kyu and Matthew have been thinking about how to make their initial UK product useful in other countries.
The Mu System is the result...

What we need...

As you can see from our video, we have the design of the Mu System completed,

We hope to do this with your help. In

Risks & Challenges...

We have a great

we are confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.  
We are well versed in

What you'll get...

and all will be in black.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’m Curtis Lewsey.
Last winter Jeff Hanson and I met up at Panera Bread in Trumbull, CT to talk
about some fun, new business ideas. One idea that came up was a concept to
organize groups and communicate with them on a mobile device. This concept has
now blossomed into a new App called FlashRe (FlashResponse). We have had a
blast working on this project and are now taking it very seriously!</p>
<p><b>Background
Story</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li> Jeff and I
both graduated from Sacred Heart University where we also excelled at playing
baseball. We founded the idea of FlashRe based on a personal need in our
everyday lives. Jeff needs the FlashRe App to communicate with players and
parents on the baseball teams he coaches. I personally need it to better
communicate with family scattered across the US as well as for communicating
with my business marketing team (across the world). </li></ul>

its growing ineffectiveness. We then asked, <i>“What
if there was a way you could download a free app, organize all your groups,
invite the friends you want into your groups, and have a quick and easy way to
send messages via text, voice or video from your smart phone?”</i> We also
shared our interactive scheduling feature and from the overwhelming positive

this App to make lives around the world a bit easier. <br/>

<h3><strong>Pepper’s Ghost</strong></h3>
<p>Exactly 150 years ago (1862) John Henry Pepper introduced a projection technique that is now known as ‘Pepper’s ghost’. This technique allowed live people or objects to appear on stage, like ghosts.<br/> After 100 years, in the 1960’s, with the introduction of projectors, Uwe Maass and The Walt Disney Company further pioneered the techniques using the effect to thrill visitors in theme parks (Haunted Mansion), theaters and events.<br/>Now 50 years later, we came up with the next step; bringing it to your living room.</p>
<h3><strong>Prototypes</strong></h3>
<p>We experimented with different materials and created two product lines; the mini holo@home for smartphones and the maxi holo@home for iPad and 10.1” tablets.<br/> The first prototypes were made out of carton board. Although they work really good, the carton versions are time consuming to fold and the maxi carton version isn’t strong enough to hold a tablet. For this reason, we are going to make the final mini and maxi versions out of plastic.</p>
<h3><strong>Holographic content</strong></h3>
<p>I guess that it was hard to sell the first televisions, if there wasn’t any channel to look at. The same goes for the holo@home. We will setup a website to offer creators a place to share their content and user the possibility to find it.</p>
<p>Creating good holographic content is easy to do. We’ve been creating content for a long time and we put our experience into 10 golden rules for creating holographic content. Now it’s still in writing, but as soon as the holo@home is released, we will have a holographic tutorial (maybe the world’s first ;).</p>
<h3><strong>What we need</strong></h3>
<p>Creating the tooling for producing the plastic versions, the production of the first batch and the shipping is expensive. Although we do invest ourselfs, we run a bit short :(</p>
<p>We already gave a GO for the tooling (over 20.000 euro's). To be able to produce the initial batch and ship them to us, we need approx 30.000 euro's.</p>
<p><strong>If you like our holo@home, please help us by telling others about this!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<p>Depending on your perk, you will get our '10 golden rules for creating holographic content' manual, a holo@home mini, a holo@home maxi, or both. For companies, we will also offer a promotion pack of 10 holo@home mini's, 10 holo@home maxi's with personalised sides and their own 3D holographic logo.</p>

<h3>Privacy is a right</h3>
<p>Privacy is a right.  Everyone, no matter, what race, what nationallity, what background has a right to privacy.  It doesn't matter where you live, what you do, how much money you have or don't have, privacy is a fundemental human right and in most places, it's the law.</p>
<p>I've designed Talaria, a mobile messaging system that is gauranteed private from prying eyes, all of them.  Not us, not anyone will be able to read your messages. Just you, and the people you send them to.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help.  We've built alot of this already, the system works, it's up and running <em>today. </em> We know <em>how</em> we're going to put it onto Android, iPhone, Windows Phone and Blackberry and we've proven it'll work.  What we need now is help putting it onto your phone.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to get it onto each device.  We've done the sums and think that'll cost between $10,000 to $20,000 per device.  That money isn't just spent building the app, we could do that for some of them, it's about making it easy to use by people who are good that &amp; getting it tested so that <em>you</em> have a tool that protects your privacy &amp; that you want to use.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need some cash to help run it.  It won't be ad-supported so while we're getting going we need to pay for the servers and the bandwidth.</p>
<p>As an early supporter you get the app for free, for life and depending on what you've donated you can give the app away for free too.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal we'll come back to <em>you</em> the supporters and ask you to vote on what platforms you want us to target first and see where we go from there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How else can I help?</h3>
<p>We need support, we want you &amp; your friends to shout about our app, we want people to want to use it and that's about so much more than funding.</p>
<p>Talk to your friends about privacy, really think about what your privacy means to you.  Blog about it, tweet about it. </p>
<p>If you're in the field of technical security, go to our blog at <a href=""http://talariachatapp.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://talariachatapp.wordpress.com</a> and start peer reviewing our work.</p>

</div></div>","Secure, Confidential CommunicationIt's hard to understand, with all of the data being collected about us all the time and the surveillance that has become pervasive throughout our online and cellphone experience, why we as citizens don't do something about it.We have the technology. It exists. Today!
This campaign is about getting that technology into your hands, so that you can choose who to trust and who to communicate with in your own personal, secure, confidential network. We call it the Newbound Network.

The software is currently in a period of beta testing. This is version 1.0, and it's simple but powerful. The web browser based user interface allows you to easily establish direct peer-to-peer connections with any other device running the Newbound Network software. 

Works Where You Need It


The software runs on any Mac, Windows or Linux computer, and Android/iOS versions are in the works as well. It also works exceptionally well with small computers like the Raspberry Pi and the Phidgets SBC. Your help will allow us to return the decision of who to trust with your confidential information and communications back to you... where it belongs! 



Releasing to the General Public
With the software in beta, we have control over the way people are introduced to the software and how they familiarize themselves with it. In order to make that process frictionless enough for a public release of the Newbound Network, we need to spend some money to:

Produce documentation and contextual help
Fix any remaining bugs and implement features identified as ""must have"" by the beta testing team.
Set up a developer program with documentation and support.
Finish porting the software to Android and iOS (stretch goal).


In order to make your support of this great effort even more personally rewarding to you, we've come up with this list of incredible perks to entice you, including:

Early access to the Newbound Network software through the beta test program.

Enrollment in the Developer Program

Skype interviews with the exciting people making this software happen
If we reach our initial goal, we'll add the additional goal of finishing our ports to Android/iOs, and we'll add perks for early access to them.
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will not be able to release all of the Newbound Network apps to the general public on time, but we will at least maintain our beta test program until we are ready for general release.

Our first step was to make 3D prototype of our design model.<br/>That was accomplished back in September. We printed plastic case using 3D printer<br/>in Moscow; then we bought a USB cable and attached it to our prototype. At the same time, Andrey was searching for a Li-Po battery manufacturers in China, and ordered samples from 3 companies.<br/><br/>2. We received samples when we came back to New York in October and this is when our next challenge begun. <br/>We had to test those sample batteries in order to find out which one works better, holds more power, and doesn't get too hot during work process. After we were done with tests, we inserted battery inside the plastic case, soldered all wires, and finally got  everything that we need to charge Google Glass. This is when our functional prototype was born.<br/><br/>3. Currently we are looking for ways to fund our project. <br/>We thought it might be a great experience to try Indiegogo as a way to raise funds. But we have also applied for a business loan and were approved. Surely we would prefer Indiegogo project to do well rather than using bank's money to avoid paying interest and endless fees.<br/><br/>4. Our next step will start when we go to China in 2014 (around 18-19th of January) to start manufacturing process. <br/>We want to be on top of this process and stay in China (Shenzhen) for about 6 weeks in order to control quality of production. This is what is going to happen there:<br/><br/><i>a) </i>creation of molds for battery itself and it's plastic case. This is done with the same manufacturer.<i><br/>It will take 1 week. Approximate dates: January 20th-26th</i><br/><br/>b) production of battery and plastic case. Assembling all of them together with USB cable and other plastic parts. Testing process.<br/><i>It will take 4 weeks. Approximate dates: January 27th - February 24th</i><br/><br/>c) production of battery package. This is done with another manufacturer in China. <br/><i>It will take 2 weeks. Approximate dates: February 10th - February 24th</i><br/><br/>d) we will pack everything together. Ready to ship!<br/><i>It will take 1 week. Approximate dates: February 24th - March 2nd</i><br/><br/>5. Final step is to deliver GAZERglass to the United States. Shipping by air and going through the customs won't take longer than a week, so we expect to have everything in our warehouse by March 9th. As soon as we get it, we will start sending battery packs to our early birds. After GAZERglass opening ceremony (around 20th of March) we will continue to ship batteries and will start regular sales in April.<br/><p></p><h2>
Risks and challenges 

</h2>
<p>Our team is experienced in design, development, production and
 logistics of an end product. Our company is running for 2 years 
already, during which we successfully developed several hardware and 
software projects. </p>
<p>Of course there are always possibilities to be delayed at some point 
or to have an unforeseen expense, but we are bringing our experiences 
together with our partners and making a unique alliance which will prove
 itself. If any problems come up during the production cycle we will 
solve them using our own funds and resources. We will do our best to 
deliver GAZERglass on time.</p>
<p>Things you might be concerned about:</p>
<p>Design: our partners from Moscow, Russia created a beautiful and 
unique design of GAZERglass battery, so we have successfully overcame 
this challenge.</p>
<p>Prototype: 3D modeling and engineering of GAZERglass as a final 
product was a successfully completed task that ended with our real 
functioning prototype.</p>
<p>Product parts: we have tested few batteries from different 
manufacturers and have chosen one we like the most. Circuit board 
protection for the battery was customized for our needs.</p>

user. Convenient, affordable, and perfect product is the main goal that Anton
 set for our team. His idea is to make GAZERglass a unique piece of art,
 that is harmoniously combined with Google Glass.We also have Guli and Timur in our team. Guli is our General Manager responsible for customer service and public 
relations. She is ready to professionally assist anyone with any questions 
related to our products and services. Timur has genius skills in Search Engine Optimization, Internet 
Marketing, Social Media Advertisement, everything to organize successful
 promotion of our services and products to the IT market. He is the guy 
who will be posting news and updates about GAZERglass project on our 
website.DesignIn Moscow we worked together with the team of professional
designers SMIRNOVDESIGN. Their view of a future product combined with a subject expertise produced beautiful GAZERglass battery concept. We started with plasticine
model and drew a few sketches, then we worked on 3D model of a final object, and finally 3D printed our first working prototype which you could also see on the video.You are welcome to meet our designer team also.Sergey is a president and founder of “SmirnovDesign”, company based in 
Moscow, which works on GAZERglass project design and architecture. 
His 
company is one of the leaders in an industrial design, cooperating 
together with Skolkovo Innovation Center. Kirill and Ivan are the other team members who put a lot of efforts 
into the GAZERglass project. Kirill is 
responsible for styling, modeling and end product visualization; his 
ability to concentrate on task and get the job done leaves no doubts 
about success of any complicated idea that we might have. Ivan is a 
young talented designer and his responsibilities include general product
 concept, 
ergonomics, and composition. Ivan is very passionate about his projects 
and does the best for every project he works on.Go green with GAZERglassWe are concerned about our 
environment and truly support an idea of plastic waste reduction. Our 
designers and engineers developed a very thin GAZERglass battery case to
 reduce plastic consumption. Less plastic = more green!Technical data & factsForecasted specs:  1500mAh Lithium-Polymer Battery Pack.  Simultaneous charging and data exchange via micro-USBLightweight and compact design. Convenient charging cable.  Only 3.5 ounces (100 grams)Next stepsHere is some more information:1. Our first step was to make 3D prototype of our design model.That was accomplished back in September. We printed plastic case using 3D printerin Moscow; then we bought a USB cable and attached it to our prototype. At the same time, Andrey was searching for a Li-Po battery manufacturers in China, and ordered samples from 3 companies.2. We received samples when we came back to New York in October and this is when our next challenge begun. We had to test those sample batteries in order to find out which one works better, holds more power, and doesn't get too hot during work process. After we were done with tests, we inserted battery inside the plastic case, soldered all wires, and finally got  everything that we need to charge Google Glass. This is when our functional prototype was born.3. Currently we are looking for ways to fund our project. We thought it might be a great experience to try Indiegogo as a way to raise funds. But we have also applied for a business loan and were approved. Surely we would prefer Indiegogo project to do well rather than using bank's money to avoid paying interest and endless fees.4. Our next step will start when we go to China in 2014 (around 18-19th of January) to start manufacturing process. We want to be on top of this process and stay in China (Shenzhen) for about 6 weeks in order to control quality of production. This is what is going to happen there:a) creation of molds for battery itself and it's plastic case. This is done with the same manufacturer.It will take 1 week. Approximate dates: January 20th-26thb) production of battery and plastic case. Assembling all of them together with USB cable and other plastic parts. Testing process.It will take 4 weeks. Approximate dates: January 27th - February 24thc) production of battery package. This is done with another manufacturer in China. It will take 2 weeks. Approximate dates: February 10th - February 24thd) we will pack everything together. Ready to ship!It will take 1 week. Approximate dates: February 24th - March 2nd5. Final step is to deliver GAZERglass to the United States. Shipping by air and going through the customs won't take longer than a week, so we expect to have everything in our warehouse by March 9th. As soon as we get it, we will start sending battery packs to our early birds. After GAZERglass opening ceremony (around 20th of March) we will continue to ship batteries and will start regular sales in April.
Risks and challenges 


Our team is experienced in design, development, production and
 logistics of an end product. Our company is running for 2 years 
already, during which we successfully developed several hardware and 
software projects. 
Of course there are always possibilities to be delayed at some point 
or to have an unforeseen expense, but we are bringing our experiences 
together with our partners and making a unique alliance which will prove
 itself. If any problems come up during the production cycle we will 
solve them using our own funds and resources. We will do our best to 
deliver GAZERglass on time.
Things you might be concerned about:
Design: our partners from Moscow, Russia created a beautiful and 
unique design of GAZERglass battery, so we have successfully overcame 
this challenge.
Prototype: 3D modeling and engineering of GAZERglass as a final 
product was a successfully completed task that ended with our real 
functioning prototype.
Product parts: we have tested few batteries from different 
manufacturers and have chosen one we like the most. Circuit board 
protection for the battery was customized for our needs.
Production: agreements were made with manufacturers and we are ready to start GAZERglass battery production.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Protect yourself<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The HiddenToolbox can protect your files from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Your spouse or partner</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Your boss</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your mother!<br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>Kids</strong></li>
<li><strong>Friends/visitors who want to use your computer</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you lose or have your computer stolen</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It's ideal for individuals that want to protect their media from prying eyes, and corporations/professionals with sensitive information, Drs, lawyers etc.</p>
<h2><strong>Huge...Huge...MASSIVE..MONSTROUS list of features:</strong></h2>
<p>We've integrated a huge amount of features to give the toolbox suite amazing value, some of these features would cost you $30 to $50 each if you went out and bought individual software products, plus it gives you everything you need to perform all your important tasks in once place, with one piece of software, so need need to ever expose your files outside of the private environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All media and the program itself remain invisible<br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>Full military grade encryption with instant file access</strong></li>
<li><strong>Built-in secure and secret media player</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supports all popular codecs: Play MPG, MP4, 3GP, WMV, AVI, Divx, flash etc</strong></li>

<p><strong>...It's FAST!</strong> Our proprietary encryption engine is FAST, we’ve developed an OTFE (On the fly encryption) system, so unlike other encryption programs which can take forever to playback, especially with large videos, our system suffers no delays, it’s all instant and delay free!</p>
<p>Hiddentoolbox is a Windows based high security product that not only makes your media invisible to others, it also uses a proprietary encryption system to ensure that it is also protected to militarily standards. As far as anybody is concerned the files simply do not exist on the computer, even the HiddenToolbox program itself is invisible, only you can access it through your secret keys and password.</p>
<p>It creates its own environment that allows you to not only secure all of your media but also organize and view it, along with lots and lots of tools for conversion of file types, a very fast secret web browser, media player and lots more.</p>
<p>There are other security products out there, but not one of them offers all of the tools in one place and that's a problem. It's imperative that you keep all your media inside the secure environment at all times especially when viewing it, protecting the media and also ensuring that you never leave a trace or any history.</p>
<h2><strong>No need to hide content? Content Organizer is still invaluable</strong></h2>
<p>Don't need to secure and hide your content, the content organizer is invaluable. Forget creating folder after folder and then struggling to find particular images, videos or documents. Finally you'll be able to tag all of your media with keywords, add comments, create custom categories to store them in, so your collection will once and for all make sense and media can be easily located. You can find a particular file based on its comments, file name, keywords, file type, using the somple to use built in search engine, this feature alone makes the software invaluable.</p>
<p>We've created a prototype GUI to layout all of the main features:</p>
<h3>Prototype Content Organizer GUI</h3>
<p><img alt=""Content Organizer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hiddentoolbox.com/images/screenshots/screenshot.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototype Content Organizer GUI""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Secret Access:</strong></h2>
<p>You set up your own private combo access keys AND password to access the program, nobody knows it's there, it runs in complete stealth mode. As a critical component we have already developed this in order to ensure the project was feasible, it works extremely well, not only protecting against anybody on the computer knowing you are running the program, but also within a network.</p>
<h2><strong>Encrypt/Hidden Content: </strong></h2>
<p>Content is not only encrypted to military standards, but it's also hidden, it's literally invisible and can't be seen by anybody else, to others it simply does not exist! We have already developed this part as it was critical to the projects success, and it functions perfectly! Not only is the content invisible, but<strong> the HiddenToolbox software itself is also invisible!</strong></p>
<h2>Cloud Storage Protection:</h2>
<p>You can also use it to protect the storage of your cloud based content by utilizing our encryption system to create one encrypted file which stores all of your media so that nobody else can read, great for cloud based storage like Dropbox etc...</p>
<h2><strong>Secret Browser:</strong></h2>
<p>A built in high performance web browser will allow you to browse the web without leaving a trace of your activity. We've created a lightweight test browser and we were blown away with the speed, it's exceptionally fast, out performing all the major browsers in download times! Plus it leaves absolutely no history behind.</p>
<h2><strong>Capture video and images from the web:</strong></h2>
<p>If you see a video or image on the web that you want to keep, just right click on it and it'll automatically capture and save it into your toolbox, even streaming videos, great for capturing tube videos when they are streamed to your computer, allowing you to build your own locally stored private collection.</p>
<h2><strong>Media Player:</strong></h2>
<p>There's absolutely no point securing media if you can't securely view it, this is where toolbox shines through. You won't have to take media out of the secure, secret environment, it has its own built in media player, play all your videos, view all your images inside the toolbox, with all major video formats supported MPG, MP4, 3GP, WMV, AVI, Divx, flash etc</p>
<h2><strong>Media Format Converter:</strong></h2>
<p>Convert image or videos into different formats. Ideal for converting large videos into smaller files for <strong>Ipad</strong>, <strong>Android Tablets</strong>, <strong>smartphones</strong> etc. All major codecs supported.</p>
<h2><strong>Emergency Remote Content Destruction!</strong></h2>
<p>Here's the <strong>cool bit</strong>, if you can't get to your computer you'll be able to log into a web based account, from another computer or smart phone, and instruct the toolbox to safely shred all of your content, and remove itself! All in the background, without anybody knowing! You'll even get a confirmation report back to your control panel to confirm its success.</p>
<h2><strong>Online Services</strong></h2>
<p>Various online services will be created, should you forget your secret key combo or password you will always be able to retrieve it through an online account. If you want to destroy content from a remote location you can also use your online account to send a self destruct instruction to your computer, you can also use it to move licenses from one computer to another. <br/><br/>Depending upon how much we raise we might be able to add other cool online services to help manage and connect with your content, more will be revealed as our fund increases.</p>
<h2>Licenses</h2>
<p>For the online services above, the software license includes an annual license fee. However, if you back us with the appropriate amount (Starting at just $40) we're going to give you a <strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">lifetime license</span></strong> so you will never pay any annual fees, it will also include free upgrades for life! This is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">only for indiegogo backers in limited quantities and will never be available after we complete the funding!</span></span></p>
<h2>Where are we up to?</h2>
<p><strong>The project is almost complete!</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to make sure that developing the project was possible, so we've already created the encryption system including the ability to hide all of the media and the program itself. We've created a prototype GUI and the content organizer, and we've also completed the web site and server code with it's ability to send the remote destruction control and all the necessary server functions for you to use it. We have a test browser in place, it's super fast, it just needs a small amount of development time to add a few bells and whistles. We've spent a lot of time getting this project as far as we can, and we're not too far off completion.</p>
<p>All the important features are therefore either complete or close to completion. We just need this last push to complete the final step of putting it all together and the development of some of the less complex tasks such as the media convertor, play list manager etc. So, please back us so that we can finish off these final tasks and you can be the one of the first people to get your hands on it.</p>

Content is not only encrypted to military standards, but it's also hidden, it's literally invisible and can't be seen by anybody else, to others it simply does not exist! We have already developed this part as it was critical to the projects success, and it functions perfectly! Not only is the content invisible, but the HiddenToolbox software itself is also invisible!
Cloud Storage Protection:
You can also use it to protect the storage of your cloud based content by utilizing our encryption system to create one encrypted file which stores all of your media so that nobody else can read, great for cloud based storage like Dropbox etc...
Secret Browser:
A built in high performance web browser will allow you to browse the web without leaving a trace of your activity. We've created a lightweight test browser and we were blown away with the speed, it's exceptionally fast, out performing all the major browsers in download times! Plus it leaves absolutely no history behind.
Capture video and images from the web:
If you see a video or image on the web that you want to keep, just right click on it and it'll automatically capture and save it into your toolbox, even streaming videos, great for capturing tube videos when they are streamed to your computer, allowing you to build your own locally stored private collection.
Media Player:
There's absolutely no point securing media if you can't securely view it, this is where toolbox shines through. You won't have to take media out of the secure, secret environment, it has its own built in media player, play all your videos, view all your images inside the toolbox, with all major video formats supported MPG, MP4, 3GP, WMV, AVI, Divx, flash etc
Media Format Converter:
Convert image or videos into different formats. Ideal for converting large videos into smaller files for Ipad, Android Tablets, smartphones etc. All major codecs supported.
Emergency Remote Content Destruction!
Here's the cool bit, if you can't get to your computer you'll be able to log into a web based account, from another computer or smart phone, and instruct the toolbox to safely shred all of your content, and remove itself! All in the background, without anybody knowing! You'll even get a confirmation report back to your control panel to confirm its success.
Online Services
Various online services will be created, should you forget your secret key combo or password you will always be able to retrieve it through an online account. If you want to destroy content from a remote location you can also use your online account to send a self destruct instruction to your computer, you can also use it to move licenses from one computer to another. Depending upon how much we raise we might be able to add other cool online services to help manage and connect with your content, more will be revealed as our fund increases.
Licenses
For the online services above, the software license includes an annual license fee. However, if you back us with the appropriate amount (Starting at just $40) we're going to give you a lifetime license so you will never pay any annual fees, it will also include free upgrades for life! This is only for indiegogo backers in limited quantities and will never be available after we complete the funding!
Where are we up to?
The project is almost complete!
We wanted to make sure that developing the project was possible, so we've already created the encryption system including the ability to hide all of the media and the program itself. We've created a prototype GUI and the content organizer, and we've also completed the web site and server code with it's ability to send the remote destruction control and all the necessary server functions for you to use it. We have a test browser in place, it's super fast, it just needs a small amount of development time to add a few bells and whistles. We've spent a lot of time getting this project as far as we can, and we're not too far off completion.
All the important features are therefore either complete or close to completion. We just need this last push to complete the final step of putting it all together and the development of some of the less complex tasks such as the media convertor, play list manager etc. So, please back us so that we can finish off these final tasks and you can be the one of the first people to get your hands on it.

<p>Death is an uncomfortable &amp; painful
subject for most people, but it’s a fact of life that we all face at some
point.  Everyone grieves in their own way, but today, many of us may find
ourselves turning to the world’s largest social network, Facebook, to share our
pain and feelings surrounding death.</p>
<p>The My Respects Facebook Memorial Pages
Application will allow you to create an interactive Memorial Page which will
serve as a digital tribute and legacy for your loved ones, a deceased pet or
even yourself.  These Memorial Pages are specifically designed to be
interactive and wide reaching; encouraging family, friends and acquaintances
around the world, to share their memories and feelings with other grievers,
creating a respectful community of grievers facilitating understanding,
communication and healing.</p>
<p><b>What
happens when a Facebook user dies?</b></p>
<p>Facebook has over a billion users, and about
2.5 million of these users passed away last year. When a Facebook user passes
away, a family member can request that their profile page be put in a memorial
mode. The default memorial mode basically makes the profile inactive which
makes it difficult for page visitors to view and interact on the deceased’s page.</p>
<p>Currently, Facebook isn't setup to deal with
the death of its members with the sensitivity needed for this delicate issue.
My Respects app will ultimate facilitate these issues.</p>
<p><b>What
if someone you love dies?</b></p>
<p>Sooner or later we will lose someone you love
and admire. One way to deal with loss and grief is to try to understand it. You
may yourself turning to your existing social networks, like your Facebook
friends and family. The My Respects Facebook App will help to create an
online grieving community around the deceased individual, facilitating:
friendships, sharing, respect and healing.</p>
<p>My Respects' aim is to provide a thoughtfully
designed memorial app where mourners may share videos, music, photos, links,
memories, and event details and much more. These items will help keep our
deceased loved ones in our hearts and those that knew your loved one can visit
the My Respects Memorial Page and keep their memory alive.</p>
<p><b>What
if a Facebook user wants to set up their own My Respects Memorial Page?</b></p>
<p>When someone is anticipating the end of their
own life, they are faced with many decisions. One of the most pressing issues
can be how to say goodbye to their loved ones. With My Respects, you will be
able to create your own memorial page, where you can do things such as posting
a video to say farewell to the people in your life, or share your last
thoughts, dreams, and wishes with the people you care most about. You will
assign a digital caretaker to your account who will then be able to release
your personal My Respects Memorial Page upon your passing.</p>
<p><b>What
if a Guest Mourner visitor wants to do more?</b></p>
<p>Many visitors may find themselves wanting to
do more when someone passes away. Upon visiting the memorial page the visitors
will have the option of paying tribute in several ways. The visitor may leave a
comment or story, upload a video or picture. In the future we look to have a
group source feature that will allow for the planting of a tree in the name of
the loved one who has passed on. </p>
<p>The Memorial page creator will be able
identify several charities which the page visitors will be able to easily
donate to in the deceased person’s name. My Respects is excited to offer this
option to users and hopes to benefit many charities worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Our
Goal</b></p>
<p>We are raising 6,500.00 in  funds to finish the app
development phase, which includes: interface design, functionality coding programming and beta testing.</p>

   Our project in a few lines...
Gith is a free encrypted communication platform available on OS X, Windows and Linux.

Gith opens as a ""Virtual Secured Desktop"" and allows you to share e-mails, documents and chat with your contacts with complete end-to-end encryption.
You can also choose to store your documents on your Secured Cloud, your files are encrypted on your computer then transferred on our servers. 
Recent news urges us to develop smartphone versions and buy new servers ...

   Why do you need end to end encryption?

""End to end encryption"" means that we use specific cryptographic mechanisms (asymmetric ciphers) to ensure that only the recipient of your message will be able to read it.
We simply transfer an «encrypted thing» to your contact and are totally unable to read its contents, we don’t even know if it’s an email or a document!
The same principle is used for your Secured Cloud : we store encrypted documents and only you have the key to access them.
This is definitively something you should use if you don't trust your usual services providers anymore.
   Our project history

We started our project from Paris one year ago, when no-one was thinking that general public privacy on the internet was a real problem. 

Nevertheless, we thought that anyone should be able - if needed - to communicate with a real confidentiality, for free and without any form of advertising.


This summer, documents leaked by E. Snowden have revealed several programs of the NSA showing clearly that all our communications are watched, analyzed and processed with the help of the major actors of the world wide web.
Most existing security solutions are based on the US and then cannot be fully trusted.


Today we realize that we should really put more effort on our project because the general public really needs a shiny, easy to use and really secure solution to communicate on the Internet.


That’s why we’re here, we need your support !

   What we need

Our project is actually in a beta-test phase for OS X, Windows and Linux and we own one server hosted in France
[download and try it from http://www.gith-systems.com/download/]
To propose you a real and complete solution we need to :

finish this beta-test
develop the iPhone and Android applications

rent new servers all around the world (not in the US, nor in UK ...) to be stronger and more flexible



You can help us to fund our hardware infrastructure (main servers, backup servers, databases), buy development devices for iPhone/Android versions, feed our Umpa Loompa specialized in computer security and cryptography.

   What you obtain!

Karma points:
We will not get more in details about all those Karma Point things. Everybody needs karma points, whatever it is. You’ll probably find them useful, one day.
By helping us, you get a lot of karma point, because you’re doing something right.


Quota upgrades:
Creating a Gith account if free and you can use email, instant messaging, documents and cloud features. A default Gith account has a 100Mb storage quota on our servers and there’s an annual fee to get more (20€ for 1Gb/year).
By helping us, we offer you increased storage quotas for your Gith account!


Smartphone Apps:
One of the biggest goal of this funding process is to develop earlier smartphone versions of Gith.
Once ready, they will be found on the Android Market and App Store for 5€.
By helping us, you will get them for free!

   The future

Computer security is a very large domain, with many old and wide US companies present for decades.
Those companies must be replaced by something else, something smaller, something more «independent» and something not subject to US laws and the «patriot act».


We’re a French startup, we’re experienced, we have ideas and convictions : help us protecting your communications!




   Notre projet en quelques lignes...
Gith est une plateforme de communications sécurisées sur Internet disponible pour Windows, Mac OS X et Linux

Gith démarre sous la forme d'un ""Bureau Virtuel Sécurisé"" et vous permet d'échanger des e-mails, des documents et de chatter avec vos contacts : tout cela avec du chiffrement de bout en bout.
Vous pouvez également conserver des documents votre Cloud Sécurisé, tous vos fichiers seront chiffrés sur votre ordinateur avant leur transmission à nos serveurs.
Les dernières actualités nous encouragent à accélérer le développement des versions smartphones et acheter de nouveaux serveurs …

   Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de chiffrement de bout en bout ?

Le ""chiffrement de bout en bout"" signifie que nous mettons en oeuvre des algorithmes particuliers (asymétriques) grâce auxquels seul votre destinataire pourra consulter votre message.
Nous nous contentons donc de transmettre ""un truc chiffré"" à votre contact et sommes totalement incapables d'en lire le contenu : nous ne savons même pas s'il s'agit d'un email ou d'un document !
Le même principe est utilisé pour votre Cloud Sécurisé : nous stockons des documents chiffrés et vous seul avez la clef pour y accéder.
C'est définitivement une solution technique que vous devez exiger si vous ne faites plus confiance aux hébergeurs traditionnels !

It astonishes us that most case companies allow their products to reach customers in a state that will diminish that part of the user experience.</p></div>
</div>
<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;"">Simply put, the buttons on the dbrand Grip, made using the patented D3O® formulation, are the clickiest in the industry. No <em>wear-in</em> period is necessary – just pop on the dbrand Grip and enjoy buttons that are arguably even more satisfying than the stock buttons themselves. Don't believe us? Buy a Grip and find out for yourself.</p>

While nearly all in-ear style headphones will be compatible with the dbrand Grip, unfortunately it simply wasn't possible to make a hole big enough to accommodate larger audio jacks (like those seen on the Audio-Technica line of over-ear headphones).</p></div>
</div>
<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;"">That said, this is dbrand. We always find a solution. Every dbrand Grip we ship includes a custom gold-plated headphone adapter. It's designed to fit perfectly within the headphone port on the Grip, and allows compatibility with any headphones on the planet.</p>

</h3><p style=""margin:1em 0;"">This is real life and we're not going to pretend that grip is going to save you from forgetting your phone on your lap when you get out of the car. That's why we partnered with D3O®: the global leader in shock-absorbing technologies. Trusted by Adidas, Under Armour, Dr. Martens, and the US Military, their track record speaks for itself.</p><div style=""margin:1em 0;display: flex;"">

Ergonomic D3O® grip extrusions running along the frame of the case not only provide confidence-inspiring grip, but <em>break in</em> over time, like your favorite pair of shoes.</p></div>

<p style=""margin:0;margin-bottom:.75em;"">Delivery... it's the pain point of nearly every crowdfunding campaign that's ever existed. As a company that already ships thousands of orders every day from our Toronto HQ, delivery is our expertise.</p>
<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;margin-bottom:.75em;"">Manufacturing of the Grip is slated for completion by mid-February, at which point all 31,000+ units will be shipped from China to our warehouse in Toronto. All Grips will be shipped to Toronto via an express air service, rather than a slow sea freight.</p>
<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;margin-bottom:.75em;"">Once the Grips arrive at our warehouse in Toronto, we'll immediately begin fulfillment. Fulfillment will be done sequentially, by device, in order of popularity. What that means is that the devices with the most Grip orders will be filled first. That sequence can be seen in the list shown on the right.</p>
<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;margin-bottom:.75em;"">For a detailed breakdown of our manufacturing process, take a look at the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dbrand-grip-phone-case/x/8403891#/updates/3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: inherit;text-decoration: underline;"">3rd Campaign Update</a>.

<p style=""margin:0;margin-top:.75em;"">As we go through the process of filling orders, we'll be sure to keep everyone posted on the status. As always, keep an eye on our Campaign Updates for the latest information.

Using a combination of patented material science and strategically engineered grip extrusions, we've accomplished what no other phone case even set out to attempt: revolutionary grip. 
   Who is dbrand? // 

Since 2011, dbrand has operated as the global leader in device customization. Designed to customize your smartphone and add industry-leading scratch protection, skins – also known as vinyl wraps – are ultra-thin, precision-cut pieces of 3M vinyl. They're prototyped, manufactured, and shipped from our HQ in Toronto, Canada. Chances are, you've seen our skins featured on various literally every tech-focused YouTube channel on the internet.

   Revolutionary Grip // 
With the dbrand Grip, you'll never drop your phone again. Using patented material science, every detail of the dbrand Grip is designed to make sure your phone stays where it belongs: in your hand.
Along the sides of the case, and on all four corners, you'll find confidence-inspiring grip features. They're made from a uniquely formulated material, engineered for ultimate grip... and strategically placed for maximum contact. Over time, this patented compound gets even grippier and forms to the way you hold your phone. Like your favourite pair of shoes, the dbrand Grip will evolve to a fit that's totally custom to you.

   Supported Devices // 

Below is a list of devices we'll be supporting during this campaign. If your device isn't shown below, unfortunately, that means we won't be supporting it during this campaign. While we definitely plan to support more devices in the future, our sole focus right now is to get production completed and orders shipped as quickly as possible for these 21 devices.
If you've already placed an order for a dbrand Grip, visit https://dbrand.com/grip/my-order to select the device you plan to get a Grip for.

   Design Elements // 
  Carbon Composite //  

Through 18 months of development, testing, and more testing, we've formulated a unique compound that makes up the rigid frame of the dbrand Grip. That compound, a unique blend of carbon fiber and plastic polymers, brings together the durability and flexibility of plastic, while maintaining the light weight and unparalleled strength of carbon fiber.

Oh – and in case you're wondering, the answer is ""No"": The carbon composite we've developed will have absolutely no negative interference with Radio, WiFi, GPS, NFC, or Qi Wireless Charging signals.
  Tactile Buttons //  

There's nothing quite as satisfying as the tactile click of a flawlessly engineered button. From the first day we embarked on this journey to develop the dbrand Grip, we knew the buttons needed to achieve perfection. Aside from your screen, what part of your smartphone do you interact with more than the buttons? It astonishes us that most case companies allow their products to reach customers in a state that will diminish that part of the user experience.

Simply put, the buttons on the dbrand Grip, made using the patented D3O® formulation, are the clickiest in the industry. No wear-in period is necessary – just pop on the dbrand Grip and enjoy buttons that are arguably even more satisfying than the stock buttons themselves. Don't believe us? Buy a Grip and find out for yourself.
  Headphone Compatibility //  

There's nothing worse than getting your dream phone case, then having to take it off every time you want to plug in your ATH-M50x headphones. While nearly all in-ear style headphones will be compatible with the dbrand Grip, unfortunately it simply wasn't possible to make a hole big enough to accommodate larger audio jacks (like those seen on the Audio-Technica line of over-ear headphones).

That said, this is dbrand. We always find a solution. Every dbrand Grip we ship includes a custom gold-plated headphone adapter. It's designed to fit perfectly within the headphone port on the Grip, and allows compatibility with any headphones on the planet.
  Lens Protection //  
The camera – it's one of the most important features on your smartphone. When designing the dbrand Grip, we purposefully extruded the back lip – ensuring that your camera lens remains clear of any surface you rest it on.

   Impact Technology // 
This is real life and we're not going to pretend that grip is going to save you from forgetting your phone on your lap when you get out of the car. That's why we partnered with D3O®: the global leader in shock-absorbing technologies. Trusted by Adidas, Under Armour, Dr. Martens, and the US Military, their track record speaks for itself.
This D3O® impact technology is used nearly everywhere on the dbrand Grip. It lines the entire inner edge of the frame, ensuring your phone only ever makes direct contact with a shock-absorbing material.

Furthermore, because the D3O® material itself is naturally grippy and soft to the touch, we've engineered it into all exterior design features of the case. Ergonomic D3O® grip extrusions running along the frame of the case not only provide confidence-inspiring grip, but break in over time, like your favorite pair of shoes.

That's right – the more you use it, the more your Grip will truly become unique to you. Of course, the D3O® material is also used on the reinforced corners, ensuring any major drops have extra cushioning.

   The Science of D3O // 

In its raw form, the patented D3O® material flows freely – like a very slow moving, thick liquid. Upon impact, the molecules in the D3O® material lock together to absorb and disperse the impact, as if nothing had ever happened. The result? Unparalleled drop protection that you'll simply never need.

   Customization // 

As expected, the dbrand Grip can be fully customized - designed for compatibility with unique ""Grip-specific"" dbrand skins. From Carbon Fiber to Concrete, Marble to Matte Black, even Bamboo and Mahogany… you'll be sure to find a custom dbrand skin to fit your unique style.
Every Grip comes with a signature Matte Black skin. That said, if you want to further customize your Grip, simply select one of The Custom Grip™ perks and choose one of our four legendary skin packs.




 




 



   Delivery Timeframes // 


Delivery... it's the pain point of nearly every crowdfunding campaign that's ever existed. As a company that already ships thousands of orders every day from our Toronto HQ, delivery is our expertise.
Manufacturing of the Grip is slated for completion by mid-February, at which point all 31,000+ units will be shipped from China to our warehouse in Toronto. All Grips will be shipped to Toronto via an express air service, rather than a slow sea freight.
Once the Grips arrive at our warehouse in Toronto, we'll immediately begin fulfillment. Fulfillment will be done sequentially, by device, in order of popularity. What that means is that the devices with the most Grip orders will be filled first. That sequence can be seen in the list shown on the right.
For a detailed breakdown of our manufacturing process, take a look at the 3rd Campaign Update. For a better understanding of our fulfillment process, as well as the rationale behind why we're filling orders in the sequence we are, take a look at our 4th Campaign Update.
As we go through the process of filling orders, we'll be sure to keep everyone posted on the status. As always, keep an eye on our Campaign Updates for the latest information. If you have any specific questions, feel free to post a comment in the comments section. Thanks so much for your support!

   Shipping // 


All orders will be shipped using a door-to-door tracked service. For deliveries in the US and Canada, this means that once your Grip has shipped, delivery won’t take more than 2-4 days. For deliveries outside the US and Canada, we’re still working to determine the best service provider for your local area. The most likely solution for international deliveries will be FedEx, although some Gulf Region shipments may be better served by Aramex. Regardless of your delivery location, rest assured your package will have full tracking visibility.

As is the case with nearly every package you’ve ever received from an online purchase, duties and customs fees will be determined at the time of delivery, and charged by your local authority. Unfortunately, we have no control over that.
If you have any further questions about timelines, feel free to post a comment. We’ll be hanging out there all month!

   FAQ // 
  How do I select the device type I want a Grip for? //  Great question! We've developed a custom interface which allows Backers to select their device type. You can check it out at https://dbrand.com/grip/my-order.  I'm still not sure which device I need a Grip for, but it's definitely one from the list. Can I wait to make a selection? //  Of course. Until we start filling orders, you can change your device selection at any time.  If my device isn't supported on the list, can I still get a Grip during this campaign? //  Unfortunately not. With the 21 devices we're supporting during this campaign, our sole focus is to get production completed and orders shipped as quickly as possible. We'll definitely be supporting more devices in the future, but we won't be able to support additional devices during this campaign. If you purchased a Grip and your device isn't supported, the next step would be to select 'None of the above' from the device selection interface at https://dbrand.com/grip/my-order and follow the instructions on how to obtain a refund.  I ordered a Grip with a Custom Skin Pack. Can I change the Custom Skin Pack selection? //  Unfortunately, Indiegogo doesn't have any option for backers (you) or campaigners (us) to change Perk Options. If you need to make a change to your Custom Skin Pack selection, the only way to do is by getting a refund and placing another order. To get a refund, first log into your Indiegogo account. Next, click your name in the top right corner. Select 'My Contributions', then click 'View Order Details'. Finally, click the 'Request Refund' button. Once you've initiated the refund, it will be processed automatically. It can take up to 5 business days until the refund is reflected on your account statement, depending on the policy of your bank or financial institution.  Can I change my delivery address? //  You sure can. Changing your delivery address can be completed right here, on the Indiegogo website. Full instructions on how to make adjustments to your delivery address can be found here.  When will shipping begin? //  All the answers you're looking for can be found in the Delivery Timeframes section above.  What delivery provider are you using to ship the Grip? //  In Canada, we'll be using Canada Post Xpresspost. In the US, we'll be using a Priority 2-day USPS service. For International orders (i.e. outside of US and Canada), we'll either be using FedEx or Aramex. Regardless of where you're located, once the Grip leaves our warehouse, it'll be traceable all the way to your door.  Will my existing dbrand skin be compatible with the Grip? //  While technically all dbrand skins will be compatible with the Grip, we highly recommend using the skins that we've developed specifically for the Grip (i.e. the ones included with your order). These Grip-specific skins were designed not only to offer a much simpler installation (for those experienced with dbrand skins, that means no side or corner flaps), but they're also engineered to complement the Grip with an optimal fit. While dbrand skins are imperceptibly thin (0.23mm), even micro-millimeter changes in the device thickness can affect the intended fit and feel of the Grip. Once all campaign orders have been fulfilled, we'll be opening up a full customizer on our website, allowing customers to purchase any type of Grip-specific dbrand skin they want.  Why did you launch the Grip on Indiegogo? //  We're always looking for new and innovative ways to launch products. You're here reading this, so it must have worked.  What is the Grip made of? //  The dbrand Grip features an industry-first carbon composite frame, housing world-class shock absorbing technology from the material science experts at D3O®. The carbon composite frame has the flexibility and durability of plastic, while maintaining the light weight and unparalleled strength of carbon fiber.  Why is it called ""Grip""? //  You're kidding, right?  Does the Grip come in any other colors? //  The case itself is available in only black. That said, as a skin company, we're all about customization. You can select a Custom Skin Pack with the Custom Grip perk and choose between Marble, Concrete, Black Dragon, Red Dragon, Bamboo, Mahogany, Black Carbon Fiber, and White Carbon Fiber skins to customize the look and feel of your device.  Can I still use my headphones with the Grip? //  Absolutely. Nearly every earbud-style headphone will fit without issue – and for those that don't (like the Audio-Technica M50x), we provide a custom head phone adapter to ensure full compatibility.  How do the buttons feel on the Grip? //  Unbelievable. We specifically engineered the buttons on the Grip to be ultra-tactile. Some would argue that the buttons on the Grip are even clickier than the stock buttons your device!  Will the Grip affect wireless charging or NFC? //  Not at all.  Will the Grip protect my camera and screen? //  Indeed it will. We've designed the Grip with an extended front and back lip, ensuring that any surface you rest it on will make no contact with the device itself.  Is the Grip waterproof? //  100%.  If I still have questions, whom should I contact? //  You can either post a comment or email grip@dbrand.com.",38.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>You can do just about anything from the comfort of your own smartphone these days - order a limo, buy shoes, watch the latest episode of <em>Breaking Amish - </em>pretty much anything your heart desires. But - as we discovered on a blustery night in a crowded DC bar - you can't request a song from a DJ. Over the next few hours (and countless IPAs), we set out to change that. Hey DJ was born. Over the next six months, we devoted ourselves to developing the concept and blueprint for Hey DJ.</p>
<p>Hey DJ allows you to request songs from the DJ in clubs, bars and restaurants, or anywhere a DJ performs. You can also tip the DJ, and even bid against or with other users to get your song played first. Hey DJ puts you in control of the music.</p>
<p>And all of you hard working DJs out there - you'll make more tips! Let's get this economy moving one request at a time.</p>
<p>Working with the good people at Objective Apps, we've created a wireframe blueprint for the project, and it's ready to move on to production. Hey DJ is ready to make the leap from great idea to great app.</p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We need the Indiegogo community to help us bring this product to life. We love this idea and think you will too. We're offering some solid rewards along with the bragging rights that come along with being an early adopter of the next big thing. Please check out our video and then show your support for Hey DJ. Let's get this party started.</p>

<p>A little bit about us:</p>

<p>Dave also grew up in the Philadelphia area and now resides in our nation's capital. After earning an engineering degree from Vanderbilt University, he spent five years as a Naval officer on active duty, stationed in San Diego and Chicago, making two overseas deployments.  After the Navy, Dave earned an MBA from Kellogg and has worked in commercial real estate for the past nine years in various roles - including project manager, developer, and asset manager.  Once Hey DJ is built the first song Dave plans to request will be something by Toots and the Maytals or maybe some 3rd Bass.</p>

<h2>We’re on a Mission to Provide Peace of Mind in the Cloud…</h2>
<p>And we need your help to do it. Cloud storage has become a convenient and accepted way of storing and accessing all of our digital files. But there’s a huge downside to public cloud storage – the loss of privacy and control. Technology changes seemingly overnight, making it difficult for policies and laws to keep up. It seems every day we hear news about the uncertainty of our rights to privacy when we store our data online. Even Apple Co-Founder, Steve Wozniak, has spoken out about his concerns:</p>
<p><em><strong>I really worry about everything going to the cloud. I think it’s going to be horrendous. I think there are going to be a lot of horrible problems in the next five years.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I want to feel that I own things. A lot of people feel, ‘Oh, everything is really on my computer,’ but I say the more we transfer everything onto the web, onto the cloud, the less we’re going to have control over it. (1)</strong></em></p>
<p>And he’s not alone. Here is what the experts say about your rights to privacy in the cloud:</p>
<p><em><strong>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendment Act (FISAAA) allows US authorities to spy on cloud data. This includes services such as Amazon Cloud Drive, Apple iCloud and Google Drive. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>— </strong></em><strong>“Experts warn on wire-tapping of the cloud,”</strong> <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21263321"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BBC"">BBC News</a></p>
<p>When we put stuff on someone else’s servers it is unclear who exactly can access our files and which policies will allow that access. What is clear is that in order to truly retain the rights to our own digital files, we need to keep them in our own possession. We all want to take back control of our files, but who wants to give up the anytime, anywhere access that cloud storage provides? We don’t. That’s why we created the CloudLocker project. It combines the best of both worlds – private, centralized storage for all of your files along with instant access from all of your devices, wherever you are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">You Have Your Right to Privacy - Now Use It</span></strong></p>
<p>Our forefathers guaranteed our rights under the Fourth Amendment to privacy of <img alt=""Constitution"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cloudlocker.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/constitution.png"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;"" title=""Constitution""/>the person and possessions against unreasonable searches. CloudLocker supports those rights by allowing you to keep all of your digital media in your possession, instead of putting it “out there” in a public cloud, without sacrificing the convenience of modern technology. Our CloudLocker project is underway and we need your support to allow everyone to enjoy their right to privacy. This is your chance to show your support for the continued development of new and innovative ideas and technology that provide more private and secure options for storing our growing amounts of data.  </p>
<p>Get one of the first-edition CloudLockers, complete with certificate of authenticity, and start safeguarding your files right away. Or make a donation to help us create and enhance the technology that guarantees you keep your right to privacy. Whatever you choose, we’re happy to have you participate in our campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Hidden Dangers in the Cloud</h2>
<p>Our new white paper reveals five hidden facts about cloud computing. Some may surprise you. Some may scare you. You need to know all of them. This informative, easy-to-read white paper, <em><strong>Is Internet Privacy a Cloud Illusion?</strong> </em>is available to download <a href=""http://www.cloudlocker.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cloud-Illusions-White-Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Designed with Security &amp; Privacy in Mind</h2>
<p><strong><em>Why should the law treat digital data stored in the 'cloud' any differently than papers stored in a file cabinet in our home? It doesn’t make any sense.</em> </strong></p>
<p><strong>–US Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), “With cloud, privacy issues loom,” <a href=""http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/with-cloud-privacy-issues-loom-90513.html#ixzz2UoXi2Sg7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Politico</a></strong></p>
<p>And we agree. That’s why keeping your files in CloudLocker is like keeping them in that locked file cabinet at home. CloudLocker is truly a mini cloud server that stays securely in your home or office. It allows you to return to keeping your files in your possession in a location you choose, while having all of the convenience of cloud computing technology.</p>

We’re all accustomed to attaching files to emails and sending them off to be downloaded onto the recipients’ hard drives or forwarded on to others. If you ever want to take back your file, you’re out of luck. CloudLocker eliminates this issue and puts you back in control of your files.  </p>
<p>When you share a file using CloudLocker, you are simply giving access to the original file stored on your CloudLocker. You can limit download permission, as well as retract the share completely at any time. It’s really a return to sharing in the old-fashioned sense, and you know exactly where your files are at all times.</p>

<h2>Do You Know Your Social Media Rights?</h2>
<p><span>Have you read the Terms of Service on your favorite social media sites? Policies vary by site, but this is another area of concern when it comes to your rights to privacy. Some of the policies that have come under fire in the recent past seem necessary in order for social media sharing to take place, as Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg explains in a Facebook blog post:</span></p>
<p><em><strong>When a person shares information on Facebook, they first need to grant Facebook a license to use that information so that we can show it to the other people they’ve asked us to share it with. Without this license, we couldn’t help people share that information. (2)</strong></em></p>
<p>However, this still opens the door for uncertainty, because you have given up your rights to your own content.</p>
<p><img alt=""Testimonial 3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cloudlocker.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/callout3.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" title=""Testimonial 3""/><br/>CloudLocker allows you to retain the rights to your media when you share on social media sites. You post a link to the file that stays securely in your CloudLocker, so others don’t get the rights to your media. If you decide to retract your share, it is gone forever – even if others have shared it.</p>

<h2>Who We Are:</h2>
<p>We are an innovative group of experienced professionals trained in various disciplines – from artificial intelligence, programming and math to marketing and finance – who are dedicated to creating a better cloud. We are headquartered in the U.S. but we also have team members in Europe and Asia, all of whom have devoted themselves tirelessly for more than two years to engineering the software that drives the CloudLocker. Our goal is to take everything great about cloud computing and combine it with the protection, privacy and control that we all deserve. Everyone is excited because the First-Edition CloudLocker is in production and on schedule to be shipped in July. We’re also animal lovers who chose a Saint Bernard as our mascot because he exemplifies the canine traits we admire: loyalty and protectiveness.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why This Campaign?</h2>
<p>The issues of Internet privacy and the security of our digital media are not just American problems, European problems, or Asian problems; they are worldwide problems. Privacy is one of the rare issues that unites people all across the globe. While we are pleased that the first phase of our mission is culminating in the introduction of the CloudLocker, we still have a long way to go. Jump-starting distribution of the CloudLocker will raise awareness not only of the privacy issues, but also of the possibility that new technology can offer real solutions.</p>
<p>Our project is a bold undertaking by our visionary founders. Developing software that tackles a basic fundamental right that has been eroded as technology advances is a humongous challenge. It takes an inordinate amount of talent, time and financial resources. Our goal is to speed up the production of our CloudLockers to a large volume to improve economies of scale and thus be able to deliver the CloudLocker affordably to everyone who wishes to own one. We strongly believe that there should be nothing standing in the way of people wanting to exercise their rights to privacy and control by owning a CloudLocker. We want people to know that, no matter where in this world they live, be it socialist, democratic or somewhere in between, they will eventually have a choice if they wish to protect their personal media and files, as the CloudLocker will be coming their way!  </p>
<p>We also envision developing an entire ecosystem on our platform that will allow people to perform what they are used to doing on the internet, but with a focus on security, privacy and control. While the funding we are seeking from this campaign is modest, it will go a long way in letting us get a head start in recruiting additional developers to speed up our next phase of software development while we market our first production of CloudLockers. <br/> <span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </span></p>

“For those for whom Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Dropbox’s server farms are too far away for comfort, CloudLocker gives you your own private cloud.” Forbes.com

 
What is CloudLocker?
CloudLocker is an actual mini server that:

Stores all your media
Gives you access anytime,anywhere
Works on all of your devices - desktop, laptop, iPhone, smartphone, iPad or tablet

Most importantly, it offers a private and secure alternative to public cloud storage. While online cloud storage services have become very popular in recent years, users are growing more concerned about potential security breaches and losing control of their personal data stored in the Cloud.
CloudLocker lets you keep your files in your possession, while also giving you all the convenience of cloud technology coupled with an innovative approach to sharing and control over your digital media. Watch the video here to find out more.
 
What's the Value of a CloudLocker?
It's Private: You own it. No one else can get to it without your permission.
It's Convenient: All your content is available to you on any device anytime, anywhere.
It's Safe: You can backup everything yourself - no worries, no hassles.
It's Easy: Simple setup and user-friendly features
It's Fun: You can enjoy all your movies, pictures and music no matter where you are or what device you use.
It's Economical: You get significant savings over online cloud services for similar capacity.
It's Limitless: Just add more storage through USB - endless capacity to store all of your digital media.
It's Fast: You'll be amazed at the transfer speed on your local network.
It's Unsurpassed: Not just a hard drive or NAS device! It's the future of cloud computing, and the future is now.
 
Which of these are on YOUR wish list?
I wish I could get to all my digital media anytime on any of my devices.
I wish I knew for sure that my files are always safe from prying eyes.
I wish I didn't have to spend the extra money to get more storage on the devices I want.
I wish I could send a hundred pictures all at once to family and friends as easily as sending a single photograph.
I wish I didn't have to use email attachments to share files with people.
I wish I could stream HD movies to my TV, smartphone or iPad without having to download them.
I wish I could let people view my shared files without letting them copy or download them.
Do you want it all? You've got it all with CloudLocker.

We’re on a Mission to Provide Peace of Mind in the Cloud…
And we need your help to do it. Cloud storage has become a convenient and accepted way of storing and accessing all of our digital files. But there’s a huge downside to public cloud storage – the loss of privacy and control. Technology changes seemingly overnight, making it difficult for policies and laws to keep up. It seems every day we hear news about the uncertainty of our rights to privacy when we store our data online. Even Apple Co-Founder, Steve Wozniak, has spoken out about his concerns:
I really worry about everything going to the cloud. I think it’s going to be horrendous. I think there are going to be a lot of horrible problems in the next five years.
I want to feel that I own things. A lot of people feel, ‘Oh, everything is really on my computer,’ but I say the more we transfer everything onto the web, onto the cloud, the less we’re going to have control over it. (1)
And he’s not alone. Here is what the experts say about your rights to privacy in the cloud:
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendment Act (FISAAA) allows US authorities to spy on cloud data. This includes services such as Amazon Cloud Drive, Apple iCloud and Google Drive. 
— “Experts warn on wire-tapping of the cloud,” BBC News
When we put stuff on someone else’s servers it is unclear who exactly can access our files and which policies will allow that access. What is clear is that in order to truly retain the rights to our own digital files, we need to keep them in our own possession. We all want to take back control of our files, but who wants to give up the anytime, anywhere access that cloud storage provides? We don’t. That’s why we created the CloudLocker project. It combines the best of both worlds – private, centralized storage for all of your files along with instant access from all of your devices, wherever you are.
 
You Have Your Right to Privacy - Now Use It
Our forefathers guaranteed our rights under the Fourth Amendment to privacy of the person and possessions against unreasonable searches. CloudLocker supports those rights by allowing you to keep all of your digital media in your possession, instead of putting it “out there” in a public cloud, without sacrificing the convenience of modern technology. Our CloudLocker project is underway and we need your support to allow everyone to enjoy their right to privacy. This is your chance to show your support for the continued development of new and innovative ideas and technology that provide more private and secure options for storing our growing amounts of data.  
Get one of the first-edition CloudLockers, complete with certificate of authenticity, and start safeguarding your files right away. Or make a donation to help us create and enhance the technology that guarantees you keep your right to privacy. Whatever you choose, we’re happy to have you participate in our campaign.
 
The Hidden Dangers in the Cloud
Our new white paper reveals five hidden facts about cloud computing. Some may surprise you. Some may scare you. You need to know all of them. This informative, easy-to-read white paper, Is Internet Privacy a Cloud Illusion? is available to download here.
 
Designed with Security & Privacy in Mind
Why should the law treat digital data stored in the 'cloud' any differently than papers stored in a file cabinet in our home? It doesn’t make any sense. 
–US Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), “With cloud, privacy issues loom,” Politico
And we agree. That’s why keeping your files in CloudLocker is like keeping them in that locked file cabinet at home. CloudLocker is truly a mini cloud server that stays securely in your home or office. It allows you to return to keeping your files in your possession in a location you choose, while having all of the convenience of cloud computing technology.

Multiple ways to easily share files

 

 
Amazing Sharing Controls
Simple permission setting controls let you set and modify permissions with just a click, even after the file’s been shared. Add customized messages, make shares private, enable or disable downloading or retract your share completely.
 
 
 
Say Goodbye to Email Attachments
Sharing our files via email attachments really means giving our files away. We’re all accustomed to attaching files to emails and sending them off to be downloaded onto the recipients’ hard drives or forwarded on to others. If you ever want to take back your file, you’re out of luck. CloudLocker eliminates this issue and puts you back in control of your files.  
When you share a file using CloudLocker, you are simply giving access to the original file stored on your CloudLocker. You can limit download permission, as well as retract the share completely at any time. It’s really a return to sharing in the old-fashioned sense, and you know exactly where your files are at all times.

However, this still opens the door for uncertainty, because you have given up your rights to your own content.
CloudLocker allows you to retain the rights to your media when you share on social media sites. You post a link to the file that stays securely in your CloudLocker, so others don’t get the rights to your media. If you decide to retract your share, it is gone forever – even if others have shared it.

<h2><strong>The Second Screen Experience for your iPhone 5</strong></h2>
<p>popSLATE is an E-Ink screen in an iPhone 5 case.  That means it’s low-power, always-on, super-readable in direct sunlight, and totally customizable.  It’s a blank slate you can populate with the images you love. Now you can express yourself to the world, share cool stuff with friends, and always have your favorite app functionality at a glance.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Express Yourself</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Yoda"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.popslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Yoda-CROPPED-e1353996359978.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/> </p>

<p><img alt=""Camera to Pop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.popslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Popping.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>You can Pop just about anything to the back of your phone.  Snap a picture.  Grab images on the Web. Take iPhone screenshots.  Plug in to your other photo sharing platforms, like Instagram.  Receive pictures from friends.  You can Pop ‘em one by one, or quickly set up a slideshow.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Always-On Productivity</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""always-on"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.popslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Productivity.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don’t you hate it when your iPhone screen keeps turning off when you need to view something every few moments?  Or, you’re in a meeting and need something important from your iPhone, but you just can’t get away with looking at it on the sly? </p>
<p>Since the popSLATE screen is ultra-low-power, it is always on.  This opens up a bunch of possibilities.  Urgent notifications, sports scores, maps, notes, calendar, talking points—you name it—will now be available at a glance. </p>
<p><strong>Micro E-Reader</strong></p>
<p>Kindle? iPhone?  Who wants to carry both?  Get a popSLATE instead.  The E Ink screen is readable even in the brightest sunlight.  Try doing <em>that</em> with your glossy LCD screen.</p>
<p><strong>Open API</strong></p>
<p>We will be developing an API to let you build always-on applications. With popSLATE you will be able to create entirely new ways for people to interact with the phone.</p>
<p>  </p>
<h3><strong>Share With Friends</strong></h3>

<p><span> </span></p>
<h3>
<strong>How It All Works</strong> </h3>
<p>The popSLATE case includes the latest, ruggedized, E-Ink screen, so it protects your iPhone just like any ‘dumb’ case. In fact the screen is nearly indestructible.</p>
<p>The screen only uses power when the image changes so it sips negligible power from the phone. We use the lightning connector for both power and data exchange.  For shortcut navigation, we’re also integrating a tactile interface based upon the phone’s accelerometer. Double tap the back of your phone to cycle through images or accept Pops from your friends.</p>
<p>Then there’s popSLATE app on the iPhone side.  You can take pictures with the camera, browse the image gallery, manage your library, connect with other users, send/receive images and messages, and Pop what you want, when you want it.</p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We have been working for years creating mobile-social solutions that bring people together to accomplish cool things. In a different start-up, we helped pioneer digital medicine, delivering a system packed with smartphone-connected sensors and social tools, to help people manage their own health and wellbeing.  <span>We have recruited a world-class team of hardware engineers, software developers and designers who have developed many connected consumer devices for the iPhone. W</span>e have dozens of patents and many years of start-up experience conceiving of and developing innovative products.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How We’ll Use the Funds</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve prototyped Pop'ing images from an iPhone to an E-Ink screen. We have strong support from E-Ink and are working closely with them to integrate their newest display technology for our ultra-thin, ruggedized screen.</p>
<p>With your help, we’ll refine our design and transfer it to manufacturing, add new features to the app, and buy materials to start making product.  We’ve built complex mobile systems before and know what it takes to get it done.</p>

BT 4.0 has already become pervasive and our goal is to have a flexible lighting solution.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>BT 4.0 technology (Bluetooth Smart) is a simpler protocol than WIFI or Zigbee (802.15.4) it will always be less costly for development and less likely to break since there are fewer parts. Setup is also simplified because it is just the iPhone and the bulb.</strong></h3>

We believe Bluetooth Smart is the right technology at the right time to make this happen.</strong></h3>
<h2> </h2>
<h1>DEVELOPERS</h1>
<h3><strong>The power of Bluetooth Smart is the simple programming model required for most Applications. Each bulb is a slave that has services and characteristics that are set by the Smart Phone App.  Smart Home Labs will publish a RoboSmart Programmer's guide with detailed explanations of the services and characteristics available to be programmed. In addition we will provide example source code of working applications for iOS, Android and Linux when the project is complete.</strong></h3>

Just like you breath without even thinking about it we want solutions that are secure and extremely easy to use. We believe Bluetooth Smart is the right technology at the right time to make this happen.
 
DEVELOPERS
The power of Bluetooth Smart is the simple programming model required for most Applications. Each bulb is a slave that has services and characteristics that are set by the Smart Phone App.  Smart Home Labs will publish a RoboSmart Programmer's guide with detailed explanations of the services and characteristics available to be programmed. In addition we will provide example source code of working applications for iOS, Android and Linux when the project is complete.

SO, IF YOU ARE GOING TO REPLACE YOUR INCANDESCENT BULBS OVERTIME, WITH LED BULBS, WHY NOT GET THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF HAVING THE ROBOSMART LIGHT BULB.
 

WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

<p><b></b></p>
<p>You are free to jot down just about anything.</p>
<p>Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel 6 will make doodling your favorite pastime. Tegware Bagel is so easy to use.   You can scribble anything and erase instantly with the simple push of a button. </p>
<p>The compact case adds almost no extra weight or bulk to your phone.  This case packs the convenience of a notepad into a package you already carry with you.</p>
<p>If you're one of those people who can't seem to get by without pen and paper, you'll love the feel of our elegant, ergonomically designed stylus and e-jot board. </p>

<p>Tegware Bagel provides the world's best natural handwriting experience, nothing like writing on smartphone or e-ink LCD.  Screens on smartphones have latency when you write, making the experience feel unnatural.  Tegware Bagel provides an experience closely resembling pen and paper.</p>
<p>Then again, if you're the type of person who prefers to go paperless and get by with just the phone, you know the pain of wanting a quick way to take notes.  With Tegware Bagel, there is no more waiting for your phone to power on just to jot down a quick note; no more putting someone on speaker phone just so you can use your phone to enter a phone number into your address book.</p>
<p>Those last little inconveniences are gone: now you go paperless but still enjoy the convenience that paper provides.  The e-jot board is always on, always waiting to help you when you just want to use a pen to do something quick.</p>
<p>And don't worry about the battery.  A single, non-replaceable battery lasts for an incredible 50,000 erases.  Use it 20 times a day, and it'll last for more than six years!</p>
<p>Tegware Bagel: It's easy, stylish, convenient, and fun. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">There is little to learn about this premium case before enjoying a wide spectrum of personalized experiences.  Just jot, draw or write.  Then push the button to erase.  Young and old and everyone in between will find it intuitive and super easy to use.</p>
<p>Extensive R&amp;D led us to design a case that provides you with both style and comfort in a compact package.  </p>

<p>Forget video games!  Now you can doodle or draw when you have a spare moment.  Play a game of hangman with a friend, or make a sketch of your surroundings.  Once you start using your Tegware Bagel, you'll find so many more ways to enjoy it.  Not everything needs an app - unleash your inner creativity instead, with the power of the blank page (or, rather, blank screen).</p>

go just like pen and paper.  Enjoy the ultimate natural handwriting experience
that could not be matched in other devices.  Write down a phone number, a cool

<p><b>1.  Who are we?</b></p>
<p>Wire Factory, Inc., a San Francisco based startup with co-founders from companies like Frog Design, Microsoft, Nokia, Blackberry, and others.  Tegware Bagel is only the first of many products that may come from Wire Factory as we focus on enabling the smarter lifestyle - accessories that make life easier.  </p>
<p><b>2. What is Tegware?</b></p>
<p>Tegware is our brand.  Tegware distills Wire Factory's vision to make people's lifestyle smarter by integrating related technologies.  Just like we carefully extract the essence of existing technologies to create building blocks for a new category of products, we extracted ""TEG"" from the word ""inTEGration"".   ""WARE"" is our ingredient as well as creation. </p>
<p><b>3. How does the e-jot board work? </b></p>
<p><span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></span></p>
<p>Tegware Bagel uses a pressure sensitive
LCD featuring the BoogieBoard™ LCD eWriter Technology. You can
control the thickness of the line as your write and it feels just like pen and
paper. You can find more information about BoogieBoard™ LCD eWriter

<p><b>9. What's the difference between the
Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel 6?</b></p>
<p>Tegware Bagel 360 is a sleek and stylish
iPhone 6 folder style case with a detachable hinge. The Patent-pending
detachable hinge feature allows you to easily detach and attach the e-jot
board.</p>
<p>Tegware Bagel 6 is diary style iPhone 6
case with a removable e-jot board.   Tegware Bagel 6 also provides a card
slot for carrying card (ex, id card, credit card etc.) </p>
<p>Both Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel

<p><b>10. How long does the battery last and
how do I charge it? </b></p>
<p>You don't need to charge Tegware Bagel.
Tegware Bagel does not consume power during writing. It only uses an extremely
small amount of battery while erasing the screen. We adopted a
Panasonic-made built-in coin battery (CR1616) for reliability. The battery
lasts over 50,000 erases and is non-replaceable.  </p>
<p><b>11. How can I save my picture? </b></p>

Fun doodling, anytime 

Jot down
anything. Erase it for another go.

You are free to jot down just about anything.
Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel 6 will make doodling your favorite pastime. Tegware Bagel is so easy to use.   You can scribble anything and erase instantly with the simple push of a button. 
The compact case adds almost no extra weight or bulk to your phone.  This case packs the convenience of a notepad into a package you already carry with you.
If you're one of those people who can't seem to get by without pen and paper, you'll love the feel of our elegant, ergonomically designed stylus and e-jot board. 



Tegware Bagel provides the world's best natural handwriting experience, nothing like writing on smartphone or e-ink LCD.  Screens on smartphones have latency when you write, making the experience feel unnatural.  Tegware Bagel provides an experience closely resembling pen and paper.
Then again, if you're the type of person who prefers to go paperless and get by with just the phone, you know the pain of wanting a quick way to take notes.  With Tegware Bagel, there is no more waiting for your phone to power on just to jot down a quick note; no more putting someone on speaker phone just so you can use your phone to enter a phone number into your address book.
Those last little inconveniences are gone: now you go paperless but still enjoy the convenience that paper provides.  The e-jot board is always on, always waiting to help you when you just want to use a pen to do something quick.
And don't worry about the battery.  A single, non-replaceable battery lasts for an incredible 50,000 erases.  Use it 20 times a day, and it'll last for more than six years!
Tegware Bagel: It's easy, stylish, convenient, and fun. 


There is little to learn about this premium case before enjoying a wide spectrum of personalized experiences.  Just jot, draw or write.  Then push the button to erase.  Young and old and everyone in between will find it intuitive and super easy to use.
Extensive R&D led us to design a case that provides you with both style and comfort in a compact package.  



The materials were chosen with care to create a tactile experience you will love. 




Meanwhile, we pack so much more functionality into the size of regular diary style case while still providing you a comfortable experience using both the e-jot board and your phone.

Forget video games!  Now you can doodle or draw when you have a spare moment.  Play a game of hangman with a friend, or make a sketch of your surroundings.  Once you start using your Tegware Bagel, you'll find so many more ways to enjoy it.  Not everything needs an app - unleash your inner creativity instead, with the power of the blank page (or, rather, blank screen).



Just flip it
open, it is ready to go.
All you need to do is slide out the stylus and start
writing.  There is nothing to turn on, no manual to read.  It is always ready to
go just like pen and paper.  Enjoy the ultimate natural handwriting experience
that could not be matched in other devices.  Write down a phone number, a cool
idea while on the street, or important appointments not to miss.  It is simply
ready at all times.


Can you find anything simpler than this?  Compare it with your smart device:






World Class

Protection
& Robustness like nothing else. 



Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel 6 have both gone through the toughest set of tests to ensure their reliability and robustness.  The screen proved to be erasable over 50,000 times under extreme conditions.

We picked the most durable materials to
withstand physical shocks and tough elements without compromising elegant
style. Using our finest craftsmanship, we paid utmost attention to complete
phone protection and access to all controls without hindrance.




Tegware Bagel 360 and Tegware Bagel 6

</div></div>","The future is upon us! Thanks to affordable quality electronics, we can have previously single-function objects become multifunction! We are here to take our completed, manufactured prototype through its final design phase. We need your help!  What is it?The once mundane 'water bottle' has been transformed to be so much more!When you're on the go, lugging around all your favorite gear can be restricting. Being light and agile means leaving good stuff behind. But not anymore! Introducing a brand new category - the SmartBottle!Features:
Safety
The HYDRA is looking out for YOU:
1. The translucent, frosted fluid chamber refracts The HYDRA's BRIGHT, FLASHING RED light ensuring you'll be seen by approaching vehicles when biking or walking.

2. Wearing headphones isolates you from your environment - very dangerous when cycling! The HYDRA’s powerful built-in Bluetooth speaker pumps music into your vicinity, letting you retain an aural connection to the world (and any potential hazards) around you!

 
Detachable, Water-Resistant Bluetooth Enabled Speaker:

Connect wirelessly to any Bluetooth enabled audio device and enjoy your favorite music, podcast or audiobook through The HYDRA's compact-yet-powerful 3W speaker. Flip it, extend the rubber legs, and set it on a surface for even better audio quality!

No Bluetooth device? No problem! Connect via a standard headphone jack (cable provided) or tune in to local FM radio without the need for an accompanying audio player. No need to replace batteries, this speaker is rechargeable. MICROPHONE!
The addition of a microphone has turned the bottle into a speakerphone! If your music is interrupted by a phone call, you can take the call, hands-free, and then get back to your tunes.
 
POWER BANK!!Charge Up Your Phone or other Electronic Devices: The HYDRA ensures you’ll never get caught with a dead smartphone battery again! The dedicated 4000 mAh power bank (with 2.1a USB output) ensures you’ll always have power whenever and wherever you need it.   LIGHTING!!!Light your Way: For safety and convenience The HYDRA features THREE powerful light choices: standard WHITE for illuminating the dark...  ... or FLASHING RED to alert others to your presence...   ... or RAINBOW, color cycling to set the mood for your party. Lightweight Design: The Hydra weighs just over one pound and is easily transportable.  
Secret Storage: Use the Hydra’s hidden chamber to stash small loose valuables. The sealed, false rubber bottom will ensure that your keys and cash don’t take a walk without you. 


Fluid Storage: 
Stay hydrated with 12 fluid ounces of your favorite beverage in the BPA-Free FDA approved bottle.
BIG BOTTLE!
 
The stock HYDRA bottle is 20oz - holds enough fluid for long trips! 
 

 
ADDED BONUS!
Regardless of how 'outdoorsy' you are, you likely spend much more time at home. So we thought, what might make this device useful around the house? 
Our answer? 
THE BEDSIDE COMPANION
When your device is not on a road trip, why not keep it on your bedside table, plugged-in so that it will be fully charged and ready for outdoor adventure at a moments notice.
The HYDRA has a beautiful lamp that will cycle through the colors of the rainbow. Add to that, The HYDRA SmartBottle: Nighttime Sleeper App and you've got sounds of the ocean surf, or summer rain, camping crickets, even light street noise to lull you to sleep. 

If you wake up in the middle of the night with dry mouth, The HYDRA is there to refresh you. The water is FREE. So is the App. Available for SOON on iOS and Android.
 
 
Colors!
We are currently going to make The HYDRA in FOUR different colors. 
You'll be able to pick your favorites, and mix-n-match with multiple bottles!
 
  
 
We need your help to take our fully-functioning prototype, that has all the internal components already in manufacturing, through a design update. The images above show the look of the update and the videos below show the physical device as it is currently. We are in the mold making phase now due to the fact that every feature has been improved from the state of the prototype - ALL new molds need to be made. It is very costly.


You can take The HYDRA wherever you go, keeping both electronic and creature comforts close at hand!

We're a company
passionate about people and solving their problems, 
We have developed an innovative
product which provides a truly safe and sanitary solution for using public restrooms and porta potties... More than 400,000 people use public restrooms every day
at roadside stops alone. Beaucoupdeforce
has created a Flushable PLASTIC,biodegradable, toilet seat cover which can
provide a complete barrier against all germs, liquids, and debris a person
could encounter when sitting on a toilet seat. Paper covers have never protected anyone from anything... the Revolution is here... TIDY POTTY is here...
                                        WHEN DO YOU NEED A TIDY POTTY?

WORK (at the office, on the site, the employee restrooms)

SCHOOL (do you trust sending your child to school without one? college dorms)

AMUSEMENT PARKS (the carnival, or the all day parks
MALLS (now you don't have to stop if you're not finished)

CONCERTS, (need we say more?)

FESTIVALS ([2] words ""Porta Potty"")

TRAVELING (rest stops/truck stops, bus/train stations, the bus/train itself, airports, airplanes, other countries,other peoples homes)

SPORTING EVENTS (whether your playing or watching) ..

      No matter the situation or the occasion ... Always be prepared!                     WHY A TIDY POTTY & NOT A PAPER COVER?    BOTH THE TIDY POTTY AND PAPER COVERS, ARE THIN AND LIGHT, BOTH ARE FLUSHABLE AND BIODEGRADABLE,  AND ARE SAFE FOR REGULAR AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS ALIKE...THE SIMILARITIES END THERE.... THE TIDY POTTY IS DURABLE ,STABLE , HAS MORE COVERAGE AND PROTECTION INSIDE AND OUT OF THE TOILET SEAT, ITS ALSO A NON-POROUS (100% BARRIER) AGAINST EVERYTHING YOU SEE AND DON'T SEE ON THAT SEAT... DESIGNED TO BE CARRIED WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO , PACKAGED WITH ITS OWN TIDY WIPES, AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST , COMES IN VERY COOL, EXCITING COLORS, AND DESIGNS (SO YOU LOOK GOOD BOTH CARRYING, AND USING IT ) MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WORKS !!!... PAPER IS FLIMSY, FRAGILE, POROUS(EVERYTHING SOAKS THRU) , BORING, AND JUST  PLAIN OLE DOESN'T WORK!!                                           Our 1st REVOLUTIONARY product is the TIDY POTTY, a innovative, patented portable toilet seat cover, made of a unique water soluble, biodegradable, PLASTIC (not paper) material.The TIDY POTTY was created to deliver a secure piece of mind that you and your family will be safe and protected from whatever you may encounter along the way.                   What truly adds to the awesomeness of this product, is the very unique patented ULTRA portable and fashionably discreet refillable dispensing device we call a TPD (Tidy Potty Dispenser). The cartridge consists of (3)Tidy Potty's, and is specifically  designed to be carried on your key-chain, lanyard, purse, you or your child's backpack, or a  tool belt.As if that isn't enough, we have also designed this nifty dual duty dispenser to include a roll of (15) sanitary towelettes we call ""Tidy Wipes"". Now, you are fully armed!!  Allowing you and your loved ones the freedom, and peace of mind to go wherever, and whenever ""nature calls"".Beautiful, but still Flushable!If that still isn't enough?What We Need: At this point We have completed the prototyping of this product and are preparing for our initial production run. We need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to get the ball rolling at the mass production level, so that we may bring this wonderful new REVOLUTIONARY product, not only to you,  We want to bring The Tidy Potty to the World and you can be a key part of that goal...What You Get:For helping us achieve our goal and for being an Early Backer, We are offering You over 50%-60% off of the retail price of this product, and some very Cool Limited Edition Perks,Not to mention being the first to have the piece of mind and security that comes with having a Tidy Potty in your pocket, purse, key-chain or backpack!!(at least 2 months before anyone else) We know We wont be successful without you, your support and shared excitement for this great new product... So we want you to reward and thank you for supporting us at this stage of our existence and
The Impact:
By pre-purchasing our product, you are not only going to be the 1st to own (about 2 months before anyone else) and benefit from the safety and security of the only flushable 100% barrier protection available, and receiving great perks and even more awesome (1) time only discounts... You are helping to bring this product to the World , by proving the need, value, and popularity of this one of a kind soon to be commodity item... You and only a few others will be able to say they played a key role in its existence in the marketplace...

You are witnessing, and participating in the emergence of a product rarely seen in its introduction into the market place, how many of us can say we remember when Kleenex, tampons, and condoms,even toilet paper (on or off the corrugated roll) came into existence? We tend to to take them for granted as if they have always been...NOW comes the long awaited next obvious evolution of a very ineffective and substandard product, The TIDY POTTY ...The 1st Flushable PLASTIC Toilet Seat Cover,designed to be carried with you wherever you go!
This is one of very few products that has the strong  potential to CHANGE the way we view and use public restrooms,(any restroom) even our own home bathrooms... You are witnessing and even have the opportunity to participate in this REVOLUTION ...OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
We understand that everyone can't contribute by buying a Tidy Potty, contributions of  $1 are also accepted and greatly appreciated... But if you aren't in the position to give monetarily, that's OK, We definitely understand ....
But, if you love what We are doing, and want to see the Tidy Potty at every grocery store, pharmacy, Wal-Mart, Target and any other major retailer  so that it will be available when you are ready to buy and most importantly , when you NEED it...We need you to spread the word, to your friends family, and associates, even the share this link, like us on Facebook andTweet about us @tidypotty, (#tidypotty, #tidypottyrevolution) SHOUT IT OUT TO THE WORLD!!!!!  We would be eternally grateful and speak highly of you too! Early drawings & concepts:Q&A:Q: Will the Tidy Potty be available free in public restrooms?A: No, but it may be available in vending machines in the next few years.Q: What is the fear of using public restrooms called?A: ""Sanity""...

<p>The research and development of the Pluto Wireless has reduced the risks substantially. Now, what is left is to bring everything together starting off with tooling (the molds for the Pluto). Some samples then ought to be tested to start production of the first batch.</p>

<p><em>Thank you all so very much for our successful campaign!  450% of our goal with over 1,500 contributors!</em></p>
<p><br/><em>We're working hard to ensure you get your iSmartAlarm home security system as soon as possible, and we're still on pace for shipping to begin at the beginning of the last week of April, 2013.</em></p>
<p><br/><em>If you have a moment, check out the site we have set up at <a href=""http://www.iSmartAlarm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iSmartAlarm.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>If you haven't ordered yet, you can order from our site!</em></p>
<p><em>We're still working on the site, and it will go through lots of cosmetic and material changes in the coming weeks, but we would love any feedback at indiegogo@ismartalarm.com </em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER - This Indiegogo campaign is for US and Canada consumers only.  We will be expanding internationally later in 2013, and as soon as we are able to support/ship to/sell in your country/region, we will make the announcements here and on our ismartalarm.com website.  Thanks again for your support!</strong></p>
<p>Hi Everyone!  Thanks for taking a look at our campaign, and full steam ahead!  Make sure to check out some of the press we've gotten (bottom), and please please please check out the updated FAQ at the bottom for shipping information, timelines, and other details we were asked in the show and over email.  We update it constantly.  If you have any questions/comments/concerns/cupcakes, please email us at <a href=""mailto:indiegogo@ismartalarm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo@ismartalarm.com</a></p>
<p>Now on to the regularly scheduled program -</p>
<p>There are lots of options for home security services and ""smarthome"" products, but what we have always noticed is that a) They usually come with long-term contracts and monthly fees, b) They are expensive to buy and to have installed, and c) The amount of actual ""control"" the user has is limited by whichever big corporation makes the product and runs the monitoring center. </p>
<p>We are a company of home-renters and home-owners.  We are people with families and we are single men and women.  We have pets.  We have children.  We have had our homes broken into, and we have had our belongings stolen.  We have realized we left the windows open after crawling into bed, and we have worried we forgot to close and lock the door after leaving the house to go to work.  We <em>love</em> technology, and we <em>need</em> safety.  We don't want to pay for monthly monitoring center or service fees, and we have no interest in signing 3-year contracts.</p>
<h1><strong>This is iSmartAlarm</strong></h1>
<p>We have based our programming and construction on four major tenets -</p>
<h3><em><strong>Unparalleled Intelligence</strong></em></h3>
<p><img alt=""CubeOne - The brains of the system"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/317/258/fe73cdeb496407133781ebfc2e152b9f_large.png?1356632247"" src="""" style=""""/>CubeOne - The brains of the system</p>
<ul>
<li>Control the system from anywhere in the world - turn it on or off, watch through the directional camera, check family member statuses, and more</li>
<li>iPhone-enabled apps and state-of-the-art cloud technology</li>
<li>Real-time device management including on/off, battery status, status updates, user information, and more</li>
<li>Almost unlimited expandability for a variety of smart home applications</li>
</ul>
<h3><em><strong>Outstanding Performance</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Instant response time through phone call, voicemail, and push notifications</li>
<li>Real time camera monitoring with iCamera - anytime, anywhere, for any reason with the swipe of a finger</li>
<li>You can manage and save on energy costs by having a record and real-time examples of doors and windows opening and closing</li>
<li>Control for the whole family, or for only certain members.  You can set up emergency contacts, customized notifications, and more</li>
</ul>
<h3><em><strong>Flexibility</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>All devices are mobile, light, and easy to use</li>
<li>You can add, remove, and move any of the devices - perfect for renters or if your concerns change</li>
<li>Say goodbye to running telephone lines throughout your house or drilling holes in your wall for installation</li>
<li>iPhone App is customizable to keep track of your home and your family, in the manner you prefer.  Use names, nicknames, pictures, and unique identifiers for every family member and device in the house</li>
</ul>
<h3><em><strong>Cool</strong></em></h3>
<p><img alt=""iCamera - Complete control and visibility at all times, from anywhere, with the swipe of your finger on your iPhone"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/316/663/40f481a16f2a0e892e031c4ea3d5d74c_large.jpg?1356568198"" src="""" style=""""/>iCamera - Complete control and visibility at all times, from anywhere, with the swipe of your finger on your iPhone</p>
<ul>
<li>The iSmartAlarm was made to match the style, simplicity, and unibody design of the iPhone</li>
<li>Form and function - There's no reason to sacrifice security for beauty, or vice versa</li>
<li>The level of control is completely up to you - Monitor constantly, or only when you want.  The choice is yours</li>
<li>Motion sensors, infrared cameras, door/window sensors, all at the touch of your finger with your iSmartAlarm app - How cool is that?</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of every piece that comes out for the line will be of the highest caliber.  We will make sure, through rigorous design and testing, that when we make and market a product, it will be something we want in our homes and will trust in our homes.  We want to keep the price low and the quality high.  We want to expand the product to include and run on Android and Windows operating systems, tablets and with wizard wands.  We want to offer different colors and customizable skins (mahogany?  Favorite college football team?  Hello Kitty?  R2-D2?)</p>
<p>Imagine the possibilities that can grow from the iSmartAlarm -</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GPS pet tracker</em></li>
<li><em>Pet feeder automation</em></li>
<li><em>Remote door lock/unlock</em></li>
<li><em>Home temperature automation</em></li>
<li><em>Electricity savings by turning lights on and off or dimming them</em></li>
<li><em>Remote oven control</em></li>
<li><em>Sprinkler/yard automation</em></li>
<li><em>Remote heater/air conditioning control for the car</em></li>
<li><em>What else can you think of?  Let us know!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The packages will ship in April, and customers will have their choices of the packages that best suit their needs.  You'll be able to mix and match packages as well - Want more than one package?  You can use multiple, and the CubeOne CPU will automatically recognize all the devices.  Later on, you'll be able to buy the individual devices separately for low low LOW prices (That was my car salesman pitch).</p>

<p>We've built our prototypes and we've tested them to make sure they are up to our standards. But designing and building a prototype is one thing - Manufacturing, marketing, and getting the iSmartAlarm into lots of peoples' hands and homes is another.</p>
<p>We’ve figured out our raw material sources, manufacturing processes, and our supply chain and infrastructure. We need your help to take the next step. We need funds to put the iSmartAlarm into production.</p>
<p>We will run into challenges, sure. Everyone and everything does. But challenges bring solutions, and, many times, even more successful results. We are motivated, excited about the possibilities, and we hope you are too.</p>
<p>With your help, we can get past any issues we may run into with with advanced laboratory testing, meticulous and conscientious manufacturing procedures, and hiring the best people to help us grow.</p>

<p>Right now we only ship to US (free shipping) and Canada (add $15 to your order).  We will be adding additional countries later, hopefully Q3/Q4 this year.  We've got to nail down wi-fi protocols, country-specific requirements (like 220v vs. 110v in US and Canada), shipping details, etc. </p>
<p><strong>What is required to use the iSmartAlarm system for my home?                  </strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Very simple - No telephone landline is required. All you need is an internet router with regular high speed internet services and your iPhone, and you're  good to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where will I be able to buy the iSmartAlarm when it is released?</strong></p>
<p>At first, to keep costs low, we are going to focus sales on our own online channels - the iSmartAlarm website, sites like Amazon, Yahoo! Products, etc.  As we grow, we will be able to branch out into brick-and-mortar box stores and Apple Stores (hopefully)</p>
<p><strong>Does an iPhone come with the system?</strong></p>
<p>No.  But let's face it, you probably knew the answer to that question.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I move, and want to take the system with me?</strong></p>
<p>No problem, every device is detachable from the wall/door/window you placed them on, and completely mobile.  No hardwires, no drilling holes, no running ethernet cables all over the place.  You can move tomorrow morning and have the system up and running by lunch.</p>
<p><strong>How are the devices powered?<br/></strong></p>
<p>The door/window sensors and the remote control/key fobs use button batteries (like watches), and the motion detector uses AAA.  The camera and the CubeOne plug into the AC outlet for now (may offer battery-backup later)</p>
<p><strong>What's the battery life?<br/></strong></p>
<p>We've tested, based on approx 30 ""uses"" a day (door open/close, motion sensor detecting motion, that sort of thing), and the battery life for all the battery-operated devices is about 12-18 months, depending on how often they are used.  The app also keeps a running tab of estimated battery life, so with the app you'll know when it's time to change the battery.</p>
<p><strong>Will the sensors work through walls?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it works through walls, with devices up to 100 feet away from the CubeOne.  Basically, as long as your laptop connects to your wi-fi, your iSmartAlarm devices will work there as well.</p>
<p><strong>Will the iSmartAlarm package come with an instruction guide?  Will the iSmartAlarm App have a tutorial?  What if I get confused?</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry, we'll have you covered.  Though we hope we have made it simple to use, you'll have the App, instruction manual, our website, and our customer service to help you if you need it.</p>
<p><strong>What's the size of the devices?</strong></p>
<p>The camera is a little under 5"", the motion sensor is the same height as the camera, and the contact sensors a bit over 2"".</p>
<p><strong>Does the iSmartAlarm App work with Android?</strong></p>
<p>Soon, it will.  We're expecting it to be ready and out very close to our shipping dates.  We're launching on the iOS and then expanding from there.  Being able to escalate Android development is one of the biggest reasons for our Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a warranty or guarantee for the iSmartAlarm?</strong></p>
<p>We know this sort of thing is very important, and we're working on it as a high priority. We can't make any promises, but we CAN guarantee you will receive a properly working iSmartAlarm package.  We'll work on the warranty aspects and post with updates.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Will we be able to add on additional devices at a later time?  Order a la carte?</strong></p>
<p>Yup!  You'll be able to order each piece individually in April, and additional devices can be added to the CubeOne at any time.  For right now, you can add the $29 Package (for 2 additional Contact Sensors) and the $49 Package (for 2 additional Contact Sensors PLUS 1 more Motion Detector) to any existing package.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The camera in the (insert media source here) video from CES looks different.  What's up?</strong></p>
<p>The camera shown at CES was the beta shell.  Check out the ""Images"" section for a picture of the ""Jellyfish,"" the iCamera that will come with all Indiegogo premium package orders.</p>

Thank you all so very much for our successful campaign!  450% of our goal with over 1,500 contributors!
We're working hard to ensure you get your iSmartAlarm home security system as soon as possible, and we're still on pace for shipping to begin at the beginning of the last week of April, 2013.
If you have a moment, check out the site we have set up at iSmartAlarm.com
If you haven't ordered yet, you can order from our site!
We're still working on the site, and it will go through lots of cosmetic and material changes in the coming weeks, but we would love any feedback at indiegogo@ismartalarm.com 
 
PLEASE REMEMBER - This Indiegogo campaign is for US and Canada consumers only.  We will be expanding internationally later in 2013, and as soon as we are able to support/ship to/sell in your country/region, we will make the announcements here and on our ismartalarm.com website.  Thanks again for your support!
Hi Everyone!  Thanks for taking a look at our campaign, and full steam ahead!  Make sure to check out some of the press we've gotten (bottom), and please please please check out the updated FAQ at the bottom for shipping information, timelines, and other details we were asked in the show and over email.  We update it constantly.  If you have any questions/comments/concerns/cupcakes, please email us at indiegogo@ismartalarm.com
Now on to the regularly scheduled program -
There are lots of options for home security services and ""smarthome"" products, but what we have always noticed is that a) They usually come with long-term contracts and monthly fees, b) They are expensive to buy and to have installed, and c) The amount of actual ""control"" the user has is limited by whichever big corporation makes the product and runs the monitoring center. 
We are a company of home-renters and home-owners.  We are people with families and we are single men and women.  We have pets.  We have children.  We have had our homes broken into, and we have had our belongings stolen.  We have realized we left the windows open after crawling into bed, and we have worried we forgot to close and lock the door after leaving the house to go to work.  We love technology, and we need safety.  We don't want to pay for monthly monitoring center or service fees, and we have no interest in signing 3-year contracts.
This is iSmartAlarm
We have based our programming and construction on four major tenets -
Unparalleled Intelligence
CubeOne - The brains of the system

Control the system from anywhere in the world - turn it on or off, watch through the directional camera, check family member statuses, and more
iPhone-enabled apps and state-of-the-art cloud technology
Real-time device management including on/off, battery status, status updates, user information, and more
Almost unlimited expandability for a variety of smart home applications

Outstanding Performance

Instant response time through phone call, voicemail, and push notifications
Real time camera monitoring with iCamera - anytime, anywhere, for any reason with the swipe of a finger
You can manage and save on energy costs by having a record and real-time examples of doors and windows opening and closing
Control for the whole family, or for only certain members.  You can set up emergency contacts, customized notifications, and more

Flexibility

All devices are mobile, light, and easy to use
You can add, remove, and move any of the devices - perfect for renters or if your concerns change
Say goodbye to running telephone lines throughout your house or drilling holes in your wall for installation
iPhone App is customizable to keep track of your home and your family, in the manner you prefer.  Use names, nicknames, pictures, and unique identifiers for every family member and device in the house

Cool
iCamera - Complete control and visibility at all times, from anywhere, with the swipe of your finger on your iPhone

The iSmartAlarm was made to match the style, simplicity, and unibody design of the iPhone
Form and function - There's no reason to sacrifice security for beauty, or vice versa
The level of control is completely up to you - Monitor constantly, or only when you want.  The choice is yours
Motion sensors, infrared cameras, door/window sensors, all at the touch of your finger with your iSmartAlarm app - How cool is that?

The quality of every piece that comes out for the line will be of the highest caliber.  We will make sure, through rigorous design and testing, that when we make and market a product, it will be something we want in our homes and will trust in our homes.  We want to keep the price low and the quality high.  We want to expand the product to include and run on Android and Windows operating systems, tablets and with wizard wands.  We want to offer different colors and customizable skins (mahogany?  Favorite college football team?  Hello Kitty?  R2-D2?)
Imagine the possibilities that can grow from the iSmartAlarm -

GPS pet tracker
Pet feeder automation
Remote door lock/unlock
Home temperature automation
Electricity savings by turning lights on and off or dimming them
Remote oven control
Sprinkler/yard automation
Remote heater/air conditioning control for the car
What else can you think of?  Let us know!

The packages will ship in April, and customers will have their choices of the packages that best suit their needs.  You'll be able to mix and match packages as well - Want more than one package?  You can use multiple, and the CubeOne CPU will automatically recognize all the devices.  Later on, you'll be able to buy the individual devices separately for low low LOW prices (That was my car salesman pitch).

We've built our prototypes and we've tested them to make sure they are up to our standards. But designing and building a prototype is one thing - Manufacturing, marketing, and getting the iSmartAlarm into lots of peoples' hands and homes is another.
We’ve figured out our raw material sources, manufacturing processes, and our supply chain and infrastructure. We need your help to take the next step. We need funds to put the iSmartAlarm into production.
We will run into challenges, sure. Everyone and everything does. But challenges bring solutions, and, many times, even more successful results. We are motivated, excited about the possibilities, and we hope you are too.
With your help, we can get past any issues we may run into with with advanced laboratory testing, meticulous and conscientious manufacturing procedures, and hiring the best people to help us grow.

<p>Many thanks to all our contributors!  Despite not reaching our goal, BAS is pushing forward with the prototype of the Path To Zero app.  In fact, we're more committed than ever to developing an app that is up to the challenge of helping people take control of their energy needs while saving both time and money.  During the campaign, we were able to develop a wireframe of the on-boarding portion of the app, which we'll be using to help demonstrate our concept as we continue raising funds.  </p>
<p>Please get in contact with us, we'd love to hear from you!  You can always contact us through our websites, linked below, or by following the links on this site to Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Energy
is a basic need. Without gas and electricity it is hard to imagine how we could
continue to power our homes, businesses and communities.  Yet, today,
scarce resources provide the energy we depend on; we are currently using fossil
fuels 5 million times faster than the Earth produces them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditional
energy providers make more money when their customers consume more energy, and
the average consumer uses energy that comes mostly from the combustion of
fossil fuels.  Put simply, this is a recipe for disaster.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>BAS Holding has a solution and we call it the “Path To
Zero”.  Through the Path To Zero, we earn more money as our customers use
LESS energy.  We call ourselves BAS because we believe this innovative business
model truly Benefits All Stakeholders.  The Path To Zero works because
when we provide our customers with gas and electricity we choose not to take a
profit on this supply.  Instead, we take the potential profit margin and
use it to help our customers invest in energy solutions that will lower their
total energy consumption and switch their energy supply over to renewable
sources.  BAS makes money by facilitating clean energy services and not by
supplying dirty power.  </p>

<p></p>
<p>The Path To Zero is already working
in the Netherlands where we started our business four years ago.  Now, we
want to bring the Path To Zero to the world through a free mobile app.  The app will provide a
single interface with all of the automated tools, or modules, needed to conduct energy
scans, develop investment plans with customizable budgets, and then connect with
local retailers and contractors in a digital marketplace.  The app will also allow you to monitor your
progress and savings, share your success with friends and family, and have fun
along the way to energy independence. </p>
<p>We’ve
already started developing the user interface and the backend algorithm that
will help people in energy markets all over the world make smart investments in
their clean energy future. </p>

<p><b>The Energy Audit Module</b></p>
<p>This module carries out an automated energy audit for your building and home.  Depending on your energy goals, this can be a quick scan of a part of your building or a comprehensive and detailed audit.  Whatever your goals, the audit will produce a roadmap that shows how to achieve energy savings over a period of time. The audit will also take into account expenditures for your current and future supply of electricity and gas to ensure that your future supply will decrease over time on its way to zero.  During this process, the app will help you build a user profile so that you can  add more detail or update any recent changes.  The app will tell you when and where more information is needed to make smart decisions - saving you time and ensuring the most accurate results.    </p>
<p><b>Calculation Tool Module</b></p>
<p>This module will serve as the 'brain' of the Path To Zero and encompass the business intelligence and the data algorithms that our App will be based on.  Here we apply our expertise to match proven products and solutions with the information gained during your energy audit to deliver the following outputs:</p>
<p><i>A Path To Zero Plan: </i>you will be presented with an clean energy investment roadmap consisting of all the major solutions pertaining to appliances, lighting, heating, insulation, and monitoring with an expected return on investment. All of the necessary maintenance, insurance, guarantees and administrative services will also be included.  Whether you are ready to take a few simple steps or make major building improvements, we have a plan for you!</p>
<p><i>Energy Budget: </i>the App will calculate the fixed monthly energy budget that will be required for you to attain the optimal energy savings, much like a clean energy mortgage.  An initial investment can be used to accelerate your Path To Zero and achieve the maximum energy savings right away.  You will be able to adjust the budget at any time and watch how the priority of your investments and your path to energy independence change - putting you in complete control.</p>
<p><b>Marketplace Module</b></p>
<p>This module will consist of a database of all local suppliers and vendors. The App will link each of the solutions that are outlined in your Path To Zero plan to a supplier/vendor. All selected suppliers and vendors will have the opportunity to plug into this module and present their solutions with specific pricing and technical specifications. The module will then link you with the best suppliers. This way you will always get the lowest price and highest quality available with all measures and costs reported on a monthly or quarterly invoice.  The module will also be intelligent enough to continually monitor the real time pricing of energy and subsequently switch your energy supplier based on the lowest energy price at any given time (if this is possible in your region).<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </b></p>
<p><b>Monitoring Module</b></p>
<p>This module is where we will monitor your energy consumption in real time.  This level of monitoring affords you intelligent insights with respect to where you stand on the Path To Zero roadmap.  You will also receive alert messages when your energy consumption is higher than personalised benchmarks set for daily, weekly, and monthly periods. You will be able to view any related invoices with as much detail as you desire i.e. energy budget, energy supply/consumption, and solution implementation costs.<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">            </b></p>
<p><b>Gamification and Social Media Module </b></p>
<p>This module will provide the opportunity to engage in social sharing and community building activities. The App will make it fun to share your Path To Zero progress via games and social media. Features here could include options and tips that will speed up your Path To Zero, incentives and badges for successful implementations, and a carbon calculator for making comparisons with your ‘energy peers’.</p>

<p>It is the independence, ownership, and empowerment of our customers that drives our commitment to building an app that will bring power to the people. We envision the Path To Zero as a platform and BAS as a service provider. Our chief tasks are to match supply and demand through our platform, take away all complexities of gaining energy independence, and ensure a seamless Path To Zero for all energy users.</p>
<p>We currently serve around 5,500 commercial buildings and residences. Four years after our start in 2010, using our own investments, we have annual revenues over €12 million and employ a full time team of 15+ highly skilled co-workers who ensure the delivery and further development of the Path to Zero.  Our efforts were further recognized when our proposal to scale this concept to serve entire communities won the People's Choice and Judge's Special Commendation at the 2014 Climate CoLab Challenge, an international sustainability competition hosted by MIT.</p>
<p>When scaled up to the level of neighbourhoods or communities, the Path to Zero will empower people to have durable ownership over their energy needs and provide a self-financing solution to transit into a world that runs on clean energy. For a city like Rotterdam, our organisation’s home, this would result in 850 million tons of CO2 saved – the equivalent emissions of over 100 million cars per year. Now imagine if we were able to take our solution to your house or your building and then to your community followed by your neighbourhood and eventually your city. </p>
<p>We will develop an international platform that accelerates the energy transition, facilitate a community that helps its members connect and work together, and provide suppliers and partners with a platform where they will automatically be able to sell their best products for the best prices.  </p>
<p>We are fully committed to investing the time, energy and resources to implement the Path To Zero in households, neighbourhoods and cities across the world.  </p>

Power in the palm of your hand


Energy
is a basic need. Without gas and electricity it is hard to imagine how we could
continue to power our homes, businesses and communities.  Yet, today,
scarce resources provide the energy we depend on; we are currently using fossil
fuels 5 million times faster than the Earth produces them. 

Traditional
energy providers make more money when their customers consume more energy, and
the average consumer uses energy that comes mostly from the combustion of
fossil fuels.  Put simply, this is a recipe for disaster.  

BAS Holding has a solution and we call it the “Path To
Zero”.  Through the Path To Zero, we earn more money as our customers use
LESS energy.  We call ourselves BAS because we believe this innovative business
model truly Benefits All Stakeholders.  The Path To Zero works because
when we provide our customers with gas and electricity we choose not to take a
profit on this supply.  Instead, we take the potential profit margin and
use it to help our customers invest in energy solutions that will lower their
total energy consumption and switch their energy supply over to renewable
sources.  BAS makes money by facilitating clean energy services and not by
supplying dirty power.  



The Path To Zero is already working
in the Netherlands where we started our business four years ago.  Now, we
want to bring the Path To Zero to the world through a free mobile app.  The app will provide a
single interface with all of the automated tools, or modules, needed to conduct energy
scans, develop investment plans with customizable budgets, and then connect with
local retailers and contractors in a digital marketplace.  The app will also allow you to monitor your
progress and savings, share your success with friends and family, and have fun
along the way to energy independence. 
We’ve
already started developing the user interface and the backend algorithm that
will help people in energy markets all over the world make smart investments in
their clean energy future. 

We
are looking for your support to help push this project forward and to become
part of the clean energy movement.

making clean energy services available by putting power in the palm of your
hand.

<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>The main developers of the CellMegaPhone are Miguel Orozco and Adam McLaughlin.  All of the people involved in this project work in other jobs and other industries.  We have come together to create a way for everyone to have a hands free option no matter how tech savvy they are.  The original idea came from Miguel Orozco as a way to eliminate all the headaches of Bluetooth and still use the phone hands free.  Adam worked alongside Miguel, designing and modifying until the right shape and sound was found.  After months of prototypes and tens of  thousands of dollars spent in development we are ready to go to production.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h3>
<p>We need your help to raise enough money to finish the molds, develop the packaging and produce enough to start selling in stores.</p>
<p>We feel we have a product everyone can benefit from and that everyone needs therefore we like to give you an opportunity to help  raise enough money to finish the molds, finish the development of  the packaging and produce enough to start selling in stores.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How we will use the funds</strong></h3>
<p>We have already put half the money down on building the molds to produce the CellMegaPhone.  We need to complete the molds, develop the packaging, and make our first run of production units.</p>
<p>We have invested over half of the funds needed to get the CellMegaPhone into the hands of you and your loved ones. We are now creating an opportunity for you to be a part of something exciting. The funds raised will go towards completing the molds, completing the development of the packaging  to then produce the CellMegaPhone and get it to you.</p>

The main developers of the CellMegaPhone are Miguel Orozco and Adam McLaughlin.  All of the people involved in this project work in other jobs and other industries.  We have come together to create a way for everyone to have a hands free option no matter how tech savvy they are.  The original idea came from Miguel Orozco as a way to eliminate all the headaches of Bluetooth and still use the phone hands free.  Adam worked alongside Miguel, designing and modifying until the right shape and sound was found.  After months of prototypes and tens of  thousands of dollars spent in development we are ready to go to production.
 
Why Indiegogo?
We need your help to raise enough money to finish the molds, develop the packaging and produce enough to start selling in stores.
We feel we have a product everyone can benefit from and that everyone needs therefore we like to give you an opportunity to help  raise enough money to finish the molds, finish the development of  the packaging and produce enough to start selling in stores.
 
How we will use the funds
We have already put half the money down on building the molds to produce the CellMegaPhone.  We need to complete the molds, develop the packaging, and make our first run of production units.
We have invested over half of the funds needed to get the CellMegaPhone into the hands of you and your loved ones. We are now creating an opportunity for you to be a part of something exciting. The funds raised will go towards completing the molds, completing the development of the packaging  to then produce the CellMegaPhone and get it to you.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>
<p><b>Isn't dry firing bad for your gun?</b></p>
<p>Dry fire that hurts a weapon is when you pull the trigger and there is nothing for the firing pin to hit.  The retaining pin absorbs the impact and over time, this retaining pin can get worn and eventually break.  When using a snap cap - or in this case, a laser bullet - the firing pin hits the hard rubber back of the laser bullet which absorbs the impact.  There is no damage to the weapon.</p>
<p><b>How does the Laser Bullet not get ejected?</b></p>
<p>The Laser Bullet is designed without a rim.  Without a rim, the ejector pin has nothing to grab onto.   To remove the Laser Bullet, you have to push it out with a pencil or cleaning rod.</p>
<p><b><b>What about  recoil?</b><br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Dry fire training does not have recoil.   Managing recoil is only one aspect of becoming a better marksman.  Trigger control and sight management are two important components that can be improved through dry fire training. </p>
<p> Dry fire training is used by the FBI, the US military, police departments and competitive shooters.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">In an interview with world champion marksman Robert Vogel, he was asked,  ""How often do you dry fire?""</span></p>
<p>He answers, ""In one form or another, just about every day. For sheer skill building I feel it has no equal. For every live round that I actually fire, I probably mimic that round eight to 10 times in dry fire.""</p>

<div>
<p><b>How Accurate is it?</b><br/></p>
<p>There are two factors to the accuracy - the Laser Bullet itself shooting perfectly straight and the App's ability to accurately detect the hit.  The company we are manufacturing Laser Bullets with has been making bore sights and assures me about the quality.  They adjust each laser bullet to make it precise and straight before shipment.  I've had the opportunity to test a few samples and have been pleased with their accuracy so far.<br/></p>
</div>
<div><p>The second factor that determines accuracy is the App's ability to detect the laser hit on the target.  This is determined by the user and how the settings are adjusted.  It can be perfectly accurate when adjusted properly.  We are working on an algorithm to automate this by the time the final version of the app is available.  The accuracy of the App can be seen in this video. </p></div>

</div>
<div><b>What is the range?</b></div>
<div>I can't give you a definite number of yards because there are several factors which affect the range.  I've shot at 60 ft with a handgun, and will be doing tests with a rifle soon to try to try to get a better answer.  The app  doesn't care whether you are 10ft or 100 yards away, it is simply looking for the red laser to show up on the target.  Lasers can go for hundreds of yards and still be seen - so it becomes a factor of how bright that laser is when it hits the target.  Unless you live in a very large mansion, you won't hit the limits of range unless you are outdoors.  Being outdoors creates an additional problem because sunlight on the target washes out the laser light hitting the target and makes it difficult for the app to distinguish the laser mark.  I've used it outdoors, but it must be in the shade.  At night, it would likely work for over a hundred yards, but that hasn't been tested yet.</div>
<div>
<p><b>When will it be shipped?</b></p>
<p>We are just waiting on delivery of the products, then we will start shipping.  </p>
</div>
<b>When will the Android version be available?</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Android version is finished.  It is available on the Google Play store.</p>
<p><b>Can I use a different Target?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The target is an 8.5x11 sheet of paper.  You could print out anything you want and slide it into the target holder.  In testing, it works best when it's black lines on white paper.  Hits in a dark area, like a solid black bullseye, can be more difficult for the App to detect.  </p>

The Plastic Injection mold for the iTarget Sled.



The Idea
Like many Americans, I own a gun for home protection.  It usually sits in a gun safe, locked away and out of sight.  I like shooting for fun and practice, but I rarely find time in my busy day to get to the gun range.  Also, as the price of ammo has increased, so has the expense of going to the range.   I was looking for a safe way to train at home, but living in the city of Los Angeles, my options were limited.




Firearm training systems that use lasers instead of live bullets seemed like the answer.   There are multiple Laser Training Systems on the market.  As I researched, I was surprised at how limited and expensive these systems were.  Some of the more complex systems went for well over $1000, while the cheaper hardware targeting systems lacked features and still sold for over $300.

Being an app developer,  I saw an opportunity to build an app capable of functioning like these much more expensive Laser Training systems.  I went to work and created the first iTarget app, ""BULLSEYE"".






After the first App was created, I started demonstrating it for friends and family.  My wife was able to overcome her fear of guns by using iTarget with a Laser Bullet instead of live ammo.  As I watched my wife and her friends enjoy target shooting for the first time, I knew I had developed a product that everyone could enjoy. 


I also knew that this was a product that gun owners would LOVE!  Using a 3D printer, I built the prototype of the iTarget sled to hold the target and the phone in optimal positions for the App to work.   The sled is designed to acoustically amplify the gun shot sound and allows for multi-directional movement to adjust for the  viewing angle of the phone's camera.  The iTarget System is patent pending.






What You Get and How It Works
A complete iTarget system consists of three parts - A Laser Bullet, the iTarget App and the iTarget Sled.  It works with your actual firearm.  

The iTarget Sled 

The iTarget sled holds the shooting target and your phone in such a way that the phone's camera has a clear full screen view of the target.  The sled adjusts to grip any size phone.  The target distance is adjustable to compensate for different phone cameras.  You adjust the sled to fill the Phone's display with the image of the target.The sled comes with three different shooting targets, one for each of the upcoming apps.   You can also print out any image you'd like on standard 8.5"" x 11"" paper and use it for target practice with good results.  




The Laser Bullet


The iTarget Laser Bullet is shaped like a real bullet and is inserted into the chamber of the gun.  The snap-cap style design does not damage the weapon.  The Laser Bullets are rimless, so they are not ejected by the gun after each shot.  When the trigger is pulled, the firing pin strikes the hard rubber back of the Laser Bullet, causing it to fire a laser beam at the target.  The iTarget Laser Bullets are currently available in 9mm - .380 ACP - 38 Special - .40 S&W - .45 ACP and .223

If you contribute to this campaign and get a perk that includes a Laser Bullet, we will send out an email asking you which caliber(s) you would like before shipping them.




The Upcoming iTarget App
The iTarget Pro app is now available for Android and IOS.  Search for it on the App Store and Google Play.
There are links to download the app on our website at www.iTargetPro.com

The Bullseye App will be offered free of charge.  Other training modes will be available for $4.99 each through in-app purchase.


BULLSEYE allows you to shoot an unlimited number of shots at a standard scoring target.  It keeps track of the total score while showing you clearly were each shot hit.  It also counts the number of shots fired and lets you enter the distance you are shooting from.  If you shoot well and want to share with your friends, you can save the results to your phone's camera roll.  This app and it's functionality is seen in the demonstration video for this campaign.



QUICK DRAW is meant to test your speed as well as your accuracy.  Once the game starts, the App will wait a random number of seconds before it says ""DRAW!""  Once the command to draw is given, a timer starts counting to measure how fast you can react and shoot the target.   Each shot is displayed on the phone's screen, with your reaction time directly under it.  The game ends after 10 shots are fired.  You can also save your fastest times to your phone's camera roll.

With all of these Apps, one very cool feature is the ability to use an Apple TV or, for Android, a Google Chromecast to see your phone's screen live on your TV as you shoot.  This is demonstrated in the campaign video.

The second factor that determines accuracy is the App's ability to detect the laser hit on the target.  This is determined by the user and how the settings are adjusted.  It can be perfectly accurate when adjusted properly.  We are working on an algorithm to automate this by the time the final version of the app is available.  The accuracy of the App can be seen in this video. 



What is the range?
I can't give you a definite number of yards because there are several factors which affect the range.  I've shot at 60 ft with a handgun, and will be doing tests with a rifle soon to try to try to get a better answer.  The app  doesn't care whether you are 10ft or 100 yards away, it is simply looking for the red laser to show up on the target.  Lasers can go for hundreds of yards and still be seen - so it becomes a factor of how bright that laser is when it hits the target.  Unless you live in a very large mansion, you won't hit the limits of range unless you are outdoors.  Being outdoors creates an additional problem because sunlight on the target washes out the laser light hitting the target and makes it difficult for the app to distinguish the laser mark.  I've used it outdoors, but it must be in the shade.  At night, it would likely work for over a hundred yards, but that hasn't been tested yet.

When will it be shipped?
We are just waiting on delivery of the products, then we will start shipping.  

When will the Android version be available?


The Android version is finished.  It is available on the Google Play store.
Can I use a different Target?

The target is an 8.5x11 sheet of paper.  You could print out anything you want and slide it into the target holder.  In testing, it works best when it's black lines on white paper.  Hits in a dark area, like a solid black bullseye, can be more difficult for the App to detect.

<p>We all are counting days until Apple Watch launches in early 2015.<br/>
Right now we are excited to introduce to you our creation of a premium protective system
that accurate engineered and well manufactured to match quality and style of Apple
Watch. LAVA case is the product that we will be proud to put our name on as creators
and you will be proud to show your friends and explore your favorite sports and physical
activities with. </p>

<p>Apple Watch allows you to keep track of your body's reactions while exercising or in
extreme situation, measuring your heartbeat, calories youʼve burned, or another
physical activities you perform through the day and Lava Case will help you to get this
experience to the new level.
</p>
<p>LAVA case transforms Apple Watch into an organic looking, highly-protected device -
the system that can read your body's information in any environment while doing casual
sport activities, or enjoying your adrenaline rush in extreme situations: underwater while
diving, catching the highest waves while surfing, exploring a new hill while mountain
biking, checking an amplitude heights of your jump while snowboarding. You can
experience even more adrenaline rush and less stress for your Apple Watch knowing
that they are protected by LAVA Case.

<p></p>
<p>We are using only the high-quality materials: ballistic polymer, carbon fiber, anodized
aluminum, stainless steel, silicon straps and pillow inside of the case to fully protect
your Apple Watch from water, dust, scratches.
</p>
<p>LAVA case protects display in the front and the sensors in the back with Corning®
Gorilla® Glass - the ideal cover sheet with outstanding performance and durability. It
allows display respond accurate and sensitive to a touch of your finger while protecting
its surface from harsh environment, so you can control your Apple Watch under any
circumstances. This means that now you don't need to stop in front of the challenge and
you can explore it in any way since display is protected by the strongest polymer
available on the market.

<p>The straps are made of a soft premium quality silicon that will keep your LAVA case

<p>We have been living with the dream of engineering this protective case and make the
project come to life for the past few months and we decided to make it happen together
with the community of people that might want to share our idea and excitement of a new
product here on INDIEGOGO. On INDIEGOGO we make our own rules and give
chances to amazing products all together believing in something greater than we
already have.

</h3><p>We had the idea of giving people a tool that would tell them if a picture is real or fake.

It provides your photo with a unique fingerprint the moment you  take the picture. So you can prove the authenticity
 of your photo. Important:

</p><h3>What
we need now:</h3>
<p>This
app is great. But its function needs to be certified to enable people to use it
in real life. We need some more security features to combat hackers. And we
need to secure the database thru mirroring and multi level backups on several
servers. Next step would be to a get a certificate and to make this service
audit proof. The aim is to get Tru-Data Cam photos accepted as evidence when
dealing with officials, lawyers and in court. </p>
<p>Our
next steps:<br/>
- Software enhancement to make the app itself even more tamper-proof.<br/>
- Certification for data transfer from app to our server.<br/>
- Certification that the data on the server is unviolable.<br/>
- Press and media work to spread the news.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The
possible future:</h3>
<p>Our
plans are to make a professional version of Tru-Data Cam. Still keeping the
free one but also providing a more complex version and license and/or sell it
for a reasonable price. We want to combine it with a membership fee. We will
add a video function. We will make it work user-based to have everything linked
with the user’s identity. Our final goal is to offer the professional software
on a membership basis and also as a simple box product you can buy. There will
be different types of memberships, with limitations on the number of pictures
and videos, or maybe the length of time picture and video information is
stored.</p>
<p>Also,
we are planning to have a platform running showing many, many real photos and
videos. That will be our “news of the world” with a “no-fake” guarantee.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What
successful funding will do:</h3>
<p><span>Basis:<br/>
We still have about 2,500 EUR in our start-up fund but that is not enough for
step 1. This is why we are asking for your support for step 1.</span></p>
<p><span>Step
1:<br/>
The initial crowdfunding goal of </span>2,500 EUR will secure the modifications of the

<p>Step
2:<br/>
If we somehow manage to collect an additional 10,000 EUR then we will be able
to get the complete process and the database certified. </p>
<p>Step 3:<br/>Additional 5,000 EUR will make us fly. We could easily have the professional

 How does it work?
We
have designed a new Plug-in connector.

This
is important for an adequate power supply. We need 40Ampere with a
switch regulator, to load the battery.
You
will get two connectors.

Type
A, mostly in the USA
Type
C, mostly in EU

Here
a list of all types
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country

Switch
the connector and take it in the case with you, easy and comfortable.


Development!

We have redesigned our
case and the board, and now we are finished with the design-process.
Now we have implemented
the power-supply and the connector, this results in a smaller
battery.Here the redesign on
the pc.

Then we
went to the production of the case and of the board.

Now we are
ready for the mass production.

<li> First I started to work on piezoelectric shoe model made from piezo cigarette lighter igniter common spark-gap capacitor and simple electric circuit. First lighting led diodes was achieved.

It worked  but efficiency was very low, Two white led emitting diodes on each shoe were blinking constantly, but charging battery would take to much time. Maybe even self-discharging of battery would be faster than charging it... And one major fault was discovered. Piezo ignition has very limited durability. It only works for approximately 50 to 100 thousand sparks. After that quartz crystal deforms and igniter stops sparking, So this idea had been abandoned. Fortunately, in 2005 I started to study Nikola Tesla's patents and everything available internet wide  on that great inventor/discoverer. I decided to use Nikola Tesla's blade-less turbine ( <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/patents/US1061206"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.google.co.uk/patents/US1061206</a> ) and pneumatic principle for new prototype. Turbine have 20 mm diameter and spins more than 5000 times per second. It has two small magnets in disks and it puts out ac high frequency current, which is transformed  to charge battery. Turbine tested on reference air compressor can give more than 10 W of power. Efficiency greatly improved. USB output added. Overcharging circuit redesigned. Charge full sound warning added. We started to develop version with internal 3,7 V 2000 mAH battery Battery charging shoes started to be much more comfortable. It is more comfortable than walking with classic shoes because pressure on legs is more evenly distributed as shoes soles work as suspension. Now our team is developing shoe inlay compressor that can be used with any shoe and buying shoes will not be necessary. You only buy inlay compressor and snap the turbine generator assembly around ankles enabling its use with any type of shoes.  <br/>

Throughout my entire engineering and design career, the MacBook is an indispensable tool. My MacBook has a long history of durability, except for just two items - the Battery and MagSafe power adapter. If you searched the internet for damaged MagSafe, you'll see most of the cable damage in the same way - either the end of the cable connecting to the laptop, or the end of the cable joined to the power adapter. The damage of the cable connecting to the laptop can be easily prevented, unlike the cable connected to the power adapter. Initially, I thought it was just my personal problem, but soon I realized that everyone using MacBook is having the same problems.</span><p></p></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_NkU64MJ60?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><font color=""#000000""><span style=""font-size: 30px; line-height: 38px;""><b>Here is the scenario:</b></span></font><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever encountered your MagSafe power adapter for the MacBook blown away suddenly, and you have to buy another one? That will cost you US$79. Have you noticed that the joining part of the adapter and the cable have a kink in it? That is because the negative shielding has worn or torn off. This creates lots of electrical stress on the adapter. Before you know it, you will hear a ""POP"" sound, and there goes your MagSafe power adapter.</p></span><p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>If your MagSafe power adapter is still working and you wish to prolong the life span of your power adapter than to spend US$79 to get a new one, here's what we have created. Back our MagSavior and save your power adapter before it's gone! Forget about Googling ""How to fix MagSafe adapter"".</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>MagSavior is invented with an actual need to protect and prolong the usage of the MagSafe adapter. Improved Ideas were created in 3D using Autodesk 123D Design, and multiple prototypes were printed from a 3D printer just to perfect the final product before pre production.</span></p>

This is Anthony, a passionate graphic and industrial designer with 20 years experience introducing my latest invention, MagSavior. Throughout my entire engineering and design career, the MacBook is an indispensable tool. My MacBook has a long history of durability, except for just two items - the Battery and MagSafe power adapter. If you searched the internet for damaged MagSafe, you'll see most of the cable damage in the same way - either the end of the cable connecting to the laptop, or the end of the cable joined to the power adapter. The damage of the cable connecting to the laptop can be easily prevented, unlike the cable connected to the power adapter. Initially, I thought it was just my personal problem, but soon I realized that everyone using MacBook is having the same problems.Here is the scenario:

Have you ever encountered your MagSafe power adapter for the MacBook blown away suddenly, and you have to buy another one? That will cost you US$79. Have you noticed that the joining part of the adapter and the cable have a kink in it? That is because the negative shielding has worn or torn off. This creates lots of electrical stress on the adapter. Before you know it, you will hear a ""POP"" sound, and there goes your MagSafe power adapter.







If your MagSafe power adapter is still working and you wish to prolong the life span of your power adapter than to spend US$79 to get a new one, here's what we have created. Back our MagSavior and save your power adapter before it's gone! Forget about Googling ""How to fix MagSafe adapter"".

MagSavior is invented with an actual need to protect and prolong the usage of the MagSafe adapter. Improved Ideas were created in 3D using Autodesk 123D Design, and multiple prototypes were printed from a 3D printer just to perfect the final product before pre production.

Design Considerations:



Reduce the straining of the cord by increasing the height of the stem, and having a rounded brim to provide a bigger curvature during coiling of the cord.
Secure the breaking point of the joint by having a rigid body attached to the adapter and cord. 
Easy to attach and remove using the clip-on method. 
Light weight using polycarbonate material. 

Cost should be relatively low as compare to the actual price of the MagSafe power adapter.




Previous two beta versions were posted in Thingiverse as a Creative Commons.
Version 1: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:137534Version 2: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:141012

After numerous rugged testing and improvement, the final version is now ready for production. The MagSavior in the photo below is an actual working prototype printed from a 3D Printer.








Illustration of MagSavior in ivory white color 
MagSavior in 4 colors 

Features and specifications:



The material is made from durable Polycarbonate treated with a gloss finished
Curved brim to prevent cable from straining and sharp folding
Comes in 4 colors- Ivory White, Cool Blue, Vogue Pink and Neon Yellow
Patented easy and secured clip-on to secure MagSavior
3M adhesive to secure clip onto the MagSafe power adapter
Tailored cavity to fit ALL original Magsafe power adapter (MacBook, MacBook Pro & MacBook Air)












Why do we need the funds for?
With your funding, we can :

To initiate this project by creating mold and mass produce to reduce product cost and increase material quality
Explore more variety of colors and materials to provide more choices for you (e.g. Glow in the dark, matt, eco-friendly, transparent, mixture of TPU and Polycarbonate, etc.)
Deliver MagSavior to you at an earlier time
Create more protective shields for your other valuable products.

And with the funding goal reached, we expect to launch MagSavior into mass production, and soon the new MagSavior will arrive at your doorstep.
Where is the fund going to when reach our goals?

Reaching our goal of US$5,000 and above We'll start sending our 3D drawings to injection mold maker for mass production, get our packaging printed, and finally the delivery of MagSavior to you our backers.

What will you get in the perks:
Single Pack: 1 MagSavior in a pack(Ivory White, Neon Yellow, Cool Blue or Vogue Pink)


Twin Pack Saver: 2 MagSaviors in a pack(Ivory White & Neon Yellow) or (Cool Blue & Vogue Pink)

    4 Colors Pack Saver: Comes in a pack of 4(Ivory White, Neon Yellow, Cool Blue and Vogue Pink)Twin Pack with Retract Winder:Comes with 2 MagSaviors of selected color (Ivory White & Neon Yellow) or (Cool Blue & Vogue Pink) + 1 Large Retract Winder (Free)* Retract Winder is an ideal way to organize your MagSafe cord. More information: www.retractwinder.com


Retailer Pack:Contains one box of 40 MagSavior with 10 units of each color (Ivory White, Neon Yellow, Cool Blue and Vogue Pink). A saving of almost 50%!

It doesn't just help you make smarter drinking decisions, it helps you maintain a healthy lifestyle!




Why is knowing your Blood Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) Important?


- MAKE SAFER AND SMARTER DECISIONS - Alcohol can impair judgement, so knowing your B.A.C. level will give you objective data to decide if you are safe to drive or should find another way to get home.

- IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH - Alcohol affects the body way beyond just the time that you are drinking. There are everyday effects even in the following days. Having the data about your drinking (through B.A.C.) and comparing it to your mood, weight, energy level or athletic performance will help you decide if having that additional drink will really be worth it.





Who Should Use The Alcohoot Edge?

Anyone who drinks! Be it three drinks a week, one drink a month, or going out for the first time at 21, the Alcohoot Edge benefits anyone who wants to make smarter and healthier decisions.



 
















The Alcohoot Edge app (works for both iOS and Android) will easily connect to the mobile alcohol tracker via bluetooth. It will seamlessly fit into any user's lifestyle of digitally monitoring B.A.C. and health and well being.

Additional App Features



Instant and simple to understand B.A.C. levels. Find out clearly and easily your B.A.C. on the Alcohoot app after blowing into the Alcohoot Edge.

Accurate readings. Includes 15:00 timer to ensure B.A.C. % accuracy.
SmartLine Graph. Provides users with visible trends in alcohol consumption and allows for notes to be added to better track information.
Morning Quiz. Performs qualitative analysis to algorithmically predict optimal alcohol consumption level.

Apple Health and Google Fit. Fully supported by Apple Health and Google Fit.With a one button turn-on,  users can automatically connect to their phone's Alcohoot Edge app, blow and instantly get feedback on alcohol level in the body. It's never been easier and more accurate! The Edge employs the same active breath analysis technology found in law enforcement devices to provide users with industry-leading Breath Alcohol Consumption (B.A.C.) readings.










Unlock awesome new features and rewards by helping us achieve our stretch goals! Sharing our campaign with your networks to help us spread the word.




We are a young company with a team dedicated to building products like Alcohoot Edge, with the goal of empowering people to improve their health and well-being. We are bringing world-leading technology from the lab to the individual and having fun in the process!

<h3>A 3D printer at VeloCity would be awesome</h3>
<p>There have been a few attempts to get one before, but none of them worked out, they all fizzled out for various reasons. I think with Indiegogo, we can finally get the structure we need to get the funds together. A 3D printer would be fantastic for anyone building a hardware project, especially for enclosures. It would also be useful for replacement parts for anything you have that breaks, and of course it can be used to print intricate ornaments and toys. Check out thingiverse.com for more ideas.</p>
<h3>What you can build</h3>
<p>Here are some of the things that this 3D printer will let you make:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7933"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7933</a> - Catan card holder</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36321"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36321</a> - Earbud holder</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34343"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34343</a> - Decorations</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36561"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36561</a> - Mechanical parts</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've set the funding goal at $2000. After fees, this is enough to get the basic MakerBot Replicator (<a href=""http://store.makerbot.com/replicator-404.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://store.makerbot.com/replicator-404.html</a>) but if we go over that amount, we'll be able to get the mugh higher quality Replicator 2 (<a href=""http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html</a>) so ideally we would get $2500 or more.</p>
<p>Any funds after that will be used to get more plastic to print with in more colors, parts to upgrade or repair the printer, or other things as determined by YOU!</p>
<h3>After this term</h3>
<p>After the Winter term, the printer will stay in VeloCity, and someone will be appointed to take care of it. They will be responsible for ordering plastic, and keeping the printer working. It will be up to them to decide how to buy the plastic, for example by charging for each print, or by soliciting donations. If no one in the residence is suitable, the priter might move to the VeloCity Garage. People who donate $200+ will help make this decision.</p>

<span>Don't think of the portable battery exclusive for traveling; use it to stay charged anywhere you go, whether you're in bed or on the couch, out and about, or traveling abroad. Use the micro-USB on the battery pack to Re-charge it on the go, and when you get back to the Charging Station, simply slide it back in.</span>

<p>The first step when developing the ENERGI
Charging Station stemmed from the following question: <i>what are the core problems USB hubs are designed to
alleviate? </i>We see hubs as the heart of charging everyday devices at home,
including a multitude of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile accessories. One pain
point was when a device is charging, it’s inconvenient being tethered to the
wall. If one of the ports was able to “jump out” and travel around the house
with us, that would make using the hub that much more seamless. With that core
insight, we looked at the conventional charging station in a different light
and developed a product we feel lives up to carrying the TYLT logo. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443551099/ibtko10vcdl4wot5g1sh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>When evaluating other USB charging hubs, we
noticed the multitude of USB cables cluttering up our countertops at home and
workspace at the office. So we developed a new seamless way to aid in cable
management – using the top and bottom fins to hold the excess cable for a less
cluttered charging experience. </p>

</div>
<div>
<p>No. We looked at this technology, but found several tradeoffs we weren’t happy with. The marginally improved charge time wasn’t worth the extra cost to implement this feature, especially since it doesn’t help Apple users. Quick Charge 2.0 is specific to flagship Android phones at this point. It’s not supported by Apple, Windows and many older and entry to mid-level Android phones. That being said we made sure that ALL phones would get their maximum charge from standard 5 Volt power output.  As you may know QC 2.0 ups the output voltage to 9V/12V depending on what the device can accept, most phones only accept 9V with QC 2.0.  We like fast charging, we just want to be sure that the technology we build into our product can be used by the majority and QC 2.0 is still in the minority/early adopters and has no benefit to Apple users.  But Smart Detect Technology is a benefit to both Apple and Android users by providing the fastest charge to ALL.</p>
<p><b>Will this product work internationally?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We have both a version with a US cable, as well as a version that includes Type C plugs for Europe and others, and Type G plugs for the UK and others for international users. Check below for countries using each outlet type.</p>

Currently we are aiming at optimal performance for mid size to large size smartphones, could not accommodate smaller phones and GoPro. Making it usable for sizes, including GoPro, would result in similar poor stabilization problems with large phones that many smartphone gimbals on the market now have. If mainly for GoPro use, it's better to buy a GoPro-only gimbal.

If phone width within 85mm and weight not exceed 222 gram by too much then would be OK.</p><p> </p><p>Q4: Are all mid-size to large-size phones usable?</p><p>A4: Some of the smartphones has side buttons not on top part of the phone. If too low, it might come in contact with the phone grip. In case just coming in contact a bit, slide the phone out a little would clear the situation. If buttons are too low, it might be a problem. Such is common issue with all smartphone stabilizer phone grip designs. Please check with below figure to see if your phone has such issue.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479871131/ikrjf1k0jutazepr0mup.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Q5: How does ProView S3 compare with other InDemand smartphone gimbals?</p><p>A5: SMOVE:<a href=""http://bit.ly/2fT6obW"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> http://bit.ly/2fT6obW</a></p><p>        FlowMotion One: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2iAb34b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/2iAb34b</a></p><p> </p><p><br/>Note * : We have Bluetooth 4.0 inside ProView S3 for setting control and firmware update using Bluetooth Low Energy profile. Video recording on/off via Bluetooth requires additional Human Interface Device (HID) profile. Testing with limited model of phones we have in the office (of Apple, Samsung, Asus, HTC brands), we see that this feature could work with phones from Apple, Samsung, and Asus, but unable to work with HTC phones using this new HID mode. Since the feature is not guaranteed to work with all phones, it's offered as extra bonus feature for user to try. We only have access to limited phone models in our office, unable to know if all other brand/model works or not.

If phone width within 85mm and weight not exceed 222 gram by too much then would be OK. Q4: Are all mid-size to large-size phones usable?A4: Some of the smartphones has side buttons not on top part of the phone. If too low, it might come in contact with the phone grip. In case just coming in contact a bit, slide the phone out a little would clear the situation. If buttons are too low, it might be a problem. Such is common issue with all smartphone stabilizer phone grip designs. Please check with below figure to see if your phone has such issue. Q5: How does ProView S3 compare with other InDemand smartphone gimbals?A5: SMOVE: http://bit.ly/2fT6obW        FlowMotion One: http://bit.ly/2iAb34b Note * : We have Bluetooth 4.0 inside ProView S3 for setting control and firmware update using Bluetooth Low Energy profile. Video recording on/off via Bluetooth requires additional Human Interface Device (HID) profile. Testing with limited model of phones we have in the office (of Apple, Samsung, Asus, HTC brands), we see that this feature could work with phones from Apple, Samsung, and Asus, but unable to work with HTC phones using this new HID mode. Since the feature is not guaranteed to work with all phones, it's offered as extra bonus feature for user to try. We only have access to limited phone models in our office, unable to know if all other brand/model works or not. Later after receiving ProView S3, you can let us know if it works with your phone, and we'll compile a list of compatible and non-compatible phones.",12.0,12,"2 Campaigns
