<div><br/></div>
<div>1) They <b>do not offer a friendly, collaborative environment</b> for students to tackle challenging math problems. Most of the time, students are <b>separated in a room</b> to work on problems privately.</div>

<p>I am aiming for<b> $5000</b> for the growth of Contendify and the improved experience for our math contenders. </p>
<p>Here are the reasons why your help is essential for the success of Contendify:</p>
<p>1) These competition events are not free for students to attend and compete. Currently, admission to these competitions is around $10. I want to decrease the price for these students by <b>using 75% of the money raised</b> to help pay for the cost of running these competitions. These costs include:</p>
<p>a) The problem creation which occurs with the help of <b>graduate students and professors</b> in the field of mathematics. </p>
<p>b) The <b>event venue space</b> where students compete.</p>
<p>c) <b>Discounts and prizes</b> for teams that win the competitions.</p>
<p>Prizes include <b>free tickets to compete, free tickets to lectures given by expert professors from institutions such as Columbia University and NYU.</b></p>
<p>2) The rest of the money raised will be used to <b>spread the word to as many students as possible</b>. It would be a shame for high schoolers to miss out on this great opportunity because they simply have not heard of it. I will use the money to pay for people to go to as many high schools as possible in NYC to speak with math teachers and their students. I will also use it for advertisements (posters).</p>
<p>If I do not reach the entire goal, I will still use the funds for the costs mentioned above.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>PERKS!</b></p>
<p>There are 3 perks depending on how much you donate:</p>
<p><b>$20</b></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>I see one risk of Contendify and that is that not enough students will have the opportunity to become a member of Contendify. NYC is a big place and there are tons of mathematically strong high school students. It is my mission to reach out to as many of them as possible, and that is one of the main reasons I need your help.

</div></div>","CONTENDIFY 
WHO AM I?
My name is Corey and I'm an engineer/entrepreneur. I have a background in chemical engineering from MIT. I have been passionate about education and sharing that passion with others ever since I could remember.

WHAT IS CONTENDIFY?
Mathematics is the most fundamental tool needed to achieve almost anything in Science, Technology, Engineering and of course, Mathematics (S.T.E.M.). It is no wonder why there are so many passionate high school students that go the extra mile to show their skills in competitions like the American Mathematics Competition (AMC). However, most math competitions can be made better. As of now:

1) They do not offer a friendly, collaborative environment for students to tackle challenging math problems. Most of the time, students are separated in a room to work on problems privately.

2) They only happen once or twice a year! Who wants to wait that long to feel the joy and rush of competing. 

This is why I created Contendify. 

Contendify allows high school students to compete in math competitions with their friends and peers! These competitions take all the positives of hackathons (where programmers come together in teams to work on cutting-edge projects for 1 or 2 days straight) and combines it with math competitions. Contendify is based in NYC. The competitions are timed and are taken by teams of 2 to 4 students.

Contendify Competitions happen continuously throughout the year so that students can enter many times a year (at least 4 times a month). The competition tickets will be handled using Eventbrite on the Contendify website. The website will be launched very soon as I am developing more math problems for the first few competitions. 

HOW IT WORKS
1) Students will register their teams on the Contendify website.
2) Students will take the Algebra, Geometry or Calculus Quizzes to find out their level. There are 3 levels as shown below.



3) Students will then sign up for the particular event that they can make with their teams. Teams range from 2 to 4 people. 

There can be as many as 20 teams competing with each other in one setting for now.
4) After the students compete, they will have their results posted on the same day. 
Depending on who won 1st , 2nd and 3rd place, prizes will be awarded to the winning teams.

DETAILS ON THE COMPETITION 
1) Tickets to attend the competition range from $5 to $10. Discounts can be awarded to winning teams.
2) The Competition Booklet that the students must complete is a timed test. Students will have 1 Hour to complete 10 to 12 questions. 
There will be problems from each level.
3) Light snacks and drinks will also be provided in each competition. 
Competition event spaces will taken place in beautiful venues as seen below:







EXAMPLE PROBLEMS
ALGEBRA:





GEOMETRY 





CALCULUS 





SCORING
Scores are a function of questions correct. Higher leveled problems are worth more and if there is a tie, then there will be a timed tiebreaker problem.


What We Need & What You Get

<div>Hi!   </div>
<div>VEX team 4911 has been invited to attend the Create US Open Championships in Council Bluffs, Iowa this spring! We have entered three events so far this year and have placed First at two of them, (at the other one we burned out a motor in the finals). We currently place 4th in the State for robot skills test and 8th for programming skills, which is measured by how many points the robot can score in one minute.   </div>
<div>The VEX challenge this year is to score  points by putting small foam balls into a low or high goal and lifting your alliance partner's robot off the floor by at least 4 inches!We usually hit 30 out of 32 high goals during a match, but have yet to successfully lift our partner or be lifted by them.    You can learn more about the game challenge at <a href=""http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/competition-resources"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/c...</a>
</div>
<div>We need your help to raise the $3000 needed to attend the Create Us Championship event.   The entry fee is $450.  Hotels for team members and coaches about $1500, transportation and food for the team and families and parts (extra motors and new batteries!)  for the robots, team t-shirts, banners, etc. $1050.<br/>
</div>
<div>These students have worked hard to build and program a robot for this years challenge.  They are the engineers of the future and will design things that we cant even imagine yet!  Attending this world-wide event will provide them the opportunity to meet other students from different cultures, share ideas, and grow in their skills.  <br/>
</div>
<div>This team is one of several teams that are hosted by Michiana Youth Robotics and Engineering, a small non-profit that offers classes and competitive teams to students age 6 and up.  </div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>*<span>During the first three months of our 2016 
pre-launch period, we will begin research, podcasting, and daily news 
updates, while cultivating our social and traditional media network. In 
March, we will present a webinar on classism, economic justice, and the 
law, and conduct a nationwide survey of anti-poverty, sustainability, 
and other organizations to build a comprehensive profile of the legal 
and policy needs of a new, just economy.</span></p>
<p>Funds raised beyond our goal will allow us to do our work more quickly, and to be able to address a larger number of critical issues in the first year. The sky is pretty much the limit for this work, so please help spread the word widely and give what you can.</p>

<h3>The Perks!<br/>
</h3>Our perks can give you a taste of the world we are working to create. Books, consulting time, a webinar and even a game that teaches through fun... all of our perks are variations on the theme of bringing that better world into being. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Can't give now?<br/>
</h3>We get it. Part of why this project is so compelling is that folks like us who care about the world can sometimes be awfully tight on cash. You can still help spread the word.

and the need to protect and revitalize the Commons.
Check out our video and our video updates over the next month to get to know us better!

We Need Your Support!

Materialized Empathy goes online January 2016 and can officially launch as a full-on project on July 1, with the support of Commonomics USA, a team of researchers and interns in cooperative content production... and you and your networks! 
Materialized Empathy needs $12K to launch, and $55K to fund our first year of work. This campaign will get us the funds we need to start our work.
This budget includes:
$  7,900                             For staff time*
     1,500                             For our first intern*
        300                             Website and Podcast equipment and costs
        800                             Office rental 
      1,500                            Campaign Costs
$ 12,000                       TOTAL CAMPAIGN GOAL

*During the first three months of our 2016 
pre-launch period, we will begin research, podcasting, and daily news 
updates, while cultivating our social and traditional media network. In 
March, we will present a webinar on classism, economic justice, and the 
law, and conduct a nationwide survey of anti-poverty, sustainability, 
and other organizations to build a comprehensive profile of the legal 
and policy needs of a new, just economy.
Funds raised beyond our goal will allow us to do our work more quickly, and to be able to address a larger number of critical issues in the first year. The sky is pretty much the limit for this work, so please help spread the word widely and give what you can.


The Perks!
Our perks can give you a taste of the world we are working to create. Books, consulting time, a webinar and even a game that teaches through fun... all of our perks are variations on the theme of bringing that better world into being. 

Can't give now?
We get it. Part of why this project is so compelling is that folks like us who care about the world can sometimes be awfully tight on cash. You can still help spread the word. We also invite you to get in touch with us if you think you might have a project we could partner with that would benefit from our work, or if you have legal background that could help us move things along.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

TeacherLearn.  TeacherLearn is the first ever web-based application which provides teachers in Africa with easy access to quality training and local educational resources all at the click of a button.  We collaborate with top teachers in Africa to create classroom-tested resources, which are specifically tailored to improve classroom teaching and students’ learning outcomes.So far, we have tested TeacherLearn with hundreds of teachers and the response was fantastic:“Lesson planning became so much easier’“My students’ engagement in class shot up hugely!”“Finally this has arrived! Bonus: So user-friendly!!”After such positive feedback and effective impact, we want to grow and expand TeacherLearn in terms of number of resources and teacher training courses we provide. Doing that requires a huge amount of finance. by contributing a small sum, thousands of teachers will have access to quality support and resources tailored to improve learning outcomes for millions of children in Africa. SCREENSHOTS FROM THE PLATFORM   Most teachers want to transform their classrooms but they need that extra support and resources to do so. TeacherLearn is designed to support teachers who are looking:
To develop their teaching skills 
For guidance on how best to teach their curriculum subject
For local content and stories to improve classroom teaching delivery and students’ learning outcomes but find it difficult to find the appropriate content and sources
To support students with learning disabilities and difficulties in their classroom but do not have the training. learning resources and support to do so.
   Since 2016, we have invested time and money into the following: 
Identify and train teachers to be content creators for other struggling teachers
Designing our platform, www.teacher-learn.com, so it can be adaptable on both desktop and mobile phones and handle the capacity of over a million teachers using it
Successfully carried out beta testing of TeacherLearn with 300 target teachers in Nigeria
Created over 1000 resources 
Created our first TeacherLearn community: a community of teachers from 10 schools in Port Harcourt, Nigeria who come together to learn from each other and exchange ideas.
  Our target is to raise £42,000 by December 2019. We will use the funds to:Content creation + Build more partnerships with top teachers in AfricaWe are looking to add more content to TeacherLearn. More specifically, we plan to add 8,000 resources by the end of 2020. To do this, we need to partner with more teachers who can create quality and effective resource packs.  Teachers are paid a commission for each Resource Pack they create.     One Resource Pack (contains 4 resources) = £12    We are looking to create 2,000 Resource Packs (8,000 resources) = £24,000 2)   Recruit graphic designers to support our current team After the content has been created, we need skilled people to convert and design the resources into an electronic format so that it can be accessible to teachers on the platform.To achieve our goals, we will want to add 3 graphic designers to the team to keep up with the workload:   To pay 1 graphic designer = £3,000 (yearly)   Therefore, we need £9,000 (yearly) to pay 3 graphic designers. (PLEASE NOTE: These wages represent the average monthly wage of a graphic designer in most African countries. It is, in most cases, 3 times the minimum wage.) 3)  MarketingThe remaining £9,000 will be used to create more awareness about TeacherLearn through marketing. Consequently, we can reach out to more schools and teachers to help transform their classrooms and students’ learning outcomes.  By raising £40,000, we will be able to fully launch TeacherLearn into schools in Nigeria, then expand to other African Countries.We want to end the era of sending unprepared, under-trained teachers into African classrooms.TeacherLearn will provide quality and effective support, training and resources to teachers and schools across the continent. Not only will this improve learning outcomes for millions of children in Africa, millions of teachers will have achieved an exceptional standard of training to unlock the potential of all of their students.  1)  Click this link to know the Einstower story.2) Click this link to know about our other projects.

<p>My name is Dayra Gaitan Crespo and I am originally from Rivera, Colombia. I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah in 1999, right after graduating with a BA in Modern Languages, from Universidad Surcolombiana. I also hold a M.Ed. in TESOL from Grand Canyon University, and have worked as an ESL teacher since 2003.</p>
<p>As a language teacher of over 15 years, I have become very familiar not only with my students’ struggle to learn due to their low reading levels or limited English skills, but also my colleagues’ frustration with the lack of adequate resources to help these students. Most of the online resources currently available have been created by big name corporations or by people who have never taught in a classroom, making them unfit for the real needs of today’s teachers and students. That’s why Elliteracy was born! I was committed to creating an online educational platform to help teachers become more effective in helping their students improve their oral reading fluency, pronunciation and spelling. All of this, while giving them the flexibility to use their own curriculum and providing them with state of the art technology that allows students to receive immediate input, as if their teacher were right by them!</p>
<p>This increasing urgency to help my students and peers, fueled my desire to make this idea a reality. I could not let one more year go by without creating Elliteracy. I knew I had to risk it all. With my husband’s encouragement and support, we set out on this journey. We started our business plan and contacted several developers, all which agreed on how complex and costly this project would be. Although we did not reach our funding goal here on indiegogo, we were able to complete the development of our site, and are happy to say that we are live now at <a href=""http://www.elliteracy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.elliteracy.com</a></p>
<p>Since the end of the school year is approaching, we have decided to allow the site to grow organically for now, as we continue to test and improve every feature.  We have some teachers already registered, who like me, get to use Elliteracy with their English language learners and struggling readers, every day. As a teacher, nothing is more rewarding than seeing your students feel empowered to learn and that’s exactly what Elliteracy does. When students complete recording their reading, they not only receive a score with the number of correct words read, but also, a list of the specific words that were mispronounced. They are then, able to hover over the words and listen to the correct pronunciation, repeat the words, listen to the whole passage again, and even listen to their own recording! ELLiteracy helps teachers give specific and timely feedback to individual students, a teaching practice almost impossible to implement in our large classrooms. ELLiteracy helps students take ownership on their learning while building a growth mindset. They realize that with practice, a good teacher, and a little help from technology, they too can be successful in school. As in the words of author George Couros, “Technology will not replace great teachers, but technology in the hands of great teachers can be transformational.”</p>
<p>My hope is that today, you too, feel encouraged to make a difference in the learning experience of millions of students, whether signing up or sharing this project with your friends and families.</p>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> we must show parents <strong>new gun guards that kids cannot remove,</strong> but adults can take off quickly in an emergency, without a key.  <u>Unprotected guns are one of the leading causes of accidental child deaths!</u></p>
<p><u>We support using any device to stop a child from pulling the trigger!  </u><strong>But our favorite is the </strong><strong>new CHILDSAFE1,</strong><strong> a trigger blocker that no child has ever removed -- but trained adults can remove in 2 seconds.</strong>  It has <u>two loud alarms</u> to scare kids and warn parents the moment it is touched.

ChildSafe1 has a lock no child has ever removed

Dual LOUD alarms that warn parents and frighten kids
A 2-second release once parents learn how.
No key, combination, or fingerprint reader. It resembles a childproof medicine cap.

Ready now to save lives, like all other devices recommended on our website

How Your Contribution Will Be Used

30% for mass advertising on radio, TV, print, social media and billboards.
15% for direct contact with retailers and gun trainers.
25% for outreach to parents, parent groups, civic and religious organizations, police departments, and Individual volunteers to spread the word. Events will let us reach gun dealers, parenting conferences, gun trainer workshops, women’s self-defense training events, among others.
20% for purchase of #1 rated ChildSafe1 units directly from manufacturer to distribute, including to nonprofits and low-income families if enough is raised. Otherwise all funds will go to directly warning parents.
5% donated to other charities which promote teenage suicide prevention programs.
5% administrative costs, including professional services, printing, postage, videos, website, etc.  Not one dollar of your support will go for rent or salary expenses.
    
Talk to your kids about gun safety.  That's critical! 
But remember they are children, not little adults. 
The burden of safety is on the parents, not the kids!

<h3>Hi!  My name is Sharon Meade and I am a survivor of childhood abuse who developed Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) as a way to cope with the on-going trauma in my early childhood.  After three years of intensive therapy, a lot of inner healing and doing things afraid, I have fully integrated and no longer have parts (altars).  </h3>
<p>This campaign will be used to create a professional three-minute sizzle reel (DVD) to send to potential hosts (churches, mental health facilities, conferences, hospitals, women's groups, crisis centers, domestic violence shelters etc.) for inspirational speaking engagements.  It will include professional video editing, blank DVDs, cases, mailing expenses, flyers, and labeling costs.  Additionally, it will cover the cost of a lunch and learn session to introduce the ministry to our local community in order to share this newly available resource.  One person reached out to me and it gave me hope and opened up the door to my healing.  Because of one person, I felt loved and was able to allow the Lord to heal my deepest wounds.  Sharing this message of hope and healing could be the difference between life and death for someone feeling suicidal in the same way I used to feel.  I am so thankful that I learned that I am valuable and that God loves me extravagantly.  I no longer have panic attacks, nightmares, flashbacks, self-harming behaviors, or deep depression and hopelessness.  It is so important that trauma victims know that God loves them, and healing is available for them too!  Your contributions will help us achieve an avenue to get this message out to hurting women everywhere.  The Lord has done many miracles in the last four years of this journey and I believe that He has only just begun.  He has given me a vision of speaking in front of thousands of people, bringing hope to the broken and setting the captives free (Isaiah 61:1). </p>

<h3>Our Slovenian Beekeeping Mission:</h3>
<p>Our goal is to be the first school in the United States to build, and maintain, a Slovenian hive. We need your help to accomplish our goal! Slovenian beekeeping is a technique that originated in Slovenia over 100 years ago.  Slovenian beekeeping is more efficient, and is healthier for both bees and humans.</p>
<p>We were inspired by the fact that Slovenian students of all ages learn beekeeping basics and the bee’s importance to the environment. We hope to spread that concept here in the US by offering AZ hive tour, workshops for local aggricultual groups, beekeeping associations, and schools. We also hope to start a 4-H club in our county that focuses on bees because there is not one in our county currently.</p>
<p>Within our classroom this hive will help us achieve our secondary goal of expanding our microeconomy by selling nucs, expanding our current honey sales, and various products from the hive (lip balm, creams, soap, and candles).</p>
<p>We also hope to start a scientific research, with comparing and contrasting the Langstroth hive with the Slovenian hive.  </p>
<h3>Our School:</h3>
<p>Woodside Montessori Academy offers the full Montessori educational experience, educating students from three years old through eighth grade. Our school offers a challenging and stimulating academic environment where students are guided by faculty members who are knowledgeable, dedicated, and caring. Our in-school academic atmosphere is complemented by the wide variety of real life experiences.</p>
<p>Based largely on Dr. Maria Montessori’s ideals and teachings, our program reflects a love and respect for each student. It is completely student-centered, with a commitment to the success and happiness of each of our students.</p>
<p>As a community we recognized the need for an adolescent program which would meet the unique psychosocial characteristics of the student of the third plane. We feel that the addition of the adolescent program to the school community creates a point of satisfaction and fulfillment in ushering our young adolescent students into high school in a healthy, self confident manner and well prepared. They are a vital, integrated part of the community; they are leaders for younger students and models for what a healthy adolescent can be.</p>
<p>The mission of the adolescent program is to provide opportunities for adolescents to be self-confident and gain self-knowledge, to belong to a community, to learn to be adaptable, to be academically competent and challenged, and to create a vision for their personal future; thus, to empower early adolescents.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our expenses break down into two categories - the physical needs of the Slovenian Bee House and the educational needs of the young beekeeper.</p>
<p>Physical expenses include: Preparation of the site, fencing and installation, building materials for the house and construction fees, eight two-level hives, four nucs, comb foundation, hive tools, bee suits, smoke sticks, Carniolan bees.</p>
<p>Educational expenses include: Travel to Slovenia for eight students and two adults with the leading US expert on Slovenian hives, Suzanne Brouillette. Slovenia is the size of New Hampshire but has over 10,000 beekeepers, during this trip students will be immersed on Slovenian culture and have opportunity visit a variety of hives and learn from their keepers. We will also visit two schools to see how they run their educational programs so that we can bring that home to our community.</p>
<p>Money made from this campaign will be spent first on physical expenses and then on educational expenses.</p>
<p>When you contribute to our project we will share with you some of the products that come from our hive, handcrafted artwork, and tours of this unique bee house. Your contributions will help bring environmental awareness, a love of bees, and help us become the first school with a Slovenian bee house in the United States. See the “perks” section of our site for complete details on how we will show our gratitude for your donation.</p>
<h3>About Slovenian Hives</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Slovenian beekeeping is a technique that originated in Slovenia over 100 years ago! Slovenian beekeeping is more efficient, and is healthier for both bees and humans. It removes the burden of lifting an eighty pound hive super, (where the honey is stored) so smaller children and adults who may not be able lift such a heavy object. The frames where the bees reside slide out of the back of the hive, which removes the hassle of having to lift the top off and take everything out, including the bees, which aggravates them. A Slovenian Hive allows the bees to be much calmer and more peaceful than in the Langstroth hive.  Since we have children on campus who are very young, and hope to bring people of all ages and abilities to learn about bees, calmer bees who are less likely to sting are ideal.</p>
<p>    The Slovenian bee house is essentially a shed with specially fitted beehives placed in the front, where the bees’ entrances/exits are located. In the house, there is enough room for storage and a work space for honey extraction and/or other necessities and/or activities that we may need to do to take care of the bees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute monetarily but you can help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools to share our campaign with friends and family!</p>

<p>We've already made an organic prototype with all our love, it remains good old games when all family with guests and neighbours kids sat around one table. Rules of Lit-Lotto appeals to the classic number’s lotto’s mechanic that is proven by several generations of players. We bring some new conditions and details to make the process of learning language easy and funny. <i>Everybody is involved. </i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479001899/odxenr9nu6zxqdgme5me.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>It can be more than one winner</i>. You can add your own rules to this simple mechanic: with a leader who spells every letter or without, with special Christmas prizes and a ribbon on the Wish-tree. The most important thing is learning languages and culture with the pleasure of learning. We propose this ready to use product as a good addition to your Christmas table.<strong> </strong>As well, every proverb has it's own very deep meaning, and for me, it's important which one I pull out today - it remains me the Christmas guessing game. We left a shirt of a card with a proverb for therapeutic colouring - fine motoric is very important for developing linguistic skills. And the icing on the cake is philosophy: we let our kids tie a ribbon on the Wish oak every time they win the LIT-LOTTO, we explain to them that wishes could be different, but only those can make you happier that contain love and care about others. We illustrated this idea by the qualitative production line: the philosophical musical, the calendar-tree and other magic souvenirs. </p>

It’s a Christmas story full built upon the traditions that we grew up with and we are honoured to share it with you. A Good Magician carved a Doeling figure and gave it the power to realise people's desires. But before the Green Doeling's power could be activated, it would have to complete a quest to understand what makes people the most happy. </p>
<p>The Green Doeling travelled the world asking everyone “what would make you happy?"" But everyone had different desires: love, a successful career, more rain for their crops, less rain and more sunshine—there was no end to the variety of answers that the Doeling was given. In the end, just as Green Doeling was ready to give up, she had the idea that <strong>only those wishes could make people happier, that contain love and care about others</strong>. Once Green Doeling understood this very truth, the Wish-Oak started to grow from the Green Doelings head.</p>

<p>And we appreciate working together. Prolonging the Green Doeling's story, I wrote a little fairy-tale about <i>Bubby who came to the Wish-oak, tied a ribbon around a branch and asked to become a cosmonaut, but the ribbon has untied. <br/>- Why? - asked Bubby<br/>- Because your wish is not wise - answered Doeling<br/>- So how can I make a wise wish? - wondered Bubby<br/>-  Ask for wisdom and tie the ribbon again - and you will see then - suggested Doeling<br/>After Bubby asked for wisdom, acorns from the Wish-oak became letter-tiles, and leaves became cards with proverbs. <br/>- What do I have to do with all of this? - asked Bubby<br/>- Learn all proverbs and come again -  Doeling replied - a wise wish will come true. </i><br/><i>That's why one, who wins in LIT-LOTTO set, ties a ribbon around the ""Wish Oak""</i></p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p> </p></div>","We have developed and designed Belarusian, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Ukrainian  languages and we want to make an invoiced Braille alphabet's Lit-Lotto for blinds.

We've already made an organic prototype with all our love, it remains good old games when all family with guests and neighbours kids sat around one table. Rules of Lit-Lotto appeals to the classic number’s lotto’s mechanic that is proven by several generations of players. We bring some new conditions and details to make the process of learning language easy and funny. Everybody is involved. 

 
It can be more than one winner. You can add your own rules to this simple mechanic: with a leader who spells every letter or without, with special Christmas prizes and a ribbon on the Wish-tree. The most important thing is learning languages and culture with the pleasure of learning. We propose this ready to use product as a good addition to your Christmas table. As well, every proverb has it's own very deep meaning, and for me, it's important which one I pull out today - it remains me the Christmas guessing game. We left a shirt of a card with a proverb for therapeutic colouring - fine motoric is very important for developing linguistic skills. And the icing on the cake is philosophy: we let our kids tie a ribbon on the Wish oak every time they win the LIT-LOTTO, we explain to them that wishes could be different, but only those can make you happier that contain love and care about others. We illustrated this idea by the qualitative production line: the philosophical musical, the calendar-tree and other magic souvenirs. 



We are an international multidisciplinary team (Belarus - UK), creative agency Smart Space Farm - with successful experience in design, production, music, theatre, events, agriculture, and marketing. We do amazing things, moved by creativity and the idea of social enterprise, trying to develop new ideas instantly and every day, but first of all 

We are mothers: 

As mothers, we want our children to grow up wise and educated in the ways of the world. In order to create a bright future for them, we’ve looked to the past—using traditional storytelling methods to educate children, better preparing them to participate in the modern world.

Ulia Kudzina is the creator of the social media brand OhMyDoeling! The author of the idea of Magic calendar and a social entrepreneur, the co-founder of Smart Space Farm. 

She is   a mother of two kids, she is the producer of the  philosophical musical “The Wish-Oak grew on the Green Doeling's Head"" . It’s a Christmas story full built upon the traditions that we grew up with and we are honoured to share it with you. A Good Magician carved a Doeling figure and gave it the power to realise people's desires. But before the Green Doeling's power could be activated, it would have to complete a quest to understand what makes people the most happy. 
The Green Doeling travelled the world asking everyone “what would make you happy?"" But everyone had different desires: love, a successful career, more rain for their crops, less rain and more sunshine—there was no end to the variety of answers that the Doeling was given. In the end, just as Green Doeling was ready to give up, she had the idea that only those wishes could make people happier, that contain love and care about others. Once Green Doeling understood this very truth, the Wish-Oak started to grow from the Green Doelings head.

Nika  Wegosky  co-founder of Smart Space Farm


She is the creator of the conception of Lit-lotto, an art-activist and a mum of two smart boys. We made a charity festival OhMyDoeling! together around this Philosophical musical fairy tale on the Christmas holidays'15
And we appreciate working together. Prolonging the Green Doeling's story, I wrote a little fairy-tale about Bubby who came to the Wish-oak, tied a ribbon around a branch and asked to become a cosmonaut, but the ribbon has untied. - Why? - asked Bubby- Because your wish is not wise - answered Doeling- So how can I make a wise wish? - wondered Bubby-  Ask for wisdom and tie the ribbon again - and you will see then - suggested DoelingAfter Bubby asked for wisdom, acorns from the Wish-oak became letter-tiles, and leaves became cards with proverbs. - What do I have to do with all of this? - asked Bubby- Learn all proverbs and come again -  Doeling replied - a wise wish will come true. That's why one, who wins in LIT-LOTTO set, ties a ribbon around the ""Wish Oak""

 
Every product with the OhMyDoeling! label contributes to charity. In a case of LIT-LOTTO, we will donate part of the income to create the LIT-LOTTO for visually impaired and blind people in Braille alphabet.  We want to make the world of the visually impaired kids cuter because somebody cares.  Our aim is to create an invoiced LIT-LOTTO that will have several regimes from 3 to 10  with different sounds of the same letter because Braille is the same for different languages. We want to make the world of cecutient people more broad and understandable, available for socialisation and friendly. Because of we care, and we want this world to be a nice place for everybody. That's what our PERKS are about: all of them are tactile in different ways. We want to share this feeling with you. You are welcome to check it.

<p align=""center""><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Special Edition communicates Knowledge, Wisdom, &amp; Understanding that everyone can achieve</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mission of the Program</strong></p>
<p>The mission of this program began with my ancestor who was one of the original 10-thousand that are the ancestors of the 7-billion in the present.</p>
<p>The ancient knowledge of the previous <a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/331988/is-there-an-english-word-for-a-period-of-10000-years"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">myrietes </a> (10,000 years) was a secret kept by my family and our physical differences, attributes were used to evaluate the hypothesis of each subject in the Special Edition.</p>
<p><strong>The Purpose of the Program</strong></p>
<p>There is a contentious line drawn between science and the recorded history of religion, separating believers and non-believer and offered an opportunity for a interdisciplinary research that could apply the tools of science to disprove or verify the claims of the humanities.</p>
<p><strong>The Participation Program</strong></p>
<p>The Special Edition is a 3 subject presentation that allows everyone to evaluate the hypothesis, review the references, and by following the instructions in the use of the ICU application to produce photographic evidence for their personal review and consideration.</p>
<p><strong>How Was the Program Formed?</strong></p>
<p>A multidisciplinary research was required to develop a methodology that was simple to present with recognized sources that everyone can use to reacquire this lost knowledge by combining the references of antiquity and comparing the results they will produce.</p>
<p><strong>The Evaluation Framework</strong></p>
<p>The development required the disciplines of science and the participation of the humanities to evaluate the results of the investigation, and produce a presentation that would allow everyone to use their personal knowledge and experience and compare the recognized references and reproducible evidence they will produce.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of the Journey</strong></p>
<p>The journey to this time in the present has required 3-decades of exhaustive investigation, and the commercial development and availability of handheld devices that possess computing power are available to the public and allows everyone to photograph and confirm-what is hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>If everyone used The Solution, according to the writings of antiquity, then death could not claim the remaining souls of mankind.</p>

<p>You can get the word out and share what you have read to help those who seek answers to the difficult questions and you can easily use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

To assist the reader in understanding the veracity of the following information, I have included a link to my YouTube video that demonstrates the ancient knowledge and the legend that belongs to my family name.
I am the direct-lineal descendant of one of the original 10-thousand of the ancient past, and our family is known around the world as the 7 Samurai.

The written prophecies of antiquity identify our ancestral heritage, my birth, purpose, and this is what compels me to fulfill the legend of my family name and my purpose.

This fact is corroborated by data produced by modern science that identifies a population of @250-million in the first millennium whose ancestors were the original 10-thousand.
In the time of my ancestor, everyone was known by their kind (of mankind) and it was essential to know who you are, and what you possess.
In the present, a persons heritage has been lost, and replaced by identities, with names, and labels of race. As a result everyone does not know who they are, and the lack of this knowledge will affect their fate.

The Mission of the Program
The mission of this program began with my ancestor who was one of the original 10-thousand that are the ancestors of the 7-billion in the present.
The ancient knowledge of the previous myrietes  (10,000 years) was a secret kept by my family and our physical differences, attributes were used to evaluate the hypothesis of each subject in the Special Edition.
The Purpose of the Program
There is a contentious line drawn between science and the recorded history of religion, separating believers and non-believer and offered an opportunity for a interdisciplinary research that could apply the tools of science to disprove or verify the claims of the humanities.
The Participation Program
The Special Edition is a 3 subject presentation that allows everyone to evaluate the hypothesis, review the references, and by following the instructions in the use of the ICU application to produce photographic evidence for their personal review and consideration.
How Was the Program Formed?
A multidisciplinary research was required to develop a methodology that was simple to present with recognized sources that everyone can use to reacquire this lost knowledge by combining the references of antiquity and comparing the results they will produce.
The Evaluation Framework
The development required the disciplines of science and the participation of the humanities to evaluate the results of the investigation, and produce a presentation that would allow everyone to use their personal knowledge and experience and compare the recognized references and reproducible evidence they will produce.
Summary of the Journey
The journey to this time in the present has required 3-decades of exhaustive investigation, and the commercial development and availability of handheld devices that possess computing power are available to the public and allows everyone to photograph and confirm-what is hiding in plain sight.
The Impact

If everyone used The Solution, according to the writings of antiquity, then death could not claim the remaining souls of mankind.

The school needs to repair the roof, finish the additional classrooms with new bathroom facilities, fencing the school ground and rewiring the electric of the building.We have many fundraising plans in place for the spring and summer months, however, for those far and wide who can't attend, we hope you can contribute online. We hope you can find it in your hearts to contribute to this school.

Pastoralist Child Foundation is a US-based registered nonprofit that works to stop FGM/C (Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting) and forced child marriage in Kenya. ""Pastoralists"" are semi-nomadic people whose livelihood is primarily dependent on the herding of cattle, goats and camels. Girls in the Samburu tribe (cousins to the Maasai tribe) are standing up and voicing their opposition to these 2 ancient, harmful traditions that negatively affect them. By contributing to this campaign you'll empower 50 teen girls ages 13-17 when they attend this summer's educational workshop from August 9-13 during their school holidays. Pastoralist Child Foundation has secured $2,100.00 towards the budget and needs to raise an additional $1,625.00.  You'll make life-saving impacts on the lives of girls as they courageously resist long-standing traditions that can no longer be tolerated.

GIRLS BELONG IN SCHOOL AND DESERVE TO LIVE HAPPY, HEALTHY LIVES FULFILLING THEIR DREAMS! 

The Samburu tribe is a beautiful tribe with many unique and wonderful traditions. Our goal is to preserve the positive aspects of the Samburu culture and remove the suffering of girls who are marginalized due to retrogressive traditions.

Many effects of FGM/C and forced child marriage are detrimental:




extreme pain when cut with an unsterilized knife or razor blade, making girls vulnerable to HIV infection

shock, profuse bleeding or hemmorhaging (sometimes resulting in death)
long term/lifetime emotional, physical and psychological effects
painful menstruation, internal infections, infertility
negative impact on girl's socio-economic opportunities
high drop-out rate from primary school due to forced marriage
early first pregnancy before the girl's body is mature, leading to higher infant mortality
difficult childbirth and more incidents of post-partum  haemorrhaging 

The August 2015 workshop will be facilitated by healthcare professionals and social workers who all agree that FGM/C and forced child marriage should be eradicated. They will teach the following subjects: 


Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)
Child Marriage
Teen Pregnancy
Sexual & Reproductive Health
HIV/AIDS/STDs
Self-Awareness
Self-Esteem
Gender-based violence
Health & Sanitation
The importance of formal education
Planting Moringa trees




Girls having a lively brainstorming session during the April 2015 workshop



It's plain and simple - Girls don't want to be harmed anymore. They don't want to follow the status quo ""just because it's tradition.""  The harmful, non-medical (unnecessary!!) procedure of FGM/C will be replaced by Alternative Rites of Passage - replacing ""the cut"" with educational workshops followed by ceremonies with songs, dance, poetry, drama, and exchanging gifts. Now THAT'S the way to celebrate womanhood! 

  


Thanks to contributors to this campaign, more girls like ""Naserian"" will not undergo FGM/C.

help2kids has a partnership with Bajeviro, a local primary and nursery school serving
children from low-income families in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  While education is technically free in
Tanzania, there are a number of extra costs in obtaining an education that keep
kids from school. Financial barriers like purchasing the mandatory uniforms,
paying test fees and buying textbooks often prevent children from low-income
families from attending school. help2kids covers
these additional educational costs so that children in the Mbezi Beach area of
Dar es Salaam, can attend school regardless of their economic background. Bajeviro
serves about 300 students ranging in age from 4 to 16.

<h3>How are we different?</h3>
<p>In many universities, students are taught statistics based on the assumption that they are already very quantitatively literate. Obviously, this isn't the case for a huge proportion of students. Our teaching style assumes the student knows nothing about stats (na da!), and we begin teaching from the ground up: By telling a story that we can all relate to, such as being lied to by a dodgy friend.

<h3>Where will your contributions go?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us create a high-quality membership website that facilitates the delivery of online lectures along with a consultation section for students and practice exam papers with video solutions. The average cost for a professional web designer and developer to produce a premium-quality membership-based video learning website is $9,900 (quotes from Australia, Singapore, and Thailand).

<p>This is a very good question.

<p><strong>NICK PETRONZIO</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nick Petronzio is a second
generation sculptor, painter and artist that began his career in fine art
working under the tutelage of his father Robert Petronzio at age twelve. Coming
from an artistic family, mother Dora Bendahan a potter &amp; sister Nina, a
furniture and interior designer of Plushhome,
the artist knew his calling from an early age.<br/>
Acclaimed for his versatility in style,
technique and knowledge of materials, the award wining artist has produced
works that range from the reproduction of a Pietro Cipriani bronze sculpture
for the J. Paul Getty Museum to several fiberglass Disney characters including
Mickey Mouse, Rex and Pluto for Disney's theme parks world-wide. The artist has
also realized and enlarged several sculptures for celebrated artists including;
Vincent Capraro's (Bull fighter), Yayoi Kusama's (Hymn of Life Tulips), Erin
Lareau's (Walk of the Glass Slippers), Tanya Ragir's (Doubt kills the warrior)
and most recently, Nick has produced two monumental sized sculpture
enlargements for Jim Carrey.In addition to the interactive, educational and
public sculpture work Nick has developed, the artist has also created several
key sculptures for film &amp; television productions including Darren
Aranofsky's ""The Fountain"" and Rob Cohen's ""The Mummy; Tomb of
the Dragon Emperor"". Nick practices his craft daily and is always
expanding his knowledge, style and technique. His personal sculpture work
reveals his understanding of the human and animal anatomy and their gestural
movement but ultimately the experience, spirit and interconnectedness of all
things in nature. His fascination with the human form and with mankind's broad emotional
range has inspired him to create dynamic and sensitive works that carry a
quality of timelessness.<br/>

You gave participants the chance to experience UWC in a nutshell, but more importantly, you showed us how to change the world
The feeling of friendship and appreciation of diversity made me realize how narrow my life and my outlook on life were before the course

<p>I
have something you need! Do you want your child to reach their full potential?
Does your child need to improve their concentration in school? Have more confidence?
Reduce their stress? Learn about forgiveness and gratitude? <br/></p>
<p>Hi I'm Kim! I’ve
created My HOPE Dolls. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">They are spiritual and meditation plush talking dolls for every day life. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Do you know someone who is suffering from illness? Do you want to create peace and love? Are you against bullying? Against gun violence? Are you a military family? Do you support the LGBTQ community? Are you trying to learn forgiveness? Do you have things in life you are grateful for? Are you trying to overcome grief? My Hope Dolls are fun, educational, therapeutic and bring comfort to kids and adults. They make a great birthday gift, holiday gift or any time gift!   </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                                   </span></p>

<p>An
added feature of My HOPE Dolls is that you can record your own personal message
on them and the recipient will have your beautiful message to carry with them.   If you’re a grandparent who lives far away, a military parent who is deployed,
or you know someone who is in the hospital, the recipient will have your
personal message to treasure.</p>
<p>You
can be spiritual without practicing meditation. Spirituality and meditation are
not a religion. If you are Jewish, Muslim or Christian you can practice
spirituality and meditation. </p>
<p>Have
you ever experienced grief so great where a piece of yourself died too? I
experienced a great loss in my life when my baby died.<span>  With the help of fertility drugs, I
became pregnant, but my baby died during my
second trimester of pregnancy. My life was turned upside down. My life’s plans
had changed. I know what it’s like to be given a treasure and have that
treasure taken away from you. I relied on my spirituality and mediation to overcome grief.  During that process,  the idea of My HOPE Dolls was
born. My Hope Dolls are in memory of the baby I lost. As E.M. Forster said, “We
must be willing to let go of the life we planned, to have the life that is
waiting for us”. </span></p>

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's How You Can Be a Part of Making This        Happen </h3>
<b></b>
<h1>
</h1>
<p></p>
</div> <div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>1.
Pick a reward to the right and make a pledge. Early donations encourage others to donate too.</p>
<p>2.
Tell your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors. We need as much help as
possible. We are hoping to surpass the $25K goal. So please Tweet it, Facebook
it, Blog it, Talk it up!</p>
<h3><b>Where Does My Pledge Go?</b></h3>
<p>Your
generous pledge will pay for manufacturing all the dolls and their clothes.<br/></p>
<h3><b>What Will I Get for It?</b></h3>
<p>In
addition to knowing that you made a worthwhile and meaningful project come to
fruition, you also get some perks! Everything from book bags, t-shirts and Thank You tweets.  You will also be the first to own your own unique My Hope Doll!</p>
<p>Do you want to be a miracle in the life of a child? You can pay it forward and donate your perk. Your perk will inspire and empower a little girl in need. Once you pay for your perk and let us know you'd like to donate it, we will give it to a charity that will give it to a little girl in need. You can even choose which charity you'd like to donate it to from our list of selected charities. </p>

<h3><b>What Will You Do With ""Extra""
Money?</b></h3>
<p>The message is in the clothes. So it's important that we are able to manufacture as many clothes designs as possible. That way we can spread our messages about love, forgiveness, meditation, peace and gratitude. <br/></p>
<p>Our initial goal of $25K will allow us to manufacture the dolls and 3 clothes designs. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stretch goal #1</span> is to raise $75K so we can manufacture more clothes designs and start our line of kid products including book bags, clothes, puzzles, yoga mats and more.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stretch goal #2</span> is to raise 125K to manufacture all of our clothes designs and expand our line of kid products. <br/></p>
<p>Once we surpass $125K we will be able to create boy dolls and produce new girl dolls beyond the 6 we have so far. We can manufacture many more clothes and kid products to help spread  our messages. </p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to create a cartoon series and a line of children's books teaching our messages. </p>

<h3><b>Why Should I Pledge Right Now?</b></h3>
<p>Firstly,
because you want to be a part of creating something
wonderful - and your early donation helps encourage others to donate, too.</p>
<p>Secondly,
we have Early Bird Specials 1 and 2 where you can get perks at discounted prices. <br/></p>
<p>Also,
and this is of utmost importance: If we don't raise our goal, we can't manufacture our unique collection of dolls and kid products. You don't get our great perks and we can't move forward.
Sadly, no one gets a chance to own this unique collection of dolls. </p>

I
have something you need! Do you want your child to reach their full potential?
Does your child need to improve their concentration in school? Have more confidence?
Reduce their stress? Learn about forgiveness and gratitude? 
Hi I'm Kim! I’ve
created My HOPE Dolls. They are spiritual and meditation plush talking dolls for every day life. Do you know someone who is suffering from illness? Do you want to create peace and love? Are you against bullying? Against gun violence? Are you a military family? Do you support the LGBTQ community? Are you trying to learn forgiveness? Do you have things in life you are grateful for? Are you trying to overcome grief? My Hope Dolls are fun, educational, therapeutic and bring comfort to kids and adults. They make a great birthday gift, holiday gift or any time gift!                                                      
                                                  
An
added feature of My HOPE Dolls is that you can record your own personal message
on them and the recipient will have your beautiful message to carry with them.   If you’re a grandparent who lives far away, a military parent who is deployed,
or you know someone who is in the hospital, the recipient will have your
personal message to treasure.
You
can be spiritual without practicing meditation. Spirituality and meditation are
not a religion. If you are Jewish, Muslim or Christian you can practice
spirituality and meditation. 
Have
you ever experienced grief so great where a piece of yourself died too? I
experienced a great loss in my life when my baby died.  With the help of fertility drugs, I
became pregnant, but my baby died during my
second trimester of pregnancy. My life was turned upside down. My life’s plans
had changed. I know what it’s like to be given a treasure and have that
treasure taken away from you. I relied on my spirituality and mediation to overcome grief.  During that process,  the idea of My HOPE Dolls was
born. My Hope Dolls are in memory of the baby I lost. As E.M. Forster said, “We
must be willing to let go of the life we planned, to have the life that is
waiting for us”. 






Here's How You Can Be a Part of Making This        Happen 




 
1.
Pick a reward to the right and make a pledge. Early donations encourage others to donate too.
2.
Tell your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors. We need as much help as
possible. We are hoping to surpass the $25K goal. So please Tweet it, Facebook
it, Blog it, Talk it up!
Where Does My Pledge Go?
Your
generous pledge will pay for manufacturing all the dolls and their clothes.
What Will I Get for It?
In
addition to knowing that you made a worthwhile and meaningful project come to
fruition, you also get some perks! Everything from book bags, t-shirts and Thank You tweets.  You will also be the first to own your own unique My Hope Doll!
Do you want to be a miracle in the life of a child? You can pay it forward and donate your perk. Your perk will inspire and empower a little girl in need. Once you pay for your perk and let us know you'd like to donate it, we will give it to a charity that will give it to a little girl in need. You can even choose which charity you'd like to donate it to from our list of selected charities. 


What Will You Do With ""Extra""
Money?
The message is in the clothes. So it's important that we are able to manufacture as many clothes designs as possible. That way we can spread our messages about love, forgiveness, meditation, peace and gratitude. 
Our initial goal of $25K will allow us to manufacture the dolls and 3 clothes designs. 
Stretch goal #1 is to raise $75K so we can manufacture more clothes designs and start our line of kid products including book bags, clothes, puzzles, yoga mats and more.
Stretch goal #2 is to raise 125K to manufacture all of our clothes designs and expand our line of kid products. 
Once we surpass $125K we will be able to create boy dolls and produce new girl dolls beyond the 6 we have so far. We can manufacture many more clothes and kid products to help spread  our messages. 
Our ultimate goal is to create a cartoon series and a line of children's books teaching our messages. 



Why Should I Pledge Right Now?
Firstly,
because you want to be a part of creating something
wonderful - and your early donation helps encourage others to donate, too.
Secondly,
we have Early Bird Specials 1 and 2 where you can get perks at discounted prices. 
Also,
and this is of utmost importance: If we don't raise our goal, we can't manufacture our unique collection of dolls and kid products. You don't get our great perks and we can't move forward.
Sadly, no one gets a chance to own this unique collection of dolls. 



We Want Your Testimonials

Once
you receive your My HOPE Doll, email us your story with the heading: 
What My
HOPE Doll means to me.
Send
us a picture of you and your My HOPE Doll in your favorite outfit from our
collection. Include your name, city, state or country you live in. We will be
posting stories on our webpage.






So, let's all start spreading the word and give our children a tool that will help them in life!
I am passionate about this project, and I invite you to be a part of it. Thank you for reading this and watching our video. And thank you so very much for pledging and helping us spread the word! 

In Gratitude,Kim

</p><p><strong>Rainbow Children</strong>®<strong> movement stories classes offer an alternative,
holistic, balanced and effective self-development education for children.<span>  Your support with this project will help us
to resource the next generation to become all they can be, to benefit them and
the world that we all share.</span></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
key benefits and outcomes for children participating in Rainbow Children
movement story classes are:</p>
<p>*
Increased ability to focus</p>
<p>*
Awareness of emotions and how to self-regulate</p>
<p>*
Increased cardio-vascular fitness</p>
<p>*
Flexibility – both in body and mind</p>
<p>*
Ability to relax</p>
<p>*
Reconnection of body with mind</p>
<p>*
Appreciation of the joy of movement/non-competitive exercise</p>
<p>*
Feeling connected to self, others and the greater community</p>
<p></p>
<p>By offering a joyful
connection to self, others and nature, Rainbow Children aims to ease the
problems that we see in adolescents and young adults such as depression and
addiction.</p>
<p>The project has been
successful, with the development and delivery of classes through a network of
dedicated teachers and a 'use at home' book and CD.<span>  So far, however, the project is mainly
reaching children whose parents already have an interest in alternative and
holistic educational methods.  The aim of
this funding is to reach a wider range of children, those whose lives would not
otherwise be enriched by this type of education; enabling a campaign to reach
out to schools to let them know about this ground-breaking approach and to
encourage them to include these classes as part of their curriculum.  </span></p>
<p>By donating to this project
you will be giving children the opportunity to experience the joy of
connection, clear and focused attention, balanced development and free
self-expression. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</b></p>
<p>The funds raised will fund a website
specifically aimed at schools (which will be <a href=""http://www.movementstories.com),"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.movementstories.com),</a> ‘off the
shelf’ materials for school teachers to use in classes, an e-mail, telephone
and free demo class campaign to reach schools across the UK.<span>  </span></p>
<p>There are a number of benefits
for those donating to the project – books, CDs, personal development tools for
adults, magical events for children and the heart-warming feeling of enriching
children’s lives.<span>  <br/></span></p>
<p>Should the we raise less than
the total amount, the e-mail and telephone campaign will simply be reduced in scope to reach the geographical areas
that we feel will benefit most.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The benefits of this approach</strong></p>
<p>There has been much research
into the benefits of yoga and mindfulness and their benefits in schools but the
problem with both of these approaches or even both approaches combined is that
when they are in the midst of stress and trauma, few children have the ability
to sit still enough to take part in a sitting practice or stay on a yoga mat
for an hour. If you are not ready to sit in classroom then you are not ready to
do sitting meditation or reflective movement practice. Our over-stimulated
students simply cannot sit still. Teachers tell kids 100 times a day to sit and
pay attention. It doesn’t work.</p>
<p>To
engage children and achieve mental, physical and emotional release, relaxation,
mindfulness, body-mind connection and awareness a combination of approaches is
necessary. It is also of utmost importance that the methodology is FUN! Adults
can reason as to why an activity is good for them (such as mindfulness and
yoga) and thus stick to it until the positive results are felt. Children need
to enjoy something to keep focus, participate fully and stick with it. Rainbow
Children ticks all of the boxes with its unique format of free-form dance and
self-expression through movement, creative yoga-style movement, music, song and
breathing/relaxation/creative visualisation techniques all held within
captivating, therapeutic teaching stories with enchanting characters.</p>

<br/></div>","Rainbow Children® movement stories classes offer an alternative,
holistic, balanced and effective self-development education for children.  Your support with this project will help us
to resource the next generation to become all they can be, to benefit them and
the world that we all share.

The
key benefits and outcomes for children participating in Rainbow Children
movement story classes are:
*
Increased ability to focus
*
Awareness of emotions and how to self-regulate
*
Increased cardio-vascular fitness
*
Flexibility – both in body and mind
*
Ability to relax
*
Reconnection of body with mind
*
Appreciation of the joy of movement/non-competitive exercise
*
Feeling connected to self, others and the greater community

By offering a joyful
connection to self, others and nature, Rainbow Children aims to ease the
problems that we see in adolescents and young adults such as depression and
addiction.
The project has been
successful, with the development and delivery of classes through a network of
dedicated teachers and a 'use at home' book and CD.  So far, however, the project is mainly
reaching children whose parents already have an interest in alternative and
holistic educational methods.  The aim of
this funding is to reach a wider range of children, those whose lives would not
otherwise be enriched by this type of education; enabling a campaign to reach
out to schools to let them know about this ground-breaking approach and to
encourage them to include these classes as part of their curriculum.  
By donating to this project
you will be giving children the opportunity to experience the joy of
connection, clear and focused attention, balanced development and free
self-expression. 

What We Need & What You
Get
The funds raised will fund a website
specifically aimed at schools (which will be www.movementstories.com), ‘off the
shelf’ materials for school teachers to use in classes, an e-mail, telephone
and free demo class campaign to reach schools across the UK.  
There are a number of benefits
for those donating to the project – books, CDs, personal development tools for
adults, magical events for children and the heart-warming feeling of enriching
children’s lives.  
Should the we raise less than
the total amount, the e-mail and telephone campaign will simply be reduced in scope to reach the geographical areas
that we feel will benefit most.

The benefits of this approach
There has been much research
into the benefits of yoga and mindfulness and their benefits in schools but the
problem with both of these approaches or even both approaches combined is that
when they are in the midst of stress and trauma, few children have the ability
to sit still enough to take part in a sitting practice or stay on a yoga mat
for an hour. If you are not ready to sit in classroom then you are not ready to
do sitting meditation or reflective movement practice. Our over-stimulated
students simply cannot sit still. Teachers tell kids 100 times a day to sit and
pay attention. It doesn’t work.

engage children and achieve mental, physical and emotional release, relaxation,
mindfulness, body-mind connection and awareness a combination of approaches is

<strong>
</strong><p>     East New York Memorial Classic is 501(c)(3) not
for profit organization. Six guys from Brooklyn, NY decided to start a
basketball tournament to give the youth in the community the opportunity to
showcase their talent. There were tournaments all around city and uptown but
nothing this huge in Brooklyn. So we established the East New York Memorial
Classic and are currently approaching our 10th year. The starting point was
rough but we remained focused. We've grown over the years from t-shirts to
jerseys. Then we expanded from 8 teams to 16 teams. Lastly, from a couple of
hundred fans to a few thousand on a nightly basis. Through our dedication,
focus and hard work we have become one of the best tournaments in the tri-state
area.<br/>
<br/>
      As we want to expand, broaden our horizons and share our visions we're looking
to incorporate a junior league for our youth. The talk around the city is that
kids playing street ball on the playgrounds are non-existent. We beg to differ,
if you are a fan of basketball, you know that playground basketball is alive
and well. With that being said, we want to give them somewhere they can come
and gain the necessary structure and foundation needed to succeed in a
competitive environment. With the help of anyone that donates, we can help the youth
live up to their full potential.</p>
<p>     With our tournament we
look to teach kids some important aspects of life. One way of doing that is
through sports. This can be very important because it teaches them teamwork and
how to do it in an organized way. This will be an outlet for our youth to use
their energy in a positive way. This also will be another way for those who are
socially challenged to collaborate with someone with a common interest. Our
goal is to build the confidence needed to make them want to reach for success.
We're looking forward to being a positive influence on our youth as they
progress through life.</p>
     Also, by supporting our campaign, you will help us with our back to school give back. There are so many children who lack the support from family members. With this funding we would be able to help children get the school year started off correctly by providing them with school supplies. Just a little assistance like this goes a long way in a child's mind.<br/><p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<p>We
earnestly need funds to setup our local school software , train our young
employees, and expand our operations to over 1000 schools in Ghana.<br/>
<br/>
Most school children are downhearted over their academic reports at the end of

Over 85% of schools in Ghana do not have an Management system to accurately
access students performance as most is done manually ; full of errors. Others
who have systems to use complain about inaccuracy of information generated or
non-expertise to help manage the system. We have therefore tested a system that
could solve both the management system type and requisite support personnel
problem.<br/>
Our tested system was meant to provide an accurate information system to
schools and create employment for the youth in our society.<br/>
How the system was tested ? <br/>
<b>1) The System:</b> We wanted to get
software as a service (SaaS) system that would work perfectly. Though we are
developers we tried to get an already existing system to test our plans.
Therefore joined Fedena as an OEM partner Fedena is easy customizable ERP
software for schools. With this Idea we were able to get about 25 schools
within 2months.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2) Create Employment: </b> We were
able to employ 21 young talented people. Those employed were graduates from
certified IT training centers in Ghana including NIIT and IPMC. Others too were
brilliant young Senior high school graduates. <br/>
Our focus was to create a sustainable livelihood for the young and provide
a better school management system  for schools.<br/>And this had been deeply ascertained by the aforementioned
testing software system.<br/>
<b>Our Employment structure(funding our employees)</b>- our system was designed to generate a recurring fund
from the schools. This is easily achievable by charging server cost from the
school and also each student paying a small amount (0.25cent) per term to
save the systems operation. This technique is convincingly acceptable by the
schools since our system runs online. <b><br/>
<br/>
Why Our Campaign?</b>
<p><b></b>We
are using an OEM system, which does not belong to us and does not fit our local
education system. Since the system was customized to suite our local
educational report system, the report generated is a bit different from what is
expected. Hence, the need to get our locally manufactured management software.
We have young talented developers to help facilitate the new online application
software.<br/>
Also since our young staff needs training before they are deployed to their
various stations (schools) to manage the system, we urgently need a training
center for training, testing, research and development. A fully equipped center
for such a purpose involves getting a state of the art IT lab. <br/>
<br/>
In short, we will create more employment for the youth and provide a better
system to help in generating examination report for schools in Ghana. <br/>
<br/>
<b>The Funding: </b><br/>
We need USD 64,500 for the entire project. This is for the software
development, setting up a computer lab and management.<br/>
<br/>
Software Application Development  and Online Server Cost: USD19,000.<br/>
Training Centre Setup Cost: USD  37,500<br/>
Nationwide Branding and Advertising : USD  6,500<br/>
Management and Misc : USD 1,500<br/>
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and
specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.<br/>
<br/>
Though we plan to raise 64,500 for the entire project we could easily manage
any amount that we get. The total amount is for the total software development
(which comprise 12 modules: Academics, Examination, Library, Hostel ,HR,
Registration, Attendance, Time Table, Resource Centre, Assignment, Finance and
Transportation.  <br/>
If we are not able to meet our target, any fund generated would be used on the
primary modules to start with. And with time internally generated funds would
be used to complete the rest.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>Impact: </b><br/>
How can school children be encouraged to go to school if their end of term reports
misrepresents their efforts? Most
school children in Ghana are mentally worried due to the inaccuracy of academic
performance reports they receive at the end of each school term.<br/>
On the other hand, most young people after graduating for professional IT
certification institutions do not get employment. Unemployment rate in Ghana is
very high currently. And will get worse due to IMF restriction coming on board.
The issue is then that, how can we as ordinary people help in the creation of
jobs for our fellow people. That is our main focus now, and we need your help
to achieve just that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As a BSc Degree Holder in Actuarial
Science, I have led our team to worked so hard to reduce the risk factor and
the error margin in our operation. Though we have some challenges ahead of us,
we still have a larger strength position to let this idea happen.</p>
<p>This is because, the IT and Management
Information System to be precise is taken hold of our daily operational
management tasks. We cannot generate accurate information without using the
latest and accurate technological methodology. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the
potential of software development delay due to decision taken today been
subsequently overtaken by event. We can also envisage the difficulty in getting
most schools at the initials since many schools prefer tried and tested
systems. Hence our growth pace will increase with time.</p>
<p>But with our well-organized system and
an already tested approach, we hope to grow faster than even planned. We have a
well-planned approach to the system development and also to the branding and
marketing of the product. </p>
<p>Our ""to create-employment ""

send them to the schools to manage the system on our behalf. And as we offer

<h3>What will the game be like?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike a typical statistics class, this game is not about calculations. The statistical calculations are done for you. <span>This game is about interpreting statistical results and developing the mental models to reason about the world probabilistically. </span></p>
<p>It is inspired by <i>The Oregon Trail</i>, a classic game that lets you make a series of bad decisions and then learn from them!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will I be able to do after playing the game?</h3>
<p>After playing the game, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a gut sense for what a standard deviation of 2.4 means</li>
<li>Have a gut sense for what correlation coefficients of -0.4, 0.1, and 0.6 look like</li>
<li>Use the correlation coefficient between two variables to make predictions of one variable based on the other</li>
<li>Justify use of normal distribution models using the Central Limit Theorem</li>
<li>Use a graphical form of Bayesian hypothesis testing to pick the more likely hypothesis</li>
<li>Apply a z-test to determine if the difference in the sample mean is statistically different</li>
<li>Interpret p-values (very carefully)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why statistics?</h3> <p>There's an entire subject dedicated to explaining randomness in real life and how we can model its behavior to our advantage!<br/></p>

</div></div>","What will the game be like?

Unlike a typical statistics class, this game is not about calculations. The statistical calculations are done for you. This game is about interpreting statistical results and developing the mental models to reason about the world probabilistically. 
It is inspired by The Oregon Trail, a classic game that lets you make a series of bad decisions and then learn from them!

What will I be able to do after playing the game?
After playing the game, you will be able to:

Have a gut sense for what a standard deviation of 2.4 means
Have a gut sense for what correlation coefficients of -0.4, 0.1, and 0.6 look like
Use the correlation coefficient between two variables to make predictions of one variable based on the other
Justify use of normal distribution models using the Central Limit Theorem
Use a graphical form of Bayesian hypothesis testing to pick the more likely hypothesis
Apply a z-test to determine if the difference in the sample mean is statistically different
Interpret p-values (very carefully)

Why statistics? There's an entire subject dedicated to explaining randomness in real life and how we can model its behavior to our advantage!


I fell in love with statistics during my time at MIT, and I want to take the concepts from serious statistics classes and pool them into a game about everyday life so they are accessible to more people.


Who are you?

I am a graduate of the MIT Computer Science Department and the MIT Media Lab. I am a freelance programmer with the World Bank working on intuitive data visualizations for rural populations. In my free time, I work on  interactive stories about probability like Adventures in Cognitive Biases and The Raccoon Princess and the Fox Prince: A Bayesian Parable. 
Timmy's Journey is going to be different from anything I've worked on in the past... it is going to be my first full-fledged game.   
What age group is this for?

<p>Thank
you for supporting my campaign to study abroad in Barcelona, Spain. My name is

<h3> Our Story<br/>
</h3>We are helping our friend and colleague, Rhoena Dehaan, <b>build a new school</b>, daycare, and community space in her hometown village of <b>Kwakwani, Guyana</b> in South America.  Rhoena was born in this village, but she has lived in Canada, teaching preschool and college for many years.  She goes back every year to visit and support her village. Quentin Krogstad and Janet Steeves are teachers who have become <b>passionate </b>supporters of The Guyana Project, and this campaign is their effort to help grow it.<br/>This is a <b>grassroots</b>, <b>personal</b>, and <b>heartfelt </b>campaign, and we are friends and fellow educators helping Rhoena to realize her childhood dream of bettering her community through education.  This is not a registered charity, but simply a collection of caring people trying to make a difference in the world.  The benefit of this is that there are no administrative costs or other fees, and all of your donation goes directly and completely to the work being done.<br/>This campaign is important because it allows us to recognize our place of privilege and give to those who have less.  By creating a safe, healthy school environment, we are giving children an opportunity for education and success that was previously unavailable to them.  This school is a concrete, authentic example of people working together to reach across the globe to make a real difference.  <br/>By contributing even the smallest amount to join with us, you become part of both a local and global community committed to <b>making the world a better place</b>.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>So far, we have raised over $30,000 in the past 2 years, which assisted in the construction of the outer shell of the school.  We <b>need over $100,000 </b>to finish the construction and furnishing of the building, landscaping, creation of a playground, and much more.

<p>For <b>$10</b>, you can contribute to the school <b>library</b>.  Your name will be written in the book(s) you purchase.<br/></p>
<p>For <b>$25</b>, you will buy a <b>chair</b> for the school.  These chairs are handmade in the village of Kwakwani, so this donation benefits the community twice!  You can have your name on the chair you donate to show your connection.</p>
<p>For <b>$50</b>, you can purchase a stack of <b>cinder blocks</b>.  Your name will be placed on the wall as a supporter of the building.</p>

The program will require more but this will kick start many costs that are essential to launch us. These expenses include rental space, teacher compensation, field trips, and arts supplies. The Lyric foundation sees this new education plan as a long term initiative, and showing support on this campaign will add power to our appeal for larger grants. </li> <li>We are operating under a flexible funding program so even if we don't make 20,000 every little bit will still help!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li> By contributing to this cause you can help initiate social change. The chance to speak out about afflictions and struggles that make us unique is an opportunity many take for granted. What if you couldn't tell people where it hurts or why? What if in the most successful educational realms, you became an after thought? Donating will help birth a program that will change your community for the better by inspiring human empathy and raising awareness all the while creating new opportunity for teens with Autism.</li>
<li>  We would like to Identify our mentor group: The Miracle Project. Willem Long has worked closely with the founder Elaine Hall on her successful Arts for Autism Program The Miracle Project. Her programs success is beautifully chronicled in the HBO documentary Autism the Musical. This Veteran group has already offered us guidance and support on our journey to create more opportunities for ASD students. Other supportive parties include The Music Center, RFK, Westside Regional Center, The Royal Jacks, and Lissie.</li>
<li> 1 in 68 births in the US result in ASD diagnosis. Chances are you know someone who has ASD or  someone who has a family member on the spectrum. Opportunities for those who struggle with ASD can be few and far between, but when those opportunities have been present the results are phenomenal.  </li>

   What We Need & What You Get  We are asking for 25,000  to kick off our initial fundraising campaign! The program will require more but this will kick start many costs that are essential to launch us. These expenses include rental space, teacher compensation, field trips, and arts supplies. The Lyric foundation sees this new education plan as a long term initiative, and showing support on this campaign will add power to our appeal for larger grants.  We are operating under a flexible funding program so even if we don't make 20,000 every little bit will still help!    The Impact   By contributing to this cause you can help initiate social change. The chance to speak out about afflictions and struggles that make us unique is an opportunity many take for granted. What if you couldn't tell people where it hurts or why? What if in the most successful educational realms, you became an after thought? Donating will help birth a program that will change your community for the better by inspiring human empathy and raising awareness all the while creating new opportunity for teens with Autism.
  We would like to Identify our mentor group: The Miracle Project. Willem Long has worked closely with the founder Elaine Hall on her successful Arts for Autism Program The Miracle Project. Her programs success is beautifully chronicled in the HBO documentary Autism the Musical. This Veteran group has already offered us guidance and support on our journey to create more opportunities for ASD students. Other supportive parties include The Music Center, RFK, Westside Regional Center, The Royal Jacks, and Lissie.
 1 in 68 births in the US result in ASD diagnosis. Chances are you know someone who has ASD or  someone who has a family member on the spectrum. Opportunities for those who struggle with ASD can be few and far between, but when those opportunities have been present the results are phenomenal.  
Risks & Challenges

  Although the Lyric has always made education a priority, we are aware that this education plan is new. Having worked with successful education institutions and foundations like The Miracle Project and Fusion academy, we are confident that we have the support necessary to avoid first time mistakes. The combination of our passion and the investment of larger well established organizations like the RFK, will make us prime for success. The real challenge is raising the money, as the out pour of support for our program has been inspiring! In the early stages of building this program it has been amazing to witness the encouragement and support being offered already. I can say confidently that our students will be given a top education by some of the most talented teaching artists in LA as well as a substantial platform to speak their truth in a safe, fun, and nurturing environment.     Other Ways You Can Help  We understand that not everybody can give their money, but we also want support! Please get the word out about our Program. Tell everyone about the teens with Autism that have the power to change the world!  Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p><b>The Terra-a-Terra Team </b></p>
<p><i>Terra-a-Terra</i> is a Portuguese expression that means “down to earth” and it can be used to describe a person who is very practical, uncomplicated and a problem solver.
</p>
<p>In June 2012, Madalena, a
Portuguese architect travelled to India and, during that trip, she was asked to
design the architecture project for a school in a small community in Khatangi-Bihar.
After Madalena returned to Portugal, she started <i>Terra-a-Terra</i>, a group of volunteers that designs and implements
sustainable architecture projects in developing countries.</p>
<p>In 2013, <i>Padrinhos de Portugal</i> asked <i>Terra-a-Terra</i>
to design and raise the funds necessary for the new daycare centre at Praia
Nova. Once we saw the current conditions of the centre we could only say YES to
this challenge and start work right away! The current team
has six members: Madalena, Luísa, Duarte, Marco, João, and Marta.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442357632/imkronhu2uknz5gtt1yt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Team working. <br/></span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is what we have prepared for the children of Praia Nova:</span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442357736/dgneyzjlq0mrsrspedux.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The centre seen from the playground.</span></p><p></p>

DAYCARE CENTRE FOR 234 ORPHAN CHILDREN IN THE CITY OF BEIRA, MOZAMBIQUE

The orphan children of Praia NovaWelcome to the neighbourhood
of Praia Nova, in city of Beira, in the eastern part of Mozambique! Here live
more than 230 orphan children who have lost one or both of their parents to
HIV/AIDS and have little familiar ties left.These children are supported
by a Portuguese NGO called Padrinhos de
Portugal (Godparents of Portugal) and by the Movimento das Mães Cristãs Intercessessoras contra o HIV/SIDA
(Christian Mothers’ Movement against HIV/AIDS), a Mozambican NGO. All the children
are fostered by Portuguese godfather or godmother, who provides for their education
and financial needs, and are taken care of and followed up closely by the team
of Movimento das Mães.Most children don’t have a
sound familiar structure and spend long parts of their day at a daycare centre
that is run by the Mothers and funded by the Padrinhos. Even though they don’t
live at the centre, that’s the place where they have all the daily meals, do their
homework and spend much of their free time… Currently, the
centre looks like this:
There are only two
small “classrooms” and the children have to use it in turns.
The centre is
located near the river and it floods frequently, so the children have no place to stay…There are no proper
bathrooms.
When we see these pictures one thing only comes to our minds: the children of Praia Nova need a new daycare centre! And
that’s where the Terra-a-Terra team comes in!

The Terra-a-Terra Team 
Terra-a-Terra is a Portuguese expression that means “down to earth” and it can be used to describe a person who is very practical, uncomplicated and a problem solver.

In June 2012, Madalena, a
Portuguese architect travelled to India and, during that trip, she was asked to

For those who do survive the treacherous journey, the terrifying ordeal is not over.Children often arrive in Europe scared and exhausted. Many have seen and experienced untold horrors during their journey. 


The physical impact of travelling is also clear. Many of the children have severe
sunburns and blisters from their journey. Many have lost their toenails from the 
huge distances they have walked.

Refugee children are frightened, homeless and many have witnessed unspeakable horrors. You can help them. Save the Children's teams are working across Europe and in the countries they are fleeing to provide aid and support. Help them to reach more refugee children.

 What Save the Children are doing
Save the Children work along the whole route that refugees take as well as in the countries they are fleeing. In countries like Turkey, Greece and Italy, they provide children and their families with essentials that they desperately need - like food, water and shelter, as well as items like soap and toilet paper.
They also run centres where children can shower, receive medical help and make calls.
Making sure that children are protected wherever possible is vital – Save the Children identify child protection needs and make sure that they’re aware of their legal rights.
They also continue to work in countries like Syria, where brutal war has ripped apart the lives of millions, as well as neighbouring countries where many have fled to, such as Lebanon and Jordan.
Here, they provide children and their families with much needed food, safe water, medicine and shelter.
Save the Children also help children to return to school, make sure that they are getting the psychological support they need and run literacy and numeracy centres.

How you can help

Save the Children are doing whatever it takes to provide essential support to the thousands of children in need but they desperately need your support to respond to this crisis.For every £1 they receive, Save the Children spend 88p on activities to benefit children, 11p to raise the next £1 and 1p on governance and other costs.

<div><b>Practically 50% of Marriages end in Divorce and nearly half of those Divorce's involve CHILDREN! </b></div>
<div><b>WE NEED TO HELP THE KIDS.</b></div> <p><b><i>Welcome. My name is Karla Lee and I am the Author and founder of ""Voice 4 Kids"". </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>(Helping Children of Divorce have a Voice, and bringing Communication back into the home).</i></b></p>
<p>To first give you an understanding of why we are fundraising, let me tell you a little about myself.</p>
<p>My Parents separated when I was 9yrs old and for the next 17yrs I struggled with the pain from their divorce. </p>
<p><i><b>Why it happened to me? </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Why did I feel like I was the only one going through this? </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>What did my future now hold for me now?</b></i></p>
<p>I couldn't find anything to help me understand my pain. There was a lot of help out there for Parents, <i><b>but what about us kids?</b></i></p>
</div><div>
<p>The reason this is important to me is because children of today are crying out to be heard but many are too young to speak up for themselves. I have moved forward after much pain, and gone on to live happily married for 13years with two beautiful daughters, <b><i>but it's not like that fore everyone.</i></b></p>
<p>The average age of Children that are going through divorce is between (7-12yrs old). These children are too young to stand up for themselves, so I have chosen to speak up and represent them.</p>
<p><i><b>Children need both a Mother &amp; Father despite the circumstances. </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Yes there is the 20% of parents who are not thinking in the best interests of the children. OR they may not be able to care for their child due their own addictions or personal behaviours.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>I am not talking about them, I am talking about the 80% of Parents who both love their Children. Where one caring and loving parent has been alienated and shut out of their personal relationship with their child. </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>I ASK: ""Was their ANY consideration for the children and how THEY feel?</b></i><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>""</b></i></p>
<p>Both Parents bring wonderful strengths to a child. A Mother can not give to a child what a Father has, and it also works the other way. </p>
<p>Parents have been entrusted with a gift, a child. This child is the DNA of their Mother &amp; Father. Children do not see faults within their parents, they just want their time and to be loved. </p>
<p>They are the most forgiving human beings, and only ask that parents would put their differences aside and think of their perspective.</p>
<p>Ever since I launched my 2 books <i><b>""Please don't go!""</b></i> and <i><b>""Is it my fault?""</b></i> in 2003 <b>(<a href=""http://www.voice4kids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.voice4kids.com</a>) </b>I have made it my life's mission to reach nations on behalf of these Children, and for once let them be heard.</p>

Our team has established the first In-Home Child Sponsorship program on the continent. The project has been designed to support both an orphaned child and his or her surviving relatives with the goal of keeping families together while making the orphan communes available for only the most imperative situations. Relatives taking on the parental responsibilities of a niece, nephew, or young cousin will do so on a conditional basis; each household will receive a per annum, circumstantially determined stipend (a pre-determined monetary sum, PTA school fees, medical assistance, school supplies, uniforms, text books, shoes, as well as rice, seeds, and cooking oil) with full understanding that it will be conditional and made available only as certain requirements of the child’s rearing are met. These stipulations include that the child attend a decent school and maintain certain expectations in their evaluations, and that he or she is fully vaccinated and receives whatever healthcare that may be specific to their personal needs.</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p>CameroonONE, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, focuses on helping orphaned children in Cameroon obtain basic human essentials by placing them in the households of surviving relatives and seeing that they receive access to essential healthcare, food and education. All of the funds that are raised drive will be given to children through CameroonONE's In-Home Sponsorship and Orphan Health and Education Program. If even one child no longer has to work in cement mines to pay for basic human necessities such as shoes, then we will have made a difference. Each dollar donated helps contribute to the greater effort of providing essentials to Cameroonian children!</p><p>For example:<br/>
<span>- 2 Dollars will buy a guinea pig to go to a Destitute / Orphan child's family<br/>
- 4 Dollars would buy a chicken to enable a family to eat eggs<br/>
- 46 Dollars will buy a goat for an elderly person or orphan family<br/>
- 85 Dollars can cover the entire expenses of a toddler for a month<br/>
-450 Dollars will pay a child's apprenticeship fees for 3 years</span><br/></p><p><b>The Goal</b></p><p>For Cameroonian children, the need for basic essentials is great. Here is how you can help:</p><p>- Visit <a href=""http://www.cameroonone.org%2C/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cameroonone.org</a> to learn more about CameroonONE and the children that they help.</p><p>- <b>Raise Awareness! </b>Share this campaign with friends, family, and colleagues. Word of mouth can mean more than you think!</p><p>- Join the CameroonONE group on Facebook and keep an eye out for future fundraising events: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/CameroonONE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/CameroonONE</a></p><p>- <b>DONATE WHATEVER AND WHENEVER YOU CAN!</b></p><p>Your generosity means a great deal, for is frequently impossible for extended family to provide basic care to orphaned children. For the most part, they simply cannot afford to pay for the food, clothes, and medical care needed. Talk about the issues. Be aware of the hardships faced in other countries and by other populations.

The project has been designed to support both an orphaned child and his or her surviving relatives with the goal of keeping families together while making the orphan communes available for only the most imperative situations. Relatives taking on the parental responsibilities of a niece, nephew, or young cousin will do so on a conditional basis; each household will receive a per annum, circumstantially determined stipend (a pre-determined monetary sum, PTA school fees, medical assistance, school supplies, uniforms, text books, shoes, as well as rice, seeds, and cooking oil) with full understanding that it will be conditional and made available only as certain requirements of the child’s rearing are met. These stipulations include that the child attend a decent school and maintain certain expectations in their evaluations, and that he or she is fully vaccinated and receives whatever healthcare that may be specific to their personal needs.The ImpactCameroonONE, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, focuses on helping orphaned children in Cameroon obtain basic human essentials by placing them in the households of surviving relatives and seeing that they receive access to essential healthcare, food and education. All of the funds that are raised drive will be given to children through CameroonONE's In-Home Sponsorship and Orphan Health and Education Program. If even one child no longer has to work in cement mines to pay for basic human necessities such as shoes, then we will have made a difference. Each dollar donated helps contribute to the greater effort of providing essentials to Cameroonian children!For example:
- 2 Dollars will buy a guinea pig to go to a Destitute / Orphan child's family
- 4 Dollars would buy a chicken to enable a family to eat eggs
- 46 Dollars will buy a goat for an elderly person or orphan family
- 85 Dollars can cover the entire expenses of a toddler for a month
-450 Dollars will pay a child's apprenticeship fees for 3 yearsThe GoalFor Cameroonian children, the need for basic essentials is great. Here is how you can help:- Visit www.cameroonone.org to learn more about CameroonONE and the children that they help.- Raise Awareness! Share this campaign with friends, family, and colleagues. Word of mouth can mean more than you think!- Join the CameroonONE group on Facebook and keep an eye out for future fundraising events: www.facebook.com/CameroonONE- DONATE WHATEVER AND WHENEVER YOU CAN!Your generosity means a great deal, for is frequently impossible for extended family to provide basic care to orphaned children. For the most part, they simply cannot afford to pay for the food, clothes, and medical care needed. Talk about the issues. Be aware of the hardships faced in other countries and by other populations.

<p>The area we stayed in is mainly populated by Masai. The government introduced a law a few years ago that the Masai (they were originally nomads) have to send their children to school.

<p>We stayed near the village of Namelok (look for Kimana if you want to find it on google maps). A few hundred meters from where we stayed there is a Masai village. The people there live very simply, they have kettle, clay houses (manyattas) and a lot of children. What they don't have is the money to let all their children go to school.

With your help, I will be a delegate of the Eco Cuban Networks Sustainable Agriculture Rooted in Community/Nature's Friends from October 2 – 11, 2015

During the course of the tour we will:

Compare indigenous land management and modern permaculture design
Discuss the invisible threads that hold together urban agriculture: public policies, cultural practices, land use patterns, generativity
Inquire into the role of faith communities in regard to feeding people and sustainability

Formerly importing most of its food, Cuba's agriculture is now 95% organic, with the city of Havana producing over 60% of its own fruits and vegetables within the city's urban spaces.  At the same time, Cuba has been engaging in reforestation and investing in alternative energy production, with a focus on solar and biofuels.
Itinerary:

City Tour of Havana with Cuban Architect/Sustainable Urban Planner
Urban gardens/farmer's markets
Herbal Medicinal Farm and Green Pharmacy
Paolo Freire Center and Murealando Community
Matanzas polyclinic, family doctor clinic and school
Alamar Organoponico
Permaculture urban and rural farms
AfroCuban communities of Regla and Guanabacoa and Casa Africa
Cubasolar, NGO promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency



During my stay, I will be visiting the Cuban Polytechnic Institute to lay the ground work for a Spring  2016 Study Abroad where I will be working on  clean water and solar energy projects in the rural areas of eastern Cuba.  I hope to serve as an ambassador for North Carolina A&T State University so that future students will exchange between the 2 universities.

This campaign is about giving free education to orphans with no access to education in and around the rural areas of Kumba (Camroon).

<p>Over a decade ago, before it became a prominent issue, I decided
that I had the time and resources to see what I might be able do. After two years of
collaboration with a highly respected illustrator and an award winning elementary school educator, we decided that the best way to target bullying was to begin with students in the 1st through 5th grades .
The result of our collaboration was a 24 page book, <b>“</b><b><i>BULLYING, Why would you
want to do that?</i></b><b>”</b></p>
<p>This beautifully illustrated and colorful booklet was inexpensive enough to give  one book to each elementary student in a school system. It was designed to be used as a teaching aid and as an educational device for teachers, and
then to be taken home to parents or guardians for reinforcement.</p><p><b>“</b><b><i>BULLYING</i></b><b>”</b> was a hit, and in 2007 the book was awarded the <i><b>Seal of Approval </b>of the <b>National Parenting Center. </b>My book<b> </b>garnered </i>the highest

money for new programs and it became economically unfeasible.</p>
<p>This brings me to why I am asking for your help. I want to provide, at little to no cost, millions of books to school systems around the

<p>Our first mission is to be as inclusive as possible: by embracing diversity in the Trans community, by focusing on what unites us versus what separates us and by bridging the gap between people based on age, sexual orientation, socio-economical background, religious affiliation, and more.</p>
<p>Our second mission is to empower our community. We want to leave the attendees wanting more in their lives; expecting excellence while rejecting mediocrity; pushing themselves to become the change they want in their local community; helping them realize that they have within them all the tools needed to succeed in every area of their lives; and encouraging them to focus on what unites the Trans community instead of what separates it. </p>
<p>The last reason is why we are expanding our reach and opening the door to our Trans sisters, specifically for one special night where our Trans (men and women) models will showcase the work of LGBT Fashion Designers in at our red carpet Trans exclusive fashion show on Thursday night at the Ramada Plaza.</p>What to expect:<p></p>

It’s about stories in science, scientific finding that change the world, thinking in science perspective, concept and the important of it. This book will open a brand new world for Lao reader to enter the world of science in a very easy and enjoyable way, which I’m sure it will help people to love in reading more, think more reasonably and motivate Lao kids to study in science.<br/>

<br/><h3>About Laos<br/>
</h3>
<ul><li>The only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, Laos sits between Thailand on the west and Vietnam on the east. In 1975, the Pathet Lao (Lao Nation) ended six centuries of monarchical rule when they triumphed in the revolution that established the Lao People's Democratic Republic. Since the revolution, isolation and economic deprivation have plagued the country, which is now one of the poorest and least developed in the world.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In Laos the majority of people still can’t read. Outside of the city there are only handful of teacher, school, room to study, study book are very limited; more over reading book outside school are even less, so kids are still far from enough access to education and reading. Even in the city, reading book that written in Laos are too little to almost non-existed, lack variety in term of contents and at a very small quantity.<br/>

The World We Are Living In: The book start with the world we are living in which will tell a story about how space and time was born, knowledge about solar system and earth (how they measure & weight the earth, volcano, how they discovered chemistry, the danger of radioactive and more).

The World In Skull: This chapter will be about brain science that effect human behavior, emotion and feeling.

Reader will now start to know the miracle of science and learn that we still know so little about this space & time we are living in.




And that’s all the stories in this book which we believe that it will open a brand new world for Lao kids and create new creativity, scientific thinking and motivate them so they may want to grow up and become a scientist.

poor families or being handicapped. <b>We believe there has to be a better way.</b></p>
<p>We are a newly founded charity organisation called
“Charity Butterflies” and our objective is to put a smile on every child's
face. Our team is keen to get started with our first project in Serbia - we
want to build the first Children Care Centre in a small town called Kikinda. It
will not only be a school but a place where children can visit to have fun, get
some food, study and a lot more. <b>We know the solution, and now is the time
to implement it</b>.</p>
<p>The land that the school is to be
built on has generously been given to us by the town. - the town help us here.
The school will be run by staff who will be paid by funds raised by local

<p>One of our team member’s sister has
got Down Syndrome - so it is important to us that this school will be inclusive
to all. Handicapped children will get the same opportunity as any other child.
In Kikinda around 450-500 children are handicapped, just a small part compare
with a total of 13000 in Serbia. The children care centre will be there to
support the parents of the children also. The building will include a kitchen,
an outside play area, a small library, a garden where children can grow their

<p></p></div>","Let's provide a safe education for
the children of Serbia today!
Every child has the right to a fun and engaging
education in a safe environment, regardless of their family or personal
circumstances.  Some children cannot access education due to being from
poor families or being handicapped. We believe there has to be a better way.
We are a newly founded charity organisation called
“Charity Butterflies” and our objective is to put a smile on every child's
face. Our team is keen to get started with our first project in Serbia - we
want to build the first Children Care Centre in a small town called Kikinda. It
will not only be a school but a place where children can visit to have fun, get
some food, study and a lot more. We know the solution, and now is the time
to implement it.
The land that the school is to be
built on has generously been given to us by the town. - the town help us here.
The school will be run by staff who will be paid by funds raised by local
fundraisers. All the items that are necessary to have in a school's inventory
are will be provided by this campaign. The town is dedicated to helping us help
itself. 

One of our team member’s sister has
got Down Syndrome - so it is important to us that this school will be inclusive
to all. Handicapped children will get the same opportunity as any other child.
In Kikinda around 450-500 children are handicapped, just a small part compare
with a total of 13000 in Serbia. The children care centre will be there to
support the parents of the children also. The building will include a kitchen,
an outside play area, a small library, a garden where children can grow their
own food and many other facilities that any school needs to educate children. It
will also be a place where children can stay after their parents are not with
them anymore.
Children of all learning ages will be
catered for. The education provided will range from early years curriculum
until each pupil is ready to progress to further education. Giving them this
wonderful opportunity will help to give them confidence and install in them the

of the budget of the Spring Camp, thus it has greatly contributed to the
success of the project. The Spring Camp was organized in Baja from 29th March
2015 to 5th April 2015. During this period 151, mainly underprivileged
highschool students took part in 40 hours of interactive lectures and small
group tuition. Following the lectures students could relax on several sport
programs (football, aerobic), lectures with alternative topics and playful team
building competitive games. These events formed the participating students into
one friendly group. According to the questionnaire filled by the students at
the end of the camp the voluntary teachers professional preparation reached
4,89 and the atmosphere of the extra activities reached 4,91 on a scale of 5.
The tuition, the participation on the programs, the accommodation and the three
meals per day was financed by the Studium Generale for every student, thus ensuring equal opportunities. During
the project 98% of the students got applied to a high level educational
institution and 76% started their high level education in the institution where
they applied on the first place. We would like to express our gratitude to all donors,
without them our camp could not have been organised.<b> </b></p><p><b>Thank you! </b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259526/tavaszi2_vxatk7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259543/tavaszi3_vtbg7k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259551/tavaszi4_yrrpex.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259559/tavaszi5_gtwxye.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259566/tavaszi6_ujwzxm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461259580/tavaszi1_jgtvl6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Please help us shape Hungary’s future, so that we can
give the chance to underprivileged high school students to participate in our
Spring Camp, which is aimed at preparing them to gain admission to higher
education!  </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our mission since
1970</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This organization of ours, Studium Generale is
a non-<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">profit foundation in Hungary, Central Europe, and involves 141 young
volunteers, who participate in the work of the organization without pay or
compensation. We prepare annually 2000 </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">underprivileged
high school students</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> for their </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Matura
exam</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> in the subjects of mathematics, history and economics.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tuition takes place
for graduate and high school students on Saturdays in the form of
three- or four-hour long seminars from October to May. The course is <b>also available online</b> to those who live
in the countryside and can’t afford to participate in the seminars in Budapest
due to financial and/or other limitations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Besides regular
tuition, we also offer <b>additional
opportunities</b> for students to enhance their knowledge and prepare for their
exam. For example, on 4-5 occasions annually students have the opportunity to
take a mock exam, and on the National Mock Exam Day mock exams are held in five
different venues throughout the country, so students all over Hungary have the
opportunity to test themselves in any given subject. One week prior to the
Matura exam, an intensive final preparatory event is organized spanning three
days to ensure students are fully prepared for their final exam.</p>
<p><b>How we prepare high school students in the most
efficient way - Spring Camp</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Besides the year-long seminars and the online
course, every spring and summer we <b>organize
a week-long preparatory camp free of charge</b>. <b>151</b> students are taught by <b>49</b>
teachers for <b>44</b> hours in <b>7</b> days, between 29th March and 5th
April in 2015, this is our Spring Camp. 2 young volunteers teach in all of the
24 groups of 5-7 students, which makes the courses more personal and customized to
certain needs of the kids. The preparatory course focuses on the repetition, the systematization of the core material and the practice and learning of the methodological knowledge. We also provide mock exams during the camp, so that
our students can learn, how to take exams. On the other side, <b>afternoon programs, evening activities,
team-building</b> <b>games</b> and <b>various</b> <b>sport activities</b> enhance the students’ mood and help them integrate and give
them a break from a long and tiring day of studying. Due to the small age
difference, students usually aren’t afraid to ask the tutors for help and tips
in any subject.</p>
<p><b>The students</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main beneficiaries of the organization’s
activity are <b>high school students</b>,
who will take their <b>Matura exam</b>,
find their future important and want to gain admission to <b>higher education</b> by performing during the finals better. Due to the
fact that the preparatory courses, camps and programs are free of charge, these
are accessible for underprivileged students helping them not lag behind their
more privileged peers. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The course welcomes everyone irrespective of financial or ethnical background.</p>

month of the main <b>marketing activities</b>
and of the <b>application</b> to the camp.

<br/><b>FAQ</b><div>If you have any questions, please contact us via email: info@studiumgenerale.hu<br/><div>
<p><b><i>What are the results of our work that can confirm our

<p>90% of those who participate in our camp
will gain admission to higher education. 80% of them can get into a certain
university or college, which they mark as first choice and more than 70% of
them will be able to study at the Corvinus University of Budapest. </p>
<p><b><i>Where can I get more information about the
organization?</i></b></p>
<p>About the renowned and prestigious
organization of Studium Generale you can get more information on the following
website: <a href=""http://www.studiumgenerale.hu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.studiumgenerale.hu</span></a>.</p>
<p><b><i>Why is such a preparatory course needed to pass the
Matura exam? </i></b></p>
<p>The preparatory course of Studium Generale
is needed, because there are huge differences between the high schools in
Hungary according to their financial background and the standards of education.
That is why students studying in poorer high schools that offer a lower
standard of education cannot acquire the knowledge or skills that are needed to
pass their Matura exam successfully to gain admission to higher education.  </p>
<p><b><i>Who are the young volunteers?</i></b></p>
<p>The whole organization involves 141
volunteers, who study at the Corvinus University of Budapest. They spend their
weekends and free time on teaching students without pay or compensation. They
are not qualified experts, but they have all achieved great results in the
field of mathematics, history and economics, so they all know what the target
group needs to do to pass the exams successfully. </p>
<p><b><i>How can students participate in our camp? </i></b></p>
<p>The students are ranked according to their
performance during the preparatory course, motivation and the results of their
mock exams taken during the year. From the 300-400 children 150 can participate
in the camp. </p>

</div></div>","UPDATEThe $1571 raised by the campaign covered one sixth
of the budget of the Spring Camp, thus it has greatly contributed to the
success of the project. The Spring Camp was organized in Baja from 29th March
2015 to 5th April 2015. During this period 151, mainly underprivileged
highschool students took part in 40 hours of interactive lectures and small
group tuition. Following the lectures students could relax on several sport
programs (football, aerobic), lectures with alternative topics and playful team
building competitive games. These events formed the participating students into
one friendly group. According to the questionnaire filled by the students at
the end of the camp the voluntary teachers professional preparation reached
4,89 and the atmosphere of the extra activities reached 4,91 on a scale of 5.
The tuition, the participation on the programs, the accommodation and the three
meals per day was financed by the Studium Generale for every student, thus ensuring equal opportunities. During
the project 98% of the students got applied to a high level educational
institution and 76% started their high level education in the institution where
they applied on the first place. We would like to express our gratitude to all donors,
without them our camp could not have been organised. Thank you! Short Summary
Please help us shape Hungary’s future, so that we can
give the chance to underprivileged high school students to participate in our
Spring Camp, which is aimed at preparing them to gain admission to higher
education!  

Our mission since
1970
This organization of ours, Studium Generale is
a non-profit foundation in Hungary, Central Europe, and involves 141 young
volunteers, who participate in the work of the organization without pay or
compensation. We prepare annually 2000 underprivileged
high school students for their Matura
exam in the subjects of mathematics, history and economics.
Tuition takes place
for graduate and high school students on Saturdays in the form of
three- or four-hour long seminars from October to May. The course is also available online to those who live
in the countryside and can’t afford to participate in the seminars in Budapest
due to financial and/or other limitations.
Besides regular
tuition, we also offer additional
opportunities for students to enhance their knowledge and prepare for their
exam. For example, on 4-5 occasions annually students have the opportunity to
take a mock exam, and on the National Mock Exam Day mock exams are held in five
different venues throughout the country, so students all over Hungary have the
opportunity to test themselves in any given subject. One week prior to the
Matura exam, an intensive final preparatory event is organized spanning three
days to ensure students are fully prepared for their final exam.
How we prepare high school students in the most
efficient way - Spring Camp
Besides the year-long seminars and the online
course, every spring and summer we organize
a week-long preparatory camp free of charge. 151 students are taught by 49
teachers for 44 hours in 7 days, between 29th March and 5th
April in 2015, this is our Spring Camp. 2 young volunteers teach in all of the
24 groups of 5-7 students, which makes the courses more personal and customized to
certain needs of the kids. The preparatory course focuses on the repetition, the systematization of the core material and the practice and learning of the methodological knowledge. We also provide mock exams during the camp, so that
our students can learn, how to take exams. On the other side, afternoon programs, evening activities,
team-building games and various sport activities enhance the students’ mood and help them integrate and give
them a break from a long and tiring day of studying. Due to the small age
difference, students usually aren’t afraid to ask the tutors for help and tips
in any subject.
The students
The main beneficiaries of the organization’s
activity are high school students,
who will take their Matura exam,
find their future important and want to gain admission to higher education by performing during the finals better. Due to the
fact that the preparatory courses, camps and programs are free of charge, these
are accessible for underprivileged students helping them not lag behind their
more privileged peers. 
The course welcomes everyone irrespective of financial or ethnical background.

The impact of our Spring Camp
Short-term goals



providing an intensive and free of charge
course for underprivileged students to prepare them for their Matura exam


helping the learning process of our
students, deepening their knowledge, giving them practical skills


giving a brighter future prospect and career guidance


social
integration and personality development by giving the chance to participate
in our camp



Long-term
goals



improving
the chances of underprivileged young adults to gain admission to higher
education by helping them apply for state scholarship during their studies and to graduate


increasing equality between the underprivileged and more privileged students


making the importance of the civil activity in the field of education
become popular


supporting
families from deprived areas directly, helping the kids reach higher income
levels and better living conditions in the future



Project plan
Our project requires a lot of time to plan
and to organize every detail of the camp, so that we can reach our main goals. The
main planning phase began in
December 2014 and the development of the details lasts approximately until the end of February 2015, when the
whole project plan, marketing plan and the most important
factors like accommodation and catering have to be organized. February is the
month of the main marketing activities
and of the application to the camp.
During March the program plan and
the educational materials have to be
elaborated and all learning and sports supplies have to be bought.  
The camp takes place between 29th March and 5th April.
Where our funds go
Organizing a camp,
where daily education takes place among a lot of different kinds of
team-building games and other programs, requires a high amount of capital. In
the following you can see the details of some of our main expenses.



Providing accommodation
for one person for an entire week costs 50$, which means that we need 10.000$
for 200 campers.


One day of meals
for a camper costs 5$, seven days of meals for 200 campers requires 7.000$.


To buy supplies
for educational purposes and sports activities 10$ are needed for one camper,
so we need 2.000$ for 200 ones.


Renting 24 classrooms
during the week-long camp costs 1000$



Why we need donation. Why we need your help.
Due to the fact, that our organization is based on a non-profit foundation, donations and
support through tenders play a vital role in sustaining our activity. The main
goal, tuition, requires financial
backing every year as the costs of hosting camps also require a large
amount of capital. Our goal is to maintain our current status, thus giving opportunity for high school students, particularly underprivileged ones, to
participate in our programs, events and courses completely free of charge, and
helping them prepare for their Matura exam and gain admission to their chosen
university.
What we can’t do without your
help


The Spring Camp, scheduled to
be held in March 2015, requires 20000$
to be organized, and we are currently 10000$
short of it. We ask you, if there is an opportunity, to support our
organization, so that we can help shape Hungary’s future furthermore.

In case we will not be able to raise enough money, we will have to decrease the number of the
participants, so we could give the chance to fewer kids to develop their
knowledge.
It could also happen that we will not be able to organize the camp, then we will
organize a smaller camp in summer by
using the money raised so far and raising more money furthermore. 

Other Ways You Can Help

you are not able to give us financial support, it does not mean, that you are
not of great help to us. Share our message on different kinds of platforms, social media networks like Facebook or

</div><div> <p>We like to spread awareness of the importance, quality and beauty of water. Water is a life force for all of us! <b>Life is only possible with water!</b></p>
<p> In these days more and more companies want to get the rights about water resources in their private hands to control society.</p>
<p> <b>We believe in freedom of society and we believe that more than enough clean water is a birthright of all beings and free for humankind!<br/></b></p>
<p><b></b>We support this belief in different educational projects, campaigns, events, waterceremonies and actions in our daily life.<br/></p>
<p>Also we show people how they can energize and clean water in their daily life with simple things and methods. We tell people the true power of water, well - meant in a natural way for the wealth of all. We give (coaching) seminars, lectures and workshop about the true nature of water and consciousness itself.  We teach children at school and kindergarten  about the essence of water.</p>
<p> We like to <b>create a film and write a book about the true nature of water</b>, so all people get the chance to <b>receive the knowledge of Dr.Masaru Emotos</b> findings and the new science of water. We like to create a better world for our children and future generations. <b>We like to heal mother earth and oceanlife with our daily work and this campaign.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Water is an information carrier for our thoughts, emotions and words 
and all other vibrations. This knowledge includes a great healing 
potential and the chance of peace in the world. <b>When we all are aware of the reality, that we 
can influence the quality of water with our own vibrational energy of thoughts, 
words and actions, than clean and clear water is managable for everybody
 and we ourself are the source for healthy water.</b></p>
<p>
After the death of Dr. Masaru Emoto in october 2014 we want to support his  lifework and the ""Message of Water.""<br/></p>
<p><b>When water is the universal mirror of everything, how do you like to think, talk and take action in your life?</b></p>We like to be successful with our campaign till the first days of April 2015, because we need enough time to book the flights and overnight accomodations and buy the technic equipment for audio and film recordings. <b>We can get the training of the Hado instructions at school of Masaru Emoto only in special days in May and need to book the training till the middle of april 2015 . So there is a special timeline for us to organize everything before the journey.</b>

<p><b>For a successful campaign we will inform as many people as we can, connect to other water advocates, defenders and lovers and create special water events in our local area.</b></p>

<h3><strong>Wasser ist Leben!</strong></h3>
<p><b>Unsere Erde ist ein Wasserplanet, ein blaues Juwel im Universum. Leben an Land ist nur möglich, wenn unsere Ozeane und unser Wasser sauber, gesund und in Balance sind. Ungefähr 70% von dem Sauerstoff unserer Atemluft wird von den Ozeanen produziert. Circa 70% unseres menschlichen Körpers ist aus Wasser. Die Oberfläche unseres Planeten Erde besteht zu 71% aus Wasser. Nach den Untersuchungen des Wasserforschers Dr. Masaru Emoto ist Wasser ein Informationsträger unserer Gedanken, Gefühle, Emotionen und Handlungen und somit vergleichbar mit einer überdimensional grossen Datenbank. Wesentlich ist, dass wir das Wasser in jedem Moment neu informieren können und somit die alten Daten überschreiben, neu gestalten und verändern können zum Beispiel mit LIEBE UND DANKBARKEIT !<br/>Unser Team aus liebevollen und engagierten WasserfürsprecherInnen der privaten Organisation „<a href=""http://www.wasserengel.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wasserengel</a>“, möchte Menschen in der ganzen Welt aufklären über die Botschaft des Wassers. Ausserdem möchten wir beitragen  einem allgemeinen Bewusstsein neue Türen zu eröffnen, um die Qualität von Wasser zum Wohle aller zu verbessern. <br/></b></p>
<p><b>In Japan möchten wir die Hado Instructor Schule des berühmten Wasserforschers Dr. Masaru Emoto besuchen, um dort eine Ausbildung zu absolvieren. Somit dürfen wir noch mehr lernen über das enorme Wissen von Dr. Masaru Emoto und erhalten die offizielle Erlaubnis Vorträge in der ganzen Welt zu halten, um das Wissen an andere Menschen weiter zu geben und mit ihnen zu teilen. <br/></b></p>

<h3>
<b>Wichtigkeit und Auswirkungen unserer Kampagne:</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Unser Ziel ist es, Bewusstheit im Umgang mit Wasser zu schaffen und die wahre Essenz, Kraft und Schönheit des Wassers für alle Menschen zugänglich zu machen. Wasser ist Lebenskraft für uns alle! <b>Leben ist nur mit Wasser möglich!</b> In der aktuellen Zeit möchten mehr und mehr Firmen die Rechte über Wasservorräte der Erde privatisieren, um somit die Gesellschaft und Menschen kontrollieren zu können. Wir sind der Überzeugung, dass sauberes Wasser ein Geburtsrecht von uns allen ist und möchten durch Bildung, Aufklärung Kampagnen und Wasserzeremonien dem aktuellen Bestreben verschiedener Firmen und Politiker Einhalt gebieten.</p>
<p> <b>Wir engagieren uns für mehr als genug sauberes, energetisches Wasser für alle Wesen dieses Planeten!</b><br/></p>
<p>Auch zeigen wir den Menschen, wie sie ihr Trinkwasser auf einfachste und preisgünstigste Weise reinigen und energetisieren können. Wir erklären Menschen, die wahre Natur und Essenz des Wassers in wohlgemeinter natürlicher Weise zum Wohle aller Wesen. Wir geben Workshops, Vorträge und Seminare in Kindergärten, Schulen und Bildungsveranstaltungen.<br/></p>
<p>Wir möchten<b> einen Film drehen und ein Buch schreiben über die wahre Natur des Wassers, dem Wissen von Dr. Masaru Emoto </b>und den Erlebnissen und Interviews unserer Reise. <b>Wir möchten unseren Anteil daran leisten, eine liebevolle, friedvolle und saubere Welt für uns, unsere Kinder und zukünftige Generationen zu erschaffen. Wir möchte Mutter Erde heilen und ebenso unsere Ozeane mit unseren täglichen Aktivitäten, dieser Kampagne und unserem Sein.</b><br/></p>
<p>Wasser ist ein Informationsträger für unsere Gedanken, Emotionen, Worte und Handlungen und allen anderen Vibrationen. Dieses Wissen und Verstehen enthält eine grosse Chance um Frieden in der Welt zu erschaffen und ein grosses Heilungspotential für uns alle.<br/></p>
<p><b>Wenn wir alle uns bewusst darüber sind, dass wir selbst die Qualität des Wassers durch unsere Gedanken , Gefühle, Worte und Handlungen beeinflussen können, dann ist sauberes und energetisiertes Wasser für jeden von uns reichlich vorhanden und wir selbst sind die Quelle sauberen, gesunden Wassers!<br/></b></p>
<p>Nach dem Tod von Dr. Masaru Emoto im Oktober 2014 möchten wir in seinem Namen die „Botschaft des Wassers“ weiterhin in der Welt verbreiten und mitteilen.<br/></p>
<p><b>Wenn Wasser der universelle Spiegel von allem ist, was möchtest Du dann denken, fühlen, sprechen? Wie möchtest Du handeln Dir selbst, anderen und allem gegenüber?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>Wir möchten erfolgreich sein mit unserer Kampagne und das Kampagneziel erreichen bis zum 12. April 2015</b>, da wir uns bis mitte April bei der Hado Instructor Schule anmelden müssen, um an der Ausbildung teilnehmen zu können. Zudem ist es wesentlich vorher die Flüge und Unterkünfte zu buchen und das technische Equipment für die Reise einzukaufen. <br/></p>
<p>Wir wünschen vor der Reise einige Tage Zeit, um alles entsprechend organisieren und planen zu können. <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Vielen Dank!</b></p>
<p><b>Für eine erfolgreiche Kampagne werden wir so viele Leute wie möglich informieren und motivieren für unsere Ziele. Wir verbinden uns mit anderen Wasserfreunden und Wasserfürsprecher und veranstalten spezielle Events und Einladungen über Wasser in unserer unmittelbaren Umgebung.</b><br/></p>

    to time the crowdfunding to coincide with the publicity campaign for

of Healing</i></b></p>
<p>Hello
everyone!  My name is Zach; I am raising
money to continue my pursuit of becoming a certified healer.  I have spent my life learning the healing arts
and am ready to take on the certification process. For me the first step in
this process would be to learn to teach yoga; to study ways to strengthen and
balance, harmonizing these things together to help heal the body. I intend to continue
beyond this in time and learn Massage therapy as well, including Reiki and
other healing modalities.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate
that my family and friends have been so supportive of my pursuit of the healing
arts, and I have studied yoga since I was young.  I have dedicated myself to not only the
improvement of my own practice, but also helping grow the practices of others.
I am at a place in my life where I am ready to dedicate myself further, and
become an active healing being in my community.</p>
<p>Living in the
fast-paced, fiercely competitive world of today, it isn’t always easy to follow
the path your heart is taking you. 
Without proper certification, it is almost impossible to get a foothold
in a yoga practice career. My intentions are set to achieve my 200 hour yoga
teacher training certification, and while I have the will to make it happen,
the events of life make it difficult to afford. Becoming certified is a
critical step in any healer’s or healing teacher’s path, and is something I
know I am ready for. </p>
<p><i>My goal is to raise $2200to
help fulfill my dream, and continue on my heartfelt path of yogic practice and
the spread of the healing arts.</i></p>
<p><b>That’s why </b><b><i>you</i> are so important – every donation goes
toward my pursuit of healing, and so every donation becomes a healing force in

of Healing
Hello
everyone!  My name is Zach; I am raising
money to continue my pursuit of becoming a certified healer.  I have spent my life learning the healing arts
and am ready to take on the certification process. For me the first step in
this process would be to learn to teach yoga; to study ways to strengthen and
balance, harmonizing these things together to help heal the body. I intend to continue
beyond this in time and learn Massage therapy as well, including Reiki and
other healing modalities.
I have been fortunate
that my family and friends have been so supportive of my pursuit of the healing
arts, and I have studied yoga since I was young.  I have dedicated myself to not only the
improvement of my own practice, but also helping grow the practices of others.
I am at a place in my life where I am ready to dedicate myself further, and
become an active healing being in my community.
Living in the
fast-paced, fiercely competitive world of today, it isn’t always easy to follow
the path your heart is taking you. 
Without proper certification, it is almost impossible to get a foothold
in a yoga practice career. My intentions are set to achieve my 200 hour yoga
teacher training certification, and while I have the will to make it happen,
the events of life make it difficult to afford. Becoming certified is a
critical step in any healer’s or healing teacher’s path, and is something I
know I am ready for. 
My goal is to raise $2200to
help fulfill my dream, and continue on my heartfelt path of yogic practice and
the spread of the healing arts.
That’s why you are so important – every donation goes
toward my pursuit of healing, and so every donation becomes a healing force in
this world. 
Even
just to have the reach to have you read these words, I am grateful.
It
is not about the amount! It is about community, which is what is truly vital to
me.
This being said, as tokens of gratitude to
my contributors, I have a few rewards to be aware of:
-25-
A signed original art print – some of my healing-inspired expression
-50-
A human nutrition consultation service + the art print!
-100-
A human design chart reading – much like an astrology reading but with
greater depth, + the art print!
-500-

<br/> <p>My name is Danielle Damask. I am 20 years old and am aspiring to be a physician in the near future who educates and assists others so that they can take full advantage of the truly amazing gift we were given, life. As for now, I am taking advantage of every opportunity that I can so that I can better myself and can better the world around me. I am presently attending the University of Wisconsin - Parkside where I am double majoring in Biology and Applied Health Science. I work at Brookside Care Center in Kenosha County, WI as a Certified Nursing Assistant assisting the elderly in every way I possibly can to make sure they are living comfortably and blissfully. Also, I am in the Army National Guard, working as a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, &amp; Nuclear (CBRN) Specialist, trained to protect our nation if ever need be.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Campaign:<br/>
</h3>I am trying to raise $3,000 so that I can attend a medical mission trip to Ometepe island located in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere. In Nicaragua I will be working from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM  alongside Nicaraguan and U.S.
physicians and physically observing how medicine is practiced in third world
countries without the hi-tech equipment that we are accustomed to using in the
United States. In addition, alongside physicians I will be allowed to assist in some of the procedures. In addition to being able to learn and assist, my fellow peers and I will be bringing about 70 lbs of medication each as a part of our luggage which will then be distributed by local doctors in the rural clinics.<br/><br/>Patients are not expected to pay with money, instead each patient is asked to bring used batteries as a form of payment for each free appointment and any medication they may need. Doing so also helps us eliminate some one the toxic waste in Nicaragua since there are no recycling facilities there. If they do not have batteries we take in plastic garbage as a form of payment. <br/><br/>Attending this trip would
be an astonishing, once in lifetime experience for me and would allow me to make a difference in other people's lives who are less fortunate and need it. The government
presence in this rural area is very limited so the funding for this project is
done solely by payments of the students that participate in the project, or myself, which is why
I want to diligently work to earn/raise the money for the mission trip. <br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Funding Breakdown:<br/>
</h3> <p>In order to attend the medical mission trip to Nicaragua I need to raise 3,000. This money will cover the fees of me getting to the island and in addition some of the money is used to pay for the medication and the doctors in the clinics so that we can successfully treat the patients in Nicaragua. <br/></p>

</div></div>","A Little Bit About Myself:

                                     
 My name is Danielle Damask. I am 20 years old and am aspiring to be a physician in the near future who educates and assists others so that they can take full advantage of the truly amazing gift we were given, life. As for now, I am taking advantage of every opportunity that I can so that I can better myself and can better the world around me. I am presently attending the University of Wisconsin - Parkside where I am double majoring in Biology and Applied Health Science. I work at Brookside Care Center in Kenosha County, WI as a Certified Nursing Assistant assisting the elderly in every way I possibly can to make sure they are living comfortably and blissfully. Also, I am in the Army National Guard, working as a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, & Nuclear (CBRN) Specialist, trained to protect our nation if ever need be.

My Campaign:
I am trying to raise $3,000 so that I can attend a medical mission trip to Ometepe island located in Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere. In Nicaragua I will be working from 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM  alongside Nicaraguan and U.S.
physicians and physically observing how medicine is practiced in third world
countries without the hi-tech equipment that we are accustomed to using in the
United States. In addition, alongside physicians I will be allowed to assist in some of the procedures. In addition to being able to learn and assist, my fellow peers and I will be bringing about 70 lbs of medication each as a part of our luggage which will then be distributed by local doctors in the rural clinics.Patients are not expected to pay with money, instead each patient is asked to bring used batteries as a form of payment for each free appointment and any medication they may need. Doing so also helps us eliminate some one the toxic waste in Nicaragua since there are no recycling facilities there. If they do not have batteries we take in plastic garbage as a form of payment. Attending this trip would
be an astonishing, once in lifetime experience for me and would allow me to make a difference in other people's lives who are less fortunate and need it. The government
presence in this rural area is very limited so the funding for this project is
done solely by payments of the students that participate in the project, or myself, which is why
I want to diligently work to earn/raise the money for the mission trip.    The Funding Breakdown:
 In order to attend the medical mission trip to Nicaragua I need to raise 3,000. This money will cover the fees of me getting to the island and in addition some of the money is used to pay for the medication and the doctors in the clinics so that we can successfully treat the patients in Nicaragua. 
  Perks:
                       For every $5.00 donated your name will be entered in a raffle for a trip (if you donate more than $5.00 your name will be entered more than once).
The raffle prizes are as follows:
1st Prize: Bahama's Vacation for 2 + $100.002nd Prize: Las Vegas Vacation for 2 + $75.003rd Prize: $50.00The drawing for this raffle will be held on March 1, 2015. Winner does not need to be present to be eligible to win.

<p><span><b>Who We Are</b></span></p>
<br/><p>We are Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM): an internationally renowned network of students and researchers that are working tirelessly to make access to essential, life-saving medicines a reality for everyone across the world. In the last 2 years, our students have run campaigns at our universities, met with government ministries and have advised on parliamentary select committees, as well as and spoken at international institutions such as the World Health Organisation, run the world's first Access to Medicines Week and launched the UK’s first <a href=""http://globalhealthgrades.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Health League Table</a>. Almost all of our work is driven by committed students, on a completely voluntary, non-profit basis. </p>
<br/><br/><p><b>Why is this important? </b></p>
<p>Today, a third of the world lacks access to affordable medicines. These are the drugs needed to treat severely disabling, or even life-threatening diseases. These are the drugs that don’t exist because they’re not profitable enough to interest the pharmaceutical industry. These are drugs that every health system needs. These are drugs that every human being has a right to. As students, we work to make sure that our universities, who discover many of these drugs, do not neglect the diseases of the poor. Access to medicines should never be sacrificed for financial gain!</p>
<br/><br/><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This April, we are holding a conference in London for 200 students from all over Europe. Over one weekend, we will educate, inspire, and give a voice to a rising network. We will connect them with each other and with experts in the field. We will give them the tools to reach out for social justice and have a real impact on the research and development of life-saving medicines.</p>
<br/><p>The London Conference will be the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA6gk-bvSV0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inspirational backbone</a> to a year of campaigning throughout Europe. In the past year, we have had unprecedented success - but we want to continue striving towards a better world. With your support we can reach that together.</p>
<br/><p>Specifically, we have three core aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide students with knowledge, confidence and skills necessary to speak to faculty members, politicians and members of the public to discuss the difficult topic of universal access to medicine. </p></li>
<li><p>Inspire and empower students to embody the change they wish to see in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring together 200 students from over 20 countries to foster a community built on the principles of respect, equality, and justice.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><p>To run the conference of our dreams, we estimate a budget of approximately £15,000. This includes:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>Accommodation and food for two hundred students  </p></li>
<li><p>Means to invite fifteen ground breaking speakers and expert workshop facilitators </p></li>
<li><p>Venue rental</p></li>
<li><p>Conference materials</p></li>
<li><p>Publicity </p></li>
<li><p>Travel funding for conference disadvantaged participants</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><br/><p>These are expected costs for an international student conference, but there are a couple of unique aspects about it:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>We believe that personal finances should never be a barrier to participation. So, uniquely for a conference, we want to provide travel funding for students that needs it. </p></li>
<li><p>This conference is being run, and organised, by a team of student volunteers, all while studying for their degrees. For us, this is an incredible learning opportunity, and a chance to make a lasting impact on the lives of our student friends.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use your funding to pay for items that have otherwise been difficult to raise money for, in particular, focussing on those students in greatest financial need. If we manage to satisfy that, we will use the remaining money to fund other areas of the budget.</p>
<br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/><p>This year, we plan on breaking the traditional mould of didactic learning. We are creating a flexible, engaging, and member driven approach to the conference, that will deliver maximum participation and ensure sparks are flying from day one.</p>
<br/><p>Our conferences make sure that we have a large, skilled, and motivated volunteer base necessary to maintain activism across Europe. We make considerable efforts to connect our members through virtual means, but nothing can replace the power of an in-person meeting. All of our projects are given momentum through the mutual exchange of ideas, materials, strategies, and feelings.</p>
<br/><p>Perhaps the greatest impact it will have however, is on the lives of the students themselves. We believe that the best way to create change in our society is to focus on the leaders of tomorrow. UAEM, its principles, its activities, and its community occupy a special place in the heart of our members. By acting now to foster faith in the importance of social justice, we can change institutions from the bottom-up.</p>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/><p>Organising such a large conference in one of the busiest cities in the world with a student team of volunteers will not be easy. With patience and dedication, we are confident we will succeed. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge is making sure we get enough funds to make sure the conference manages to go ahead. Our fundraising team is currently working hard behind the scenes to make this a reality. Their strategy has included: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contacting every major university in London</p></li>
<li><p>Contacting ethical food providers for donations</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting numerous fundraising applications to foundations and trusts</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a 'name your own price' ticketing system that will allow members to subsidise each other.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our logistics team, on the other hand, are exploring options to make the conference as affordable as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Housing students in local sports halls, and in peoples' homes.</p></li>
<li><p>Cooking as much of the food as possible ourselves</p></li>
<li><p>Asking speakers to cover as much of their own costs as possible</p></li>

This is an initiative that was initiated and is run by a student from the same Lake Victoria region who is today is in school,( EARTH University, Costa Rica)because there are people who believed in him and helped him access opportunities.Being the first person to get into college from his community, David is  a role model to many of students from his community who cannot be in school because of the high cost of education which their parents who live in extreme poverty conditions cannot afford. He started this initiative as a call to help the students he had motivated to when he won his full scholarship to study abroad be able to go to school. Today, the number keeps on rising.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why the Fundraising?</h3>
Majimbo is a small village along the shore of the Lake Victoria where fishing and small scale farming are the main economic activities. Most of the families live on less than $1 a day. It is a community where education is not a priority because education has to be paid for in Kenya. Beyond education, Majimbo faces a major threat in terms of HIV/AIDS and STIs which according to the recent research stands at 56%, a sad reality that does not only influence the kind of life here but also the future of the community. The following are the major reasons for the fundraising;</div><div>
<ol><li><b>Scholarships</b></li></ol>
<div>Majimbo had its first ever college student last year when David won a scholarship to study in Costa Rica at EARTH University under the full support of the MasterCard Foundation. This was a great motivation to many school going students and for the first time, 20 students from this community joined high school. High school education in Kenya is not free, parents pay up to $2000 annually in public schools. In Majimbo however, the parents cannot at times cannot afford meals for their families - education will definately get the least priority. School dropouts has always been a culture even before graduating from primary school. Boys drop out from as early as 11 to start taking part in the family upkeep while the girls get pregnant even as young as 13. We really need your help to make this difference.</div>
<div>We need your support to provide comprehensive scholarships to 50 chiildren who need at least $600 annually to be able to stay in school. This is meant to cover their accommodation, food, tuition, books and uniform.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""> 2.  </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sanitary Pads</b>
</div>
<div>Most of the girl child dropouts in Majimbo are directly related the fact that they do cannot access sanitary pads and the appropriate sanitary and hygiene awareness. Although boys are allowed to study and work, culturally, girls cannot do anything and when difficult time come, they opt to sell their bodies to the man around who can in exchange give them some little money to help them buy stuff like sanitary pads because if not they would not be able to attend school. Because of this, they end up getting pregnant in their teens and if not end up being HIV/AIDS positive. Girls are the future of the world. They also need to be educated.</div>
<div>We hope to provide all our students with regular sanitary pads to help them stay in school</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">  3.  </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Solar Lamps</b>
</div>
<p>Imagine living in a world without electricity. Where you cannot only have to watch television or use your telephone but also have to take dinner before darkness sets and go without doing your homework. This is the situation in Majimbo. Students cannot do their assignments because there is no light to do so, they cannot study like the rest. If they happen to have kerosene lanterns, they cannot afford the kerosene regularly.</p>
<p>We want to provide hope for the students by giving them an opportunity to also study and do homework like the rest<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why is Your Contribution Important?</h3>
<p>The community we are working to change is one that has had a very negative school enrollment and very huge numbers of dropouts. In fact, only one has managed to get into the university (David, the founder EducationHOPE). Among the factors, the main one is the poverty levels that are so high in this community, literally every household lives on less than $1 every day. So many students cannot go to school because their families cannot afford to pay their school fees, a necessity since education has to be paid for by students in Kenyan high schools.</p>
<p>Imagine the impact you are creating not only for the students but for their families and also their communities. Educating one child can change the world, but you are going beyond this with your support to create a motivation, show a possibility and beyond all this, building a future for someone whom without you cannot make it.</p>
<p>With your support, these students will forget the trouble and worry of being sent out of school and instead peacefully stay in school just like their fellow students.</p>
<b>Help Make the difference</b><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Have Done</h3>Begun five months ago, EducationHOPE has already provided scholarships to 8 boys 6 girls in three different schools fro the support of people like. We can never be any happier than seeing our students full of smiles<p></p>

</div><div> <p>The $20000 target is meant to help provide scholarships for the first half of the next academic year to all our students, provide sanitary pads and also a single LuminAID solar lamps to the families of each student. The collected funds are sent directly to the bank accounts of the various schools. The rest will be used to purchase the lamps from LuminAID and sanitary pads to the students.</p>

Majimbo had its first ever college student last year when David won a scholarship to study in Costa Rica at EARTH University under the full support of the MasterCard Foundation. This was a great motivation to many school going students and for the first time, 20 students from this community joined high school. High school education in Kenya is not free, parents pay up to $2000 annually in public schools. In Majimbo however, the parents cannot at times cannot afford meals for their families - education will definately get the least priority. School dropouts has always been a culture even before graduating from primary school. Boys drop out from as early as 11 to start taking part in the family upkeep while the girls get pregnant even as young as 13. We really need your help to make this difference.
We need your support to provide comprehensive scholarships to 50 chiildren who need at least $600 annually to be able to stay in school. This is meant to cover their accommodation, food, tuition, books and uniform.

 2.  Sanitary Pads

Most of the girl child dropouts in Majimbo are directly related the fact that they do cannot access sanitary pads and the appropriate sanitary and hygiene awareness. Although boys are allowed to study and work, culturally, girls cannot do anything and when difficult time come, they opt to sell their bodies to the man around who can in exchange give them some little money to help them buy stuff like sanitary pads because if not they would not be able to attend school. Because of this, they end up getting pregnant in their teens and if not end up being HIV/AIDS positive. Girls are the future of the world. They also need to be educated.
We hope to provide all our students with regular sanitary pads to help them stay in school

  3.  Solar Lamps

Imagine living in a world without electricity. Where you cannot only have to watch television or use your telephone but also have to take dinner before darkness sets and go without doing your homework. This is the situation in Majimbo. Students cannot do their assignments because there is no light to do so, they cannot study like the rest. If they happen to have kerosene lanterns, they cannot afford the kerosene regularly.
We want to provide hope for the students by giving them an opportunity to also study and do homework like the rest


Why is Your Contribution Important?
The community we are working to change is one that has had a very negative school enrollment and very huge numbers of dropouts. In fact, only one has managed to get into the university (David, the founder EducationHOPE). Among the factors, the main one is the poverty levels that are so high in this community, literally every household lives on less than $1 every day. So many students cannot go to school because their families cannot afford to pay their school fees, a necessity since education has to be paid for by students in Kenyan high schools.
Imagine the impact you are creating not only for the students but for their families and also their communities. Educating one child can change the world, but you are going beyond this with your support to create a motivation, show a possibility and beyond all this, building a future for someone whom without you cannot make it.
With your support, these students will forget the trouble and worry of being sent out of school and instead peacefully stay in school just like their fellow students.
Help Make the difference

What We Have DoneBegun five months ago, EducationHOPE has already provided scholarships to 8 boys 6 girls in three different schools fro the support of people like. We can never be any happier than seeing our students full of smiles

What You Will Support
 The $20000 target is meant to help provide scholarships for the first half of the next academic year to all our students, provide sanitary pads and also a single LuminAID solar lamps to the families of each student. The collected funds are sent directly to the bank accounts of the various schools. The rest will be used to purchase the lamps from LuminAID and sanitary pads to the students.
We are in the process of forming an NGO to keep supporting more. If you wish to be part of us, please check out our perks and find our interesting offers. We are so grateful for your support. 
Every dollar raised will go directly towards those in need in the focus areas stated above.

<p>In Cambodia, children in rural villages face an uphill battle against poverty and limited access to education when compared to children in urban areas.  Many impoverished children in rural Cambodia don’t have access to money to buy uniforms and their school supplies in order to attend primary school.   The Ponheary Ly Foundation (PLF) provides children who would not otherwise be attending school with these essentials.  Once all the children from a village are present at their school and properly equipped, the PLF supports the school sufficiently to provide a quality of education that is equal to that which is accessible in the urban communities.</p>
<p>Mohala Hou Foundation (MHF) is a non-profit organization that presents Aloha Music Camp (AMC) and other educational and cultural programs to foster understanding and perpetuation of Hawaiian culture.  Through AMC, the Beamer 'ohana and other Hawaiian Kumu (teachers) have provided teaching and cultural context in ukulele, guitar hula, olelo (language), oli (chant), and traditional Hawaiian crafts to thousands of participants of all ages over the years.  The expertise of MHF in developing and presenting cultural enrichment programs ensures the Cambodian children will receive the highest quality of instruction that is responsive to their needs and interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide Cambodian kids with a way to enrich their lives and communities through the power of music and dance. Children will learn to better understand the essential connection of music and dance in other cultures, then begin to assimilate these ideas and instruments into their own culture. To begin this process, our instructors will teach the children Cambodian songs in their own language. By learning to play their own songs on their own instruments, then taking these instruments home to their villages, the warmth, joy and “aloha” of music will begin to spread and uplift the lives and hearts of their extended families. </p>
<p>It's important to realize that many communities in Cambodia are without any modern conveniences and are often comprised of downtrodden and disadvantaged people. Your gift of education and music will make a big difference in the happiness and fulfillment of the lives of these Cambodian families.</p>
<p>In addition to the instruction and the educational materials we will deliver to the children, the  educational experience we provide will foster cross-cultural understanding and deeper bonds between our countries, teachers and students.</p>

<p>I have just put down a deposit to lease an amazing studio space in Yarmouth, Maine (see above photo)! Already I have invested in legal protections for JoyRead, an application for an LLC, and I've spent thousands of dollars on supplies and toys to use during class.</p>
<p>I am now faced with a major challenge: I need investors who believe in the JoyRead vision so I can make JoyRead a reality first in Maine and then across the USA.</p>
<p>With your support, I will be able to cover launching costs, including: creating and buying printed materials, securing music licensing for the programs, buying ads to market the program, paying for initial rent and utilities, making bright signage for the location, purchasing and creating JoyRead take-homes for registered participants, and purchasing and installing appropriate toddler-safe furniture, fixtures, equipment and supplies to make a marvelous JoyRead Studio.</p>

My dream is to have JoyRead studios in every state across the USA!...but first we have to start with one. The first-ever JoyRead studio will be located where I live in Southern Maine, near the beautiful city of Portland. Here is a photo of me in front of the space I intend to lease:


With $20,000 as the goal, all profits from your purchase of one or more of the ""Perks"" listed here will go into JoyRead start-up costs, getting the word out, building out and opening the first JoyRead studio in America. With your support, families with young children will be able to begin a literacy revolution in January 2017!

My goal is to open the first class registration after Thanksgiving, and to offer classes from then onwards. With your help, parents will enter a welcoming, accessible, toddler-friendly space where they will stay to play, and where they will participate in exciting, lively letter and whimsical wordplay classes.
I have just put down a deposit to lease an amazing studio space in Yarmouth, Maine (see above photo)! Already I have invested in legal protections for JoyRead, an application for an LLC, and I've spent thousands of dollars on supplies and toys to use during class.
I am now faced with a major challenge: I need investors who believe in the JoyRead vision so I can make JoyRead a reality first in Maine and then across the USA.
With your support, I will be able to cover launching costs, including: creating and buying printed materials, securing music licensing for the programs, buying ads to market the program, paying for initial rent and utilities, making bright signage for the location, purchasing and creating JoyRead take-homes for registered participants, and purchasing and installing appropriate toddler-safe furniture, fixtures, equipment and supplies to make a marvelous JoyRead Studio.

<p>Animar a que los niños (as) y jóvenes presenten sus propias perspectivas sobre los efectos de la migración en sus vidas y la comunidad.

Esta iniciativa también pretende facilitar  la expresión directa de la mirada de los y los migrantes a través de un medio abierto y artístico: las “antiguas” cámaras del rollo.Quienes facilitan en este proyecto están donando sus sábados para hacer posible este proyecto.

<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In addition to the opportunity for children to participate in  a creative art project, and to learn photography skills; this project also carries a much larger impact. The goal of this project includes the objective to strengthen the relationship with these communities, and to support and encourage the involvement of children and youth in other Voces programming or in pursuing their dreams and desires educationally, professionally, and personally. This may include learning how to use computers, further pursuing photography, as well as developing a strong, central, and autonomous political organization in their community. <br/>Upon completion of the photography project, we will conduct a public presentation of the Museo Migrante (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM),"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM),</a> which serves as a platform for them to share their work, discuss, and take the lead in expressing themselves and their experiences through their photography and other artistic mediums. <br/><br/></p>
<h3><span><b>¿Cuál es el impacto?</b></span></h3>
<p>Además de la oportunidad para que los niños participen en un proyecto de arte creativo, y para aprender habilidades de fotografía; este proyecto también conlleva un impacto mucho más grande. Este proyecto incluye fortalecer la relación con estas comunidades, para apoyar y fomentar la participación de niñas (os) y jóvenes en la búsqueda de sus sueños y deseos desde su propio punto de vista. Esto incluye aprender a usar las computadoras (además del dominio de la fotografía); así como el desarrollo de una organización política fuerte, central y autónoma en y desde la comunidad.  Al término del proyecto, juntos y juntas vamos a realizar una presentación pública de los trabajos en el Museo Migrante (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM</a>), que sirve como una plataforma para que las niñas, niños y jóvenes indígenas de Chiapas puedan compartir su trabajo, discutir y tomar la iniciativa para expresar sus experiencias a través de la fotografía y otros medios artísticos como el teatro, el cine y la música.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks and challenges of this project are very limited as it has been strategically planned out with much thought, conversation, and detail being considered. The main risk to a project in which we give children and youth film cameras, is that something may happen to the camera, or, due to the sensitive nature of film photography pictures will not turn out due to insufficient light, movement, film exposure, etc. Finally, the risk that children or youth with cameras will not return the cameras. <br/>We have minimized these risks thorough clear instructions about film camera use and an emphasis on the importance of following the tips and instructions they've learned. These risks are also minimized by delegating some of the older youth to oversee the children's use of cameras and to be available to help and support hem. We have also included incentives to returning with the cameras and being careful with the use. For example, in the third and final workshop with the children we will have a celebration and party following the discussion and workshop and will sleep in the community. </p>

This may include learning how to use computers, further pursuing photography, as well as developing a strong, central, and autonomous political organization in their community. Upon completion of the photography project, we will conduct a public presentation of the Museo Migrante (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM), which serves as a platform for them to share their work, discuss, and take the lead in expressing themselves and their experiences through their photography and other artistic mediums. 
¿Cuál es el impacto?
Además de la oportunidad para que los niños participen en un proyecto de arte creativo, y para aprender habilidades de fotografía; este proyecto también conlleva un impacto mucho más grande. Este proyecto incluye fortalecer la relación con estas comunidades, para apoyar y fomentar la participación de niñas (os) y jóvenes en la búsqueda de sus sueños y deseos desde su propio punto de vista. Esto incluye aprender a usar las computadoras (además del dominio de la fotografía); así como el desarrollo de una organización política fuerte, central y autónoma en y desde la comunidad.  Al término del proyecto, juntos y juntas vamos a realizar una presentación pública de los trabajos en el Museo Migrante (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YBJCLkOtvM), que sirve como una plataforma para que las niñas, niños y jóvenes indígenas de Chiapas puedan compartir su trabajo, discutir y tomar la iniciativa para expresar sus experiencias a través de la fotografía y otros medios artísticos como el teatro, el cine y la música.   Risks & Challenges The risks and challenges of this project are very limited as it has been strategically planned out with much thought, conversation, and detail being considered. The main risk to a project in which we give children and youth film cameras, is that something may happen to the camera, or, due to the sensitive nature of film photography pictures will not turn out due to insufficient light, movement, film exposure, etc. Finally, the risk that children or youth with cameras will not return the cameras. We have minimized these risks thorough clear instructions about film camera use and an emphasis on the importance of following the tips and instructions they've learned. These risks are also minimized by delegating some of the older youth to oversee the children's use of cameras and to be available to help and support hem. We have also included incentives to returning with the cameras and being careful with the use. For example, in the third and final workshop with the children we will have a celebration and party following the discussion and workshop and will sleep in the community.

<p>I first heard of YWAM (Youth with a Mission) in the winter
of 2012 from my pastor.  At YWAM they
train young people to be disciples of Jesus and then send them out to spread
the Gospel to all the nations.  I was at
a crossroad in my life and was tired of living life on my own terms. I knew God
had the master plan for my life. When I heard about YWAM, I knew I was supposed
to do a DTS (Discipleship Training School). This experience helped me to
understand who God is and who I am. I completed my discipleship training school
in the spring of 2013 in Maui, Hawaii. 
This year YWAM Maui is beginning their very first school of worship;
“The Well” which is an in depth journey of seeking the heart of God. I desire
to go deeper into the heart of God and to see His glory manifested in my life.
I have been feeling drawn to return to Maui for this secondary school.  </p>
<p>The school begins on January 2nd 2016. Financially
the entire trip will cost between $9,000 and $10,000. The round trip flight to
Maui is around $1,200. The lecture portion of the school is $3850, which
includes meals, school materials, transportation, and housing. Finally the
outreach portion is estimated to cost between $3,800 and $4,200. I will be
investing my own savings, but I need your help! I have some fun and exciting
things to give to you when you donate as well. 
It may seem like a lot of money and not a lot of time, but I know that
all things are possible with God.</p>
<p> YWAM has been
reaching people all over the world with the Gospel of Jesus since 1960. It is one
of the world’s largest mission’s organizations today. As a contributor you will
be helping to change the world by supporting the Great Commission. Through the
school of worship we will be able to reach people for Christ as praise and
worship breaks through spiritual walls. Worship also moves the heart of God and
connects us with what God is doing.  By
supporting me in this trip, I believe you will be helping to release the power
of God in my life and the lives of the people in my area of influence. </p>
<p>I have always dreamed of being a worship leader. I want to
be able to use the gifts and talents God has given me to worship Him.  I know that worship is so much more than just
the songs we sing. My heart is to see people set free and
come to a place of truly knowing Jesus. The Well School of Worship will help me
to learn different topics of worship such as: Intimacy &amp; Passion for Jesus,
Ministering to The Lord, Biblical Basis for Worship, Worship With The Word
&amp; Intercession, Personal Freedom, Identity &amp; Character of The
Worshiper, Songwriting &amp; Creativity, Foundation of Music Theory, Music Skills
Development &amp; Worship Team Dynamics, Worship &amp; Prayer in Revival &amp;
Reformation, The Musicianary – Worship in missions today; and much more.</p>
<p>Will you join with me? You can help in several ways. You can
contribute financially and through prayer. You can also help to connect me with someone who might
have the desire to support missionaries. Another way to help is by sharing this
campaign with your friends, family and co-workers. Share this on Twitter,
Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and any other social media site you have. This goal
can be easily reached. I have a large amount to raise, and a little bit of time;
so gifts of $100.00, $500.00 and even $1,000.00 will be needed to see this
vision come to pass. So please help by spreading the word!</p>
<p>Your gift will help many experience the closeness we were

calling God has on my life.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With 1 in 5 students having some form of learning difficulty, the demand for more assistive technology both in the classroom and at home is very real. We estimate that there are 700 million people in the world with dyslexia at this very moment. Imagine if we could help them all!</p>
<p>We want to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students with dyslexia do not feel overwhelmed in class and frustrated at home</li>
<li>Parents of children with learning difficulties can now help their kids in a hands on manner</li>
<li>Teachers and psychologists can use a technology tool on a 'one-to-one' and 'one-to-many' basis to tailor-make their teaching to the needs of the particular child</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's not going to be easy and we know that this issue could be very easily ignored by many since ""special education"" is not as exciting as many other business areas.

<p>Our challenge is going to be entering several markets at the same time, and finding both investors and business partners to help us understand the needs of the local educational scene, but we are confident that there is enough awareness of this great social need.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I am a professor of ancient history and teach at an university. My satisfying job gives me the opportunity to be immersed in the incredible events of the ancient periods of humanity. I am surprised at <strong>how many amazing discoveries modern researchers, including us, discover every day.</strong><br/>Of course, writing reports and describing all these discoveries in scientific circles, we use a boring scientific style, which many readers do not reach to the middle of the reading. The <strong>ancient events are stunning and very rich in material life is desire to be known</strong>.</p>
<h3>Do you realize what kind of adventure you can discover in the world by looking into the depth of the ages?!</h3>

<p>Let us open ourselves to the history of our ancestors in a fascinating style of fantasy. We will go along with the heroes of the ancient world on the roads and together we will be saved from the raging rivers and seek refuge in the land hidden under dark clouds. Venturing all the way with them we will discover plenty of excitement in our history, and incredible stories about the loss of <strong>millions of peoples from the Tribes of Israel.</strong></p>

<p>We are ""reviving"" several of the ancient heroic Tribes of the distant past for you. You know one of them<strong> was able to get to America and incredible success followed, while another struck it lucky to the diamond industry in South Africa via Holland</strong>, and therefore we invite you this incredible journey into the past.<br/><i><strong>I hope you are ready to join us in this adventure</strong></i>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479317804/t6rtlpgembllkvtgdbwv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This book series will give you as well, <strong>the absolute knowledge of the people </strong>who once lived in Israel, but were forced to leave the Land, and this series will perhaps be a reflection of the fate of many of today's refugees; those whose roots come from the beloved ancient exiles.</p>
<p>.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479318015/ohqnurm2du9lxhmlduky.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>AND!!! </strong>As you are well aware this is historical, however, the modern world’s financial elite composes mainly of representatives of the Jewish nation.  You will not understand this side of the present world without familiarity of certain aspects of the history of this nation and its historical path.</p>
<p><i>In the view of the millions of people who are carriers of different cultures: the active role of the Jewish people in the world events were experienced in all periods of human history. Surely the history of the Jewish people and their land is one of the world's oldest seats of civilization – according to Biblical prophecy the land is promised the Jews – and they are an integral part of world culture.</i></p>
<p>Therefore, each new discovery of ""white spots"" in this historical arena can be safely regarded as a major breakthrough in the understanding of the formation of civilizations. And, of course, more valuable is the discovery of the ""unknown pages"" of the historical expulsion of the Israelites and their aspiration to find ""temporary shelter"" away from the motherland.</p>
<p><strong>I have, as a historian of the ancient Israelite events, already created an in-depth historical academic research project</strong>: The research cycle books, <i>""A Historical Research of the Ten Tribes Scattered into the <i>Nations</i></i><i>"" </i>have been thoroughly developed by our research team for more than ten years.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478771149/vawwam1pdde5xbebhv0r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We spent two years involved with ""in-the-field working expeditions"" in many countries, personally met representatives of leading local Jewish organizations, and beloved scattered Ten Tribe people of Israel now living outside its borders in new places they call their home. During our expeditions we were blessed to meet local archaeologists, found archaeological evidence of settlements of the ancient Israelite descendants and the connection to the defined recorded events.</p>

<p>In <strong>721 BC</strong> after a three-year siege, the Assyrian king Sargon took Israel. He decided to destroy the rebellious Northern Kingdom of Israel. Tens of thousands of Ten Tribe Israelites were taken as prisoners and settled in remote areas of the Assyrian Empire. During the second attempt in 720 BC thousands more were taken from the capital Samaria and other towns and the Northern Kingdom of Israel were emptied. In 586 BC the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and deported the Southern Kingdom of Israel, Judah, to Babylon.</p>
<p><i><strong>Millions of people were expelled from their country by their oppressors. The total number of people who left their homeland can be estimated more than 2.5 million.</strong></i></p>

<p><strong>How was it possible!!!!  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Especially in the ancient world for masses of people with their livestock to be sustained in the semi-desert middle-eastern counties?</li>
<li>Did masses of people leave to other countries before the Assyrian invasions took place?</li>
<li>Did the exiled ancient people leave their areas of captivity and venture further into the unknown areas of the New World?</li>
<li>Which migration paths did these ancient travellers choose?</li>
<li>Where did the megalithic stone structures and dolmens originate from, why do they align with certain heavenly bodies, and are they definite undeniable archaeological signs that the Ten Tribes existed?</li>
<li>What is behind the story of the ""river that stopped every seven days"" to enabling passing over and where is the mysterious land covered by dark clouds?</li>

<p>To resolve the recorded picture of BC events with progressive views of modern science is not that difficult. This narrative opens an interesting opportunity to shift mind-set and thinking to a fundamentally new relationship between religion and science. Instead of competition there is now cooperation, which is explained by these similarities.</p>
<p>Archaeology has given extensive realistic material, which can be interpreted as traces of the progressive process of life. Similarly, the recorded ancient literature has accumulated a huge stockpile of information about the structure of the physical world and of life in general on the earth, which interpreted as signs of the Creator's act of creation and its progress.</p>

<p><strong><i>In this series we also find a variety of ancient sources which are very important for the understanding of the life processes of the ancient myths and legends. </i></strong></p>
<p><i>Myth: this is the language in which old men verbally portrayed the most important aspects about themselves.<strong><i> </i></strong>The ancient Israelites thought in pictures, they contributed to the myth-making. That which is expressed in the symbolism of myth opened the human’s understanding and spirit. It very frequently happened that a 'historical fact' evolved into a 'legend', which then turned into a 'myth'. For example it is a historical fact that David slain the giant Goliath. This fact became a legend and today it is told in a story format as a myth, but undoubtedly the facts still remain. </i></p>
<p><strong><i>There are many such fascinating myths which were left behind by the people of the Ten Tribes on their migratory routes.</i></strong></p>

<p>In our world today, all of these historical events have left rich archaeological evidence, which cannot be reasoned away. What is penned in the Scriptures eons ago eventually surfaced for our generation at the end of the 21th century.</p>
<p><strong>A fresh look into history now helps us to find the reason and purpose of our existence in the nations.</strong></p>
<p>The series undoubtedly opens to you the amazing coincidence of mysterious prophecies that come true, proving an undeniable and infallible track-record. It is simply astounding how the Hebrew prophets with their incredible accuracy to predict not only the fate of their people, but also the formation and fall of empires, which had a direct impact on the Jewish people and the ultimate fate of all mankind.</p>

<p>As stated above, the modern world’s financial elite driving the banking machine, compose mainly of representatives of the Jewish nation, which was shaped by the Israelites that migrated into the various countries years gone by and established the banking systems. You will not understand this side of the world without familiarity with certain aspects of the history of this nation and its historical path.</p>
<p><i>Discovering these <strong>""new white spots""</strong> of the history of mankind and the Jews, each of you may realize that basically the world was laid on the supreme law of love and nobility for the human life. This love and nobility to mankind was not granted in vain by the Creator, no, His people now scattered and assimilated into the nations went through tormenting suffering of devastating proportions of all sorts, in the hope to return someday to their real home – the Promised Land.</i></p>

<p>We tend to offer our loyal readers the best value at the lowest prices as seen in the column on the top right-hand side on this page. In addition, jaw-dropping real-life threatening events viewed from an imaginary view, which will give you the most valuable, real-world knowledge, and hopefully, the maximum notions for sinking into a distant and unfamiliar world of these ancestor travellers, are included throughout the storyline. A world vividly unreal for us, which undoubtedly existed of an ancient people with a strong character for freedom-living, who migrated fearlessly into the unexplored New World to survive. You get all this encapsulating adventures at a reasonable price in an electronic format, which are also considered for a printed format.

<b><i> </i></b><i><strong>JOIN THE STORY, BECOME PART OF THE LIFE-CHANGING ADVENTURE in the many exciting and different ways!</strong></i>
</h3>
</div></div>","I am a professor of ancient history and teach at an university. My satisfying job gives me the opportunity to be immersed in the incredible events of the ancient periods of humanity. I am surprised at how many amazing discoveries modern researchers, including us, discover every day.Of course, writing reports and describing all these discoveries in scientific circles, we use a boring scientific style, which many readers do not reach to the middle of the reading. The ancient events are stunning and very rich in material life is desire to be known.
Do you realize what kind of adventure you can discover in the world by looking into the depth of the ages?!

Let us open ourselves to the history of our ancestors in a fascinating style of fantasy. We will go along with the heroes of the ancient world on the roads and together we will be saved from the raging rivers and seek refuge in the land hidden under dark clouds. Venturing all the way with them we will discover plenty of excitement in our history, and incredible stories about the loss of millions of peoples from the Tribes of Israel.

We are ""reviving"" several of the ancient heroic Tribes of the distant past for you. You know one of them was able to get to America and incredible success followed, while another struck it lucky to the diamond industry in South Africa via Holland, and therefore we invite you this incredible journey into the past.I hope you are ready to join us in this adventure.
This book series will give you as well, the absolute knowledge of the people who once lived in Israel, but were forced to leave the Land, and this series will perhaps be a reflection of the fate of many of today's refugees; those whose roots come from the beloved ancient exiles.
.
AND!!! As you are well aware this is historical, however, the modern world’s financial elite composes mainly of representatives of the Jewish nation.  You will not understand this side of the present world without familiarity of certain aspects of the history of this nation and its historical path.
In the view of the millions of people who are carriers of different cultures: the active role of the Jewish people in the world events were experienced in all periods of human history. Surely the history of the Jewish people and their land is one of the world's oldest seats of civilization – according to Biblical prophecy the land is promised the Jews – and they are an integral part of world culture.
Therefore, each new discovery of ""white spots"" in this historical arena can be safely regarded as a major breakthrough in the understanding of the formation of civilizations. And, of course, more valuable is the discovery of the ""unknown pages"" of the historical expulsion of the Israelites and their aspiration to find ""temporary shelter"" away from the motherland.
I have, as a historian of the ancient Israelite events, already created an in-depth historical academic research project: The research cycle books, ""A Historical Research of the Ten Tribes Scattered into the Nations"" have been thoroughly developed by our research team for more than ten years.

We spent two years involved with ""in-the-field working expeditions"" in many countries, personally met representatives of leading local Jewish organizations, and beloved scattered Ten Tribe people of Israel now living outside its borders in new places they call their home. During our expeditions we were blessed to meet local archaeologists, found archaeological evidence of settlements of the ancient Israelite descendants and the connection to the defined recorded events.

All of the academic scientific evidence of ""The Research Chronicle"" reports on the investigation is available online concerning the glorious and rich sacred history of the Israelites and their intellectual traditions.
Because it will be hard for the ordinary readerto read the academic material, which is developedfor universities and historical institutions, We decided to write this book to fans ofscience fiction who want to learn thehistorical events of the world more deeply,but in an easier and captivating format called: 

 
In 721 BC after a three-year siege, the Assyrian king Sargon took Israel. He decided to destroy the rebellious Northern Kingdom of Israel. Tens of thousands of Ten Tribe Israelites were taken as prisoners and settled in remote areas of the Assyrian Empire. During the second attempt in 720 BC thousands more were taken from the capital Samaria and other towns and the Northern Kingdom of Israel were emptied. In 586 BC the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem and deported the Southern Kingdom of Israel, Judah, to Babylon.
Millions of people were expelled from their country by their oppressors. The total number of people who left their homeland can be estimated more than 2.5 million.

How was it possible!!!!  

 Especially in the ancient world for masses of people with their livestock to be sustained in the semi-desert middle-eastern counties?
Did masses of people leave to other countries before the Assyrian invasions took place?
Did the exiled ancient people leave their areas of captivity and venture further into the unknown areas of the New World?
Which migration paths did these ancient travellers choose?
Where did the megalithic stone structures and dolmens originate from, why do they align with certain heavenly bodies, and are they definite undeniable archaeological signs that the Ten Tribes existed?
What is behind the story of the ""river that stopped every seven days"" to enabling passing over and where is the mysterious land covered by dark clouds?


- Let's imagine  and put ourselves with some of these people on the road; the difficulties in the fight for their faith and their right to live!

To resolve the recorded picture of BC events with progressive views of modern science is not that difficult. This narrative opens an interesting opportunity to shift mind-set and thinking to a fundamentally new relationship between religion and science. Instead of competition there is now cooperation, which is explained by these similarities.
Archaeology has given extensive realistic material, which can be interpreted as traces of the progressive process of life. Similarly, the recorded ancient literature has accumulated a huge stockpile of information about the structure of the physical world and of life in general on the earth, which interpreted as signs of the Creator's act of creation and its progress.

In this series we also find a variety of ancient sources which are very important for the understanding of the life processes of the ancient myths and legends. 
Myth: this is the language in which old men verbally portrayed the most important aspects about themselves. The ancient Israelites thought in pictures, they contributed to the myth-making. That which is expressed in the symbolism of myth opened the human’s understanding and spirit. It very frequently happened that a 'historical fact' evolved into a 'legend', which then turned into a 'myth'. For example it is a historical fact that David slain the giant Goliath. This fact became a legend and today it is told in a story format as a myth, but undoubtedly the facts still remain. 
There are many such fascinating myths which were left behind by the people of the Ten Tribes on their migratory routes.

In our world today, all of these historical events have left rich archaeological evidence, which cannot be reasoned away. What is penned in the Scriptures eons ago eventually surfaced for our generation at the end of the 21th century.
A fresh look into history now helps us to find the reason and purpose of our existence in the nations.
The series undoubtedly opens to you the amazing coincidence of mysterious prophecies that come true, proving an undeniable and infallible track-record. It is simply astounding how the Hebrew prophets with their incredible accuracy to predict not only the fate of their people, but also the formation and fall of empires, which had a direct impact on the Jewish people and the ultimate fate of all mankind.

The Ten Tribes’ ancient journeys helped shaping the world... 

As stated above, the modern world’s financial elite driving the banking machine, compose mainly of representatives of the Jewish nation, which was shaped by the Israelites that migrated into the various countries years gone by and established the banking systems. You will not understand this side of the world without familiarity with certain aspects of the history of this nation and its historical path.
Discovering these ""new white spots"" of the history of mankind and the Jews, each of you may realize that basically the world was laid on the supreme law of love and nobility for the human life. This love and nobility to mankind was not granted in vain by the Creator, no, His people now scattered and assimilated into the nations went through tormenting suffering of devastating proportions of all sorts, in the hope to return someday to their real home – the Promised Land.
You reading this, can become part of the greatest prophetic event in history!!!

Please view the link for a detailed overview of the enormity of the progressive Israel research project with individuals’ references and photos for an evaluation:  http://coi-recon.org/research/ All this to ensure this ""Disappeared into Eternity"" project is a success.


The good news is that we already have a great fundamental story. Delays in editing, cover design, or events in the author’s personal life would be the most common risks to potentially delay the completion of this project.
BUT! I already have adequate experience in this type of work with my existing followers of readers. For over a year I have worked fulltime on the research cycle, and consistently on the 28th of each month, subscribers receive my next research book early in the morning. There was not a single day delay in my commitment to my readers.


1. If you love this story, believe what it can achieve, and want to be part of the reality of prophecies, then please share this end-time project with your friends and family and ask them to contribute! EVERY DOLLAR SEED SOWN BRINGS US CLOSER TO OUR GOAL!2. Once you have read the books (or if you have already), please write reviews on our Facebook page ""Disappeared into Eternity"" at this link: http://business.facebook.com/Disappeared-into-E... This is vital so that others can see what you think of the story!
3. You can also join us at Instagram at #top10disappearances by sharing our postings with your contacts – this will greatly advance the project.
4. You can also like us, review us, and share our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmLFHp57qAU&feature=youtu.be  – this will also greatly advance the project.
 

We tend to offer our loyal readers the best value at the lowest prices as seen in the column on the top right-hand side on this page. In addition, jaw-dropping real-life threatening events viewed from an imaginary view, which will give you the most valuable, real-world knowledge, and hopefully, the maximum notions for sinking into a distant and unfamiliar world of these ancestor travellers, are included throughout the storyline. A world vividly unreal for us, which undoubtedly existed of an ancient people with a strong character for freedom-living, who migrated fearlessly into the unexplored New World to survive. You get all this encapsulating adventures at a reasonable price in an electronic format, which are also considered for a printed format. All copies are endorsed and distributed only at Indiegogo.com.
Our ""Disappeared into Eternity"" will be developed as a novel in the norm of a popular series. Every month you will receive the next part of this series which may be released at your preference.
We are planning to create a cognitive and adventurous board game based on the narrative of the novel, which will follow the history of the heroes of the 12 Tribes of Israel and their wonderful global wanderings when the novel series is completed. 

As said, I have a lot of experience in this type of 'develop and supply' work with my existing and frequent readers. It is now over a year fulltime that I am busy writing the 'academic' research papers for the research cycle. On the 28th of each month all my subscribers consistently receive my next research book ensuring not a single day delay. The reason, my credentials as a professor in academia are at risk. I can with honesty say that I am totally commitment to my readers.

Hi, I'm Ewan and I am the Secretary at the Australian National Aviation Museum. Our museum is all volunteer based and we are a registered Not For Profit group.
