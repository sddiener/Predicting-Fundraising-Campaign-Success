<h1>Here's what existing users are saying about <i>The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest</i>.</h1>
<ul>
<li>""<b>Love this thing.</b> I recently competed in an 8 week body transformation challenge and came third out of over 1000, in a large part thanks to the additional fat burning from the Cold Shoulder. Really appreciate what you've done here Wayne. I usually wear it just before bed, the coolness helps me get to sleep -- another awesome benefit. In the summer when it's hot out, I find myself pulling it on during the day as well so that I'm less of sweaty."" - Evan W</li>
<li>""<strong>I'm shocked at how well this thing works.</strong> I've been using it for just over a week and I can literally ""feel"" my metabolism spinning while wearing the vest. Additionally, as a side affect of it I feel better so I feel like I am making better eating choices. It's a win/win across the board."" - Dan Skweres, KickStarter backer</li>
<li>""<b>The vest is more comfortable than I thought.</b>"" - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R66PKB5GKP1PV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01AX7XHGS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Clark</a>

<li>""<b>I shrank out of it!</b> Can I get a second vest one size smaller?"" - Mariza Valdez, KickStarter backer.</li>
<li>""<b>Easiest weight loss I've ever seen. </b>Customer service was great. The product arrived quickly and was easy to adjust to my body. I have a chest style freezer and it's very easy to put the whole vest laying flat on one side. It's easy to wear and while I do feel the cold it's not unbearable.... All in all it's a great product and does what they say."" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WZDHR77U20XO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01AX7XHGS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon customer</a>
</li>
<li>""<b>Certainly a ""cool"" idea that's working for me. </b>Since adding The Cold Shoulder to my overall fitness/diet plan for about 2 hrs daily, I've lost about 1.2% or 3.5 lbs. of body fat in the last 90 days! I'm very pleased, because it took me a little more than 365 days to drop the previous 5% body fat before I discovered The Cold Shoulder. At 63, I have some issues from manual labor and sports injuries that limit some physical activity, but this ""cool tool"" is enabling me to break through a bit of a ""plateau"" I'd reached in my progress.

<li>""<b>I drank the Kool Aid.</b> I was very skeptical when purchasing this product. It seemed too good to be true but the inventor, Wayne Hayes, makes it very clear that this system is not meant to be the ""end all, be all"" to weight loss. There's no magic solution, it's meant to help you burn calories and works effectively with regular exercise and proper diet (no brainer). The vest is comfortable, wearing it over my clothes for twice a day (morning and evening) makes the cold very tolerable and it doesn't impede my daily activities. Furthermore, the vest is stylish enough (I have the black version) to wear in public and not have people stare at you."" -Amazon user MightyTiki</li>

<p><i>The Cold Shoulder</i> turns the idea into a convenient product.</p>
<h1>Why You’ll Love <i>The Cold Shoulder</i>
</h1>
<p><b>1. Backed by 50 years of science.</b> Scientists have studied how mild cold exposure can burn calories since the 1960s.</p>
<p><b>2. Burns calories without exercise.</b> Whether you’re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you – the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.</p>
<p><b>3. Saves time.</b> It takes about 30 seconds to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, especially including travel, change, and shower time.</p>
<p><b>4. It’s comfortable.</b> No shivering! After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it.</p>
<p><b>5. It gets more effective the more you use it.</b> Your body adapts to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories, making the vest more effective the more you use it.</p>
<p><b>6.</b><b>We listened to our successful users </b>and gave them what they wanted! The new Classic 2.0 combines the style of the original Classic vest (which was our first KickStarter campaign) with the longer-lasting CryoMAX(tm) ice of our PRO vest (which was our second KickStarter campaign).</p>
<h1>Some background</h1>
<p>I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories.</p>
<p>I'm a professor and former NASA scientist. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and <i>The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest</i> is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't. But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.</p>

<p>Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. <b>Note that <i>The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest</i> cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.</b></p>
<h1>The Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories</h1>
<p>The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting the fat loss benefits of a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories. <i><b>But it's not.</b></i></p>
<h1>The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure</h1>
<p>In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I worked at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.</p>
<p>I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it.</p>
<h1>Now Powered With CryoMAX 8-hour Gel!</h1>
<p>We are proud to announce that <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> has entered into an exclusive partnership with <i>CryoMAX </i>in the calorie burning vest market. <i>CryoMAX</i> gel is a patented, food-grade glycerin (which basically means it's so safe you could drink it without any ill-effects). <i> CryoMAX</i> gel is flexible even when frozen and can stay cold up to 8 hours, as their own scientific tests have shown:</p>
<div data-id=""21150846""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/150/846/0e3557f07e6f9e8f33ff28244ed53409_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1525728816&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=4e5562f69b182e6959504228c5120892"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>Considering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?</p>
<p>You don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, <i>mild </i>cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.</p>
<p>For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. <i><b>It’s the water.</b></i> They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.</p>
<div data-id=""21150880""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/150/880/2b4ea5adfeb2e91a4f429d071e489f94_original.jpeg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1525728986&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=1c1b2ecb5a3ae8ce954f163265ac8886"" src=""""/><figcaption>Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.</p>
<p>Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:</p>
<div data-id=""21150889""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/021/150/889/862e5177c854e00e782bf9cf2a6a8a56_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1525729043&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8d5872f425d88cc54b3d1d11a3b38bd3"" src=""""/><figcaption>Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>These are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called <i>Brown Adipose Tissue </i>(<b>BAT</b>). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.</p>
<h1>How to maximize effectiveness of The Cold Shoulder</h1>
<p>We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions <i>The Cold Shoulder </i>can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.</p>
<p>If you are in a hot environment, the <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> can help you stay cool, and can even help you cool down after a workout, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.</p>
<p>So, to burn excess calories, wear <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don <i>The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest</i> and enhance your calorie burn.</p>
<h1>Example trial result - Nick Hamilton</h1>

<h1>Evidence from independent scientists</h1>
<p>For more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see <a href=""http://coldshoulderweightloss.com/science"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this page</a>. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of <i>The Cold Shoulder</i>, so you <i>know </i>it's independent and objective.</p>
<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>We want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn’t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.</p>
<h1>Why We Need You!</h1>
<p>We already have the vests made, but the CryoMAX ice is cheaper to buy in bulk, so we need to create a bulk order to CryoMAX so we can offer KickStarter folks a discount---and to have enough ice to <i>continue</i> selling them at a reasonable price.</p>
<h1>Will It Fit Me?</h1>
<p>We have tried The Cold Shoulder Classic 2.0 vest on people with chest sizes ranging from 36 inches up to 60 inches, and it fits no problem. It's a finely tailored vest with side straps that allow flexibility. We'll ask your exact size once the campaign funds.</p>

<p>We have 1,000 Classic 2.0 vests on hand right here in California, and another 5,000 waiting in the wings in our manufacturing facility in China. <b>The vests are already made</b>. What we still need to do is to order the CryoMAX ice; we'll know how much ice to order once the campaign finishes. The ice takes about 1-2 months to be delivered to our California warehouse, and then we'll start shipping. <b>We also have a limited amount of ice available immediately</b><i>; </i>those willing to pay extra for immediate shipping will have their vest shipped, with ice, as soon as we get the funds from KickStarter.</p>

Testimonial Photos from exitsing users
Here's what existing users are saying about The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest.

""Love this thing. I recently competed in an 8 week body transformation challenge and came third out of over 1000, in a large part thanks to the additional fat burning from the Cold Shoulder. Really appreciate what you've done here Wayne. I usually wear it just before bed, the coolness helps me get to sleep -- another awesome benefit. In the summer when it's hot out, I find myself pulling it on during the day as well so that I'm less of sweaty."" - Evan W
""I'm shocked at how well this thing works. I've been using it for just over a week and I can literally ""feel"" my metabolism spinning while wearing the vest. Additionally, as a side affect of it I feel better so I feel like I am making better eating choices. It's a win/win across the board."" - Dan Skweres, KickStarter backer
""The vest is more comfortable than I thought."" - David Clark

""I shrank out of it! Can I get a second vest one size smaller?"" - Mariza Valdez, KickStarter backer.
""Easiest weight loss I've ever seen. Customer service was great. The product arrived quickly and was easy to adjust to my body. I have a chest style freezer and it's very easy to put the whole vest laying flat on one side. It's easy to wear and while I do feel the cold it's not unbearable.... All in all it's a great product and does what they say."" Amazon customer

""Certainly a ""cool"" idea that's working for me. Since adding The Cold Shoulder to my overall fitness/diet plan for about 2 hrs daily, I've lost about 1.2% or 3.5 lbs. of body fat in the last 90 days! I'm very pleased, because it took me a little more than 365 days to drop the previous 5% body fat before I discovered The Cold Shoulder. At 63, I have some issues from manual labor and sports injuries that limit some physical activity, but this ""cool tool"" is enabling me to break through a bit of a ""plateau"" I'd reached in my progress. I just enter the extra 500 calorie deduction in my fitness/nutrition calculator daily and can not only monitor, but plan my success. The Cold Shoulder is a simple, safe, effective and easy to use quality made product!"" - Bruce Higgins

""Helped me get over my weight loss plateau. This is the first cold vest I've tried. I like the ice packs they use they retain cold for quite awhile. When I use this consistently two times during the day for an hour each time I've noticed weight loss of .5-1lbs per week.... I'd been at a plateau for several months and this helped me get over my weight-loss plateau."" - Amazon customer

""Cool solution. I live in a hot climate and I thought this would be perfect for those long hours spent outside in the heat... and this works really well. I haven't changed my eating habits but I have lost a couple pounds in the process as well so I think it helps there too. I highly recommend it."" - TexasRed, Amazon Customer

""I wear it for 2 hours everyday and have had no issues with getting it on or in and out of the freezer. You can defiantly feel how ice chillingly cold it is while wearing it. But on the other hand it's not an uncomfortable cold. The product really works. I used the vest along with some minimal cardio and have seen significant improvement in my energy and fat loss goals. The vest literally stays cold for hours."" - Amazon Customer Veteran_68w

""The vest is really solid and well-made. It fits in with my weightloss process and works great. I highly recommend The Cold Shoulder!"" - Amazon Customer Lee_Gunby

""It is very comfortable. The design is easy to work with and after a minute or two feeling the initial cold of the packs, you can actually forget you are wearing it. Looking forward to using it many more times."" - Amazon customer toonist.

""I was 206lbs at the beginning of my experiment of the Cold Shoulder vest. I've been carb loading the last 3 days for the competition and today I weighed in at 200 lbs! I am very excited about my results and have pictures of me wearing the vest after the competition; I found it's also great for immediate muscle recovery."" - Dan Weecks, The Talk Around Town Show

""Excellent to assist with weight loss. I've been wearing the vest twice a day since it arrived and I've been losing approximately 1lb a week with no changes to my diet or exercise habits. The vest is very comfortable. On warmer days the cold is very refreshing and on the colder nights it's never cold enough to make you shiver or feel uncomfortable. Huge positive."" Shawn S.

""I've been using this vest daily since it arrived. I wear it twice a day for an hour to an hour and a half. I actually really enjoy the cold, and it has done a good job of accelerating my weight loss. A really worthwhile investment!"" - Andrew Clinton

""I suffer from a medical condition that causes skin to feel hot no matter the environmental temperature. For this purpose, the cold shoulder vest is an absolute dream for me. I can wear it for hours, and it helps, it really helps."" - Anonymous KickStarter user.
""I drank the Kool Aid. I was very skeptical when purchasing this product. It seemed too good to be true but the inventor, Wayne Hayes, makes it very clear that this system is not meant to be the ""end all, be all"" to weight loss. There's no magic solution, it's meant to help you burn calories and works effectively with regular exercise and proper diet (no brainer). The vest is comfortable, wearing it over my clothes for twice a day (morning and evening) makes the cold very tolerable and it doesn't impede my daily activities. Furthermore, the vest is stylish enough (I have the black version) to wear in public and not have people stare at you."" -Amazon user MightyTiki

Our Story
The Cold Shoulder is a time-saving, comfortable, scientifically-proven way to burn calories without exercise, sold directly to you at a wholesale price. We have thousands of users seeing great results. Our vest uses mild, comfortable cold exposure to extract calories directly from your body. You simply take it out fo the freezer, put it on, and go about your daily activities.
Just put it on and go about your business!
The idea has appeared in numerous places:
Cold Shoulder Media Exposure
The Cold Shoulder turns the idea into a convenient product.
Why You’ll Love The Cold Shoulder

1. Backed by 50 years of science. Scientists have studied how mild cold exposure can burn calories since the 1960s.
2. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you’re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you – the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.
3. Saves time. It takes about 30 seconds to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, especially including travel, change, and shower time.
4. It’s comfortable. No shivering! After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it.
5. It gets more effective the more you use it. Your body adapts to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories, making the vest more effective the more you use it.
6.We listened to our successful users and gave them what they wanted! The new Classic 2.0 combines the style of the original Classic vest (which was our first KickStarter campaign) with the longer-lasting CryoMAX(tm) ice of our PRO vest (which was our second KickStarter campaign).
Some background
I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories.
I'm a professor and former NASA scientist. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.
Radio Health Journal interview:

 
Let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't. But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.

Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. Note that The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.
The Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories
The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting the fat loss benefits of a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.
There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories. But it's not.
The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure
In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I worked at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.
The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.
I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it.
Now Powered With CryoMAX 8-hour Gel!
We are proud to announce that The Cold Shoulder has entered into an exclusive partnership with CryoMAX in the calorie burning vest market. CryoMAX gel is a patented, food-grade glycerin (which basically means it's so safe you could drink it without any ill-effects).  CryoMAX gel is flexible even when frozen and can stay cold up to 8 hours, as their own scientific tests have shown:

How does it work?
Considering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?
You don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.
For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It’s the water. They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.
Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.
Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.
Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:
Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.
These are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.
How to maximize effectiveness of The Cold Shoulder
We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.
If you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, and can even help you cool down after a workout, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.
So, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest and enhance your calorie burn.
Example trial result - Nick Hamilton

Below is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.
Nick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.
Evidence from independent scientists
For more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.
Our Mission
We want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn’t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.
Why We Need You!
We already have the vests made, but the CryoMAX ice is cheaper to buy in bulk, so we need to create a bulk order to CryoMAX so we can offer KickStarter folks a discount---and to have enough ice to continue selling them at a reasonable price.
Will It Fit Me?
We have tried The Cold Shoulder Classic 2.0 vest on people with chest sizes ranging from 36 inches up to 60 inches, and it fits no problem. It's a finely tailored vest with side straps that allow flexibility. We'll ask your exact size once the campaign funds.
Production Plan
We have 1,000 Classic 2.0 vests on hand right here in California, and another 5,000 waiting in the wings in our manufacturing facility in China. The vests are already made. What we still need to do is to order the CryoMAX ice; we'll know how much ice to order once the campaign finishes. The ice takes about 1-2 months to be delivered to our California warehouse, and then we'll start shipping. We also have a limited amount of ice available immediately; those willing to pay extra for immediate shipping will have their vest shipped, with ice, as soon as we get the funds from KickStarter.

Road to Xnowmate 1.0After 5 series of prototypes and the help of many people Xnowmate was born. A new concept of footwear, waterproof, warm, comfortable, very light, unisex ... and foldable. Almost unbelievable, but it worked. The first Xnowmate were manufactured in Spain in the 2014-2015 season and won an award at the prestigious ISPO Munich for its innovation and quality. It was the first time that such a young Spanish company got this award. We were not so crazy after all.   The second generation: Xnowmate 2.0 ...Our first model was very innovative but the outsole was too flat for snow and watery surfaces, so in the 2017-18 season we reinvented ourselves by incorporating a sole with high end technology to improve grip on ice and snow, and we incorporated a high boot model.  Soon we began to receive incredible feedback from people all around the globe, people love to wear Xnowmate. So lightweight, so warm, so comfortable, so convenient. They wear them not only for skiing, also to go outdoors, to photograph the forest at night, to go sailing, even mushing or riding horses, or in cities when snow makes it difficult to walk.We realized that there was an opportunity beyond ski slopes - a new generation was born. Xnowmate 3.0We knew our boots were great for outdoors but honestly, not too nice for cities. Therefore we decided to combine the technology we already had with modern design to create stylish outdoor boots that not only look and feel great, but offer unparalleled performance. This is Xnowmate 3.0, Hybrid Outdoor FootwearWe have developed this new model in London, with a top footwear design consultancy and results are amazing: What is new about Xnowmate 3.0

<p><strong><span>Introducing One Nova Underwear, the only underwear that is so comfortable, you’ll forget you’re wearing it!</span> </strong>At One Nova, we believe in the simple power of basics. <strong><span>Underwear is something that we think about way more than we should</span>.</strong> Whether it’s “Ugh, the tag of my underwear is irritating” or the constant feeling that you need to adjust them. At One Nova, we’re working to change that. We want the only thought you have about your underwear to be “These are so soft” when you first put them on. After that, it shouldn’t cross your mind again. <strong><span>Something that we put on every day should be a pleasant experience!</span></strong></p></figure></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587916355/m4fwhmppqc3hhock0alp.png"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""27741821""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>
<p><strong><span>We reinvented our underwear from the ground up</span>,</strong> starting by producing our own exclusive fabric blend: a unique blend of eco-friendly merino wool and beech tree fiber. Merino wool is what makes our underwear <i><span>unbelievably soft</span></i>. It also naturally wicks away sweat and other moisture, for <i><span>odor protection</span></i>. The beech tree fiber gives our underwear their <i><span>durability</span></i>, and most importantly, their <i><span>breathability</span></i>. We didn’t forget the construction either, our boxer briefs have <i><span>no tag</span></i> and a <i><span>3D pouch</span></i> that allows for extra room in the front so your sperm count is protected and you never feel squished. </p></figure></div><p><i><span>No more adjusting, chafing, odor, or sweat.</span> </i><strong><span>Just comfort.</span> </strong></p><p>Life can be unpredictable, sweaty, and uncomfortable, but you don’t need to be.

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Hi, we’re Taiga and Lilian, the team behind One Nova. We started One Nova as business students, with a strong mission: to create the perfect pair of underwear. We were fed up with the solvable every-day problems caused by poor design and cheap fabrics. We were sick of scratchy fabric that makes you uncomfortable all day long and poor construction that doesn’t give you proper support. We traveled around Asia in search of solutions to these problems and somewhere along the way, One Nova was born. We as a community deserve better from the clothes we wear. <strong><span>We deserve better quality, better comfort, better support, and better production practices</span>. </strong>We are proud to deliver you all of those things with One Nova underwear. </p><p>Thanks for reading, and let the adventure begin!</p></div>","Introducing One Nova Underwear, the only underwear that is so comfortable, you’ll forget you’re wearing it! At One Nova, we believe in the simple power of basics. Underwear is something that we think about way more than we should. Whether it’s “Ugh, the tag of my underwear is irritating” or the constant feeling that you need to adjust them. At One Nova, we’re working to change that. We want the only thought you have about your underwear to be “These are so soft” when you first put them on. After that, it shouldn’t cross your mind again. Something that we put on every day should be a pleasant experience! 
We reinvented our underwear from the ground up, starting by producing our own exclusive fabric blend: a unique blend of eco-friendly merino wool and beech tree fiber. Merino wool is what makes our underwear unbelievably soft. It also naturally wicks away sweat and other moisture, for odor protection. The beech tree fiber gives our underwear their durability, and most importantly, their breathability. We didn’t forget the construction either, our boxer briefs have no tag and a 3D pouch that allows for extra room in the front so your sperm count is protected and you never feel squished. No more adjusting, chafing, odor, or sweat. Just comfort. Life can be unpredictable, sweaty, and uncomfortable, but you don’t need to be. Never adjust, chafe, or stink again. Go hiking and get lost. Go to the gym and then back to the board room. Go to the airport and have your flight canceled. We’ve got you. 
 
 
 Whether you’re a backpacker, businessman, homebody, or anything in between, life is full of unexpected adventures. That’s why it’s important to have comfortable and reliable clothing. One Nova was designed for the ultimate comfort experience so you can feel and move confidently. Underwear may be the first thing you put on in the morning, but it should be the last thing you worry about. We thought of all the problems that underwear may cause so that you don’t have to! Look at all of the things you don’t have to worry about when you wear One Nova underwear:Let's dig into the details... 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

  
  
 On top of all this, One Nova underwear is silky smooth, resistant to shrinkage and pilling, and comes in rich colors. A pair of One Nova underwear can be worn comfortably for up to three days as well! It's not magic, it's our exclusive fabric blend... 

 
 The reason we are able to make such awesome underwear is thanks to the revolutionary material we use. Our team spent a year traveling around Asia searching for the perfect materials for One Nova. The time was well spent because we found the ultimate textile combination: Merino Wool and Modal. Modal wood fibers are created by spinning cellulose from beech trees. The result is a fabric that is breathable and silky smooth. Their properties resist both shrinkage and pilling. They also absorb dye, so the fabric keeps its rich color even after being washed. 
 Merino Wool is made from a particular breed of Australian sheep. The wool is made of very fine fibers allowing it to act as a natural temperature regulator as well as being odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, breathable, and soft to the touch. Together we blend these two textiles to make the ultimate fabric for our underwear. One Nova underwear has the benefits of both textiles. Super soft, breathable, moisture-wicking, and durable. This underwear can survive anything.At One Nova we believe in transparency about where our materials come from and how our products are made. We are committed to producing products efficiently to not harm the planet. Our underwear is made from 100% eco-friendly and sustainable materials.  
 
 We don't use any plastic material. All of our products and shipping packagings are made from recycled papers and cardboards. In order to minimize waste generation, we always look for ways to use the least packaging possible.  We only use natural materials in our products. Merino wool and modal from beech tree fibers are biodegradable.  We also make sure that the manufacturing process is earth-friendly. Our boxer briefs are made in an eco-friendly process. The merino wool comes from Australia. The Modal is produced by a company, Lenzing in Austria. From wood sourcing to factory gate, Lenzing modal fibers' sustainability has been scientifically proven in a life cycle assessment done by Utrecht University.   To meet the anticipated demands of our backers, we have spent months looking for new partners around Asia. We have finally found one in Qingdao, China. The labor condition is the most crucial element for us when it comes to choosing factories. Over the course of our preparation period, we have visited our factory to get to know the team behind the production of our underwear and to make sure that these employees are working under good conditions. We can assure you that they work under healthy conditions within well-organized factories. They also produce high-quality products. We, One Nova only become partners with those who we can count on.  
 
 
 

 
 

 
  

   
 
 
 

*Survey = Those who place 12-packs and 24-packs, please communicate your choices with us through messages to ensure speedy delivery. Those who choose other perk tiers should be able to select the sizes and the colors during the checkout process. If you'd like personalized stitching let us know by messages. Missing information will be checked at the end of the month. Thanks!

<h3>Blano</h3>
<p>Blano is an Amsterdam based luxury handbag label founded by me, Lisa Eggen, in 2019. With the help of my sister Nynke (who is specialized in sustainable product development), I started Blano. Blano delivers a line of timeless bags for the modern woman who; </p>
<ul>
<li>Aims for sheer quality</li>
<li>Wants to minimize their carbon footprint</li>
<li>Is not looking to make concessions on style/design</li>
</ul>
<p>Dedicated to delivering quality Blano bags are handmade in Italy, as well as most of the materials that are used.</p>
<p>Our love for design and for the planet is the base of this brand. We feel that products should never be the cause of harm to anyone or anything. </p>
<p>We have selected the materials carefully by looking for a balance of quality, style and environmental impact. Working only with vegan materials, we have created a line of high-end timeless bags.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I already put all of my savings in Blano, the sampling, 'leather', hardware and everything we need in order to do the production is already paid for. We now need additional funding of 6700 EUR in order to finance the first production. You can pre-order your Blano bag now and get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high-end bag that is vegan and sustainable so you don't have to make concessions </li>
<li>An attractive discount of up to 30%</li>
<li>You get to make an impact towards a better fashion industry </li>

A new “leather” innovation that is made from apple fibers that are leftover from the food processing industry. We love the concept of turning waste into high-quality new materials. This material though is still in development and very hard to access. However, when we came to Italy in 2019 to visit our suppliers they had a surprise for us. They have created a material made from apple fiber waste, PU, polyester, and cotton. But also, not unimportantly, it has a high-quality appeal and looks like leather. We are very happy to be able to use this material for our first collection. The next steps are to develop this material further to become even cleaner and have even less impact. But even if a material is not perfect yet it is already worth investing in to drive change and innovation.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I will do my utmost best to collect the money in time to deliver the products in February. However, of course, there is a risk we won't make it. The worst-case scenario is that the production will be delayed. </p>

In 2008, my amazing mother Sharon, passed away after years of battling breast cancer. With a passion for cars and determined to make a difference in the fight against breast cancer, I am excited to introduce Cure Collection®.





That's the simple part- Make awesome automotive apparel and prints, while 20% goes directly to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation®. Feel good about rocking your favorite ride while you are helping find a cure for breast cancer.

<p>Kaiteki is a Japanese word meaning “comfortable”. Kaiteki
Sandals are designed to be the most comfortable sandal you’ll ever wear. But
our mission goes beyond comfort for the feet. We are also a social-good venture
with a mission-based strategic focus on helping others and making a significant
contribution to improve the lives of others.</p>
<p>Through our partnership with AmeriCares, we will donate a
portion of all net sales to help support children and families in Latin America. We believe we can
make a difference and give comfort to those who truly stand in need of comfort.
That is why we chose Kaiteki as the name of our company.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal for our initial production run is
$15,000 USD. This will help us build our opening inventory and cover the cost
of materials, labor, shipping, and customs/duties.</p>
<p><b>About our product</b></p>
<p>Kaiteki Sandals are made from real yoga mat material! Our sandals are designed to be the most comfortable
sandal you’ll ever wear. Our goal is to manufacture the highest quality product
with the most affordable price tag. With our mission-driven strategic focus of
benefiting consumers as well as our partnership with AmeriCares, we will never
sacrifice quality or service in order to make a buck. The initial Kaiteki
flip-flop sandals are made from ultra-soft EVA material for the in-sole and
durable TPR for the out-sole. The strap is made of PU synthetic leather. The
product is shipped in a poly bag with the Kaiteki logo.</p>
<p>Our initial product run will be available in three strap colors
(black, white, red) and in U.S. women’s sizes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Once the
initial product run is delivered, future sizes, colors, and designs will be
determined by consumer demand, industry trends, and customer input.</p>
<p><b>About our manufacturing process</b></p>
<p>The sandals are manufactured by a company located in
Southeast China. As founder and owner, I have personally visited the family-owned
business in China. I spent time with the staff and built a strong relationship
of trust with the management team. We talked through the specifics of the
product line in great detail and established a strong friendship that will
benefit both companies for many years to come. This relationship is especially
important in doing business with Chinese companies. This concept is known as
“guanxi” which literally means “relationship”. But it goes beyond that. It is the connection between individuals that allow business to be conducted. Many business relationships do
not succeed if “guanxi” is not established first.</p>
<p>I plan to visit my Chinese partners on a regular basis to
ensure the highest quality materials and processes continue to be used in our
products. We will discuss product demand, new design concepts, quality
assurance steps, and production service levels. </p>
<p><b>About our logo</b></p>
<p>Our logo was designed with a dual-purpose. The “K” at the
beginning of the name obviously represents the first letter of our company.
However, if you flip the “K” on its side, it depicts a child with outstretched
arms in praise and thanksgiving. Each time a pair of sandals is purchased,
Kaiteki will make a donation through our partnership with AmeriCares to help
children and families in Latin America. You can help make this vision a reality through your
support of our company now and in the future.</p>
<p><b>About our owner/founder</b></p>
<p>My name is Lance Bradshaw. I founded Kaiteki Sandals in
2014. As an experienced business owner, I’ve always been interested in social-good
entrepreneurism. As an MBA student at the University of Utah, I learned from
others the importance of having a higher purpose than simply turning a profit.
Those organizations who are mission-driven tend to reach higher, stretch
themselves further, and realize sustainable success. On a personal note, I am a
husband and father and live with my family in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.</p>
<p><b>How can you help?</b></p>
<p>There are many ways to help! The easiest and most effective
way is to become a contributor on IndieGoGo. Your funds will be used to secure
inventory and allow our company to move forward with our mission. If you can’t
contribute monetarily, you can still play a huge supporting role by sharing information
about our mission with friends, family, and anyone else you come in contact
with. You can visit any of our sites below and use the share features to help
get our message out.</p>
<p>We also have many types of “swag” available, including vinyl
stickers and decals. Just contact us through IndieGoGo and we’ll mail you a stack
of stickers right away for free!<br/></p>
<p>Please contact us with any questions or for clarification. Thank you very much for your support!</p><p></p></div>","Introduction

truly unique and one of a kind.This
 project is a result of almost two years of very hard work, please take 
your time to look through the pictures and the video descriptions.You
 have Eight color Combinations to chose from, you also can chose either 
the open Heart PTS movement shown here and if you prefer the classic 
Date/Time NH35 Seiko movement you have that option too.I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon,God Bless,Chadi, Umbrella Watch GroupEngineering DesignLook at some of the most extreme designs out there: the F-117 Stealth Bomber, Batman's Tumbler or the Lamborghini Reventon. They share a common feature: they all have curveless orfaceted designs.From Day 1, curves where completely eliminated from our design equation --Only sharp edges and hard angles remain.The X-Frame design was taken to another extreme by breaking down each of the main watch Case Components (Watch Bezel, Case Middle, Case Back and Screw Down Crown) into separate parts, then designing those components separately.
The Case Middle has five Components including the screw-down crown.
The Watch Bezel alone consists of three parts layered on top of each other. The Bezel components have a 10-sided Decagonal design.
TheCase Back is transparent and also has a 10-sided Decagonal design.
The Screw Down Crown is designed to resemble a Gear and also ensures water-resistance by sealing it to the Case.
The Watch is 1 0ATM/100 Meters Water Resistant.
**Case Components are bolt on assemblyDial, Hands, Markers and Strap
Multilayer Dial with a honeycomb pattern in the background, the dial ring has 12 hexagon hour markers. Super-Luminous Hands and Hour MarkersThe Strap was designed to seamlessly fit into the watch and is attached to the case with four screws.FinishingSapphire Glass is used on both the Watch and Transparent Case BackAll Eight Watches have a Matte Finish:1) X-FRAME VULCAN BR, Matte Black Case/Rose Gold Bezel2) X-FRAME VULCAN RB, Matte Rose Gold Case/Black Bezel3) X-FRAME VULCAN BB, Matte Black Case/Black Bezel4) X-FRAME VULCAN SB, Matte Gray Case/Black Bezel5) X-FRAME VULCAN SS, Matte Gray Case/Gray Bezel6) X-FRAME VULCAN RS, Matte Rose Gold Case/Gray Bezel7) X-FRAME VULCAN RR, Matte Rose Gold Case/Rose Gold Bezel8) X-FRAME VULCAN SR, Matte Gray Case/Rose Gold BezelMechanism 
The PTS Resources movement  is a Dual Time Self Winding Mechanism, it is a partially transparent design style Movement.accuracy is at +/- 30 seconds/35 hour power reserve/21'600 alternances/hour/24 jewelsIn other words, you get a partial view of what’s going on inside the watch.A Separate Three-Seven Shaped Seconds Blade is directly placed on top of the Mechanism window.Production ProcessThe extreme geometries in the Design components means that X-Frame cannot be made using the typical open-mold manufacturing process you see in over 95% of watches today.All parts have to be CNC Machined individually with very accurate precision and zero room for error.This Method of production is almost exclusive to limited production runs by high-end watch manufacturers.Wrist ShotsGalleryWarrantyThe Watch is covered by a one year 365 day warranty.To put everyone at ease, we have a forwarding address in each of these countries listed below ( in addition to New York and Ontario):1) Barcelona- Spain2) Dubai- U.A.E3) Frankfurt- Germany4) Hong Kong5) Istanbul- Turkey6) Johannesburg- South Africa7) London- England8) Malaysia9) Milan- Italy10) Mumbai- India11) Paris- France12) Shanghai- China13) SingaporeMeasurements and WeightThe Watch alone without packaging is 179 grams or 6.314 ounces.Please download the 1:1 Scale file by Right clicking on the image below, print and cut it out to see how it measures on your wrist.Risks and challengesOur set delivery date is a worst case scenario date, meaning we already accounted for any potential delays.We are looking forward to communicating and receiving Feedback, We are going to be in close touch with everyone from Day 1, our backers will be well informed of every step along the way.",38.0,14,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.tafalist.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">TAFA: The Textile and Fiber Art List</span></a> is an international membership organization that seeks to help its members find larger audiences and markets for their work.  Launched in January, 2010, TAFA's first members and supporters were art quilters who quickly understood the potential TAFA offered in bringing together small businesses with a fiber art and textile focus. The membership now includes weavers, dyers, and the whole spectrum of contemporary and traditional textile techniques from around the world. Using Blogger as a test platform, we knew from the beginning that eventually we would outgrow what Blogger could offer and that we would need to fund a website that could truly perform as a base for our marketing needs.  TAFA has grown quickly!  As of May, 2011, we have 273 members from 23 countries.  TAFA's could potentially grow into the thousands!  But, only if we get off of Blogger and on to our dream site.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The video above and our<a href=""http://www.tafalist.com/p/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> About Us</span></a> page give a good description of who we are.  In a nutshell, TAFA members are juried in, must have a business focus and a developed online presence.  The core of our membership are working artists who produce their own work for sale online.  We are also open to groups, organizations, teachers and others involved in the textile/fiber art field.  There are many reasons why an organization like TAFA is essential to this niche.  A multi-million dollar industry caught in between definitions of ""art"" and ""craft"", it is propelled by individuals and small businesses who often find themselves lost and overwhelmed in an ocean of marketing demands and needs. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> As the web has increasingly become central to finding an audience and sustaining a business, more and more time and energy goes into learning how to promote via social media and other trends.  TAFA helps centralize these efforts and provides tools and communities for the members so that they can be found more easily by the larger audience.  Several niches have developed within TAFA. We have communities on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TAFAList"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Facebook</span></a>, <a href=""http://tafateam.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Etsy</span></a>, and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/tafa/pool/show/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flickr</span></a>.  Member blogs are streamed together on our site and on to our Facebook page.  Coming together in these ways means that there is a much greater chance of being found rather than swimming out there in cyberspace all alone.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now that TAFA has grown to a decent size, our Blogger platform has become unwieldy, making it hard to explore what our members really have to offer.  Aside from the gorgeous products that our members have for sale, we also have a gold mine of expertise and talent that needs to be accessed.  Many or our members offer workshops, have published books, give lectures, and several have fascinating global tours that focus on textiles.  We want our audience to have access to these gifts.  We also want to centralize our knowledge and have a place where members who need help can find mentors and guidance as they build their businesses.  During this first year it has become clear that although many of our members are tech savvy, others are completely overwhelmed with new technologies.  Our new website will provide tutorials or referrals to help them learn some of these skills.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>TAFA has unique potential both for its members and for the community at large.  The new website offers tools that we cannot develop on our current platform and we hope that YOU will help us achieve this vision.</p>

<h2>TAFA's New Website<br/>
</h2>We have contracted with a talented tech team, <a href=""http://horizonmediagroup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Horizon Media Group</span></a>, which can deliver our dream site.  The site will have a powerful search engine with image based results.  Each member will have their own landing page which they can edit at will.  Their presence on the web will be documented there and they will submit images which will show up as search results, linking back to their member profile.  There will be separate pages with streamed information for their member blogs and events.  A member only section will have tools and links for the members.  Users will be able to search through a menu of categories, by key words, location, and price range.  The site will integrate fully with social media sites.<br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Who will benefit from the new site?</span><br/><br/><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>TAFA Members</strong></span> are the obvious first benefactors, but there are others.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Shoppers</strong></span>:  
Members and their products will be easily found.  TAFA aims to become 
THE destination for anyone interested in textiles and fiber art.  Those 
looking for handmade gifts, a new textile for their wall, commissioned 
work for churches and corporations, functional quilts, ethnic textiles, 
wearable art, toys, and other products made by our members will be able 
to find them.  Galleries and boutiques will find new suppliers.  Museums
 will find new artists and sources. </li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Writers:</strong></span>  Book 
and blog authors who write about textiles and fiber art will have a 
place where they can come and readily find people and product to write 
about.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Other artists:</strong></span> 
 TAFA already is a source of inspiration for the fiber art community.  
But, perhaps many do not know that our members are also a great source 
for supplies.  We have members selling dyes, fabric, textile stamps,

</div></div>","Our Story
TAFA: The Textile and Fiber Art List is an international membership organization that seeks to help its members find larger audiences and markets for their work.  Launched in January, 2010, TAFA's first members and supporters were art quilters who quickly understood the potential TAFA offered in bringing together small businesses with a fiber art and textile focus. The membership now includes weavers, dyers, and the whole spectrum of contemporary and traditional textile techniques from around the world. Using Blogger as a test platform, we knew from the beginning that eventually we would outgrow what Blogger could offer and that we would need to fund a website that could truly perform as a base for our marketing needs.  TAFA has grown quickly!  As of May, 2011, we have 273 members from 23 countries.  TAFA's could potentially grow into the thousands!  But, only if we get off of Blogger and on to our dream site.

The video above and our About Us page give a good description of who we are.  In a nutshell, TAFA members are juried in, must have a business focus and a developed online presence.  The core of our membership are working artists who produce their own work for sale online.  We are also open to groups, organizations, teachers and others involved in the textile/fiber art field.  There are many reasons why an organization like TAFA is essential to this niche.  A multi-million dollar industry caught in between definitions of ""art"" and ""craft"", it is propelled by individuals and small businesses who often find themselves lost and overwhelmed in an ocean of marketing demands and needs. 

 As the web has increasingly become central to finding an audience and sustaining a business, more and more time and energy goes into learning how to promote via social media and other trends.  TAFA helps centralize these efforts and provides tools and communities for the members so that they can be found more easily by the larger audience.  Several niches have developed within TAFA. We have communities on Facebook, Etsy, and Flickr.  Member blogs are streamed together on our site and on to our Facebook page.  Coming together in these ways means that there is a much greater chance of being found rather than swimming out there in cyberspace all alone.  

Now that TAFA has grown to a decent size, our Blogger platform has become unwieldy, making it hard to explore what our members really have to offer.  Aside from the gorgeous products that our members have for sale, we also have a gold mine of expertise and talent that needs to be accessed.  Many or our members offer workshops, have published books, give lectures, and several have fascinating global tours that focus on textiles.  We want our audience to have access to these gifts.  We also want to centralize our knowledge and have a place where members who need help can find mentors and guidance as they build their businesses.  During this first year it has become clear that although many of our members are tech savvy, others are completely overwhelmed with new technologies.  Our new website will provide tutorials or referrals to help them learn some of these skills.

TAFA has unique potential both for its members and for the community at large.  The new website offers tools that we cannot develop on our current platform and we hope that YOU will help us achieve this vision.


TAFA Members on Etsy promote themselves through treasuries.


TAFA's New Website
We have contracted with a talented tech team, Horizon Media Group, which can deliver our dream site.  The site will have a powerful search engine with image based results.  Each member will have their own landing page which they can edit at will.  Their presence on the web will be documented there and they will submit images which will show up as search results, linking back to their member profile.  There will be separate pages with streamed information for their member blogs and events.  A member only section will have tools and links for the members.  Users will be able to search through a menu of categories, by key words, location, and price range.  The site will integrate fully with social media sites.Who will benefit from the new site?

TAFA Members are the obvious first benefactors, but there are others.

Shoppers:  
Members and their products will be easily found.  TAFA aims to become 
THE destination for anyone interested in textiles and fiber art.  Those 
looking for handmade gifts, a new textile for their wall, commissioned 
work for churches and corporations, functional quilts, ethnic textiles, 
wearable art, toys, and other products made by our members will be able 
to find them.  Galleries and boutiques will find new suppliers.  Museums
 will find new artists and sources. 

Writers:  Book 
and blog authors who write about textiles and fiber art will have a 
place where they can come and readily find people and product to write 
about.

Other artists: 
 TAFA already is a source of inspiration for the fiber art community.  
But, perhaps many do not know that our members are also a great source 
for supplies.  We have members selling dyes, fabric, textile stamps, 
vintage textile remnants, ribbons, roving, yarns, along with many other 
tools and products that are phenomenal.  Many of them follow fair trade 
or green practices and combined, they are an invaluable resource. 

Students of fiber art: 
 Many TAFA members have been leaders withing their niche for years.  
They offer workshops and have authored books.  Site users will be able 
to see current projects, shows, blog updates, workshops, and watch 
videos made by or about our members.

Peer Organizations: 
 The textile and fiber art community has scores of organizations around 
the world.  Some are better known than others, but members will be able 
to add their affiliations as live links.  For example, TAFA currently 
has 46 SAQA
 members.  A TAFA member recently posted on our facebook group that she 
would be attending the conference and was wondering who else would be 
there.  On the new site, visitors will be able to click on an 
affiliation and all TAFA members will pop up.  Half of our members have 
shops on Etsy.  Click on Etsy and members pop up, all illustrated by 
visual icons. 

Travelers:  One
 TAFA member recently traveled to Paris from the US.  She looked up 
another TAFA member there and they had a great time!  Most of our TAFA 
members have studios or workshops open to the public.  We also have 
several galleries who are members.  Visitors will be able to search 
members by location and find people they would like to visit.  Isn't 
that the best way to learn about a new place you are visiting?  The TAFA
 Connection!



What We Need and What You GetOur Geek Team (said with affection) has estimated that our new site will cost $5,000.  We decided to raise part of that money through a public event which we just had in Paducah, Kentucky, our TAFA Market.

After two months of hard work, we put up a beautiful show with members sending products that represented all five continents.  It was beautiful!  Unfortunately, we experienced devastating floods in the area during the same period, the worst since 1937.  It rained and rained on our parade....  Fortunately, we had one good day which covered our expenses.  The whole experience was exhausting and disappointing on one level, as we did not reach our goals for the new website.  But, on another, our TAFA Market confirmed that our members represent the best within the textile field and that together, they can do great things!  It was quite the wonderful experience to see things in real life that had only been images online.

<p>Garments that are a reflection of SERPENTFIRE's artwork. Prints that are the essence of the symbols, the design sense and the entire orchestration behind Devany's creative presence. Patterns which pay homage to aboriginal and ancient cultures, as well as personal sigils representing spiritual transformation and personal growth. These garments are beautifully designed and tailored to not only fit the intention of the pattern, but to be down-to-earth and comfortable enough for everyday wear, not only special occasions. New designs are always being made, but 'old favourites' will also always be available, unlike other fashion lines whose collections <i>""are SO 2010""</i> and therefore left in the dust - classics and contemporaries alike will always be ready to make, because the designs are timeless. Custom designs will be welcome too, all you have to do is ask!</p>

<p>$10,000 to launch Saraphima. This breaks down to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$6,000 to materials - ordering/sampling fabrics, creating designs, renting equipment and studio space for assembly</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$2,000 to personelle - making sure our awesome team has what they need in order to manufacture Saraphima effectively</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$2,000 to marketing - photographers, locations, web-building, ads, shipping supplies</span></li>
</ul>
<div>If we are fortunate enough to surpass our $10,000 goal, well - we have some amazing surprises in store for you in terms of designs and collaborations with other artists - but you'll have to wait and see on that one! <p></p>
<p>In order to make this even more worthwhile for you we've created a vast array of interesting and engaging perks that you will receive if you donate. As you can see, a lot of them give you creative direction to help shape the designs to come, and many of them are one-of-a-kind originals. We want you to be a part of this beautiful experience, and if you contribute, you can! Even if you can't donate, you can still share this campaign with your friends and social networks - any little bit helps.</p>

A little more about us and this project:
S E R P E N T F I R E is…
Devany Wolfe - Owner, artist, designer, crazy cat lady
Mimi Langlois - Head of operations, social media mogul
Sean Gillespie - Pattern vectorizer, accountant, wearer of strange magic hats
And our team has a proposal for you.
Saraphima has been a long time coming. Almost as soon as S E R P E N T F I R E was launched in 2011, people began asking, 

""When are you going to put these designs on clothing?""
Messages like this kept pouring in over months and months until Devany began drawing up prototypes in photoshop and magic happened. It was meant to be! 





SERPENTFIRE is a collection of dreams that are shared by everyone involved in the community. It is a movement, a unified body of intention. Our fans had a vision and the execution of that has been so fruitful. Now it is time to provide that vision to our community and beyond - but we need your help to get it off the ground. 




(Above: the ""All Seeing"" print cut out maxi dress)

(Above: the ""Dimensions"" print cut out maxi dress)
So, what is our vision exactly? 


Garments that are a reflection of SERPENTFIRE's artwork. Prints that are the essence of the symbols, the design sense and the entire orchestration behind Devany's creative presence. Patterns which pay homage to aboriginal and ancient cultures, as well as personal sigils representing spiritual transformation and personal growth. These garments are beautifully designed and tailored to not only fit the intention of the pattern, but to be down-to-earth and comfortable enough for everyday wear, not only special occasions. New designs are always being made, but 'old favourites' will also always be available, unlike other fashion lines whose collections ""are SO 2010"" and therefore left in the dust - classics and contemporaries alike will always be ready to make, because the designs are timeless. Custom designs will be welcome too, all you have to do is ask!


(Above: the ""Amphitheatre"" print crop top)

(Above: the ""Eternal Life"" bandeau + harem pants)

Locally manufactured and assembled, the line will be made-to-order so that we can conserve materials and lessen our environmental impact as much as possible. 5% of the sales of Saraphima will go to a local feral cat rehabilitation/adoption service in Montreal called Pussy Patrol (check out their facebook page here). As the line develops and expands, we will be donating partial proceeds to other non-for-profit animal welfare organizations worldwide. 






It's not just about beauty, aesthetics, fashion - it is about wearable art with a cause. Supporting an independent artist and giving back to the community. It's a win-win situation. So here is what we need:
$10,000 to launch Saraphima. This breaks down to:

$2,000 to personelle - making sure our awesome team has what they need in order to manufacture Saraphima effectively
$2,000 to marketing - photographers, locations, web-building, ads, shipping supplies

If we are fortunate enough to surpass our $10,000 goal, well - we have some amazing surprises in store for you in terms of designs and collaborations with other artists - but you'll have to wait and see on that one!

<p>Our mission statement at Whitney Eve is to convey our unique and eclectic fashion sensibility into wearable works of art that inspire individuality and confidence to express oneself through style. One of our favorite ways to engage and enlighten the fashion industry and fans that have gotten us to where we are today is to produce fashion shows during New York Fashion Week, where we can showcase our artful designs.</p>
<p>This year, we would like to take unprecedented steps on our way to New York Fashion Week with the first fan-supported runway show on September 12, 2012, at Lincoln Center in New York, so I can share my art in a way that educates and involves my fans to be an integral part of the process.  Having come off a successful show at New York Fashion Week last season, the time has come to show again but in a way that has never been done before.  I want to provide my fans with a behind-the-scenes experience on how a runway show of this caliber is designed, developed, and executed.    </p>
<h3>Now, to the campaign:</h3>
<p>I have set a goal to raise $50,000 to help fund my Spring 2013 Fashion Show. That $50,000 will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fee for production company</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>DJ</li>
<li>Fee for the space</li>
<li>Stylist</li>
</ul><p>I’m really excited to be raising the money through crowd funding, and have some really cool perks for anyone that contributes to the campaign. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Christopher McElvogue, I am 21 years old and live in California. My brother Jack McElvogue (15), cousin Natalie Raven (16), and I have an amazing vision for a clothing company that we will fulfill.</p>

<ul><ul>
<li><span>Uniqueness, simplicity, quality, surrealism, and fine attention to detail, will be the cornerstones of our tee shirt line.</span></li>
<li><span>Uniqueness - we are going to push the boundaries of what a shirt pocket can say. There are infinite possibilities, and we will find the most awesome ones and make them a reality.</span></li>
<li><span>Simplicity - modeling on Apple’s philosophy that there is beauty in simplicity. A plain black or white tee shirt (Or hoodie, hat, etc.), an amazing pocket, a tag spreading our image. That’s it.</span></li>
<li><span>Quality - we won’t settle for less. If it means we make less money off each shirt in order for us to sell the tee with the best fit, fabric, and style, than we are willing to do that in the name of quality.</span></li>
<li><span>Surrealism - open their eyes. Wake people up. This is your chance to really make a difference, you have a stage and it is the pocket of a shirt. Let our designs blur the lines of reality and look awesome. </span></li>
<li><span>Fine Attention to Detail - thread that matches the color in the picture. Perfect line ups. Don’t forget that the little details matter.</span></li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $500 to cover the initial costs of launching our clothing line. We need funding to purchase sewing equipment, fabric, fabric treatments, printers and ink, packaging material, and to cover the costs of launching our online store.</p>
<p>Our initial batch of shirts after we raise enough funds will consists of 9 unique designs, 3 done by each of the 3 founders.</p>
<p>If you are one of the first 9 people to donate $25 or more you will recieve in return one of the 9 initial shirts. We are willing to take your input into account when designing the image for the custom pocket on the shirt.</p>

Here is a brief summary of our brands vision:

Uniqueness, simplicity, quality, surrealism, and fine attention to detail, will be the cornerstones of our tee shirt line.
Uniqueness - we are going to push the boundaries of what a shirt pocket can say. There are infinite possibilities, and we will find the most awesome ones and make them a reality.
Simplicity - modeling on Apple’s philosophy that there is beauty in simplicity. A plain black or white tee shirt (Or hoodie, hat, etc.), an amazing pocket, a tag spreading our image. That’s it.
Quality - we won’t settle for less. If it means we make less money off each shirt in order for us to sell the tee with the best fit, fabric, and style, than we are willing to do that in the name of quality.
Surrealism - open their eyes. Wake people up. This is your chance to really make a difference, you have a stage and it is the pocket of a shirt. Let our designs blur the lines of reality and look awesome. 
Fine Attention to Detail - thread that matches the color in the picture. Perfect line ups. Don’t forget that the little details matter.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">MiGlaz Design: Crafted &amp; Handmade Eyewear in Thailand</span></p></span></h3><p></p><p>We, MiGlaz Design are design &amp; development and manufacturing of eyeglasses frame company which is located in Thailand. Our nature is based in functional eyewear industry and we have launched the handmade collection in 2013.<br/></p><p>MiGlaz emerged as an innovator questioning
what users really seek from eyewear.
 In order to bring new products to customers,
we constantly engage in R&amp;D of products and processes. Our vision adheres
to the motto <b>“We craft new inspirations and challenge conventional limitations
in order to create products that authentically meet the unmet needs of eyewearers”</b></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our story</h3><p>The word of MiGlaz came out from ""My Glasses"" at the beginning of the project 5 years ago. It was just easy thinking of how to find the best quality eyeglasses for yourself?. We were seeking for our ""my best glasses"" which should be very strong, light, flexible, durable, easy-to-wear, minimal, and beautifully fit on your face. How to do so was another step of our company history. We researched tons of books, consulted with hundred of suppliers and tested with more than thousand materials until we realised that the way we were looking for was just too far away from our expectation. Then finally in 2012, we decided to establish our own design &amp; manufacturing studio and did set theories of making process up by ourselves. We believe in what we thought. We believe in the power of making better and the best quality product.</p><h3>Our Way &amp; Promise</h3><p>The way we are is just simply. We have been looking for the best for our eyewearer. Our passion has brought us to do something challenging the limitations and go beyond the edge of conventional eyewear. With these thoughts, we have created creativity and inspiration for the new way of design and our achievement is to go beyond the customer's expectation. </p><p>It is our designers’ inspiration and our engineers’ aspiration to bring a fine eyewear product to users. Our product is an integration of artistic elegance and engineering novelty. Even though it is impossible to claim as the best in a market, we are earnestly confident that we are the best for our customers.<br/></p><h3>Our Perfection Seeking</h3><p></p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><p>We do realize that perfection does not
exist but we do pursue it. Every piece has its origin and journey. Every detail
has its meaning and requires our attention. It is our job crafting your eyewear
and we truly strive for the best.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/217753/files/20131122234706-craft.jpg?1385192826"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Awards</h3><p>In 2013 We have been honoured for;</p><p></p><p></p><ul>

<p>It
is a single-piece seamless-design which is 40-70% lighter compared with
conventional eyeglass frames. With every part built on one material piece,
users are free from conventional misery caused by hinges or loosen screws.
Comparing with 2LINES, 1LINE have less flexibility but give users more feeling of minimal design.<br/></p>

</div></div>","MiGlaz Design: Crafted & Handmade Eyewear in ThailandWe, MiGlaz Design are design & development and manufacturing of eyeglasses frame company which is located in Thailand. Our nature is based in functional eyewear industry and we have launched the handmade collection in 2013.MiGlaz emerged as an innovator questioning
what users really seek from eyewear.
 In order to bring new products to customers,
we constantly engage in R&D of products and processes. Our vision adheres
to the motto “We craft new inspirations and challenge conventional limitations
in order to create products that authentically meet the unmet needs of eyewearers”Our storyThe word of MiGlaz came out from ""My Glasses"" at the beginning of the project 5 years ago. It was just easy thinking of how to find the best quality eyeglasses for yourself?. We were seeking for our ""my best glasses"" which should be very strong, light, flexible, durable, easy-to-wear, minimal, and beautifully fit on your face. How to do so was another step of our company history. We researched tons of books, consulted with hundred of suppliers and tested with more than thousand materials until we realised that the way we were looking for was just too far away from our expectation. Then finally in 2012, we decided to establish our own design & manufacturing studio and did set theories of making process up by ourselves. We believe in what we thought. We believe in the power of making better and the best quality product.Our Way & PromiseThe way we are is just simply. We have been looking for the best for our eyewearer. Our passion has brought us to do something challenging the limitations and go beyond the edge of conventional eyewear. With these thoughts, we have created creativity and inspiration for the new way of design and our achievement is to go beyond the customer's expectation. It is our designers’ inspiration and our engineers’ aspiration to bring a fine eyewear product to users. Our product is an integration of artistic elegance and engineering novelty. Even though it is impossible to claim as the best in a market, we are earnestly confident that we are the best for our customers.Our Perfection SeekingWe do realize that perfection does not
exist but we do pursue it. Every piece has its origin and journey. Every detail
has its meaning and requires our attention. It is our job crafting your eyewear
and we truly strive for the best.Our AwardsIn 2013 We have been honoured for;
Design Excellence Award 2013, Bangkok, Thailand
Good Design Award 2013, Tokyo, Japan
Currently entering the final stage of IF Product Design Award 2014, Hannover, Germany

<h2>Juni's Playground</h2>
<p>After 4 years studying in Parsons: The New School for Design in BFA Fashion Design, I can finally build my collection that I have to design, sew and execute for ONE YEAR for my Senior Thesis. The photo above is just a rough sketch of the collection.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt=""photo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://distilleryimage2.s3.amazonaws.com/b6f8055ad34411e18ddc22000a1cdc05_7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Juni Salgado</strong>, I’m twenty-two years old, and I’m pursuing my BFA in Fashion Design at <strong>Parsons: The New School For Design</strong>. I’d like to consider myself a creative person. I’m always thinking of new, fun ideas and drawing inspiration from the most fundamental of places. I am an ambitious individual who is truly dedicated to the work that he does. I was the winner of a contest with <strong>GAP inc</strong>, which led to an internship as a children’s accessories designer. My work has also been featured in, <em>“The Fashion Sketch Book”</em> by Bina Abling. When not working hard, I enjoy traveling, shopping, eating, and spending time with my best friends. My life is an adventure; my mind is a catalyst of fashion revolution, my work an expression of art and progress. Thank you for believing in me and I greatly appreciate you considering donating to my cause.</p>
<h2>My reason for this campaign:</h2>
<h2>ALSO NOTE:</h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;""><strong>ALL BENEFACTORS AND SUPPORT WILL BE MENTIONED IN MY LOOKBOOK &lt;3</strong></h2>
<p>I have to spend my whole SENIOR year designing and constructing this whole thesis collection. I have a lot of techniques and contruction abilities up my selves. I am an excellent sewer and tailor but that is not enough for my vision. I also need to dye my fabrics to exact colors and printing my patterns. So I need YOUR help to help me build my collection and help me pay the beaders, dyers, printers and my fabrics.</p>
<p>The goal is $3,000 but this will go on until next year. BUT it is better to have the supplies now so I can start building the collection that is why the end date is 45Days</p>
<p>Your <strong>donations</strong> will help me pay the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabric Dyers</li>
<li>Beaders</li>
<li>Fabrics (Organzas, tweeds, twills, etc.)</li>
<li>Leathers</li>
<li>Trims (beads, zippers, buttons, and all of the hardware)</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Photographer</li>
<li>Photoshoot (location, makeup, hair)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donations would not only help me build my dream but will also help my <strong>parents</strong> who have been paying for my education since I was born. It would help them out tremendously. I love them for supporting me and not questioning anything that I pay for my collection because they trust me and all I want in the end is for them to be proud of what i have accomplished and what their money has been paying for.</p>
<p>It would help me build my senior thesis. It is a collection that I have been thinking of doing for a very long time. It is my <strong>vision</strong> and my <strong>esthetic</strong>.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>ANY AMOUNT DONATED IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.</strong></h2>

</div></div>","Juni's Playground
After 4 years studying in Parsons: The New School for Design in BFA Fashion Design, I can finally build my collection that I have to design, sew and execute for ONE YEAR for my Senior Thesis. The photo above is just a rough sketch of the collection.

My name is Juni Salgado, I’m twenty-two years old, and I’m pursuing my BFA in Fashion Design at Parsons: The New School For Design. I’d like to consider myself a creative person. I’m always thinking of new, fun ideas and drawing inspiration from the most fundamental of places. I am an ambitious individual who is truly dedicated to the work that he does. I was the winner of a contest with GAP inc, which led to an internship as a children’s accessories designer. My work has also been featured in, “The Fashion Sketch Book” by Bina Abling. When not working hard, I enjoy traveling, shopping, eating, and spending time with my best friends. My life is an adventure; my mind is a catalyst of fashion revolution, my work an expression of art and progress. Thank you for believing in me and I greatly appreciate you considering donating to my cause.
My reason for this campaign:
ALSO NOTE:
ALL BENEFACTORS AND SUPPORT WILL BE MENTIONED IN MY LOOKBOOK <3
I have to spend my whole SENIOR year designing and constructing this whole thesis collection. I have a lot of techniques and contruction abilities up my selves. I am an excellent sewer and tailor but that is not enough for my vision. I also need to dye my fabrics to exact colors and printing my patterns. So I need YOUR help to help me build my collection and help me pay the beaders, dyers, printers and my fabrics.
The goal is $3,000 but this will go on until next year. BUT it is better to have the supplies now so I can start building the collection that is why the end date is 45Days
Your donations will help me pay the following:

Fabric Dyers
Beaders
Fabrics (Organzas, tweeds, twills, etc.)
Leathers
Trims (beads, zippers, buttons, and all of the hardware)
Models
Photographer
Photoshoot (location, makeup, hair)

Your donations would not only help me build my dream but will also help my parents who have been paying for my education since I was born. It would help them out tremendously. I love them for supporting me and not questioning anything that I pay for my collection because they trust me and all I want in the end is for them to be proud of what i have accomplished and what their money has been paying for.
It would help me build my senior thesis. It is a collection that I have been thinking of doing for a very long time. It is my vision and my esthetic.
ANY AMOUNT DONATED IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.
 

Supply Information:
New York City is home to the very famous Fashion District where I am going to get all my supplies and what I need. Some information about the stores and what I am getting in specific stores:
Fabric Stores include Paron Fabrics, Mood Fabrics, Elegant Fabrics and B&J
Hardware Stores include M&J Trim Stores and Pacific Trims

The Thesis:
My whole thesis collection will speak greatly of who and what I am as a Designer. I have a specific vision that I want to show the world my creativity and art. My clothes are Women's RTW (Ready-to-wear) for Spring/Summer 2014. Inspired by a child's Playground, the collection is going to be fun, contemporary and innovative! Here is just some fun key points to the fun collection:

<p>From crafts to comedy sketches, I've been a creator since I was 7 years old.  I began my career in the entertainment industry, performing with the Los Angeles Groundling's Improv Theater and writing skits for programs such as Saturday Night Live (Schweddy Balls, anyone?).  </p>
<p>In 1999, I transitioned from working with comedians to working with moms (probably the only group more skilled at entertaining a rowdy crowd!) founding timi &amp; leslie, the company that introduced the ""stylish diaper bag for moms"" to the masses.  </p>
<p>My designs at timi &amp; leslie were sold to over 500 stores nationwide and internationally.  I developed a celebrity clientele of women such as Jessica Alba, Pink, Annette Bening and Hillary Swank, and was featured all over the media.</p>
<p>Today I'm excited to be launching Newlie, and create an amazing Mom Community to help me build this product company and lifestyle destination.</p>

for <span>years. We’ve shared
a lot of experiences, traveled and lived together in a lot of different
countries. We’ve always known that we wanted to unite our vision of beauty and create
something together. The idea of making unique handmade jewelry was born while we were both living in London. We were inspired by the street fashion of chic Londoners and funky style
of young rebels. A retrospective of japanese artist
Yayoi Kusama</span> left a great impression on us – now we knew exactly what we
wanted to do! We decided to unite our passions for craft, art and
fashion to create extravagant statement pieces of jewelry. Jewelry and
accessories have always captured our attention – <span>a

We researched the market and tested our creations by personally wearing them. When it came to the point when we had to give a name to our brand, the decision was obvious - YAYOI, after the artist that inspired it...<br/></p><p></p>
<p>Our pilot collection was greeted with compliments, local
magazines and bloggers wrote positive reviews and our jewelry was soon

natural states. Water is the beginning of everything and the
first of all elements because of its mastery over them. Water therefore is our main source of inspiration in ELEMENT ONE. It changes the
states forming a variety of textures. Water’s
mysterious life giving qualities are equated with the feminine aspects of
creation. By applying natural materials such as clear quartz and sea
corals and using a deep melancholic color
spectrum, we have attempted to deliver a story
of the transformation of the element. Each piece reflects a different state of
water. It freezes and forms a translucent ice on the surface whilst being in motion in the dark deep depths.

<p><b>MATERIALS</b></p>
<p>We use high quality materials and
semi-precious stones that are costly. In order to receive a wholesale discount
we need to place a large order. We’ve found material suppliers that meet
all our requirements. A part of the money pledged will cover the material order to make the
first production run of our new collection.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PACKAGING</b></p>
<p>The first thing customers
will notice is our packaging. We want to create smartly branded boxes that is attractive and
compliments our unique jewelry.</p>
<p>The problem is that most packaging suppliers require large
quantity orders. Luckily we’ve been able to find a
local packaging manufacturer that is ready to produce custom made boxes for our
necklaces and is open to collaborating on quantities and prices.</p>
<p>Together with the company’s friendly
staff we have developed the ultimate box prototype that will fit all of the
necklaces. We’ve agreed to divide the packaging production to several
stages and now we are ready to receive the first
portion of our handcrafted boxes.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/355437/files/20140207075855-packaging.jpg?1391788735"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Advantages of our new packaging:</b></span><br/></p>

<p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The main challenge to successfully
accomplishing the project goal is how to market and publicize the brand. We are
currently updating social networks and emailing bloggers in order to expand the
brand’s presence. The other challenge is ensuring deliveries are on time. We
hope that everything will go according to plan. However if we feel we are not coping on our own we will seek
additional help to complete the orders on time. We also have all our suppliers arranged to minimize the risk of
not getting the supplies we need. We are confident we can deliver all the
rewards to the expected quality and on time!</p>

Hi Indiegogo!

the right ➤➤➤YAYOI jewelry:
Statement designer jewelry made with premium quality materials and craftsmanship. YAYOI necklaces and bracelets are individually
handcrafted with high quality
materials and semi-precious stones. Our unique jewelry
is for people ready to make a
statement and not afraid to
experiment.
We are Lidia and Jane and we’ve been friends
for years. We’ve shared
a lot of experiences, traveled and lived together in a lot of different
countries. We’ve always known that we wanted to unite our vision of beauty and create
something together. The idea of making unique handmade jewelry was born while we were both living in London. We were inspired by the street fashion of chic Londoners and funky style
of young rebels. A retrospective of japanese artist
Yayoi Kusama left a great impression on us – now we knew exactly what we
wanted to do! We decided to unite our passions for craft, art and
fashion to create extravagant statement pieces of jewelry. Jewelry and
accessories have always captured our attention – a
small accent transforming a whole outfit to make you look special.We moved back to Latvia and spent months designing, prototyping and creating samples. We researched the market and tested our creations by personally wearing them. When it came to the point when we had to give a name to our brand, the decision was obvious - YAYOI, after the artist that inspired it...
Our pilot collection was greeted with compliments, local
magazines and bloggers wrote positive reviews and our jewelry was soon
available on the shelves of the best Latvian concept stores.
We took into account
all the critiques and suggestions to create the samples
for our second collection. We have plans to conquer the European market and become a recognizable brand not only in Latvia, but all over the world. This is the part where
we need your help!

ELEMENT
ONE collectionThe concept of our new collection is water and its different
natural states. Water is the beginning of everything and the
first of all elements because of its mastery over them. Water therefore is our main source of inspiration in ELEMENT ONE. It changes the
states forming a variety of textures. Water’s
mysterious life giving qualities are equated with the feminine aspects of
creation. By applying natural materials such as clear quartz and sea
corals and using a deep melancholic color
spectrum, we have attempted to deliver a story
of the transformation of the element. Each piece reflects a different state of
water. It freezes and forms a translucent ice on the surface whilst being in motion in the dark deep depths.
Crystallizes and paints all in white. Water is nature's greatest
artistic expression and this in turn has inspired us in the designs of the
Element One collection.To see all the pieces from ELEMENT ONE collection please visit our webpage:▶ ▶ ▶  www.yayoi.eu  ◀ ◀ ◀Our new collection is now ready for the first production
launch. Your help will bring this vision to life and fund the first production
run of the ELEMENT ONE collection. In order to bring this
project to life we need your support:


To place a bulk order for the materials.


To pay for the first portion of custom made packaging.

<h3><span style=""color: #660066;"">Our Story</span></h3>
<p>How do you balance everything that life throws at you? This is a question that many people struggle with including me. And I believe that the answer lies in believing in what you do and truly knowing who you are and what is important to you.</p>
<p>I've spent years trying to figure out how to bring something that I love together with something that has a positive impact on my family, my community and ultimately, the world. I realize that this is an ambitious goal but I also know that IT IS POSSIBLE. When life happens, we are forced to evaluate what is really important. And I know what’s really important: good health, faith, family, friends – and a really good pair of shoes to help you get through it all.</p>
<p>Pulling all of those things together, I’ve designed Bella Modi (patent pending). This product is a shoe system that provides a comfortable shoe base and multiple straps/components that allow for an infinite number of design variations. It will change the way women think about shoes. It will give them the tools to feel creative, beautiful, and empowered.</p>

At Crosskix, we are VERY passionate about helping those that need assistance and giving back to the world. Yes, this is a huge undertaking but..


WE CAN DO IT...ONE SHOE AT A TIME!







Crosskix are produced in MENS sizes. So... 
When selecting your size, submit the MENS size that is on same row. For Example: if you wear a womens size 7, you would submit a size 5.
Also, we will provide a chart that compares other brands with Crosskix to assist in selecting the correct size the first time around!

<br/><br/>Why is F2C Essential for San Diego?

<b>Many men become fathers without ever having the opportunity to learn how to parent.</b><br/><br/>
<li>This can frequently be attributed to men having absent, distant, or abusive fathers. However, these men often want to break the cycle.</li>
<li>Many men return from war or incarceration and are expected to immediately fall back into the role of being dad, even though they are dealing with many complex personal issues.</li>
<li>Parenting is hard, and F2C is here to provide the necessary support, compassion, and education for fathers who are ready to take the next step toward being the best version of themselves.</li>

Many men become fathers without ever having the opportunity to learn how to parent.
This can frequently be attributed to men having absent, distant, or abusive fathers. However, these men often want to break the cycle.
Many men return from war or incarceration and are expected to immediately fall back into the role of being dad, even though they are dealing with many complex personal issues.
Parenting is hard, and F2C is here to provide the necessary support, compassion, and education for fathers who are ready to take the next step toward being the best version of themselves.



Who Attends?

A diverse population of men between 21 and 67 years old.They are referred by:

Word of Mouth
Religious and Nonprofit Organizations
Wives
Family courts, Probation officers, and Counselors

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Celestine Katongole was born in a remote African village in his grand-mother’s garden on a cold rainy night with little to no chances of survival. Miraculously, this once sickly and malnourished little boy has grown into a genius &amp; cultured designer who against insurmountable odds, is leading a movement that will extend freedom to boys &amp; girls with similar stories like his.</p>
<p>After losing his father at the tender age of 6, everything that could possibly go wrong for this young lad, his uneducated mother, and four siblings went wrong. As Celestine vividly recollects, “school was regularly missed because we simply couldn’t afford it, a meal a day was a miracle, and exploitation for labor was inevitable.” </p>
<p>Refusing to be a victim, this young designer focused on developing invaluable qualities: character, perseverance, and a terrific work ethic. Fueled by his childhood pain, Celestine discovered his life’s mission; to use luxury fashion as a vehicle that will bring freedom, hope, and restoration to exploited children &amp; communities around the world. To kill Goliath, all little David had was a stone, Celestine's ingenuity in designing, passion for justice, and the support of you the American people will help us slay this evil giant, ""modern-day slavery.""</p>
<p>This once hopeless child is en route to revolutionizing the way we consume fashion, look at and think of the individuals whose labor goes into its manufacturing. Most importantly, this former orphan boy is challenging us all to demand transparency from the media, entertainment, fashion, agriculture, mining, transport, political, and hospitality industries as this is the only way human trafficking will be rooted off the face of the planet. While all this sounds great, it will all end in utter failure if YOU don’t support our project. Please back our vision and help us bring freedom to the enslaved, and remind kids like Celestine that no matter where you come from, in America you will be given a chance to make a contribution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601570265/pcagp3pcliueuscwyeip.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601475490/arnuwp5qtpoxp3gzymuf.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><p>With your support, Celestine will go from a no name brand, to becoming the new standard of excellence. Our founding philosophy is simple, “life over quick profits,” and this is got to become the philosophy of every serious brand. By 2024, all our products will be made exclusively in the United States, as this will guarantee our organization 100 percent control over the supply chain while simultaneously creating jobs for Americans of all backgrounds. </p></div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Join the Fight</span></h3>
<p>Part of being leaders in the fight against slavery and exploitation is recognizing a simple truth that in dealing with such sophisticated evil, it is virtually impossible and quite honestly naive for any single organization to claim knowledge of the best pathway to total freedom. For this reason, we invite you to join our team as an ambassador by passionately sharing our story with at least ten people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why what you consume matters</h3>
<p>It’s important to remember that one of the main reasons the trading of humans for labor, organs, and sex has prevailed for generations is because decent people just like you and I continue to give a deaf ear to the wails of the victims. If we only paused and asked ourselves a simple question before every purchase, what is the TRUE HUMAN COST on that $5 hoodie that my favorite brand or celebrity just advertised? The answer would challenge us to alter our consumption habits. Today, the UN estimates that there are over 50 million men, women, and children enslaved for labor, sex, and organs.

<h3>Why fight human trafficking?</h3>
<p>For centuries, fashion, hospitality, media, mining, agriculture, automotive, and virtually every single industry in the world has prized quick unethical profits over human life &amp; the environment. Sadly, we, the general population empowered them by taking the “bait” of always accepting their heavily discounted but low quality, mass-produced merchandise. Celestine was born to put things back in order; Human life and sustainability above heavy discounts and quick profits. We believe that sustainable manufacturing &amp; consumption, the value for human life, plus family &amp; community empowerment are the most viable approaches to permanently stop human trafficking &amp; exploitation.</p>
</div></div>","Check our Website: www.celestinewatch.com


Our Story
Celestine Katongole was born in a remote African village in his grand-mother’s garden on a cold rainy night with little to no chances of survival. Miraculously, this once sickly and malnourished little boy has grown into a genius & cultured designer who against insurmountable odds, is leading a movement that will extend freedom to boys & girls with similar stories like his.
After losing his father at the tender age of 6, everything that could possibly go wrong for this young lad, his uneducated mother, and four siblings went wrong. As Celestine vividly recollects, “school was regularly missed because we simply couldn’t afford it, a meal a day was a miracle, and exploitation for labor was inevitable.” 
Refusing to be a victim, this young designer focused on developing invaluable qualities: character, perseverance, and a terrific work ethic. Fueled by his childhood pain, Celestine discovered his life’s mission; to use luxury fashion as a vehicle that will bring freedom, hope, and restoration to exploited children & communities around the world. To kill Goliath, all little David had was a stone, Celestine's ingenuity in designing, passion for justice, and the support of you the American people will help us slay this evil giant, ""modern-day slavery.""
This once hopeless child is en route to revolutionizing the way we consume fashion, look at and think of the individuals whose labor goes into its manufacturing. Most importantly, this former orphan boy is challenging us all to demand transparency from the media, entertainment, fashion, agriculture, mining, transport, political, and hospitality industries as this is the only way human trafficking will be rooted off the face of the planet. While all this sounds great, it will all end in utter failure if YOU don’t support our project. Please back our vision and help us bring freedom to the enslaved, and remind kids like Celestine that no matter where you come from, in America you will be given a chance to make a contribution.


With your support, Celestine will go from a no name brand, to becoming the new standard of excellence. Our founding philosophy is simple, “life over quick profits,” and this is got to become the philosophy of every serious brand. By 2024, all our products will be made exclusively in the United States, as this will guarantee our organization 100 percent control over the supply chain while simultaneously creating jobs for Americans of all backgrounds. 
Join the Fight
Part of being leaders in the fight against slavery and exploitation is recognizing a simple truth that in dealing with such sophisticated evil, it is virtually impossible and quite honestly naive for any single organization to claim knowledge of the best pathway to total freedom. For this reason, we invite you to join our team as an ambassador by passionately sharing our story with at least ten people.

Why what you consume matters
It’s important to remember that one of the main reasons the trading of humans for labor, organs, and sex has prevailed for generations is because decent people just like you and I continue to give a deaf ear to the wails of the victims. If we only paused and asked ourselves a simple question before every purchase, what is the TRUE HUMAN COST on that $5 hoodie that my favorite brand or celebrity just advertised? The answer would challenge us to alter our consumption habits. Today, the UN estimates that there are over 50 million men, women, and children enslaved for labor, sex, and organs. Our mission is to lead the movement that will change these statistics and we are inviting you to fight alongside us, will you join?

<p>Our 100 % Certified Organic Cotton Pre-shrunk Canvas is produced through sustainable fabrication methods and materials.

Introducing Hidden Time 
In 2014 we released our first watch, the concentric disc Series 000, and were funded within 72 hours. In 2016, we launched the space-obsessed Series K452, and were funded within 24 hours.Now, we’re back on Indiegogo to introduce our first international project, The Trio of Time, and release our third watch, Hidden Time.Video by FuturismHidden Time in three editionsBlack watch + midnight strapsRose gold watch + coffee strapsWhite watch + snow straps The Trio of Time The Trio of Time (TTT) is our very first experimental world tour to explore how international creativity reinterprets the perception of time. We will collaborate with a local designer in three different cities around the world to create a timepiece together, which will be released here on Kickstarter. Each watch will feature a unique design that represents the designer’s view on passing time. And with each watch we will share our experience with the Kickstarter community; in fact, backers of each campaign will be able to vote on our next destination.Hidden Time is the first edition of TTT The first TTT collaboration: Hong Kong to SeoulOur TTT journey begins in Seoul, Korea.Seoul is a prominent design city in Asia. With a rich history and rapid growth rate, the city features abundant resources for art and design. Many talented designers have launched studios in the city, contributing to both the local industry and the world at large.We met with industrial designer Jiwoong Jung, an artist as fascinated by time as we are. Jung’s product design work has been featured in the 2012 and 2014 Maison & Objet Paris exhibition, among others, and in international design publications. Beautiful architecture in Seoul A few of Jiwoong Jung's beautiful products Together, we are releasing Hidden Time Early designs of Hidden Time The watch's beautiful gradient makes time disappear as it passes by Jiwoong Jung working on our first collaboration The rose gold edition offers a slight variation on gradient colors Hidden Time, the vanishing timepieceHidden Time's watch face features a beautiful gradient display under a crystal covering where numbers are firmly printed. As hours pass, the hour gradient disc rotates and “hidden time” is revealed.The watch helps you focus on time in the moment, using a modern interpretation of the camouflage effect to hide the passing hours.“My research on how to naturally pass time began with how hiding occurs in nature, which led me to one of the best known examples––the chameleon’s protective color. Their defense mechanism is a kind of optical illusion, but a simple and effective way to have two things together naturally when superimposed.” –Jiwoong JungHidden Time in black A beautiful light violet gradient compliments the rose gold edition Time disappearing as hours pass byA striking balance between lines and gradientsThe powerful watch is thin and lightweight  Watch time pass in a new way

There is enough scientific evidence to prove that even the most basic, ordinary human activities are major contributors to climate change. It is time we join forces and contribute to global efforts for mitigating the effects of this man-made disaster.To lead this transformation, we've decided to start with changing the way we think about one of our most basic human requirements, clothing. Creating ecologically responsible, durable yet stylish clothing and accessories, we want to ensure that the integration of the fight into our daily lives is seamless.In this battle to save our planet we stand with indigenous Himalayan communities who are at the front line taking the challenge head on. Our initial strategy is to create products using only natural material, mainly harvest from the foothills of the Himalayas. We, at Aslee, believe that with the consumption of these products, these communities can move towards multi-specie tree-based agriculture. This means more plant based farming, leading to afforestation, soil conservation and empowerment of the local community.In 2015 the country was devastated by one of the biggest earthquakes to have stuck humanity in the Himalayan region. It is also regularly affected by flash floods, landslides and unpredictable weather conditions. But the sheer resilience and innovation of Nepal's indigenous communities are an inspiration for us to create products that are sustainable, eco-friendly and contribute to the economic growth of the local population.We believe that environmentally friendly fabrics will play a major part in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by United Nations and will strengthen the global response against climate change. The clothing industry is one of the largest polluters in the world and our hope is to change the way we think about this industry.We understand that action is essential and the only way to incorporate it into our everyday lives is if it doesn't come at the cost of compromising on individual style and current trends. So, we're working to create products that are super stylish sustainable and durable.We are passionate about our work also because the fabrics we have used have some epic properties! Like the wild Himalayan hemp, that is super eco-friendly compared to most other materials. It has got properties that make it even better than organic cotton and linen. We’ve also worked with 'Allo' or Himalayan nettle. It is hand harvested only by indigenous mountain communities of Nepal. It grows in the wild and is hand-spun by rural women to create a fabric which is 100% natural and biodegradable. The hemp plant has been around in Nepal and India for centuries. Historically, people have have used it for various purposes. Communities nestled deep in the heart of the Himalayan mountains have developed techniques to extract oil, food (hemp seeds are also known as “superfood”), stock feed, medicines and textile to make clothes, shoes and bags from this incredible plant.  There are many different types of hemp plants. Wild hemp, also called industrial hemp, refers to the non-psychoactive (less than 1% THC) variety of Cannabis Sativa L.  Both hemp and marijuana come from the same cannabis species, but are genetically distinct and further distinguished by use and cultivation method.Here’s what makes the fabric from hemp truly one of a kind –
It requires 50% less water than cotton to grow.
It is naturally anti-microbial.
It is more breathable than cotton and linen.
It blocks out 50% more ultra violet rays than cotton. Even when only 50% hemp is used in a textile product, it is still able to offer the same level of UV blockage.  
It grows faster than other similar plants, so has a higher yield for lesser effort.
It is naturally resistant to fungus and insects, so does not require any pesticides.
It restrains or suppresses weed growth.

It is sustainable, comfortable and super stylish. The miracle Himalayan plant called Himalayan nettle (Girardinia Diversifolia), also known as Allo or Nilgiri nettle; is a perennial plant which grows wild throughout the moist mountainous regions of Nepal and India. It has several qualities of great interest to fabric and clothing manufacturing industry. 
The length of the fabric from Himalayan nettle is greater than any other plant fiber known to man.
The long fiber increases spinning options and hence fabric possibilities.
The fabric stays cool in the summer and warm in the winter due to its hollow core.
It is antimicrobial and antibacterial.
It is naturally a fire retardant.
The indigenous communities have incorporated sustainable harvesting and processing techniques in their Himalayan nettle production chain. Today, they have become experts at nettle fiber production and are developing all natural mufflers, stoles, purses, bags, home accessories and even incorporating it in to everyday apparel.The plant also combats the effects of climate change by holding soil in place thus preventing landslides and erosion.

 


Softening process: The fiber is separated from the bark by hand beating and putting the plant in clean river water for days. In order to make the fiber soft, it is further washed with ash.Drop spindle: A top-like tool is used to turn soft fiber into usable yarn in a dance like motion that twists and spins the fiber.Charkha or spinning wheel: Cleaned and carded fiber is spun by skilled indigenous women, turning raw fiber balls into softer yarn by using hand operated charkha or spinning wheel.Handloom: The threads from the yarn are loaded lengthwise on the loom. Each thread is first passed through an eyelet and then a comb. The artisans weave a wider and more uniform fabric. This process requires a unique set of skills and focus which is acquired after many years of textile manufacturing.The fabric is then brought to a small scale industrial facility, where it is stone washed to make it softer and then biodegradable water based dyes are used to color it.All the cutting, sewing and assembly is done in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur through small local facilities. More than 95% of the employees working in these establishments are women.Our goal is to provide as much information about the people, processes, materials and how our products can create an impact, so our consumers have confidence in their purchase. In order create more transparency in our supply chain, we offer exclusive Nepal tours - where you can directly meet the artisans, textile developers and inspiring rural women of Nepal who together make the backbone of our company and the fight against climate change.Other than experiencing this amazing farm to fabric journey, our itinerary will also include any of the three following activities –
Momo making classes which are conducted by local ‘Master Chefs’ of Kathmandu.
Newari dinner night with local dance performances.
A day trek to Kopan Monastery.
Himalayan mountain flight (Experience the stunning views of Mt. Everest).
Walking tour of the ancient city of Bhaktapur.
Bungee jumping from a bridge more than 160 m over a mountain gorge.
And if you want to experience the night life of Kathmandu, we can also arrange a pub crawl in the party district Thamel where you can experience some incredible live music and a mini rock concert.   
These will be small group tours of the Kathmandu valley and we plan to conduct only two tours for the year of 2018. If this itinerary excites you please sign up early because these tours are exclusive therefore need longer preparation time. Our tours will start from Tribhuvan International Airport. Please go to perks for further details. TIME LINEFor over 18 months we have been building relationships with artisans and Nepalese green entrepreneurs. During this process, we've introduced a variety of quality control measures and organizational techniques. These helped keep quality high and produce items that have the consistency required for an international market. Since these items are still made by hand, variations will be a small part of the products. Additionally, Kathmandu valley comes in the 'high' risk earthquake zone, therefore our supply chain is vulnerable to these unavoidable natural circumstances. Nepal is also a political charged country and has recently adopted a federal democracy, often there are bandhs or nationwide strikes. This unstable political situations leads to complete shutdown of transportation and manufacturing units. We have setup a robust communication system and our team regularly visits Kathmandu in order further strengthen the relations we have developed in last couple of years.",30.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>While we're doing a lot of the work ourselves, obviously we have to rely on others (manufacture, shipping) to provide their end. We're confident that these parts will be no problem, as we're talking to established companies here. We will also go to China ourselves to oversee production, and Shawn has worked with the factory we wish to use before, so communication between us and the factory will not be an issue. But talking to other people who have run Indiegogo, there is always something that comes up, be it customs, shipping, the manufacturing not being up to scratch or any other of the many things that can delay the process. We will do our best, and hope to deliver on time, and whatever happens we will keep you updated every step along the way.</p>
<p>We will definitely deliver a great product, and hope to do so on time!</p>
<p>Thanks from the whole team :)</p>

How can I choose the color and the style?
We'll send e-mail to contact with you for the information of your desired color/style.







Risks and challenges
While we're doing a lot of the work ourselves, obviously we have to rely on others (manufacture, shipping) to provide their end. We're confident that these parts will be no problem, as we're talking to established companies here. We will also go to China ourselves to oversee production, and Shawn has worked with the factory we wish to use before, so communication between us and the factory will not be an issue. But talking to other people who have run Indiegogo, there is always something that comes up, be it customs, shipping, the manufacturing not being up to scratch or any other of the many things that can delay the process. We will do our best, and hope to deliver on time, and whatever happens we will keep you updated every step along the way.
We will definitely deliver a great product, and hope to do so on time!
Thanks from the whole team :)

<h3>The Experience We are Creating. </h3>
<p><strong>SophistiGeek has ALWAYS operated with a few core beliefs. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ONE.</strong> Create fabulous &amp; geeky products that are mostly female-centric unlike the other major geeky brands out there that lean heavily toward men. </li>
<li>
<strong>TWO.</strong> Design really great products inspired by fandoms and cult classics that aren't quite as main stream as what other companies offer. </li>
<li>
<strong>THREE.</strong> Keep our exclusively designed &amp; manufactured products affordable for the average geek. </li>
<li>
<strong>FOUR.</strong> Be unique. Be different. Totally unlike the other guys. Think outside the box with what products and what designs we create and bring to our customers. </li>
<li>
<strong>FIVE.</strong> Always be in touch personally with our customer base and create unique shopping experiences for them, even if it means a lot more work on our side. </li>
</ul>
<p>Of all of those core beliefs, the one that has been the most fun and fulfilling is number FIVE. We've done tons of live chats, creating thriving VIP Groups to mingle with our customer base, and so much more. Last year we began doing LIVE sales via Facebook and they became wildly popular. THIS year we wanted to kick our live sales up a notch and make them even MORE personalized for our customers. </p>
<p><strong>In April of 2018</strong> we launched our ""Live Shopping Experience"" right from our teeny tiny, not-very-pretty warehouse. (really, it's more of a glorified storage unit) We were BLOWN AWAY by the response. You can see one of the very first &amp; rough live shopping experience videos<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LitCube/videos/1073440586127330/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> HERE</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>There isn't a single other brand or retailer<i> IN THE WORLD</i> doing what we're doing. </strong></p>
<p>However, one of the things that was evident right away was that there was no real way we could SCALE what we were doing. Only one person could do the live sale at a time and they had to be IN our warehouse. As the owner of the company, I also couldn't do it all myself since I'm busy running so many other aspects of the business. Not only that, BUT not everyone could enjoy the LIVE Experience because we couldn't schedule them to fit everyone's schedules AND Facebook is notorious for being spotty and cranky with cutting off comments, etc., if it perceives the ""live shopper"" to be commenting too many times in a thread or in a row. We were running into that more and more as we did the shopping days. </p>
<p>SO, I did some out of the box thinking, and one night while I was working late in the warehouse after a live sale, it HIT me like a ton of bricks! Instead of trying to fit MORE people into a schedule and relying on a very unreliable platform and keeping our ""experience"" not quite as nice as I would have preferred because of our ugly, cramped space... why not kick the Live Shopping Experience UP A FREAKING NOTCH and make it available permanently via our website?

<div>
<p>Our goal is to develop a functional and
practical aid for everyday use.</p>
<p>The practical size of the Tab is ideal
to put in your trouser pocket. It’s great for every occasion.
Whether you’re in a restaurant, working out or just for everyday

<p>In this day and age with a high germ
contamination rate it is easy to become a victim of illness, which is
why it is so important to purify our hands to reduce the possibility
of infection. That is why we developed a special cleaning liquid to
intensify the Tabs cleaning ability.

<p>There are currently three different

<h3>Why we need your support?</h3>
<div></div>
<p>We have now
completed the development of our Tabs and fragrance’s. However,
since we do not yet have the production capacity we need to begin by
creating the infrastructure for our production. We need to get
several mixing tanks, agitators, scales and filling stations. The second
point is the cost for advertising and promoting products. We will use
a variety of media to promote our products. </p>
<p>We need your help
to overcome these hurdles, so that we can successfully enter the
market.</p>
<div></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What's in the future?</h3>
<div>
<p>After the
successful implementation of production and marketing, we would like
to offer our customers the possibility to design their own
Tab-dispenser. We would then produce them with our 3D printers. We
are planning to expand our fragrance collection. Thereby not only
changing the scent but also the formula to obtain optimum cleaning
results for various uses.</p>
</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks and other ways to help!</h3>
<div></div>
<p>To minimize the
risk, we already pre-produced all of the products that we offer as
perks; therefore we can guarantee that you will receive your perk. 
</p>
<p>We don’t offer
any perks that you are interested in but you would still like to
help?</p>
<p>Then you can help
by simply spreading information about our products. We also still
need distributors all over the world. You handle goods and work in
the catering business and would like to purchase our products?  Then
please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us.</p>

Medium. Large.</p><div align=""justify"">With all the body shapes in the world, do you really think that the mass produced sizes that stores provide are ever going to make you look your best? Buying clothing in store is like rolling the dice every time, with most choices being a poor fit. Most men don’t even know what a great fit for them looks like, or even feels like. <p> </p>
<p>It’s true, there are plenty of great tailors out there. If you have the patience and the time and the money, then sure, this could be a good option for you. But what if you’re a normal guy who wants to look his best? It’s time for a better, more balanced solution.</p>
</div><div align=""center""><b>A Solution Called UKYS</b></div><div align=""justify"">
<p>The UKYS app has been developed to solve the problem of men not being able to easily access fitted clothing. The UKYS app uses your iPhone/iPad camera to measure your body within minutes, taking a long and costly tailor measuring process and making it quick, easy and completely free.</p>
<p>Once the app has your measurements, every quality UKYS shirt that you order will be custom fitted for your body.</p>
<p>We are excited to be able to share our ambitions with the INDIEGOGO community. We need your support in order to produce the first run of <a href=""http://www.ukys.com/custom-dress-shirts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">custom shirts</a>, measured using the UKYS app. You’re not just investing in a sharp, custom shirt; you’re also making it possible for men everywhere to finally be able to dress their best.</p>
<p>It’s time for all men to experience what fitted clothing does for your outward appearance and your inner confidence. </p>

</div></div>","The ProblemSmall. Medium. Large.With all the body shapes in the world, do you really think that the mass produced sizes that stores provide are ever going to make you look your best? Buying clothing in store is like rolling the dice every time, with most choices being a poor fit. Most men don’t even know what a great fit for them looks like, or even feels like.  
It’s true, there are plenty of great tailors out there. If you have the patience and the time and the money, then sure, this could be a good option for you. But what if you’re a normal guy who wants to look his best? It’s time for a better, more balanced solution.
A Solution Called UKYS
The UKYS app has been developed to solve the problem of men not being able to easily access fitted clothing. The UKYS app uses your iPhone/iPad camera to measure your body within minutes, taking a long and costly tailor measuring process and making it quick, easy and completely free.
Once the app has your measurements, every quality UKYS shirt that you order will be custom fitted for your body.
We are excited to be able to share our ambitions with the INDIEGOGO community. We need your support in order to produce the first run of custom shirts, measured using the UKYS app. You’re not just investing in a sharp, custom shirt; you’re also making it possible for men everywhere to finally be able to dress their best.
It’s time for all men to experience what fitted clothing does for your outward appearance and your inner confidence. 
 We use only 100% finely cotton fabrics. We're proud of the quality of our shirts. All fabrics are Oeko-Tex Certification obtained and long-term color consistency guaranteed. Almost our shirts are from 80's 2-ply, which is about the best you can get. 
Because we automate the expensive measurement process and sell directly to consumers from our factory, we're able to pass on those savings to the consumer and offer an amazing value. Typically, custom shirts of similar quality start at $130 and above.
Create your own personalized shirt for a custom look, fit, and feel.

*Not all options shown

At the heart of the UKYS app is LIM, a technology developed by our in-house engineering team to perfectly capture the measurements a tailor would make, but from your phone instead of a costly visit to the tailor.
 LIM has been developed and refined over the course of a year. Hundreds of prototypes were tested before we felt the app was able to consistently determine measurements to the same level as our own professional tailors.


 
With just five standing posture photos, which you can take in the comfort of your own home, LIM Technology is able to create a 3D model of your body from which your body measurements are taken and used by the UKYS app to apply to your orders.
 

 
Face-censored effect is designed for the privacy of your photos. Once our experts review the data, your photos are permanently deleted.

STEP 1:  After you back on Indiegogo, you will receive your UKYS account and UKYS Getting Started Guideline via your email.
STEP 2: Download and Install UKYS app to your IOS device at this link: http://apple.co/29fqGJN
STEP 3: Open UKYS app to customize your shirt choice and get measured.
STEP 4: Enjoy the Perfect Fit of your custom shirt.


Beginning with a family tailoring business overseas, our experienced team of tailors have made thousands of custom fitted shirts. This business was combined with that of other family members who work in information technology. Together we developed the app, combining the best aspects of both industries. 
The app and measurement capturing is our innovative technology, but the final product, a UKYS shirt, is individually crafted by the skilled hands of our tailors. Each shirt comes with our Fit Promise – if you’re not 100% satisfied with the fit of your shirt, we will alter it or remake it from scratch, at no extra cost. Alternatively, we also offer a money back guarantee.
The app development is complete and ready for launch. Our tailoring business has the resources to produce the shirts within the timeframe that we have outlined.


We have spent over a year developing this project and every piece is in place to begin production immediately after our Indiegogo ends.

 

Our team has been diligently working together for a year to bring this product to life. We have a diverse set of skills and backgrounds in tailoring, product management, marketing, computer science, design...This is our family.

<h4>Hey Indiegogo, Burners and Friends of Duck Pond!</h4>
<p>For those of you who don't know us, we are the Duck Pond, a Burning Man theme camp &amp; dive bar serving up frosty beers and our World Famous Playa Specials every year since 2006!   We're here on Indiegogo raising funds to help us bring back the Duck Tower, our 30 foot high, 5 foot diameter lush-luring beacon of refreshing beverage goodness.</p>

The collection showcased six different looks encompassing a range of textiles and detailing across saris, lehengas and anarkalis. The ethos behind the brand is to offer custom made outfits for individual clients. Everything is geared towards ensuring that Bollywood glamour is not just limited to the chosen few. Our clients enjoy an innovative service that gives them access to a blend of traditional crafts fused with modern designs. We've had a great response, but the most important feedback we've had is that people want to see more! By funding this preview, you'll be giving us a chance to show people what we can really do. What We NeedWe're asking for a total of £1,200 which will allow us to put one bridal ensemble and two pieces of occasion wear into production. All three outfits will be made up of fine fabrics and exquisite hand embroidery from a very talented team of craftsmen. As well as the pieces themselves, you'll be funding a photoshoot which will be used to generate some of the perks listed below. We'll work with whatever funds we raise, but the more we get, the more we'll be able to do!The collection itself is inspired by different historical eras, and will take you on a journey that will have you dancing in the palaces of 1890's Lucknow to walking the streets of 1920's New York. Luxury is the byword for this collection and you can expect to see a lot of velvet, brocade and stunningly intricate craftsmanship. Our mission is to make traditional Pakistani crafts available to everyone, whether they're looking for a gharara or an evening gown and this collection will do that in abundance. Here's a small sample of the ensembles in the collection:The Beaded Flapper LehengaDrawing inspiration from the muted
excess of the Prohibition era, this bridal ensemble features a heavily beaded
lehenga with a pleated peak-a-boo lining. The raw silk blouse features a
statement shaped seam across the bust and the embellished dupatta with its
fringed edging will be sure to recall flapperesque drama.The Black & Gold GhararaThis outfit brings back nawabi style
with a modern twist. The placement of the embroidery on the short kameez gives
a different look whilst complimenting the old world charm of the full brocade
gharara. The Sapphire Romantic GownWith its full skirt and embellished detailing, this gown recalls romantic imagery such as 'The Lady of Shallot'. Details such as the pleated waistline make this an outfit easy to dress-up or down for any occasion. What You GetIn exchange for your support, you have acces to an exciting range of perks! On offer we have a heartfelt thank you for everyone who funds this project on our website and facebook page, as well as the chance to own two of the pieces that embody the aesthetics of the collection. 1. £5  - A digital sketch of one of the outfits from the collection and a 'thank you' on our website and Facebook page.2. £10 - All of the above and a digital edition of a few pages from my scrapbook so you can see how the collection came about. 3. £20 - 1 + 2 and a 20% off voucher to use on any order you place with us. 4. £40 - 1 + 2 and a 30% off voucher to use on any order you place with us.5. £50 - 1 + 2 + 3 and a set of postcards featuring the pieces you've helped to create.6. £100 - 1 + 2 + 3 and a soft-back photobook featuring the pieces you've helped to create.7. £250 - 1 + 2 + 3 and the 'Shahi' blouse in a colour of your choice.(Please note that the lehenga/ skirt in this picture is not included)A deliciously sumptuous blouse in pure silk velvet with rich hand embroidery featuring a mix of dabka, tilla and sequins on the shoulders and sleeves.

<p>People have come up with different ways to save the doors. Each approach has its advantages and limitations.</p>
<p>Jingle bells can be hard to hear if you are not in the same room or it is hung outside the door. Electronic sensors sense the presence of the dog near the door, but the dog may not have intended to go out.

<p>This collection consists of 6 complete looks, each designed, drafted and sewn by hand.</p>
<h2>who I am + what I do: </h2>
<p>Rooted in a deep love for art, clothing has always been an important way for me to communicate my personal artistic style.</p>
<p>Raised by parents who taught the importance of a strong work ethic, I’ve been happy to take the role of being a student as a constant motivating challenge. I am driven to strive for my utmost potential in everything I do. </p>
<p>This determination in school offered me the opportunity to study in Australia for a semester. There, I discovered more peace than I had ever felt before. Australia’s culture taught me how to find the balance between work and enjoyment, simply being that whatever you do for work can and should be what you love to do every day. I took time to immerse myself back into the things I have always loved- painting, writing, music, and living a natural lifestyle where less is more. All of these things helped me find my truest sense of self, both personally and as a designer. </p>
<p>The clothing I now design is directly inspired by this lifestyle. Each piece I create is centered around the idea of self liberation- garments that allow for less worry about your appearance, and more focus on an active yet peaceful life. My main concern is always how a design and all of it's details will make a person feel.</p>
<p>I desire clothing to function in a way that allows the wearer’s true personality to shine through. I believe the most beautiful thing is when clothing lets a person’s natural imperfections to radiate. The idea of this <em>imperfect perfection</em> describes one essential characteristic of my style and design aesthetic. Clothing designed from this aesthetic will let you experience the greatest possible feeling of comfort, freedom, and confidence. My designs offer this sense of liberation through clean simple lines, soft yet durable fabrics, and a modern edge. </p>
<p>I have always desired my art to impact people in a positive way, and now I have found the means to do so by designing clothing. By producing this fashion collection, I will be able to apply my ideas as tangible and meaningful creations. These creations will serve as the initial foundation to a clothing line focused on the simple idea that what you choose to wear may inspire you to lead a healthier and happier life.</p>
<h2>how your support helps:</h2>
<p>To complete this collection I am asking for $1500. This amount will allow me to purchase quality fabric, yarn, accessories and all other materials necessary for each garment’s creation. I intend to consciously source these materials, to remain attentive to earth’s sustainability in all of the work I produce. Several looks include two or more pieces embellished with unique fabric treatments. With your donations I will be able to construct clothing that is distinguished and original- ready to be shown on a runway and to design companies in the industry.</p>
<p>A portion of this project is the collaboration with local jewelry designer, <a href=""http://www.theknottyowl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Knotty Owl"">The Knotty Owl</a>, of Rochester, NY. Your donations will assist us in purchasing jewelry materials for this collection that have the quality necessary for a professional runway show. The jewelry pieces collaborating with my clothing will introduce the The Knotty Owl's most recent line of design work, that take on a new direction of intricate shapes and materials.</p>

To maintain a streamlined profile in the water, three integrated weight pockets have been placed into the lumbar region.  Each weight pocket is designed to carry up to three pounds of weight.  For many scuba divers, this will eliminate the need for weight belts or additional weight pockets.    </span>

<p>  </p></div>","The HONU is a sidemount buoyancy compensator that was designed for destination diving.  
 

 

The HONU was designed to satisfy a need that I had for a sidemount rig that was suited for destination diving.  Since the first coffee napkin sketch 18 months ago, the HONU has been turned into a fully functional device that has been proven in various recreational diving environments.  At 6 pounds, the HONU is light enough to roll up and place into a carry-on bag when traveling.  With 27 pounds of lift, the HONU has sufficient lift for most any cylinder configuration.  The convenient location of the rear dump valve will make it easy to maintain neutral buoyancy while maintaining a sublevel orientation.  The single bladder of the HONU is ideal for scuba diving within recreational diving limits. To maintain a streamlined profile in the water, three integrated weight pockets have been placed into the lumbar region.  Each weight pocket is designed to carry up to three pounds of weight.  For many scuba divers, this will eliminate the need for weight belts or additional weight pockets.    

 
                      

 

The design of the HONU was 'Born in Texas'!  The manufacturer is located in Wuxi (pronounced woo-she), China, which is just outside of Shanghai.  The manufacturer that we selected is the largest manufacturer of buoyancy compensator devices in Asia, and is ISO 9001:2000 certified.  (It is possible that your current buoyancy compensator was also made by this manufacturer!)  The parent company of this manufacturer is located in California and owns ""top of mind"" brands within the scuba diving industry.  Our manufactuer has proven it's ability to rapidly produce small prototype orders, and we have established a solid relationship with them over the past year.  A face to face meeting with our manufacurer has further strengthened our relationship.  

              
 
What We Need
 
We have boot strapped the research, design, prototyping, and testing of the HONU.  We are now ready for the first production run of the HONU.  In order to make the HONU available to you, we will need your support in raising capital to cover the costs associated with the first production run of the HONU.  
 
 

What You Get  (the perks!)

 

Some of you will want to take advantage of this opportunity to pre-order the HONU.  Diving with the HONU is the greatest perk that we can offer.  Whether you are looking for one recreational sidemount buoyancy compensator, or multiple recreational sidemount buoyancy compensators, you will find a perk that will satisfy your desire.

 
You can pre-order one complete HONU kit for $449.  In addition to this perk, you will also receive a handwritten Thank You card.
 
You can pre-order three (3) complete HONU kits for $1,250.  At this level, the discounted price per kit is $425.  You will also receive a handwritten Thank You card.  
 
You can pre-order five (5) complete HONU kits for $2,000.  At this level, the discounted price per kit is $400.  You will also receive a handwritten Thank You card.  
 
The accessory kit is a perk that you might like to have in your dive bag.  For $99, you will receive:  
 

two chokers with stainless steel butterfly bolt snaps
two cam bands with stainless steel butterfly bolt snaps
bungees with stainless steel butterfly bolt snaps
one stainless steel oval ring
two zip ties
an additional stainless steel butterfly bolt snap
two elastic hose retainer bands
handwritten Thank You card
 
For $25 you can sport your enthusiasm for sidemount diving by wearing the Sublevel Sidemount cavern diving t-shirt.  You will also receive a handwritten Thank You card.      

 
We will appreciate all levels of support.  At the $5 level of support, we will share some Aloha with you by sending you a handwritten Thank You card.

<p><strong>What we are:</strong></p>
<p>KIS® Fashions, LLC started in 2009 by Kelly McDonald of Wabasha, MN,  designs, manufactures and distributes luxury designer KIS® handbags wholesale to boutiques throughout the US.  KIS® is also a vendor for a television shopping network, ShopNBC, selling the KIS® handbags and KIS® apparel items on their website.</p>
<p>The KIS® handbags are made of the finest leathers, so soft to the touch and in vibrant hues.  They're also unique in their design with extraordinary organization options and pockets.</p>
<p>In October of 1990, Kelly McDonald became visually impaired and remained so for over 1 ½ years.  Her sense of touch was heightened, not only to find things but the feel of soft luxury was comforting.  Kelly is a corneal transplant recipient and is grateful for the vision she has today!  Her vision loss is what inspired the search for luxurious leathers and the design of the inside pockets:  A pocket for sunglasses and keys, so they're protected and you can find them easily.</p>
<p>The KIS® logo seeks to empower.  We say its a KIS® Andbag with Purse…sonality.  It’s an Andbag because it’s for Women who want this <strong>AND</strong> that not this <em>OR</em> that.  And KIS® not only stands for Keep it Simple but also keep it Sexy, Sophisticated, Silly, Sporty, Sassy, Scrumptous, Spectacular, Special, Sleek, Smart, Stylish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where we are at:  </strong></p>
<p>KIS® has a wonderful working relationship with their factory.  We know the factory, the factory knows us and together we are able to produce beautiful, top quality, handbags.  KIS® rents space from a warehouse in Minnesota where the KIS® inventory is stored .  For a small, per order fee, the warehouse also fulfills orders  and ships the KIS® products out to customers.</p>
<p>KIS® has built a great reputation of being a solid business partner with their customers.  KIS® has received positive reviews and testimonials by the various KIS® end users.</p>
<p>Kelly McDonald has built KIS® Fashions, LLC and where it is today with her own personal funds.  It's a start up business, with enough inventory to see the brand through the holiday selling season, and then we are looking to bring on the new Spring/Summer line.  That's where we need backing.  The money coming in from current sales is going right back into the company for day to day operations of payroll and necessary “set ups” of systems for all aspects of conducting business. </p>
<p>Now that we know the company and products are working and all entities are in place to make KIS® brand a success, our next step is to bring more attention to KIS® by reaching out to fashion writers to introduce KIS® to a wide audience of women who deserve a KIS®, expand our social media outreach on facebook, twitter, and more.  All these avenues are very little cost, with big rewards down the road.</p>
<p>KIS® needs your support.  We want to grow our business in our beloved community of Wabasha, MN.  Creating jobs, by bringing a unique and ambitious venture to this area is a grand goal but one reaching.  Once we start telling the KIS® story, people will want to get their own KIS® handbag.   if we don't have the inventory – KIS® can fall from the vine.   So, before we reach out and start telling the story, we need to build our inventory – and then there's no end to the KIS® story.</p>

I worked as a designer in China for nearly 7 years before finally deciding to come to the United States, study design management and open my own brand. Taking control of not only the quality, but the conditions in which employees work, the materials and creating bags in a safe, ethical way is my ultimate dream. This year I am excited to launch my first original collection: The Geometry Collection.This collection is inspired by paper sculpture and the interaction of light and form.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello there! I'm Karolina and I've dedicated the last few years of my life to sewing bras and knickers.  I just graduated from De Montfort University's Contour Fashion degree - during my time there I started my lingerie brand to help fund my studies. 'Karolina Laskowska' has now been running as a brand for over 2 years - in this time it's been more successful than I could have ever imagined, and now that I'm free of my studies, I would like to take it to the next level.</p><p>I have big plans for the brand - currently I'm sewing nearly all of my designs myself, which isn't really the best use of time. I'm pretty much constantly overrun with customer orders, which doesn't really leave time for things like new designs or looking for stockists. I would like that to change.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/875002/files/20140922145542-Sayuri_1.jpg?1411422942"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>The Sayuri set from AW14. I'm hoping to repeat these garment shapes but in more affordable fabrics.</i><br/><br/><p>My aims for the next year are to get some of my designs into production (especially those pesky wired bras!) and to exhibit at my first trade show and hopefully get my designs into some boutiques around the world - so that people can see and try things on in person, rather than relying on small internet photos! <br/></p><p>Unfortunately, to take things to this next level, I need a pretty serious cash injection. I don't qualify for most graduate business schemes as I started my business two years ago, and although I could look for investors, I like that Indiegogo keeps everything within its own community.</p><p>Last year I had a successful campaign to raise the funds (£3000) for my first round of manufacturing.  This campaign was an extremely valuable lesson, teaching me many important knicker life skills - one of the biggest that £3000 (plus £2000 of my own money) is not enough to manufacture, photograph and launch a lingerie collection. I was able to have small quantities of my AW13 collection made, with a <i>lot</i> of hurdles along the way. The quantities weren't enough to sustain production, so for the past few months I've had to go back to sewing things myself.</p><p>Since my last campaign, I've found a new factory that <i>specialises</i> in lingerie. I want to start by getting a few key styles made there, to help bring down the cost and make my designs more easily accessible. Unfortunately, their minimum order quantities mean that getting just a <i>single</i> bra style sewn would be around 1000 euros. This doesn't even cover material costs (and I tend to use beautiful if a tad expensive fabrics - most of the lace that I use averages around £45/m). Consequently, going into production just isn't possible right now - but it can be with <i>your</i> help. Without the funds that this campaign will raise, I will struggle to make the new collection a reality - there are so many costs to cover that unless you're in the business, you wouldn't even consider.</p><p>And more to add to my list of ambitious steps: I'm soon going to be moving out of my room and into an actual studio, plus I'm also going to be exhibiting at my first trade show, The Lingerie Edit, this January. This comes along with its own costs that I'm struggling to afford, but will hopefully be an opportunity to meet new buyers and find new stockists around the world. </p><p>In short: I need your help to push my brand to the next level.  With your money, I'll be able to afford sampling the new collection, pay for the collection photoshoot and retouching, pay for manufacturing costs (including sewing and fabrics), with leftover funds helping to make my first trade show as big a success as possible.</p><p>But what will you get in return for your generous contributions?  I have of course devised a whole range of fantastical perks for you to choose from... Limited edition harness and lingerie designs, hefty discounts on new designs, gift cards, post cards, prints and lots more. I'll also be offering my staggeringly popular 'creative freedom' offer - where by paying for the cost of basic bespoke lingerie and leaving all design decisions to me, you'll receive a fantastically unique and intricate set that would normally cost much, much more. <br/></p><p>Thank you for reading and I hope that you're able to help me take the next step in my lingerie journey! <br/></p><p></p><p><b>PERKS</b></p><p>£5 - BTS Blog access</p><p>Once this

I'm Karolina and I've dedicated the last few years of my life to sewing bras and knickers.  I just graduated from De Montfort University's Contour Fashion degree - during my time there I started my lingerie brand to help fund my studies. 'Karolina Laskowska' has now been running as a brand for over 2 years - in this time it's been more successful than I could have ever imagined, and now that I'm free of my studies, I would like to take it to the next level.I have big plans for the brand - currently I'm sewing nearly all of my designs myself, which isn't really the best use of time. I'm pretty much constantly overrun with customer orders, which doesn't really leave time for things like new designs or looking for stockists. I would like that to change.The Sayuri set from AW14. I'm hoping to repeat these garment shapes but in more affordable fabrics.My aims for the next year are to get some of my designs into production (especially those pesky wired bras!) and to exhibit at my first trade show and hopefully get my designs into some boutiques around the world - so that people can see and try things on in person, rather than relying on small internet photos! Unfortunately, to take things to this next level, I need a pretty serious cash injection. I don't qualify for most graduate business schemes as I started my business two years ago, and although I could look for investors, I like that Indiegogo keeps everything within its own community.Last year I had a successful campaign to raise the funds (£3000) for my first round of manufacturing.  This campaign was an extremely valuable lesson, teaching me many important knicker life skills - one of the biggest that £3000 (plus £2000 of my own money) is not enough to manufacture, photograph and launch a lingerie collection. I was able to have small quantities of my AW13 collection made, with a lot of hurdles along the way. The quantities weren't enough to sustain production, so for the past few months I've had to go back to sewing things myself.Since my last campaign, I've found a new factory that specialises in lingerie. I want to start by getting a few key styles made there, to help bring down the cost and make my designs more easily accessible. Unfortunately, their minimum order quantities mean that getting just a single bra style sewn would be around 1000 euros. This doesn't even cover material costs (and I tend to use beautiful if a tad expensive fabrics - most of the lace that I use averages around £45/m). Consequently, going into production just isn't possible right now - but it can be with your help. Without the funds that this campaign will raise, I will struggle to make the new collection a reality - there are so many costs to cover that unless you're in the business, you wouldn't even consider.And more to add to my list of ambitious steps: I'm soon going to be moving out of my room and into an actual studio, plus I'm also going to be exhibiting at my first trade show, The Lingerie Edit, this January. This comes along with its own costs that I'm struggling to afford, but will hopefully be an opportunity to meet new buyers and find new stockists around the world. In short: I need your help to push my brand to the next level.  With your money, I'll be able to afford sampling the new collection, pay for the collection photoshoot and retouching, pay for manufacturing costs (including sewing and fabrics), with leftover funds helping to make my first trade show as big a success as possible.But what will you get in return for your generous contributions?  I have of course devised a whole range of fantastical perks for you to choose from... Limited edition harness and lingerie designs, hefty discounts on new designs, gift cards, post cards, prints and lots more. I'll also be offering my staggeringly popular 'creative freedom' offer - where by paying for the cost of basic bespoke lingerie and leaving all design decisions to me, you'll receive a fantastically unique and intricate set that would normally cost much, much more. Thank you for reading and I hope that you're able to help me take the next step in my lingerie journey! PERKS£5 - BTS Blog accessOnce this 
campaign gains momentum, I'll be launching a special 
password-access-only blog, documenting my journey in the world of kinky 
sexy pants of joy for the contributors to this campaign.  £10 - Kimono silk hair bowsHave you seen any of my MASSIVE collection of vintage kimono silks?
 I'll be using pieces of these to make cute little hair bow clips, with 
each one being totally unique! These won't be available once the 
campaign has finished. £15 - postcards & gift card packMy
 designs have been included in some absolutely beautiful photoshoots 
(even if I do say so myself!) - this perk will see you sent a random 
selection of gorgeous postcard prints, as well as a £5 gift voucher for 
my online shop and a handwritten thank you!£35 - Indiegogo frame knickerLimited
 edition, just for this campaign - a satin elastic frame knicker (i.e. 
frontless, backless, crotchless!), with silver toned components and 
finished with a little beaded charm at the back (depending on the 
contents of my bead box - likely freshwater pearls!)£40 - Celestyna harnessA
 new harness design for next season, featuring symmetrically hand cut 
eyelash lace and embellished with a satin bow. Will  be using a 
different style of lace to the prototype but I can safely say that it 
will still be gorgeous!£40 - Indiegogo nipple pastiesWhilst I have yet to decide exact design specifics, these nipple pasties will only be available through this campaign. Expect metallic leather and Swarovski crystals!£65 - Mystery tie side knickerI'm the first to 
admit that I'm a total fabric hoarder, but in this instance this can 
work to your advantage! If you contribute £65 I'll make you a beautiful 
pair of tie side knickers in one of my many beautiful silks or laces - 
sumptuously unique underthings only available through this campaign!  
The photo above shows just one of the many possibilities...£65 - Bumper harness packSave save save on my best selling designs! For this perk you can choose two out of three harness options to call your own - Kordelia, Lidia or the brand new Celestyna (shown above). These all retail between £40-45 each so you'll be making a significant saving (postage is included!).  £75 - £100 shop voucherPay £75, get £100 to spend in the shop. 'Nuff said.£100 - Creative freedom knickers For £100, I will go crazy and create you some fantastically unique knickers that would normally retail for *well* above £100!

<p>As a student
athlete I’ve seen first-hand the importance of the weight room in both academics
and in athletics. I’ve gained many friends in the weight room from all sports,
and it has become a community. Being in the weight room teaches you life
lessons like drive and how to deal with your emotions. Personally, the weight
room helps clear my mind and focus my anger into something positive. Being
active keeps kids out of trouble and be in a safe place. Physical activity is
also strongly associated with academics; as proven by Dr. Amika Singh. She
concluded that increased daily exercise “1. Increased blood and oxygen flow to
the brain. 2. Increased levels of norepinephrine and endorphins resulting in a
reduction of stress and improvement of mood. 3. Increased growth factors that
help to create new nerve cells and support synaptic plasticity.” It can be
concluded that an increase in exercise increases brain function and produces
increased academic success.</p>
<p>Augusta High School
is located in rural Wisconsin in an area with few resources outside of the
school district for athletes to improve on their skills and techniques. It is a
low income area where 53.8% of the 160 students qualify for free or reduced
meals. Many students also lack transportation and are unable to get the 30
minutes to the nearest quality weight room. Our current weight room is out
dated! We are in need of new weights, benches, bars, etc.  With this equipment the weight room would be a
safer and better place to grow as a student and an athlete. We would be very
grateful for any donations.</p><br/></div>","Why?

Today they are deeply rooted in Spanish culture with even members of the Spanish royal family sporting them. <br/></p><p>Taking the <i>abarca</i> as the starting point and experimenting with the 
front leather part gave birth to five KINA sandal styles: UNO, DOS, TRES,

The collections of DOS styles are the Kina VOYAGE lines. <br/>UNO, TRES, CUATRO and CINCO are trendy redesigns of the basic style.  <br/><br/>All sandals are handmade in Spain with hand-worked fabrics from different parts of the world, and Spanish quality leathers and raw materials. But most importantly, they're made by master artisans devoted to pursuing excellency in their crafts. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/570520/files/20140510104900-KinaVoyage.jpg?1399744140"" src="""" style=""""/></p>With almost ten years of experience in the field of fashion, I have designed and managed the production of bags and belts of renown Lebanese-American designer <a href=""http://www.johnnyfarah.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Farah</a>, as well as created<a href=""http://www.kinzadesigns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kinza Designs</a>, my own belt brand. <br/><br/>Over those years I have developed a passion for crafts and a genuine concern for their disappearance, which led me to collaborate with talented artisans to create KinaMania, a brand rooted in craftsmanship and cultural heritage.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/570561/files/20140510110418-VoyageKinas.jpg?1399745058"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

</h3>Stores start putting spring/summer 2015 footwear on their racks as early as February, and store buyers make their purchases between June and September for delivery in February 2015. We will be presenting KinaMania sandals to boutiques and department stores during that term, and the product alone is not enough. We need to: <br/><ul>

</li>
<li>Create display items</li>
</ul>We have unusual yet simple designs that we would love to have on time for the meetings. The packaging is also a must for the online sales, starting from the Indiegogo campaign. <br/><br/>Other many reasons why we need your help: <br/><ul>

And this is how I
 discovered the abarcas in all their pleasant comfort. Abarcas are traditional Spanish peasant sandals made from leather with recycled rubber soles originally handmade in the Balearic Islands. Today they are deeply rooted in Spanish culture with even members of the Spanish royal family sporting them. Taking the abarca as the starting point and experimenting with the 
front leather part gave birth to five KINA sandal styles: UNO, DOS, TRES, 
CUATRO and CINCO (numbers one to five in Spanish). DOS, the traditional abarca, tells the story of handcrafted inspiration. The collections of DOS styles are the Kina VOYAGE lines. UNO, TRES, CUATRO and CINCO are trendy redesigns of the basic style.  All sandals are handmade in Spain with hand-worked fabrics from different parts of the world, and Spanish quality leathers and raw materials. But most importantly, they're made by master artisans devoted to pursuing excellency in their crafts. With almost ten years of experience in the field of fashion, I have designed and managed the production of bags and belts of renown Lebanese-American designer Johnny Farah, as well as createdKinza Designs, my own belt brand. Over those years I have developed a passion for crafts and a genuine concern for their disappearance, which led me to collaborate with talented artisans to create KinaMania, a brand rooted in craftsmanship and cultural heritage.  
Voyage to Spain is a collaboration with the prestigious Spanish tailor of bullfighters, Daniel Roqueta (established since 1984) > picture on the left. 

 Voyage to the Orient/Embroidery is a collaboration with Inaash association for the preservation of the rich heritage of Palestinian embroidery (established since 1974) > middle picture.
Voyage to the Orient/Crochet is a collaboration with L’Artisan Du Liban for the safeguard of Lebanon’s cultural heritage (established since 1979) > picture to the right. 

All Kina sandals are handmade in Spain by artisans specialized in making the abarca, and wherever the uppers of the Voyage lines are made, they are sent to Spain where the sandals are constructed. 

And here I am today asking for your
support through the Indiegogo platform to help Kina sandals take their first steps, and make all those Voyage collaborations and more come to life.  I need your help to: 
Stores start putting spring/summer 2015 footwear on their racks as early as February, and store buyers make their purchases between June and September for delivery in February 2015. We will be presenting KinaMania sandals to boutiques and department stores during that term, and the product alone is not enough. We need to: 
Create the packaging design 

Create display items
We have unusual yet simple designs that we would love to have on time for the meetings. The packaging is also a must for the online sales, starting from the Indiegogo campaign. Other many reasons why we need your help: 
to place an order of sandals to launch KinaMania's online sales

to carry out the next KinaMania Voyage lines
to set up a KinaMania office/showroom

to rent a space at a trade show during fashion week in September

I own a small business, AIRMIKA, Inc., located in the Sandhills region of North Carolina.  We make the AUTOcyb™ – the automotive cyber security lock.  Our product was recently chosen as a 2013 Technovation Selectee at the Consumer’s Electronics CEweek in NYC.
I'm also a global expert in automotive black box technologies and advocate for fair usage. 
My goal is to build this company at meteorite speed by offering crowdsharing donors the product and using the funds to manufacture and market additional units.  
THE ISSUE
The U.S. is proposing mandating automotive black boxes, commonly termed ‘event data recorders’ (EDRs) in cars and light trucks by September 2014, that you cannot turn-off, disable, or remove.  
The information collected may include a vehicle's speed and acceleration, whether air bags were deployed, if brakes were applied, and whether seat belts were engaged.  
Even if they do not proceed with federal regulation, the USA Today recently reported that more than 130 million vehicles are now equipped with EDRs and 96% of all new vehicles would come standard with an EDR.  
Overall, privacy and consumer protection is woefully lacking and we’re doing something about this right now, not waiting for Congress, Federal regulators or State legislators  to act (if at all). 
When you purchase a vehicle you own more than just the vehicle – you own the electronic data the vehicle creates and stores. No amount of legal sophistry will undermine this right if it is properly executed.  We provide a means for vehicle owner’s to rightfully do so.
WHY YOU NEED THIS PRODUCT
Your vehicle's cyber security is important.  From the standpoint of consumer protection most consumers are unaware that their vehicles are recording data that not only may be used to aid vehicle and highway safety analysis, but also has the potential of being used against them in civil and criminal legal proceedings, or by their insurer to determine rates. 
Increasingly data from black boxes have been used in court cases nationwide, including ones dealing with vehicular homicide in which speed was an issue.
OUR SOLUTION
The vehicle owner can control access to this data, to prevent tampering and misuse with a simple, inexpensive  product, the AUTOcyb™ – the world’s first automotive cyber security lock, a vehicle connector lockout to safeguard access to in-vehicle electronics networks. 
The AUTOcyb™ is U.S. patented and globally standardized by the world's largest professional organization, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE-1616a. 
This device helps to protect you against unlawful search and seizure and furthermore demonstrates that the vehicle owner is actively exerting an expectation of privacy. 
Our product is designed for post-1996 light vehicles (cars and light trucks) that contain a Diagnostic Link Connector (DLC) which is accessible and in good working condition. 
It attaches to the vehicle’s DLC, normally located under the dash, and can be removed for vehicle maintenance, inspection, or emissions testing. 
This connector lockout gives the reassurance of knowing that you have control of crash data access. The black box / EDR will still work exactly as it is designed to. 
You determine when and who sees the data (within State law) and thus, control how it is used. 
The AUTOcyb™ is simple to install and remove and protects the security, integrity and authenticity of the data.  
You hold the key, not automakers, law enforcement or insurance companies. 
If others want to access your crash data they will have to seek your permission or use legal process to do so.  Basically, this device protects your interests.
WHAT WE NEED FOR OUR COMPANY AND WHAT YOU GET FOR DONATING
I have tooling to manufacture 800,000 units but need funding for materials.   
3900 units are ready to ship. All we need is your pledge and address. 
The initial 3900 donors of $33.00 to this project will receive one (1) AUTOcyb™ - Automotive Cyber Security Lock.   I will ship by September 10, 2013 USPS First Class in the USA.  
The product currently does not ship outside the USA.  
I offer a postcard thank you perk for $10 and product perks based on 1 each-$33, 2 each-$66, 3 each-$99 donations.
If the project exceeds the 3900 stock inventory I will send these donors a product as soon as it is manufactured.

<p> Hi there, my name is Ron Woodleigh and back in 2007 my dear friend Mike came up with a very unique concept for an <strong>Automatic Fish Catcher</strong> and we now need your <strong>HELP</strong> to Officially launch the product and support Manufacturing, which is now in place to commence. <strong>PLEASE NOTE: this is nothing like the product commonly known as the Yo-Yo</strong></p>
<p>A Proto-Type was produced and taken to the <strong>International Inventors Convention in GENEVA</strong> where we won the <strong>Gold Medal</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to the response we received, and as I was a Design Engineer I took up the project with 100% commitment to Design and Develop it into a fully functional product, in the beginning using a Poly Styrene Float and a Lead Sinker at the base to keep it upright.</p>
<p> With completion of the first batch of product toward the end of 2007 I then proceeded to carry out extensive Market Research Internationally, One to establish a need for the product and second to establish the reliability of the product.</p>
<p>It proved overwhelming successful in that during the 24 month campaign we <strong>Unexpectedly sold over 20,000 pieces</strong> with a 95% success rate,  and having no returns or Warranty to this date. (Which helped Fund us in bringing the product to this stage).</p>
<p>During the course of my Research I found that we could be vulnerable Environmentally with using Poly Styrene and Lead <strong>(especially around Children)</strong> so I proceeded to Re-Design and Manufacture Dies &amp; Tooling for an Injection Moulded Float and a Bronze Sinker to the base of the unit. Other unique changes and settings were applied also (Undisclosed), to further ensure the efficiency and reliability of <strong>The Fisherman's Mouse Trap</strong>.</p>
<p>We have developed the product primarily for the <strong>Social Fishing Market</strong>, and especially for <strong>Mom &amp; the Kids</strong>, who have difficulty from time to time in jagging a Fish the conventional way and all of a sudden can participate as a Family on Fishing outings, enjoying each others company,  even though we have had some Professional Fishermen trying the product with great success.</p>
<p><strong>The Fisherman's Mouse Trap</strong> has not just been designed for surface fishing, and with the S/Steel Trace Line at the TOP allows for a Sinker to be attached to do <strong>Bottom Fishing</strong>.</p>
<p>Please view our Website at <a href=""http://www.fishermansmousetrap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fishermansmousetrap.com</a> for more detailed information on the one and only <strong>Fisherman's Mouse Trap which is protected by Patent and Registered Trade Mark.</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Hi All, my name is Ellen Wagner. I am originally from St. Louis, Mo., but left at the age of 17 to attend Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, majoring in Fashion Design/Merchandising. Shortly after that, I went back to art school to study Art Direction at Creative Circus in Atlanta, which eventually led me to New York. I worked in Advertising for about 7 years full-time until I realized that I wasn't truly fulfilling my dream. That's when I took a leap of faith, and decided to focus on fashion and design. My brand name is Eldenwa Designs and I specialize in handmade fabric accessories made from recycled (up-cycled) jersey cotton.  I make every single piece myself by hand, and all of my designs are available in a large range of colors and color combinations, which makes my collections very unique.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">My mission is to provide high-end fashion that is attainable for everyone... I am making something beautiful and unique out of one of the most basic staples in every ones wardrobe, a t shirt! I am taking something that is no longer wanted and turning it into a beautiful <strong>FUN</strong>ctional piece of art.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">This campaign will provide me with the funding I need to really take my brand to the next level so that I can move from a one-woman-show, to a small sustainable design company. I have so many design ideas that I have not been able to share with the world simply because I do not have a team to help me with production and the day to day work that comes along with running a successful business. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Give a little...Get a lot!</h3>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">My goal is to raise $10,000.  With these funds, I will be able to hire staff to help with production design and inventory. I will also be able to purchase equipment/materials needed in addition to being able to expand in other categories such as clothing.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Here's a high-level break down of the use of funds ~</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Equipment: Dress-forms, sewing machines, tools, and tables</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Rental Space: I want to rent out a small space for production of goods. I have out grown my apartment ;) therefore; I need a designated area for production.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Staff: I would like to hire 2 staff members. A designer to help with production and an executive asst./social media guru to help with the day to day routine such as inventory, emails, and social media.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">If for some reason I do not raise all the money that is needed, whatever funds that are raised will go towards acquiring some of the equipment I will need to gear up larger scale productions of Eldenwa Designs, as well as acquiring a design asistant.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">To thank you for your help, I plan to offer some awesome deals and gifts from Eldenwa Designs. You can check out some of the styles in my photo gallery to get a better idea. Stand out in the crowd, and help me to bring more sustainable unique fashions to the world!!! </p>
<p><strong><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">They say one man's trash is another man's treasure...I never knew how true that statement was until I started Eldenwa Designs. I stated earlier that I make all of my designs from recycled jersey cotton. I want to go into a little more detail about this process. I basically deconstruct t-shirts and I use every single piece of fabric from the collar to the base seam of the shirt. The more I started creating, the more I realized I needed more resources for shirts, but I wanted to keep it all recycled and I knew I had limited capital.  So I had to come up with a way to get the materials I needed at the lowest price possible… then I had an AHA moment.</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1""> After making my first piece from scraps of t-shirts, I knew I could use them as a fabric source for all my accessories. What better place to get t-shirts you are going to cut up anyway but thrift stores. I did my research and found out where all the Salvation Army locations were in the city. I found them to be a gold mine for fabric with a wide range of colors and sizes. The possibilities were endless. The most amazing thing about it is that I would find brand new shirts in bulk. It’s basically the first place people drop of the leftovers from there family reunion shirts and work picnics. Needless to say this became my new favorite store. Not only was I able to bring costs down significantly, I am also able to call my product eco-friendly because of the recycled fabrics. This approach also makes my brand economically friendly; because of the low overhead, I can keep my price point as an independent designer at attainable prices for everyone. WIN WIN!!</p>
<p class=""ParaAttribute1"">Your contributions will help me to bring more of my sustainable eco-friendly creations out to the world on a larger scale. Remember, Green is the new Black!!</p>

Going to Hawaii or taking your daily bus? We see every situation in life as an adventure and excuse to live life to the fullest and that's why created Pathfinder.The sneaker designed for your day to day. You can have a meeting at 12:00, after-work drinks at 7 PM, and catch a red-eye for a weekend getaway.Pathfinder is designed to be the ultimate footwear companion regardless of the situation. One day or day one. it's up to you.NEW COLOR ADDED:  The best features that a sneaker can offer >> 10 times flexible.> Water resistant.> Strong and durable.> Perfect grip in all situations.> 20% more breathable than our previous models.Probably you're wondering what a “All day sneaker” means. The concept is easy but also awesome. Imagine a sneaker that you can use at the office while you're having a meeting with your boss and also for those beers with friends after work, a sneaker that can fix no matter the situation with the maximum comfort and the last technology in sports performance, well, that´s Pathfinder.But this doesn't stop here. This design is the result of the feedback from over 50.000 users that filled out over 25 surveys last year. At Muroexe we love to stay in touch with our community and creating with you.But, what makes Pathfinder different from other sneakers?
First of all, the ultimate knit technology, ultra-breathable but still water repellent.
This is not a typical “Quick dry” sneaker, this is a “never wet” sneaker. It repels water in an extraordinary way thanks to the latest technology while keeping the sneaker cool.
Antibacterial insole > Because we want to protect all kinds of animal life on earth, but not in our shoes.
TPU insole > An improved version of the memory foam technology.Much more durable with high traction and excellent tear resistance.
Better EVA outsole > Extremely comfy and ready for any situation with a better cushioning.
Anti-slip rubber piece: nothing, even the rain, can stop you now.
Once we collected all the feedback we worked closely with our biomechanical engineering team and that’s how the Pathfinder was born > the ultimate everyday sneaker.Designing the Pathfinder with eco-friendly materials was always very important to us. Each pair is made from 10 recycled plastic bottles. This is the only planet we can live in.The material we use is PET > polyethylene terephthalate (yes, we also have some troubles to pronounce it). The plastic is used to make water bottles but also the cover of the toilet paper (disgusting). When recycled, PET goes through a cleaning, grinding, and melting process after that, we can give a second life to this plastic and help to save our planet.The quality of all this product its simply awesome making each pair of pathfinder the most comfortable and stylish sneaker. Depending on the size, each pair of Pathfinder contains around 10  recycled PET bottles.Also, the company that is our PET supplier is accredited by the ""Recycled Global Standard"" certification, this means that all the processes count with the highest standards of quality always working in an eco-friendly way. The Pathfinder is 100% vegan PETA approved.We'll email you a survey after the campaign ends to collect our color and sizing preferences.NEW COLOR ADDED: Also, in our Kickstarter project, we designed this technical shoe bag to make even easier your next trip. It's totally breathable but also durable (as our Pathfinder). And yes, 100% animal-free. So now, when you're packing your bag, you will not have to worry about dirtying your fresh clothing (Win win). The media are talking about us >       You can add any of these awesome extras onto your chosen reward by simply adding the amount of the add-on to your pledge. For example, if the reward you'd like is 3x Pathfinder and you would like to add an extra Container Bag, instead of pledging the normal €229, you would pledge manually €274 (€229 + €45). It's as easy as that!  The perfect sneaker for the perfect traveler.The pathfinder has been designed to solve all the problems that a traveler can find on the way. No matter if you're on a weekend getaway or a summer holiday, you will always need the best on your feet: Optimal grip, lightness, breathability, water resistant and of course, comfort > With Pathfinder, we have broken our limits, we have designed the most comfy sneaker in our history.What is your size?                    To know what is your size just follow this easy steps.                    1º Tape a piece of paper down on the floor.                    2º Place your foot on top of the piece of paper.                    3º Draw the outline of your foot all the way around.                    4º Mark the length and width.                    5º You got it!

It's for dogs that use their own paws while out and about. They need bigger containers for their food, and a good size blanket to snuggle down with. There all dog!
<h2>Why you may want a Wag N Go Dog Travel Bag<br/><span style=""color: #ff6600;""> </span>
</h2><p><b><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Think about every time you've packed up your dog for:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>A Vacation</li>
<li>Off to the pet-sitter</li>
<li>Sleep overs at family or friends</li>
<li>A day at the office</li>
<li>Or even trying to check in at the airport or boarding a train.</li>
</ul>
The bags that I found on the market, just didn't do the trick, I still needed good containers for food, that I could freeze, and something that Maggie could sleep on and feel content. I wanted pockets for her paper work; I wanted it light and packed smartly.

<em>It should be a bag that's packed up and ready to go.</em>

</ul><h2><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Traveling with my dog use to be:</span></h2>
Dragging a big fat dog bag up stairs, across the garden or trying to fit it in the car...it drove me crazy!

Poor-quality bags that spilled my dog's food made my head spin, regardless how much my dog wanted to help clean up the mess.

I felt like I was always digging around the bottom of that bag to find that treat that Maggie was craving (it's always on the bottom).<br/><br/><b>Make it easy for the dog on the go...</b><br/><ul>
<li>Think about that time you wanted to keep your dog happy with his own blanket, food and treats. It’s a fact that dogs are more content away from home when they have things that are familiar to them.</li>
<li>Think how much of easier it will be with your dog’s personal paw-bag ready to go when you are.</li>
<li>Have containers that hold a good deal of food which I can take from freezer to bag and even use them as bowls.</li>
</ul>
The Wag N Go dog bag makes taking your dog out easy and breezy, without frustration. You’re packed up and ready to go!

<p>Hey Everybody,<br/><br/>Thanks for checking out our project. We really appreciate it!<br/> Our dream started out with the question, “Is it possible to create a fitness apparel line manufactured on U.S. soil?”</p>
<p>We are two guys, both husbands and fathers, who have big dreams and believe that dreams still do come true! Gabriel hits the pavement in the morning taking his kids to school and then working his e-commerce sales day job. Scott is a stay-at-home dad, taking care of his budding toddler and ever curious 3-year old. In 2010, we launched a small fitness &amp; lifestyle apparel company, with hopes of making product here in the heart of Los Angeles. We have partnered with local fabric and sewing houses to create exceptional product and bring back integrity to clothing made in the U.S.A. We are working hard to keep jobs on U.S. soil while empowering small business in our country.</p>
<p>Through this process, it has been an eye opening experience to see that 98% of all fitness apparel is made overseas and that sourcing certain fabrics here on U.S. soil is almost impossible at times.</p>
<p> We want to make a dent in that 98%. We want to make a difference by expanding our product line that will keep jobs here in the U.S. It has been a fun and wild ride and we are so grateful to those who have supported us up to this point. But, we have much more that we want to do. We are willing to take on the big companies who have millions of dollars behind them. Can we do it? We think its possible!</p>
<p>Please supports at whatever levels you’re comfortable with.<br/>Thanks a million – Gabriel &amp; Scott</p>

</div></div>","Hey Everybody,Thanks for checking out our project. We really appreciate it! Our dream started out with the question, “Is it possible to create a fitness apparel line manufactured on U.S. soil?”
We are two guys, both husbands and fathers, who have big dreams and believe that dreams still do come true! Gabriel hits the pavement in the morning taking his kids to school and then working his e-commerce sales day job. Scott is a stay-at-home dad, taking care of his budding toddler and ever curious 3-year old. In 2010, we launched a small fitness & lifestyle apparel company, with hopes of making product here in the heart of Los Angeles. We have partnered with local fabric and sewing houses to create exceptional product and bring back integrity to clothing made in the U.S.A. We are working hard to keep jobs on U.S. soil while empowering small business in our country.
Through this process, it has been an eye opening experience to see that 98% of all fitness apparel is made overseas and that sourcing certain fabrics here on U.S. soil is almost impossible at times.
 We want to make a dent in that 98%. We want to make a difference by expanding our product line that will keep jobs here in the U.S. It has been a fun and wild ride and we are so grateful to those who have supported us up to this point. But, we have much more that we want to do. We are willing to take on the big companies who have millions of dollars behind them. Can we do it? We think its possible!
Please supports at whatever levels you’re comfortable with.Thanks a million – Gabriel & Scott
Here is a small glimpse of what we have accomplished so far:

Women's Crop Pants are made out of 4-way stretch material providing both support and mobility in any movement . They also provides excellent coverage during squats or other movements that will put strain on the fabric.. (aka: no show and tell)

Women's Running Shorts made out of 4-way stretch material providing both support and allowing freedom of movement. With a built in moisture wicking liner and continuous drawcord that won't come out in the wash, they are the ultimate universal short for an

So What's Next? 

We start with the basic and actually create an entire line of product for both men and women on a seasonal basis. All made in the USA and from the highest quality fabrics.

COLOR! Lots of it! We want to allow men and women to be able to create entire outfit that match and complements each other.

Then create fun stylish outifts that can be worn working out or just throughout the day
What happens if we are able to raise more funds beyond the $30,000?

Well, ever since we started this company we were big dreamers, so the more we raise the further we will take WOD Gear into all areas of fitness. We already have designs and patterns in place to not only create an entire apparel line, but also dive into areas like cycling, triathlons, and much more!

<h3><strong>Who is Darion Cortez?</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Darion Cortez, 22, born &amp; raised in St Louis, Missouri. I have had a love for drawing ever since I could pick up a crayon. I started out drawing just random things that came to my mind &amp; as I grew up it slowly progressed. In middle school I found I was pretty good at drawing tattoos, &amp; I drew them for years &amp; years. In July 2011 a friend of mine asked me to draw her a pair of shoes, I had never attempted to draw a shoe before so it was pretty scary &amp; exciting at the same time. She only asked for one pair &amp; I drew 24 lol &amp; I haven't stopped. Just like my other are it took a while for it to progress but I really got the hang of it. I learned so much about the anatomy of the high heel &amp; what it takes to design a good shoe. With my active imagination i designed shoes that were a little out there, so again I had to learn what makes a shoe company survive. I asked around &amp; another friend of mine told me staple shoes set the tone for the company. I took his advice &amp; created my staple pieces. I started to talk with a manufacturer &amp; I had to learn how to give my shoe designs the right proportions so they can accurately bring my idea to life. Along the way of doing all these designs I started to wonder what my shoes would look like if they were real. I asked a friend who I met through YouTube if he could digitally render my designs &amp; luckily he said yes. When I saw them digitally rendered my mind was blown &amp; I was speechless. I asked him to be apart of my company &amp; graciously enough he said yes. He is the one who rendered all of my shoe designs you see below.

I am Darion Cortez, 22, born & raised in St Louis, Missouri. I have had a love for drawing ever since I could pick up a crayon. I started out drawing just random things that came to my mind & as I grew up it slowly progressed. In middle school I found I was pretty good at drawing tattoos, & I drew them for years & years. In July 2011 a friend of mine asked me to draw her a pair of shoes, I had never attempted to draw a shoe before so it was pretty scary & exciting at the same time. She only asked for one pair & I drew 24 lol & I haven't stopped. Just like my other are it took a while for it to progress but I really got the hang of it. I learned so much about the anatomy of the high heel & what it takes to design a good shoe. With my active imagination i designed shoes that were a little out there, so again I had to learn what makes a shoe company survive. I asked around & another friend of mine told me staple shoes set the tone for the company. I took his advice & created my staple pieces. I started to talk with a manufacturer & I had to learn how to give my shoe designs the right proportions so they can accurately bring my idea to life. Along the way of doing all these designs I started to wonder what my shoes would look like if they were real. I asked a friend who I met through YouTube if he could digitally render my designs & luckily he said yes. When I saw them digitally rendered my mind was blown & I was speechless. I asked him to be apart of my company & graciously enough he said yes. He is the one who rendered all of my shoe designs you see below. Designing shoes are my passion & it's what I would love to do for the rest of my life. The shoe industry is a never ending education, & I am ready to learn everything I can to make sure my brand goes in the right direction.

What will I do with the money?
The money will go towards the manufacturing of the shoes & shoe boxes. I plan to use the money to fully 100% fund the Darion Cortez brand to provide original designed shoes to women, & in the future to men as well with the addition of sneakers. Also in the future I will be adding in handbags to the brand. 
Beautiful shoes need beautiful names for $25 I will give a shoe design from a future collection your name.
If you like the shoe you see & want a pair of your own for $100 I will send you a pair. (this option is limited)

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our new Innovative Smart tracker provides discreet, waterproof GPS-aligned tracking with an added anti-theft feature designed to protect not only your belongings, family members and pets but you as well. Better yet, </span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">without the need for a professional installation,</b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> the customer or business owner can save an incredible amount of money while being completely in charge of their GPS device. </span><br/></p>
<p>This product is unique in its field: not only is it discrete, and virtually unnoticeable to the untrained eye when placed on a vehicle, bag, etc. But it<b> also includes the ability to remotely listen in when desired </b>by the customer for greater tracking information results. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The customer is also able to use the device to be aware of movement of the person or vehicle outside of a pre-determined area, and can receive alerts via SMS text as well as call alerts when the device has detected that it has left the area. </p>
<p>If the vehicle ever runs into inclement weather (take out often), or finds itself submerged more than the usual GPS tracker, <b>our device has a high waterproof level.</b></p>
<p>This is a Policeman or Private Investigators dream, but it is great for everyday users as well. For customers intending to use this in plain sight, <b>our Smart tracker includes SIM card insertion</b>. This clever design makes it easy to install the device in a place that is easy for the user to reach, but which still prevents it from being detected as an actual tracking device. </p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Some current market GPS tracking devices run into issues with playback, losing connection (and therefore losing memory) while tracking is in progress, and more. We wanted to create a product that could work itself through these obstacles. Our SIM card mount is self-locking, which drastically reduces the chance of vibrations or potholes knocking the memory card loose. </span><br/></p>
<p>All of these custom features can be tracked and monitored on a sleek, <b>Google Map-compatible and</b> <b>free web-based tracking platform</b>, which also supports 3rd party software. The platform is also supported on IOS as well as Android mobile platforms, giving customers the opportunity to remain in tune with their tracking device regardless of where they themselves are located. While our tracking platform looks great and performs even better, <b>it won’t cost our customers additional monthly membership payments like many GPS systems require</b>. </p>

<br/><p>GPS tracking devices have become incredibly important to daily life, both for individuals as well as for business. For companies who run primarily through delivery shipments and cargo, a GPS tracking device can ensure the security of the cargo, compare driver’s planned routes against their actual travel time, length of the trip, and more. Using a GPS device can also ensure that a wayward employee doesn’t wander away with a company vehicle without prior authorization from the company itself. </p>

Smart Tracker is a real time Smart GPS Tracker, it has many functions and features built to protect anything, anytime, anywhere.







Protect anything : people, car, pet, etc.
Protect anytime : real time tracking via phone or free web interface.
Protect anywhere : A-GPS technology, working even underground.
20 more features (Panic button, Voice monitoring, geo-fence, etc.)

Track with Google maps, Android and iOS support.

Smart Tracker is accurate up to 5m. (High GPS accuracy).
Tiny GPS Tracker with a powerful recheargable  battery.
Swiss designed with innovative technology.



Real time tracking anywhere in the world, anytime.


Protect your family, pets or any goods with one of the smallest  GPS Tracker in the world. If a problem occurs, you simply have to push the panic button and it will automatically send a SMS alerts with your GPS coordinates. Also, you can keep an eye on your loved ones in real time whenever you want through a free web service or using your mobile. 














































Our new Innovative Smart tracker provides discreet, waterproof GPS-aligned tracking with an added anti-theft feature designed to protect not only your belongings, family members and pets but you as well. Better yet, without the need for a professional installation, the customer or business owner can save an incredible amount of money while being completely in charge of their GPS device. 
This product is unique in its field: not only is it discrete, and virtually unnoticeable to the untrained eye when placed on a vehicle, bag, etc. But it also includes the ability to remotely listen in when desired by the customer for greater tracking information results. 




The customer is also able to use the device to be aware of movement of the person or vehicle outside of a pre-determined area, and can receive alerts via SMS text as well as call alerts when the device has detected that it has left the area. 
If the vehicle ever runs into inclement weather (take out often), or finds itself submerged more than the usual GPS tracker, our device has a high waterproof level.
This is a Policeman or Private Investigators dream, but it is great for everyday users as well. For customers intending to use this in plain sight, our Smart tracker includes SIM card insertion. This clever design makes it easy to install the device in a place that is easy for the user to reach, but which still prevents it from being detected as an actual tracking device. 




Some current market GPS tracking devices run into issues with playback, losing connection (and therefore losing memory) while tracking is in progress, and more. We wanted to create a product that could work itself through these obstacles. Our SIM card mount is self-locking, which drastically reduces the chance of vibrations or potholes knocking the memory card loose. 
All of these custom features can be tracked and monitored on a sleek, Google Map-compatible and free web-based tracking platform, which also supports 3rd party software. The platform is also supported on IOS as well as Android mobile platforms, giving customers the opportunity to remain in tune with their tracking device regardless of where they themselves are located. While our tracking platform looks great and performs even better, it won’t cost our customers additional monthly membership payments like many GPS systems require. 


















*Headphones are included free according to the Strech Goal.











We have designed, built, and tested the Smart Tracker prototype and software. We have selected a well-respected production facility that we have previously worked with successfully. 
However, one of our biggest concerns was making Smart Tracker affordable to the largest amount of people possible, while still insisting on a rich feature set. In order to proceed, we need to create the tooling and order quantity necessary to keep the price reasonable for everyone involved. 
That is why you are our most important asset! By working together, we can all benefit from this. 
By donating to our indiegogo campaign, you are guaranteeing that customers looking for a quality, cost-effective magnetic  GPS tracker system can be served. As we are not relying on our own incomes to get this product line started, we can make sure that the price is considerably lower to purchase on the consumer side further down the line. 









By investing in our project, your pre-orders will help to fund the first production run in a quantity that keeps the price low for everyone. In return you get (besides our gratitude and sincere thanks!) a totally new kind of Smart GPS TRACKER at a highly discounted price.
More than that, you join us and make a statement about the importance of technology and security.
We have created several different perks to offer Smart Tracker at prices up to 60% off of retail price, as well as some special perks.

Stretch Goals :













We have developed a rigorous testing and quality control process to insure your Smart Tracker arrives in perfect condition. The packaging is designed and we have a partner waiting to produce it. We have investigated and secured the logistics partners needed for safe delivery worldwide. 





A NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS:
Please note:  Backers will be responsible for any and all customs, import duties, and local taxes you may incur in your country of residence.  We recommend you ask your local tax authorities what you will incur based on the value of your pledge.  Please understand that we have no control over what your own country will charge you in VAT and import duties.  As a final note, we cannot misrepresent the customs information.  We appreciate your understanding in this matter.





GPS tracking devices have become incredibly important to daily life, both for individuals as well as for business. For companies who run primarily through delivery shipments and cargo, a GPS tracking device can ensure the security of the cargo, compare driver’s planned routes against their actual travel time, length of the trip, and more. Using a GPS device can also ensure that a wayward employee doesn’t wander away with a company vehicle without prior authorization from the company itself. 




Personal use of GPS tracking devices has also grown in scope and necessity, as well. From tracking a possible instance of infidelity, keeping an eye on a teenage driver (Smart Tracker has a Speeding alert), or protecting the safety of an older loved one suffering from memory loss, dementia, or Alzheimer's, using a GPS tracking device can mean the difference between love and loss, life and death. Finding a GPS unit that can accomplish all of these tasks, maintain a low profile, and remain affordable to both a business owner as well as a private consumer, while being user-friendly, can be difficult to find, especially all in one package.

Molnár.
The PunkTrek
lamps are unique, handmade products, which I’ve been preparing for more than
one year now.
These are cute and sometimes astounding home decorations. 
I enjoy to use wide range of raw materials. I love rethink, remodel old, worn-out
items, and combined old and new technologies. 
The lamps have personality. Qualitative products and also illuminate.
I made my first
lamp for my wife, it's name is our lamp family. It had a
great feedbacks from our friends, many people suggested, that I should
continue creating lamps. So did I.What I do.I would like
to create the following 3 categories of products:1. Unique
table, -wall, -mood lamps, and chandelier

These are already prepared.You can view below link: www.punktrek.com2. Do it yourself lampSemi-finished products, so-called 'do it yourself' lamp:)These
products are for those, who are enjoying to prepare, painting, but don't wan’t
to do the electrical installation.Therefore I
do foundations, electrical part, and drilling, meanwhile the necessary
materials for decoration is enclosed in the package.
The first
'do it yourself' lamp is chicken-lamp.You can see the sample below link: www.punktrek.com/diyContents of
the package:
- Two pieces of tile.
- Bamboo sticks for legs, and fasteners.
- Cable and switch with plug fitted ready for final assembly. When
ordering, you can select the color and material of cable, you can choose from
52 colors, fabric or flax cable. (Cables made by Tilka)- Socket and
bulb.- 3 cans of paint (when ordering you can choose paint color)The second 'do it yourself' lamp is ""Family-lamp"".Coming Soon - 2014 July3. Create an
individual lamp based received material.I conjure
unique lamp from your old teddy bear or your grandma’s meat-grinder.
The first step is to customer sent me a photograph of the object, the
dimensions and any wishes.
Based on this photo, I make some plan, and budget plan.
If you like either one, you can post me the object, and the work is starting…:)You can
watch such a transformation on:  www.punktrek.com/memoriesContactsYou can see previous works below:www.etsy.comwww.punktrek.comFacebookObjectives
I turned to
Community Funding, because I would like to develop my own enterprise (PunkTrek)
I like to
establish a manufactory, where we produce specific and / or limited edition
products with high quality.Primary
goals:
1. rent
workshop, expansion product-palette.
2. Buying tools
3. Buying raw materials
4. Marketing
5. In the future open my own shop
1. Workshop:Now, I work in
my little flat, on a little table.
I would like to rent a workshop, where I can develop my creativity.
2. Machine,
tools:I should buy
some essential machines/tools. 
So I can work faster and more efficiently.
3. Raw
materials:So that it
can realize my ideas, I need necessary more and more materials. Therefore I
like to expand my stock.
4.
Marketing:Nowadays
advertising is vital important. How it could play out in the general public
with news, that PunkTrek lives and works. :)
5. Own shop:In the
future I would like to open a shop, where an open workshop gets a place too.
Here, anyone can see, purchase our products, but also provide a space for
public works.FinancingAt the
begining I have received great support from my family and friends. As a result
I could lay a base of new business.
But to proceed outside help is needed, therefore, is to start a
Indiegogo-project.

Depending on the support I plan to the next steps:4000 $ - Raw
materials and Marketing
Raw
Materials:- Electrical
installation materials: fabric cables, sockets, bulbs, switches, etc..

<p>Traffic headache--Handy to have one in the car too</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span>Here is where it all started:</span></strong></h3>
<p><span>We went on a trip last spring-- we did a lot of hiking, boating, cycling, and even rented some scooters for a day (ya I know- Harley’s would have been cooler!). Anyway, we had to carry a few pills with us, and wanted to take some gum etc. So I ended up carrying this bulky plastic pill bottle around with different pills and some gum  in my front pocket for a few days. Every time we needed something I would dump it out in my hand and sort through them.  It got uncomfortable and pretty annoying; (I’m a travel light kinda guy!) I looked all around for a thin cool looking pill case while we were there and couldn't find one. When I got home I looked online and around the stores and still couldn't find one I liked. So, I decided to create what I wanted—&amp; thought others might like it too!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong><span>The evolution of thought and development:</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong><img alt=""Hand drawing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pill_box_hand_drwg.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Hand Drawing""/></p>
<p>First sketch, not drawn on a napkin--but close! Finished product is roughly 2"" x 3"" and less than 1/2"" thick.</p>
<p>Then I created the ""first"" computer drawing with a latch like the one on the sketch.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Resin proto"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pill_box_development_002.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Resin proto""/></p>
<p>This is a resin prototype from the first computer drawing to get a general feel--I wanted something I could hold in my hand to see if I was even in the ballpark.?...Lots of issues to sort out!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Black smooth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/black_smooth_proto.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Black smooth""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>First prototype mold with our new custom designed latch feature for a more secure hold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""prototype with days of week"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pill_box_development_012.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototype with days of week""/></p>
<p>Second revision prototype mold, with this revision I wanted to thicken walls to give it more rigidity, strengthen all parts, and add some  text cues inside.</p>
<p>At this point I had several made and handed them out to a group of people I knew to test them --the price of friendship :)!  I got some good feedback. I decided to loose the MTWHF thing, I was thinking weekender, but it just confused people. We just went to the simplified 1234 --organize as you will--or not... Trying one out myself I decided to give the latch pads just a bit more surface area as well, just enough to keep it slim in your pocket, but make it easier to open. I also decided to roll with the new latch design it worked great! It stays closed much better than the former latch, and as a bonus it works well for righties and lefties! So back to the drawing board for some final changes.</p>
<p> <img alt=""final line drawing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pillbox_ver_07_open_line.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""final line drawing""/></p>
<p>Ah-the final drawing...Ya!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""Orange dull texture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pill_box_development_008.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Orange dull textrue""/></p>
<p>Prototype mold 3 revision completed to make the changes, send the mold out for texturing and we're close!</p>
<p>Oh, also I added the word ""Lift"" on the tab--always good to know which way is up! :)</p>
<p>The new texture disappointed me at first, you could hardly see it, $1000. bucks to texture 1 prototype cavity--I expected more...!  So I got some metal polish and a micro fiber cloth, grabbed a drink, put on some tunes and ""carefully"" hand polished the final prototype mold for hours...</p>
<p> <img alt=""Orange gloss"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://medicinegear.com/images/campaign/pill_box_development_009.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Orange glossy ""/></p>
<p>...but with this new polished look--worth every minute!</p>
<p>And final prototype design is done--Awesome!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lien the title of your best car &amp; spend a year developing a product--a challenging but fun process!!</p>
<p>But whats even better...the people that tested the final product REALLY liked it! Helps make it all worth while...I hope you really like it too!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>So why do I need you as a funder?</strong></h3>
<p>I've proofed the concept, design, and prototypes, I have a functional prototype mold that I can make a few parts from, and I've created a website <a href=""http://medicinegear.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MedicineGear.com</a> as a platform to eventually sell from. But-- there is a long way to go! The funds I receive will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>First item of business will be to create a polished production mold! Trying to fill orders with a single cavity prototype mold is like trying to paint your living room with a 1 inch brush, or mow your lawn with a line trimmer--it probably could be done, but would not be pleasant! You really need a roller and a mower! In this case I really need a production mold-- these molds are very expensive but produce more parts more efficiently with less waste.  Actually allowing you to fill multiple orders and compete in the market place. </li>
<li>Secondly we need to fulfill the Perks to a very diserving group of people!!!</li>
<li>Then,  we will need to produce inventory to fill orders and to stock the shelf for efficient fulfillment.</li>
<li>Finally, there will be mailer packaging, and eventually store hang packs etc.</li>
</ul><p>I found some competitive pricing close to home. They will be produced here in the USA.  I will fulfill orders out of my home, garage, storage room &amp; possibly the neighbors garage when they're not looking :). </p>
<p>Please help us spread the word, and pass this campaign along to others you think might also be interested!</p>
<h3>So in short; I'm very appreciative of your contributions, your help &amp; support--Thank you!</h3>

<h1>What's The Grand Owl?</h1>
<p>This is our first Campaign, We’re as passionate about design, comfort and style as you are. We know that a wallet says more about a man than just his money. We know that it says who you are.</p>
<p>We created Grand Owl with that idea in mind. Our exclusive designs and <br/>popular look draws heads. And unlike those retail-markup designer brands <br/>that cost an arm and a leg, Grand Owl leather wallets won’t break the bank.</p>They may cost a fraction of the price, but they deliver superior quality and<br/>durability. Grand Owl wallets are made to last. Each is made with these <br/>three key details in mind:<br/><br/><p>When designing this Wallet, we made sure of THREE details:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimalist sleek look that can be matched with a casual or<br/>professional wardrobe;</li>
<li>Only made with the highest quality materials available;</li>
<li>Outstanding comfort and security.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

This is our first Campaign, We’re as passionate about design, comfort and style as you are. We know that a wallet says more about a man than just his money. We know that it says who you are.
We created Grand Owl with that idea in mind. Our exclusive designs and popular look draws heads. And unlike those retail-markup designer brands that cost an arm and a leg, Grand Owl leather wallets won’t break the bank.They may cost a fraction of the price, but they deliver superior quality anddurability. Grand Owl wallets are made to last. Each is made with these three key details in mind:When designing this Wallet, we made sure of THREE details:

A minimalist sleek look that can be matched with a casual orprofessional wardrobe;
Only made with the highest quality materials available;
Outstanding comfort and security.








Color OptionsOur first style 'The Grand Owl' is available  in 4 matte colors. It's made from a durable quality leather that will last years.





The Grand Owl is backed with a warranty. If there’s any problem with the Grand Owl or you’re just not satisfied with it, return it for a full refund.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Since birth I have been fascinated with art and all that it has to offer. I was never extremely talented at drawing, painting or sculpting but I always had that artistic drive. It is something I've constantly worked at and tried to polish my skills over the years. It is also a therapeutic process for me, and I'm going to school to be able to share this type of therapy with others. I found graphic design a couple years ago, which helped me showcase my creative thoughts in a clean, neat way. Along with loving art, I've always loved t-shirts. I would like to meld my creations into a wearable art display. Donating will help me achieve my dreams of building a t-shirt design company. Thank you for your support, and help. It means the world to me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds are all going towards costs for raw materials and the printing process, this also means a better t-shirt quality. After price checking with multiple companies and finally finding one that has amazingly soft, durable, and beautiful printing and calculating totals $1,500 came to be the low estimate. <br/></p>

<p>I understand times are tough, and wallets are lighter so to show you how much I appreciate your donations there's a list of perks!<br/></p>

We rolled out a sock of the month club (learn more here) that now boasts over 1,000 members.Last October, we launched a Kickstarter campaign and managed to raise $30,342.  This set our company in a new trajectory, and we’ve continued to grow ever since.We’ve collaborated with organizations such as the Negro Leagues Museum in Kansas City to help raise awareness and funds for their mission.Coming off the success of our Kickstarter campaign last year, we partnered with Les Norman in the “Create Happy Feet” campaign benefiting City Union Mission.  We donated over 500 pairs of new socks to help clothe the homeless.We've come a long way!  But, our work is never done!Next Step:  Women’s LineAt your request, our next step is to roll out a women’s line.Based on all the emails we received from you, we now know that women have the same problem as men!  Women tend to pay upwards of $20 for a pair of colorful socks!Now, we are excited to bring our Trifecta Unicorn ways of doing things to you through our women’s line and sock of the month club.We teamed up with our designers and you, our loyal customers, to create a mix of unique designs for calf and knee high socks with the same affordable pricing.  We are looking to sell calf-high socks for $7 and knee-high socks for $10.  This is a savings of over 50% from what you would find at some of the big retailers!What We Need & What You GetWe are now asking for $10,000 on Indiegogo to get our Women’s Line off the ground.  Even after all of our research and surveys, we want to make sure this is something you want while raising money to fund our initial order.How Funds Will Be SpentAll funds will go to the purchase of inventory for the women’s line, design of new socks, and future production of our women’s sock of the month club.  After raising over $30,000 last fall on Kickstarter, we would love to blow the $10,000 number away to create some awesome socks for you this holiday season.  The more we raise, the more we are able to put toward design and production of our women’s line and sock of the month club.PerksYou can get great deals on our socks and sock of the month club through our perks that are not normally offered through our website.Be sure to get in early on our great early bird specials!These perks apply to our men’s and women’s line.  You can mix and match men’s and women’s socks as part of your perk.  Get socks for yourself and give some to that special someone in your life for the holidays or special occasion.We also have two high dollar perks that are amazing deals on custom logo socks.  For $2,500, we will design and manufacture to your specifications 250 pairs of custom logo socks for you, your business, or organization.

I was experiencing to go away. </strong></p>
<p>So, I conducted more research while frantically twisting my hair, and engaged in some good old fashioned self-evaluation.<strong> </strong>I thought back to my college years when I had hand-sewed several bags using reclaimed denim shirts. That spark ignited a flame.</p>
<p><span>Pansy Maiden was born in the spring of 2009.  A year before, I had known very little about the “business” world and frankly, very little about designing and sewing bags. What I did know was that <strong>I wanted my life’s work to engage my creative tendencies, and to <em>mean</em> something to me</strong><strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>At that time I was a “9-years-strong” vegetarian (now you can add “4-years-strong” vegan to that total) who decided that fashion + entrepreneurship would be my form of activism. <strong>My ""ah-ha"" moment came when I realized that I, with the help of my company, could spread positivity and <em>possibly even inspire action</em> in others.</strong></span></p>

<p>Now I find myself in 2013 with an actual cruelty-free, eco-centric business (I'm a <em>Business Lady</em>?!). I have <br/>developed a strong brand and gained a following via social networks in the vegan community as well as the creative communities of Boston. Pansy Maiden has been featured on popular websites such as Alicia Silverstone's The Kind Life Blog, GirlieGirlArmy, and Daily Candy. Two of my bags are currently on display in the latest sustainable design installation at Disney's Epcot Center. <strong>The demand for my products is growing exponentially. And I am still hand-making every single item in my home studio.</strong> Boutiques across the country would like to carry my line but I do not have time to supply their needs. Add my first child, due July 4th (!), to the mix and I'm quickly realizing that I simply cannot keep making every single Pansy Maiden/Alva DoRight bag with my own two hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em><strong>The time has come to expand my brand, my reach, and my activist-fashion message far and wide. I need your support.</strong></em></h2>

<p>I need to raise $12,000 in order to hire six trusted seamstresses from one local sewing shop in Quincy, Massachusetts (thus keeping my bags locally handmade) to produce an initial inventory of 200 bags. The sales from this inventory will provide enough gross earnings for me to 1) reinvest in additional inventory, 2) provide myself an <em>actual</em> living wage and 3) free up some of my time for marketing efforts. <strong>Here is the breakdown of funds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>27.5%: Materials for 200 bags </li>
<li>57.5%: Outside labor costs to make 200 bags</li>
<li>8%: Marketing efforts</li>
<li>7%: third party fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If I reach my goal and my campaign has not expired, please don't let that stop you from donating :) $12,000 is actually a modest amount when it comes to working with outside sewers. With additional funds, I will be able to have even more bags made and that would be fan-tastic!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal of $12,000, I will adjust the number of bags I will have made via outside contracting accordingly. Your support will still be appreciated and used effectively and efficiently, but I do fear that 200 bags is the bare-minimum I will need outside seamstresses to produce in order to really move ahead in a manner that will ultimately be sustainable for my business. </p>

<p>I only need an initial order of 200 bags so that I may spring-board my partnership with a local sewing shop. I hope to grow with them from there. I just need a nice starting point. As stated above, the sales from this initial inventory will provide enough gross earnings for me to reinvest in additional inventory, provide myself an <em>actual</em> living wage, and free up some of my time for marketing efforts. Your contribution will allow me to grow my brand into an even stronger, sustainable agent of change for the animals and our Earth by helping me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide enriching, enjoyable jobs to my local economy that will allow at least six other women to do what they love--something I have always dreamt of doing.</li>
<li>Rather than spending all my time sewing, I will have time to devote to building my activist brand. Less time sewing = more time to devote to marketing efforts, thus building and spreading my activist fashion message to a much wider, broader market.</li>
<li>Help to assure a smooth launch of my new men's collection, Alva DoRight, this summer. This one launch will expand my market by nearly 50%!</li>
<li>Move from a Made-to-Order model to an In-Stock/Ready-to-Ship model. My customers will no longer have to wait 2-3 weeks to receive their bags in the mail. I believe this will make people more apt to buy, thus increasing my revenues, thus making my cruelty-free brand more likely to succeed and inspire action in others.</li>
<li>Assure that I will always have a stock of bags so that I may participate in more pop-up shops and conventions around the country. This will help me build my brand and name recognition significantly.  </li>
<li>Allow me to have a life outside of Pansy Maiden so that I may, you know, help my husband raise our daughter.</li>

</div>
<p> </p></div>","In an anxiety-ridden moment in 2007 after having watched Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, a ""lighthearted"" documentary about the perils of climate change, I sought solace through Google.  I ""Googled"" terms I thought might light the way for me to get my hands dirty in the Green/Animal Rights Movement. I wanted the horrible feeling of helplessness (ie: ""...humans, animals...we are all doomed..."") I was experiencing to go away. 
So, I conducted more research while frantically twisting my hair, and engaged in some good old fashioned self-evaluation. I thought back to my college years when I had hand-sewed several bags using reclaimed denim shirts. That spark ignited a flame.
Pansy Maiden was born in the spring of 2009.  A year before, I had known very little about the “business” world and frankly, very little about designing and sewing bags. What I did know was that I wanted my life’s work to engage my creative tendencies, and to mean something to me. 
At that time I was a “9-years-strong” vegetarian (now you can add “4-years-strong” vegan to that total) who decided that fashion + entrepreneurship would be my form of activism. My ""ah-ha"" moment came when I realized that I, with the help of my company, could spread positivity and possibly even inspire action in others.

  


Now I find myself in 2013 with an actual cruelty-free, eco-centric business (I'm a Business Lady?!). I have developed a strong brand and gained a following via social networks in the vegan community as well as the creative communities of Boston. Pansy Maiden has been featured on popular websites such as Alicia Silverstone's The Kind Life Blog, GirlieGirlArmy, and Daily Candy. Two of my bags are currently on display in the latest sustainable design installation at Disney's Epcot Center. The demand for my products is growing exponentially. And I am still hand-making every single item in my home studio. Boutiques across the country would like to carry my line but I do not have time to supply their needs. Add my first child, due July 4th (!), to the mix and I'm quickly realizing that I simply cannot keep making every single Pansy Maiden/Alva DoRight bag with my own two hands.
 
The time has come to expand my brand, my reach, and my activist-fashion message far and wide. I need your support.
 
 
 



I need to raise $12,000 in order to hire six trusted seamstresses from one local sewing shop in Quincy, Massachusetts (thus keeping my bags locally handmade) to produce an initial inventory of 200 bags. The sales from this inventory will provide enough gross earnings for me to 1) reinvest in additional inventory, 2) provide myself an actual living wage and 3) free up some of my time for marketing efforts. Here is the breakdown of funds:

27.5%: Materials for 200 bags 
57.5%: Outside labor costs to make 200 bags
8%: Marketing efforts
7%: third party fees

If I reach my goal and my campaign has not expired, please don't let that stop you from donating :) $12,000 is actually a modest amount when it comes to working with outside sewers. With additional funds, I will be able to have even more bags made and that would be fan-tastic!
If I do not reach my goal of $12,000, I will adjust the number of bags I will have made via outside contracting accordingly. Your support will still be appreciated and used effectively and efficiently, but I do fear that 200 bags is the bare-minimum I will need outside seamstresses to produce in order to really move ahead in a manner that will ultimately be sustainable for my business. 
 
 
 

My undying love and appreciation for helping me build upon my dream of making a living while making the world a better place for all animals (and that includes humans--we are all animals, yes?) And perks. Many, many perks. 
I wanna show y'all how much I appreciate and honor your support with not only warm fuzzies, x's + o's, and good karma but also with extra amazing incentives. 
The $5 and $10 donation levels are pretty self-explanatory (and exciting, right?!) Just look to the column on the right to learn more about those.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>From designer hopefuls to ambitious photographers, hungry stylists to determined models, everyone's looking to get a piece of the fashion world.  Our aim is to bring the stage to these artistic hopefuls in order to garner them the exposure needed to inspire and cultivate creativity in their field.</p>
<h3>Why Houston?  Will We Expand?</h3>
Houston is a city full of starving artists.

<h3>1.) Can I use perscription lenses with my new UNIQBROWs?</h3>
<p>You absolutely can!  Take our frames and lenses to any optician with your perscritpion and they will produce you a pair of perscription lenses like any other pair of glasses.</p>
<h3>2.) Can I wear non sunlenses?</h3>
<p>Of course, but legally we have to remind you that if you are going to be in the sun, you should wear sun lenses.  Your mom would be proud of us for reminding you.  </p>
<h3>3.) Is the whole frame flexible?</h3>
<p>We designed the glasses to have a strong structure that will give you the solid fit you are used to. Our innovative soft material for the external finish will give you incredible soft comfort on your face.</p>
<h3>4.) After I buy my first pair, how do I get more?</h3>
<p>We are going to start selling online in Spain and the US with free delivery.  We will then be selling in shops througout Europe, you will find the locations on our website, and updated regularly.  Or shoot us an email and we can see how we can get some more UNIQBROWs to you.</p>
<h3>5.) Will you have a warranty?</h3>

<h3>7.) When I change lenses between frames, how do I keep them clean?</h3>
<p>With every pair of UNIQBROW frames you get a super cool microfiber cloth with the UNIQBROW logo.  We recommend when you are taking out or inserting the lenses you use this cloth.  Or if you don't, you can use the cloth afterwards to clean the lenses as good as new!  Lenses and frames can be cleaned with luke warm water and non-aggressive detergent.</p>
<h3>8.) Optics by Carl Zeiss Vision lenses sound pretty awesome, do you have more info?</h3>
<p>We were focused on making every aspect of UNIQBROWs high quality, from frames to lenses. Carl Zeiss Vision manufactures the highest quality lenses with the most thorough UV protection testing in the industry.  We promise these are the best lenses around!</p>

<p><strong>The 948 model is a remix of the square broadside sunglasses that were popular in the sixties and seventies, we have reinvented them because we felt it was a style begging to be brought back.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","What people are saying about us:
 ""A revelation in a market begging for innovation.""
 ""A chance to be yourself, and be creative, everyday.""
 ""The power to change your look everyday.""
 ""Changing the way you will wear sunglasses.""
 ""Upgrade your style with a pair from UNIQBROW""
 ""Change your frames as often as your underwear.""
 

Everyday we left home wearing the same pair of glasses despite changing every other aspect of our look, it was driving us mad!  So one day we trudged over to our boss's corner office busted open the window ripped open our shirts and screamed ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" We bailed on our day jobs and for the past year we have poured our hearts into one common goal: give people the ability to have a unique pair of glasses everyday, designed and manufactured to the highest quality.  

With one pair of our lenses you will be able to remove them and insert them into every pair of UNIQBROW frames.
 
 

We are starting with three models, each with a collection of 12 vibrant colors.  
 
  

We have built a really cool internal structure that fits across all the models, and allows you to fit the same pair of frames into all the lenses.
 
  

Removing and inserting the lenses is as easy as putting on your socks....or tying your shoes for those in the anti-sock camp.  See the demo here
 
 

We are not just about colors, we have worked to create innovative new designs that reinvent classic looks.  Our collection is a marriage of retro, with our own personal re-imagining of how they can fit into the modern society of 2013.  You won’t need a flying Delorean for this back to the future experience, but you will need a credit card to ride this train.   
You can see the 219 sit perfectly on the bridge of the nose, and dogs love them too!
 

The 219 isn’t just for the young, grandmas love these babies, and the 518 looks stylish even when you are cleaning fish at the market...
 
 

Or if you are looking to do some skateboarding, the 518 has a firm hold to stay on your face even when you are bailing on a sick 180 BS Noseslide.
 
 

The 948 looks totally sweet on the raddest hipsters...
 
 

Or the 948 can be tailored to match your beard color 
 

Our branded case, boxes, micro-fiber towels, and pouches that will come with every pair!

Sorry we forgot to introduce ourselves, how rude!
 
   Cristina Brossa: Cris spent six years working in audio visual production at the CCCB (look it up, they do radical exhibitions).  She has a master in Fine Arts, graphic design, and audio visual production.  She has also been a freelance graphic designer for way too long, and wants to get out of the game.  Since meeting a handsome American on a beach in Croatia during a vacation in 2010 she has spent time working for museums in San Francisco, and building UNIQBROW.  She has two grandmas that are 90 years old, both have more energy than a 12 year old kid.
   Mireia Subirana: Mireia also spent several years working for the CCCB, mainly preparing coffees for her boss. She now has a masters in coffee making.  Ok, she also has real credentials as well.  Mireia spent several years working as a freelance doing interaction design and audio visual production. She has a masters in graphic and digital design and a postgraduate in exhibition design.  Her love of new media art blossomed after she spent time living in some eccentric corners of Berlin.  She also created the worlds largest game of pong that was projected across The Ramblas in Barcelona.
   Andrew Swiler: Spent several years as a consultant working for retail companies.  He got fed up and traveled in 2010 where he met a young woman from Barcelona on a beach in Croatia.  His life has been pretty strange ever since.  He spent time working for startups in San Francisco, built his own startup company in Barcelona that was a colossal flame out, and lost his hair (though that was likely a genetic defect).

We strive to improve the quality of life and standard of living of those who need it most.<br/><br/>In August  2013, we joined forces with Project Founders Dr. Joanna Cherry and Scott Gillenwater to expand a project with already astonishing potential. Project Stitch is an early-stage program that has a huge opportunity to drastically change lives while enriching the economy in a post-disaster society. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/239400/files/20131203082325-IMG_4499__1_.jpg?1386087805"" src="""" style=""""/><span><br/></span></p><h3>

</h3><p></p><br/><p>Project Stitch creates beautiful handmade products of the highest quality. While we have a social side to our initiative, our goal is to make incredible products that our customers are excited to wear. </p><br/><p>Our first product line is men’s neck ties. These ties come in two materials: a bold cotton with Haitian flare and a professional silk. Each tie comes embroidered with the Project Stitch logo on the back, a branded cloth carrying bag and a story card explaining the importance of Project Stitch and the story of the sewer who made your tie. </p><br/><p>We are excited to be making these ties and we hope you enjoy wearing them as much as we enjoy making them! Remember, each handmade garment tells a story, so whether you’re heading to a wedding, conference or business meeting, let your outfit look its best while keeping Haiti close to your heart. </p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/239660/files/20131203100113-IMG_3575.JPG?1386093673"" src="""" style=""""/><p><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Program!</span><br/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><p>Project stitch is a Trade Training  and employment enrichment program based out of Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

Who is Enactus Memorial...and What is Project Stitch?Enactus Memorial is an award-winning student volunteer organization based out of Memorial University of Newfoundland. We strive to improve the quality of life and standard of living of those who need it most.In August  2013, we joined forces with Project Founders Dr. Joanna Cherry and Scott Gillenwater to expand a project with already astonishing potential. Project Stitch is an early-stage program that has a huge opportunity to drastically change lives while enriching the economy in a post-disaster society. 
Our Product!
Project Stitch creates beautiful handmade products of the highest quality. While we have a social side to our initiative, our goal is to make incredible products that our customers are excited to wear. Our first product line is men’s neck ties. These ties come in two materials: a bold cotton with Haitian flare and a professional silk. Each tie comes embroidered with the Project Stitch logo on the back, a branded cloth carrying bag and a story card explaining the importance of Project Stitch and the story of the sewer who made your tie. We are excited to be making these ties and we hope you enjoy wearing them as much as we enjoy making them! Remember, each handmade garment tells a story, so whether you’re heading to a wedding, conference or business meeting, let your outfit look its best while keeping Haiti close to your heart. The Program!Project stitch is a Trade Training  and employment enrichment program based out of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In a developed country, a disability can be very isolating, but in Haiti, these people become completely cut off from the world around them. Project Stitch allows Haitians who have suffered these life-changing injuries from the devastating 2010 earthquake or due to the danger of everyday life in Haiti, to reintegrate, and become a productive member of their local community. Through a six-month professional sewing course, these individuals are taught the necessary skills to become tailors and seamstresses. Once their training is completed, they are ready to re-enter the workforce, and we are now working on creating a brand for our co-operative starting with high quality men’s neckties and pocket squares. We need your support to help us move into a new facility and to acquire the materials and supplies necessary to move our venture into full scale production.Why $31,000?Project stitch is currently being run from a small room in Hospital Bernard Mevs. This is just across the hall from where many of the program’s participants spent so much time in recovery from their injuries. This room, no larger than a bedroom in your home, can hold approximately ten participants, and currently the most experienced of them are working on production of the ties.We are now looking for capital to move our tie production team into a full-scale production facility which will allow us to use our space at Hospital Bernard Mevs to train more Haitians in need. We have a new location selected, but it is in no way ready to be moved into. We need $20,000 for new building expenses, rent, renovations and a generator. We are also in need of $11,000 for supplies and equipment to start production and to push our next two underprivileged classes through the program. Any extra funds will help us increase our working space and train more Haitians in the field. Enactus Memorial is 100% not-for-profit. That means that every cent of revenue from the sale of the neckties and this crowd sourcing campaign will go directly to develop the program and supporting the participants. We are working with many designs and alongside industry professionals in men’s apparel to nail down the final product. We have figured out the perfect offset and location for the rear logo and the colors which would best complement it.  Everything from the width, weight, length ,stitching, materials and all the other factors which make up Project Stitch ties have been considered. Our cotton patterned cotton ties will turn heads and pull together any outfit for the perfect amount of flare. Our silk ties are the perfect accessory to tap into your professionalism while creating the perfect conversation piece when entertaining a crowd. We welcome any funds invested into this social enterprise.  Even if we do not reach our goal  your contributions will still help us  move classes throughout the program and source materials which will help us build our brand and move toward securing a national retailer to carry our ties. Check out this short video to see a day at project stitch!Brace for Your Impact!Project Stitch provides each participant with training, their own personal sewing machine, materials and transportation; we plan to train a new class every six months. We will only create employment for those Haitians who need it, so all  sewing instructors and employees of Project Stitch are native Haitians.When making your donation, remember that you are enriching the lives of people who have been through so much, and they deserve a chance at forging a new career for themselves and reintegrating themselves into society. Will you help move a participant and their family off the street living in a tent, to a home?Will you help stop a Hatian from staring at the ceiling from their hospital bed knowing they’ll  never support their families again?Will you bring a person the joy of knowing they are supporting their community after so much has happened to their people?Enactus Memorial is now involved in ten  successful community involvement projects in Canada but we are looking to make an international impact. We need your support to make it a reality.  Hey Stitch, How Else Can I Help?

</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Meet Michael. He's a 15 year old high-school allstar living in San Francisco. Three years ago, YMCA matched Michael with a Santa Monica native, Jonah. The day they met, Michael shared his dream that he would some day be able to go to college and eventually become an entrepreneur. Today, ChillerShades are here to make that happen -- and of course, to make your day brighter along the way.</span></p><p></p><h3>Brighter, you say?</h3><p>We set out to rethink a product that's a part of almost everyone's day and designed these sunglasses to be exactly what you need <b><i>no matter where you are or what you're doing</i></b>. </p><p>When you're kickin' it on a beautiful sunny day, they're super high quality sunglasses that protect your eyes by shading them. When you're rocking out in the shade or indoors, there's no need to sacrifice your look: Chillershades use advanced photochromic technology to give your view a chill bright so you won't have to take them off to see, no matter how dark it gets. Made of the highest quality wooden frames, super robust aluminum hinges, and clear photochromic lenses that protect your eyes both in the sun and in the shade, we've got you covered from sunrise to...sunrise. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We're pretty sure you'll never take them off.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><h3>Here's how it works</h3><p>You pre-order these sunglasses and <i><b>save 20% off the retail price </b></i>for being an early supporter.

Meet Michael. He's a 15 year old high-school allstar living in San Francisco. Three years ago, YMCA matched Michael with a Santa Monica native, Jonah. The day they met, Michael shared his dream that he would some day be able to go to college and eventually become an entrepreneur. Today, ChillerShades are here to make that happen -- and of course, to make your day brighter along the way.Brighter, you say?We set out to rethink a product that's a part of almost everyone's day and designed these sunglasses to be exactly what you need no matter where you are or what you're doing. When you're kickin' it on a beautiful sunny day, they're super high quality sunglasses that protect your eyes by shading them. When you're rocking out in the shade or indoors, there's no need to sacrifice your look: Chillershades use advanced photochromic technology to give your view a chill bright so you won't have to take them off to see, no matter how dark it gets. Made of the highest quality wooden frames, super robust aluminum hinges, and clear photochromic lenses that protect your eyes both in the sun and in the shade, we've got you covered from sunrise to...sunrise. We're pretty sure you'll never take them off.Here's how it worksYou pre-order these sunglasses and save 20% off the retail price for being an early supporter.

</span></p><p>Hi I'm Ryan.</p><p>I moved to San Francisco to study Human Sexuality in 2004. A big part of SF gay culture is leather and fetish street fairs such as Folsom and Dore Alley. I enjoyed the fun and sexy nature of these street fairs and liked how the leather harnesses looked on the people around me. What I also noticed was a good chunk of people just enjoyed dressing up in harnesses and fetish gear without actually intending to use the garments for sexual purposes. I saw fashion accessories and my mind started buzzing. Around this time I learned to crochet.</p>
<p>In 2009 I crocheted a soft pink harness and wore it to Folsom. The harness got an immediate, strong and positive reaction, people took pictures, and I was hooked (crochet pun intended). Each year after, I produced another crocheted harness. I experimented with different styles and colors (including a jock strap). I amassed a good number of these harnesses, and I realized that I was designing a fashion line. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and I’ve assembled a team to make a go of this. We named the dang things, and narrowed our line down to three Yarness styles (for now); we’ve fine-tuned designs, sourced yarn, figured out marketing and developed a production model to pay crafters for their time (see below for more details on that).</p>
<p>Yarness is fetish and fashion, and most of all fun. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/615199/files/20140530160219-Yarness_gif.gif?1401490939"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2></h2><h3></h3><h2>THE PERKS</h2><p><br/></p><h2></h2><h2>The Hater Tee ($25) - added 7/10</h2>Now you can take your snark offline, or support your love for Yarness!

A Yarness can dress up a outfit, especially if you pick a color that pops.Do Yarnesses behave like leather harnesses?Yarnesses are inspired by leather harnesses, but while light, durable and fun,  they are something else entirely. But don't worry, you can play with a yarness just like you would a harness. Did we just blow your mind? When can I expect my Yarness? Depending on the size of this campaign we will produce yarnesses on a first come, first serve basis. We guarantee an end-of-year delivery for Yarnesses, but if you want your Yarness now we have the special ""InstaYarness"" order option. Do you ship internationally? We do, but for an additional amount for shipping. After you make your order, we will follow up with you with the additional cost.
How do I order the Yarness? Place your order on Indiegogo, and once the crowdfunding campaign has finished, we will direct you to an online form where you can indicate your style, color, and sizing preferences.The YarnWe are using Universal Yarn, a anti-pilling acrylic yarn that has a solid hold and a great selection of bright colors. Yarnesses are vegan. How are Yarnesses made?Our production model recycles money back into the hands of local skilled crafters. We have a team of crocheters and we pay them a fair wage for their time making Yarnesses. We could have outsourced production, but we are committed to supporting local makers for work that they rarely get paid for. The price of a Yarness includes the cost of our manufacturing model. You are buying a US-made handcrafted good. If you are interested in becoming a maker, please visit: http://yarness.me/make/Why Crowdfunding?After wearing Yarnesses for years, countless people have asked where to buy one. This is only anecdotal evidence, and without any large investors in the project we decided to crowdfund Yarness to help us:1. Gauge demand - How many people actually want this? Doing this campaign will help us understand the scale of the project.2. Build capital - The money we make with this campaign will help us buy supplies/inventory, pay makers and market the product.3. Establish urgency - Look, we could go open an Etsy store but that's hard to get the word out about. With only 43 days to purchase a Yarness we are hoping to gather all orders at once to make production a lot more manageable.Any other questions?
