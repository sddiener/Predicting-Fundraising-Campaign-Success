<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Crippled Trust</i> is the sequel to <i>Demon Hunter</i> and picks up with Kate Ryder at summer’s end. Being a Slayer, partnering with Jared Ford, and fighting monsters is just as much an adventure as she’d thought it would be. But now a new enemy is on the scene and looking to tear the world—and her—apart.<br/><br/>My name is A.K. Walker and I am the author of <i>Crippled Trust</i>. I wrote this book because Kate and Jared’s story is far from over and this is the next part of their ongoing adventures and battles.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how Kate’s journey has progressed as she embraces the Network life and becoming a Slayer, and how complicated what seemed like a straightforward job can become. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from our reality into one filled with monsters and magic that lurks just beneath the surface, and engage with Kate and Jared as they continue to navigate the twists and turns thrown their way together.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Summer is coming to an end, and life couldn’t be better for Kate Ryder. Traveling across the country, fighting the supernatural, living through adventures that she only could have dreamed of a year earlier? She’s found her calling, and since defeating Rosh, it’s been a straightforward, uncomplicated, extraordinary rush. Sure, there’s the small issue of being able to read dead languages and seeing the future—but her partner, Jared Ford, has been handling it like a pro. With a friend like him, facing ghosts, ghouls, and anything else that goes bump in the night is more exciting than terrifying. Together, the two of them can face just about any threat that comes their way.<br/><br/>But if there’s anything the Network has taught Kate, it’s that nothing stays simple for long. While Jared’s been keeping them away from all things Hell-related, demons have been regrouping to carry out a plan that’s been in the works for years. Now, new threats and enemies are popping up far closer to home than she’d like, and the people that she’d thought she could trust most might not be who she thought they were. In fact, <i>Kate</i> might not be who she thought she was. Life’s twists and turns are becoming far harder to anticipate, secrets are coming to light, and she’s beginning to think she may not be as in control of her fate as she’d thought. All Kate can hope for now is to face it all with her dagger in hand and Jared at her side. She can always count on him... Right?</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoyed <i>Demon Hunter</i>, have a good sense of humor, and enjoy reading about extraordinary, supernatural adventures in an ordinary world.<br/><br/><i>Crippled Trust</i> speaks to young adults and teenagers alike who grapple with balancing everyday life and new, seemingly-impossible challenges, all while seeing the world around them in an entirely new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Crippled Trust</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s worse—enemies who know a secret truth, or the friends who kept it from you?</li>
<li>What happens when someone realizes their partner trusts them even less than they trust themselves?</li>
<li>How has Kate Ryder partnered with Jared Ford for months and not lost her mind yet?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. </p>
<p> </p>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 paperback copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

She’s mostly self-taught, and has been writing since high school, using most of her free-time to create short stories and develop the Slayers’ adventures. <br/><br/>Fairy tales and urban legends have been a part of her life since the beginning, and she wanted to create her own to brighten the world around her and make the mundane a little more exciting. A.K. wrote this book to share with others a world she’s been building since high school, in the hope that it could inspire others to explore their imagination and reality in a new light.<br/><br/>A.K.‘s writing has been supported by two loving parents and a younger brother, all of whom had to put up with far too many late hours of loud, slow typing coupled with frustrated mumbles about said-typing. Her sense of humor – while endearing – is often sarcastic and cheesy, and her ability to balance being an athlete and an absolute clutz is unparalleled.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with A.K. at a.k.walker.slayers@gmail.com and on Instagram @a.k_walker<br/><br/> <h2>International Preorders</h2>For international preorders, please send me a private message.<br/> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<p>I cannot express enough how thankful I am for all of the support you have shown me over the past couple of years and throughout the book writing process. I want more than anything to travel to your cities and meet all of you in person to express my gratitude, but we have virtually no budget left over after creating this book so I need your help! </p>

<p>The goal listed is the minimum I need ($5,500 + Indiegogo fees) to make this book tour happen.

I cannot express enough how thankful I am for all of the support you have shown me over the past couple of years and throughout the book writing process. I want more than anything to travel to your cities and meet all of you in person to express my gratitude, but we have virtually no budget left over after creating this book so I need your help!

<p><strong>THE HELENS OF TROY</strong></p>
<p>After helping Bernadette Mayer work on her project, THE HELENS OF TROY, NY, I decided that we needed to continue the project by visiting TROY, MO. We will interview and photograph all the Helens of Troy, Missouri I can find. Poems will be written based of these interviews and a short section of the history of the city with photographs will conclude the book. Homer would glory in telling the story of Troy, Missouri.</p>
<p>The Helens of Troy, NY is a book of poetry and photographs featuring women named Helen from the city of Troy, New York. Inspired by her knowledge of ancient Greek and the mythic character Helen of Troy, Mayer conducted interviews with these local women, photographed them and their surroundings and created a book of poems with a visual presentation of each Helen.</p>
<p>New Directions Press released the work as part of their reinstituted pamphlet series this year. More information can be found on their website:  <a href=""http://ndbooks.com/book/poetry-pamphlets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ndbooks.com/book/poetry-pamphlets</a></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Emmaline Westlund (commonly known on the internet as Skrain, Elmo, Gul Dukat, etc....) and I am a writer of short stories. And I have a dream.</div>
<div>My dream is simple, but it will take dedication and a lot of money, but in the end of all things, it will be a REALLY cool thing.</div>
<div>The money raised from this campaign will be used to fund a cross country trip in which I will camp in all of the lower forty eight states, gathering inspiration and writing a short story (up to 10,000 words) in each state, to be published in a 48 story anthology at the end of the trip. </div>
<div>The trip will be a minimum of 20 weeks, maximum of 26, probably ending up at about 24, which will give me about four days in each state. I will be staying in national parks and state parks, taking lots of pictures and liveblogging the majority of the trip. </div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Basically, I need money to fund gas and food and electricity and whatnot. Also to guard against the possibility of complete car breakdown. </div>
<div>If you donate, and I mean this: If you donate, you will get a signed paperback copy of the book. It doesn't matter the ""level"" you donate at- IF YOU DONATE TO THIS CAMPAIGN YOU WILL GET A FREE, SIGNED COPY OF THE PAPERBACK VERSION OF THIS BOOK. </div>
<div>(That being said, if you donate more than $1,000 to this cause and you live in the lower 48 US, I will take you out to dinner when I'm in your state (or something less creepy if you're creeped by the idea of someone on the internet seeking you out and taking you for food. This is at your discretion.)</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
You'll help give my writing a new, fresh perspective and bring a little more beauty from the lower 48 to the world. </div>

the Compliments…And Other Musings on Writing) continued to host the quarterly readings after the workshop disbanded in an effort to continue growing the community of writers who depended on the series as an outlet for their work.Additional events have taken place at Bluestockings in the
lower east side of Manhattan and, in 2013 the readings had a great run at La
Casa Azul Bookstore in Spanish Harlem. Under the Pluma y Tinta umbrella, panel
discussions on literary topics have taken place at The New School, and Penzo even
curated a special reading during Lit Crawl NYC 2013 featuring a roster of
powerful Latina writers and poets, including journalist Raquel Cepeda (Bird of
Paradise: How I Became Latina).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>            My name is La'Von Gittens and I have BIG dreams of becoming a New York Times Best Seller! I wrote the adult urban fantasy novel, ""Divine Apocalypse: The Beginning of the End"" For years, I desperately tried to get published, but simply, because of a lack of experience I was always told a flat out, ""No.""  <br/></p>
<p>          Eventually, I was contacted by an agent. Imagine my excitement! He got my hopes up, read my novel, and told me that he liked everything, except for one factor... that I had no previous publishing experience and he was worried about taking a chance... WELL THEN. <br/></p>
<p>           I decided to give myself some experience. So I created a small publishing company, <i>NoV'al Publishing</i>, my name backwards. It kinda sounds like ""Novel"" and it shows that Oprah isn't the only one who can be creative! I published the first novel to my series and I am currently a 4.5 on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Google Books! I created the company with the intent on finding diamonds in the ruff that could possibly be the next best seller, but have gotten lost in the politics of major publishing companies.  <br/></p>
<p><i>New York Newbies: Poetry</i>, will be the first book in an annual series that would showcase the talent of the undiscovered poets of New York City, ages 14+. Work that is submitted will be posted on the blog and viewers would have the option of voting on which poems should make the book. I will be obtaining works from various sources and participants can feel free to submit.  <br/><br/></p>

<p><b>ABOUT UNITED FAMILY MINISTRY:</b></p>
<p>United Family Ministry was created to assist
and support 2,500 children in need, ages 5-18 with incarcerated parents. The primary
objective is to bridge the gap between incarcerated parents and their children by
increasing the quality and amount of time they have to communicate physically
with one another. </p>
<p>UFM provides safe and regular transportation
for youth visiting incarcerated parents in the Shreveport/Bossier Louisiana
region. It will also aid  with social assistance and offer mentorship centered
around life skills for these youth.</p>
<p>Research has shown that children with an
incarcerated parent are traumatized, confused by their parent’s actions, and
stigmatized as well. They are also deprived of income, guidance and are
vulnerable to poverty and stressful shifts in caregivers and other family
disruptions. They are susceptible to imprisonment, substance abuse and
behavioral disorders.<br/><br/>
United Family Ministry seeks to confront these challenges and offer a place for
healing for youth with incarcerated parents. Boult states, “There exists a
culture of misunderstood and underprivileged youth who desperately need an
antidote to counter act their suffering. This antidote must derive from the
same culture that is responsible for their suffering.""</p>

A skeleton poem is a series of unfinished lines that each participant then fleshes out with their own unique brilliance. The bones of the poem are the same, but each person brings it to life with whatever is moving within them. Completed skeleton poems will be compiled and shared in a digital gallery and, potentially, in a paper press format. I also welcome the exchange of artwork, poetry and other forms of expression during this time. This is a way for all of us to navigate the cycles of life and death and rebirth over the coming months.</span></p>

Before the sudden death of my life partner six months ago, I was a Rites of Passage guide for youth, a keeper of the Women’s Circle tradition, a teacher/facilitator of conscious creativity, an international traveler, a published writer, an art activist, a believer in magic.  Now, I am a shattered woman searching for grace and the creative fire which once fueled my life’s work. 
I am reaching out for funding to support my recovery project. This campaign will allow me to write the story of my love and loss. It is my calling to find gems among the cooling ash, to dedicate myself and this book to healing and to hope. I need your support to do this.
Please watch my video, get involved, and pass the call along to your tribe!
I need to raise at least $5,000 by November 15th, 2013, in order to fund my creative space and the publication of this piece. I have estimated that this is the minimum amount needed to make this possible, additional funding will help me to write, publish and distribute this book with ease. In exchange, I am offering copies of both this book and Caminante, Bridger of Worlds, which I published at age 23 in 2008. All contributors will also have access to a monthly update with a creative correspondence component. Your support will allow me to reflect in an authentic, engaged and inspired way, the many layers of light and shadow that I have experienced; to find medicine in this madness; and to continue to develop my skills in the art of midwifing others through their own transformational processes, as I have been doing for the past 10 years. 
A ROOM OF MY OWN
With the funding I hope to receive through this campaign, I will spend the winter at Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, a mystical, healing oasis set among three volcanos which has become one of my many homes on the planet.  This is the place where my beloved and I lived for a season while I completed Caminante, Bridger Of Worlds in 2008. The budget also includes costs for first run publication of the book at the time of its completion, which is estimated for the end of 2015. Go to the Kindling for The Fire Facebook group for excerpts from Caminante.
STONE SOUP 
Call and Response



Every full moon between November 15th and the final publication of this book, supporters can expect an update on the project, including excerpts and/or artwork. Each update will also include a skeleton poem. Skeleton poems are a tool I’ve developed to invite expression, inspiration and connection. A skeleton poem is a series of unfinished lines that each participant then fleshes out with their own unique brilliance. The bones of the poem are the same, but each person brings it to life with whatever is moving within them. Completed skeleton poems will be compiled and shared in a digital gallery and, potentially, in a paper press format. I also welcome the exchange of artwork, poetry and other forms of expression during this time. This is a way for all of us to navigate the cycles of life and death and rebirth over the coming months.
This exchange will not only allow me to share my journey and my life’s work with you but will also be kindling for the fire of my recovery as I am reminded ritually each month that I am still connected to this world. 
Go to the kindling for the fire facebook group to learn more about Kindling for the Fire, a longtime vision for creative community building and intercultural healing, and to see sample skeletons.

<p>Twenty-three years ago I stood in hot, humid weather on a
rain-drenched street in Iquitos, Peru looking at an incredibly long line of
people waiting to see the team of plastic surgeons who had come to repair the
cleft lips and palates of their children. I was there to be of service and, as
so many others have found out through the ages, it was the people of Iquitos,
their children and families who gave <b><i>me </i></b>a gift I came to cherish and set
me off on a path of healing and love that continues to grow and deepen each and
every day.</p>
<p>One of those nights in Peru, I had a dream. In that dream I was
standing in a beautiful clearing inside of an open structure of pillars formed
in a circle with an obelisk in the center. That vision was so impactful I wrote
it down.</p>
<p>Fast forward a year later and I am guided to join a
Buddhist-based Spiritual Fellowship called Johrei, a path of service of
offering divine light as a method of purifying spiritual, emotional and
physical clouds. A year later that fellowship dedicated a “Sacred Grounds” near
Sao Paulo, Brazil and when I saw pictures of the place I recognized the image
from my dream and knew that one day I would visit that place and fulfill on the
vision from my dream.</p>
<p>Now, these twenty-two years later I am embarking on a Pilgrimage
to the Solo Sagrado de Guarapiranga, Brasil and invite you to be a part of that
journey. In exchange for your support, I will take your prayers, intentions and
do service in your name and the names of your loved ones who seek healing. </p>
<p>We are at a turning point on our planet where so many old ways
of operating no longer serve us. Some members of our families are still playing
out the old stories of their grandparents and parents and have become involved
with drugs, violence, gangs and are in trouble with the law. The intention of
this trip is to acknowledge our ancestors for having brought us to this time,
thanking them for their contribution and, requesting they release us from the
bondage of the Karmic clouds we carry for them, that we be free to create a new
paradigm of a life of truth, goodness and beauty for our children,
grandchildren and future generations.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>As a nurse and a healer I have had the amazing opportunity to touch many lives, and be touched in return. How Shall I Heal is based upon my years of traditional nursing, the stories are real, the emotions raw. It is the ultimate "" Everyone has a story"" as I have woven the fabric with the richness of tradition, emotions, heart wrenching transparency and the love that I have been witness to. This book has been in the concept stage for the past 10 years, in the written stage for a year. It was inspired by a conversation with a man who knew the value of life much more intimately than many. Below is a tiny segment of the story. </p>
<p></p>
<p>          "" It was
about this time that I realized how intertwined our lives as nurses became with
how we identified ourselves. I was no longer Jill, I was a nurse, mother, wife,
advocate, friend and it would be years before I could untangle myself to
realize I was Jill, a creature of the Universe. We lose our identity in what we
do, forgetting who we really are. I’m not saying that is altogether a bad
thing, but when we do this we lose our essence. Most people live their entire
lives this way, and become so caught up in their identity, their egos and
reputation that they fail to grow beyond those things, and in doing so do not
necessarily become the true blessing they could be. Here in this hospital
filled with sickness, pain, hopefulness and hopelessness, I began to realize
that when the spirit shows through, we can grow and nurture not only others but
ourselves. Here I learned the value of living a meaningful life.  The difficulty I'd experienced with others who were not touched in this manner, including some of my own family, is that they simply didn't get it and couldn't understand that life is to be lived, love shared and relationships cherished. While I knew it in my heart, living this way was not easy, established relationships tend to stagnate, unless both parties desire to move forward, learning stops, and seams tear. ""</p>
<p>Your contributions in whatever form they come can bring to life a story that has been waiting to be told and the time is now. So many people are searching for healing and it does not always come in the way we think. Be open, believe and be willing to accept the possibility that there is another way. Namaste' ( I bow to the divine in you !)</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am seeking $18,000 to fund my mission of getting this book published and in the hands of as many people as I can. As a holistic health care consultant I see , feel and experience the need of so many who are struggling with illnesses of all forms. My greatest desire is to see this book go viral! </p>
<p>Working as a consultant allows me the freedom to choose my schedule and follow my heart and for that I am grateful. In order to market this book what I need most is time and a cash flow to allow me to focus on making this  happen. </p>
<p>Please check out the perks of funding this project and give as your heart dictates. I am so willing to share my story, knowledge and gifts that I have offered some perks that can change, and enhance your life. If you do not have the financial resources to contribute I ask that you do so by sharing this message with as many people as you know. I believe with all of my heart and soul that there is a way to reach my goal and I will be forever grateful for any assistance you can lend. </p>
<p>If I do not reach my campaign goal you can be sure that I will find a way to make it happen. I have been nicknamed "" The junkyard dog"" for a reason. When I believe in something I will not let it go until I find a way. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I believe with every fiber of my soul that this book has the potential to change many lives. I went from being a traditional nurse working challenging jobs in ER, ICU, Oncology and more to living a life of a holistic practitioner because I saw that we need more than traditional medicine to heal. We need to get real, and understand that there is a way to heal that is yours to discover. </div> <p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>I worked and lived "" traditional"" medicine until 2001 when I was diagnosed with a disease that disrupted my life, left me in pain so severe for weeks at a time that I lost portions of my life. I discovered after a two year battle that the illness had an emotional connection, and once I understood , accepted and then healed that I began to live my life in a whole new way. This story is the beginning of the journey, and touches on the beginning of the healing. Book two "" Now That I Have Healed"" is in the works! <br/>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>Your contribution in whatever form it comes will be greatly appreciated! If you find you cannot contribute financially I ask you to consider spreading the word via email, word of mouth, social media or anywhere you feel relevant. Much love and blessings in abundance to all! </div><div>If you have any questions or comments please contact me via email.

How Shall I Heal is based upon my years of traditional nursing, the stories are real, the emotions raw. It is the ultimate "" Everyone has a story"" as I have woven the fabric with the richness of tradition, emotions, heart wrenching transparency and the love that I have been witness to. This book has been in the concept stage for the past 10 years, in the written stage for a year. It was inspired by a conversation with a man who knew the value of life much more intimately than many. Below is a tiny segment of the story. 

          "" It was
about this time that I realized how intertwined our lives as nurses became with
how we identified ourselves. I was no longer Jill, I was a nurse, mother, wife,
advocate, friend and it would be years before I could untangle myself to
realize I was Jill, a creature of the Universe. We lose our identity in what we
do, forgetting who we really are. I’m not saying that is altogether a bad
thing, but when we do this we lose our essence. Most people live their entire
lives this way, and become so caught up in their identity, their egos and
reputation that they fail to grow beyond those things, and in doing so do not
necessarily become the true blessing they could be. Here in this hospital
filled with sickness, pain, hopefulness and hopelessness, I began to realize
that when the spirit shows through, we can grow and nurture not only others but
ourselves. Here I learned the value of living a meaningful life.  The difficulty I'd experienced with others who were not touched in this manner, including some of my own family, is that they simply didn't get it and couldn't understand that life is to be lived, love shared and relationships cherished. While I knew it in my heart, living this way was not easy, established relationships tend to stagnate, unless both parties desire to move forward, learning stops, and seams tear. ""
Your contributions in whatever form they come can bring to life a story that has been waiting to be told and the time is now. So many people are searching for healing and it does not always come in the way we think. Be open, believe and be willing to accept the possibility that there is another way. Namaste' ( I bow to the divine in you !)   What We Need & What You Get I am seeking $18,000 to fund my mission of getting this book published and in the hands of as many people as I can. As a holistic health care consultant I see , feel and experience the need of so many who are struggling with illnesses of all forms. My greatest desire is to see this book go viral! 
Working as a consultant allows me the freedom to choose my schedule and follow my heart and for that I am grateful. In order to market this book what I need most is time and a cash flow to allow me to focus on making this  happen. 
Please check out the perks of funding this project and give as your heart dictates. I am so willing to share my story, knowledge and gifts that I have offered some perks that can change, and enhance your life. If you do not have the financial resources to contribute I ask that you do so by sharing this message with as many people as you know. I believe with all of my heart and soul that there is a way to reach my goal and I will be forever grateful for any assistance you can lend. 
If I do not reach my campaign goal you can be sure that I will find a way to make it happen. I have been nicknamed "" The junkyard dog"" for a reason. When I believe in something I will not let it go until I find a way. 
  The Impact
I believe with every fiber of my soul that this book has the potential to change many lives. I went from being a traditional nurse working challenging jobs in ER, ICU, Oncology and more to living a life of a holistic practitioner because I saw that we need more than traditional medicine to heal. We need to get real, and understand that there is a way to heal that is yours to discover.  
  Risks & Challenges
I worked and lived "" traditional"" medicine until 2001 when I was diagnosed with a disease that disrupted my life, left me in pain so severe for weeks at a time that I lost portions of my life. I discovered after a two year battle that the illness had an emotional connection, and once I understood , accepted and then healed that I began to live my life in a whole new way. This story is the beginning of the journey, and touches on the beginning of the healing. Book two "" Now That I Have Healed"" is in the works! 

  Other Ways You Can Help

<p></p>In the middle ages, it was thought that insanity was contagious. Centuries on, we label such ideas as superstitious ignorance. But when John Doe begins to speak after decades of silence, the staff and patients at the Golden Canyon Behavioral Health center begin to realize that behind every superstition lies a horrid truth.
<p>On the night that a vicious sandstorm closes the roads and seals the doors, a plague of madness spreads through the hospital. Two staff members try desperately to hold onto their sanity while searching for the cause - and, hopefully, the cure - of the outbreak.</p>
<p>But they're not alone. In this shared world anthology edited by Brad C. Hodson and Bram Stoker Award® winner Benjamin Kane Ethridge, some of the genre's most talented authors present their own sanity shattering tales. With fiction by John Skipp, Jeff Strand, Scott Nicholson, Lisa Morton, John Palisano, and many others, the horrible truth is revealed bit by awful bit. Step inside and find out what it's truly like in the MADHOUSE.</p>

<b>MADHOUSE</b> is a project that has a lot of room for expansion; new stories, multiple interior artworks, audiobook versions, new features and more can be added to the book if the campaign surpasses its initial goal. We also feel that MADHOUSE is a project where others can get involved in a lot of fun ways, from adding your own room to the Golden Canyon Behavioral Health Center to getting your own uniquely stamped traycased edition of the book. It's also a project with many contributors and illustrations, so expenses are higher than your typical project. <p></p>
<p>This campaign should be considered just another way to preorder the book. All backers of the campaign will be receiving campaign-exclusive editions of the book at planned retail price with free U.S. shipping included. Backers of the campaign can receive special perks that won't be offered to retail customers as thanks for their support in making MADHOUSE a reality.</p>
<p><b>If you have any questions about the campaign, please e-mail us at: madhousedrp@gmail.com</b>. Indiegogo unfortunately does not have its own internal messaging service, so we have created this Gmail account to handle all matters with our campaign backers.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, and please spread the word about the MADHOUSE Indiegogo campaign!</p>

Enter the MADHOUSE: Illustrated Shared World Horror Anthology Published by Dark Regions Press - Dark Regions Horror #1
In the middle ages, it was thought that insanity was contagious. Centuries on, we label such ideas as superstitious ignorance. But when John Doe begins to speak after decades of silence, the staff and patients at the Golden Canyon Behavioral Health center begin to realize that behind every superstition lies a horrid truth.
On the night that a vicious sandstorm closes the roads and seals the doors, a plague of madness spreads through the hospital. Two staff members try desperately to hold onto their sanity while searching for the cause - and, hopefully, the cure - of the outbreak.
But they're not alone. In this shared world anthology edited by Brad C. Hodson and Bram Stoker Award® winner Benjamin Kane Ethridge, some of the genre's most talented authors present their own sanity shattering tales. With fiction by John Skipp, Jeff Strand, Scott Nicholson, Lisa Morton, John Palisano, and many others, the horrible truth is revealed bit by awful bit. Step inside and find out what it's truly like in the MADHOUSE.

MADHOUSE is a project that has a lot of room for expansion; new stories, multiple interior artworks, audiobook versions, new features and more can be added to the book if the campaign surpasses its initial goal. We also feel that MADHOUSE is a project where others can get involved in a lot of fun ways, from adding your own room to the Golden Canyon Behavioral Health Center to getting your own uniquely stamped traycased edition of the book. It's also a project with many contributors and illustrations, so expenses are higher than your typical project. 
This campaign should be considered just another way to preorder the book. All backers of the campaign will be receiving campaign-exclusive editions of the book at planned retail price with free U.S. shipping included. Backers of the campaign can receive special perks that won't be offered to retail customers as thanks for their support in making MADHOUSE a reality.
If you have any questions about the campaign, please e-mail us at: madhousedrp@gmail.com. Indiegogo unfortunately does not have its own internal messaging service, so we have created this Gmail account to handle all matters with our campaign backers.
Thank you for your support, and please spread the word about the MADHOUSE Indiegogo campaign!

<h3>The Story</h3>
<em>Sinkhole: A Natural History of Suicide</em> tells two stories: a personal story of the legacy of suicide in my family and a story of the boom-to-bust growth of an American mining town. I'm writing about my family's original home--Pittsburg, Kansas--and about its history as one of the largest coal mining regions in the country. I'm also writing about the life and death of my father and both my grandfathers--all of whom died by suicide. My maternal grandfather’s family (his father and four brothers) worked throughout their lives in the coal mines. My paternal grandfather served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and fought for worker's rights, including those of coal miners. This is an American story that is also emblematic of a piece of history.
<h3>The Impact</h3>
There are roughly 36,000 deaths by suicide in America every year. With roughly six people touched by each suicide, the number of survivors is considerable, and growing. Yet, why do we hear so little about suicide? In part, because it's a different kind of tragedy; murders make news, most suicides don't.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Suicide also carries a strong taboo, and most of us don't discuss it much. The stories that surround a suicide are often buried in silence, and the lives that end in suicide can become framed by this silence, leaving lasting effects of trauma on families--and on generations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>Sinkhole </em>is my attempt to explore the impact of suicide on my family at a very personal level, exploring what it means to have a voice--as a writer, as a suicide survivor and as a mortal human being. In this work, I also explore how the destruction of the natural world serves as a metaphor for our own self-destruction.
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Because of the emotional nature of the material and the research involved so far, this project represents the slowest and most careful writing I’ve ever undertaken. The work of this project, in particular, has required contemplative time that supports both the conception of the project and the drafting of new material. Likewise, to understand the history of Pittsburg and my father’s origins more fully, this project requires research and travel throughout Southeastern Kansas.</p>
<p>A portion of this manuscript was awarded the 2011 <em>Arts &amp; Letters</em> Susan Atefat Prize in Non-Fiction; other recent awards include a 2012 Minnesota Emerging Writer's Grant, and a fellowship from the Minnesota State Arts Board. Funding from these sources has helped me to complete nearly all of my research and draft the first half of the book. This campaign is designed to build off this momentum of support and help me meet the goal of completing a full-length draft by Spring 2013. Now more than ever I’m realizing how much I need to focus on this project so it can be completed—and more importantly, shared. </p>
<p>My overhead is low, but I still have expenses to meet. My target goal is $8,000, which will cover a portion of my basic expenses through April 2013. Like many artists, I string together a modest income through a variety of freelance jobs that allow me flexibility and time in the studio. Your contribution will help me keep my work load to a minimum over the next six months, so I can spend more time writing. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you're also investing in the grassroots principle of crowdfunding, an idea vital to our future. In these difficult economic and political times, it seems important that we all come together to share resources, give to each other to support ideas we believe in and grow our collective power.</p>
<p>There are many ways for you to participate: as a fan, sponsor, devotee, patron, or angel and the perks, one of a kind.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're personally unable to contribute, please spread the word via e-mail, Facebook. Twitter, love letter, or postcard to others who might be interested or able to contribute. Please help me make the most of this opportunity. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>About Kazu</strong></p>
<p>Ceramicist Kazu Oba migrated to the States from Japan at the tender age of 17. Initially trained in sculpture and working as a chef on the side, his ever-growing appreciation of the vessels he was using to serve food eventually led him to pursue pottery. He trained under master Karatsu potter Nakazato Takashi before returning to the US to set up his own studio in Colorado.

<p><strong>About the Ichsan</strong></p>
<p>Indonesian artist and KJ contributor Ichsan Harja came to Kyoto in 2010 on a Nippon Foundation grant to document the city's heritage through the medium of watercolour painting — an extension of a long-standing project in his home country, where he compiled an award-winning book to raise awareness of urban conservation in Bandung, West Java. He says: ""Most of my works are about a certain quality of light: the harsh autumn light with ultramarine-hued shadows, or unusual marmalade sky caused by a rare combination of late noon sunlight, low-hanging clouds and thin snow...I tried to convey a notion of universal, timeless beauty. I want the viewer to enjoy my work as is, without any pretext nor context. This universal beauty, I believe, will enhance any historic and cultural meaning embodied by the original object.""</p>

We have won several independent press awards, including the Utne Reader and Pushcart Prizes, and also received recognition from the Japanese Ministry of Cultural Affairs.
 We are dedicated to giving a platform to writers and new perspectives from all over the Asia region. But we also delight in coming back to our roots in the ancient capital of Japan; our beloved home, and a remarkable city we consider to be a kind of cultural crossroads.

Our Small Buildings of Kyoto book is dedicated to the quaint homes, businesses, workshops, as well as the occasional neighbourhood shrine and teahouse, that make up the lifeblood of the city. A far cry from the grand old temples they may be, but we believe the distinct personalities these buildings acquire and the insights they offer into the lives of ordinary citizens makes them invaluable cultural assets.

 

Support our book. Support independent publishing.
The Small Buildings of Kyoto project began in early 2016 when our founder John Einarsen began sharing pictures from his daily bicycle journeys through the city at the @kyotojournal instagram page. These images have proven to be so popular, and in response to demand we decided to compile them into a little book.
 

  
We would like to print 500 copies of Small Buildings of Kyoto. The book will be printed by a wonderful team in South Korea who have worked with us over the past 3 years, with a special limited edition hand-bound by a Kyoto craftswoman.
 

 
This is our third Indiegogo campaign -- both our previous crowdfunds exceeded their goals and you can be sure we will deliver. Any additional contributions beyond our funding goal will support Kyoto Journal in continuing its work as a fully independent publication.  To celebrate 30 years of publishing in 2017, we will be releasing a revamp of our print edition and holding a retrospective exhibition of photography from our issues -- in one of Kyoto's small buildings.

About Kazu
Ceramicist Kazu Oba migrated to the States from Japan at the tender age of 17. Initially trained in sculpture and working as a chef on the side, his ever-growing appreciation of the vessels he was using to serve food eventually led him to pursue pottery. He trained under master Karatsu potter Nakazato Takashi before returning to the US to set up his own studio in Colorado. You can read more about Kazu here.

About the Ichsan
Indonesian artist and KJ contributor Ichsan Harja came to Kyoto in 2010 on a Nippon Foundation grant to document the city's heritage through the medium of watercolour painting — an extension of a long-standing project in his home country, where he compiled an award-winning book to raise awareness of urban conservation in Bandung, West Java. He says: ""Most of my works are about a certain quality of light: the harsh autumn light with ultramarine-hued shadows, or unusual marmalade sky caused by a rare combination of late noon sunlight, low-hanging clouds and thin snow...I tried to convey a notion of universal, timeless beauty. I want the viewer to enjoy my work as is, without any pretext nor context. This universal beauty, I believe, will enhance any historic and cultural meaning embodied by the original object.""

Brush up your nighttime photography skills with long-time Kyoto resident Stuart Gibson. Beginning at sunset, Stuart will take you to see some of the city's hotspots in a different light – from a historic pagoda silhouetted against the sunset to the backstreets of Gion. If you are lucky, you may even encounter some of Kyoto's elusive Geisha. We are offering a private tour with Stuart for 2-3 people valid on Fridays and Saturdays through 2017. Please note this is still subject to Stuart's availability and you will need to reserve in advance. Start and end times also vary depending on the time of year. See the terms of booking a tour here.
 

About Stuart
Scotsman Stuart Gibson has devoted nearly every spare moment to photography since arriving in Kyoto 14 years ago. ""If you are like me, you want more than just holiday snaps —you want images that really capture the essence of a time and place, and that's precisely what you'll have the chance to do on these tours. With the peace-of-mind of being with an experienced photographer who knows the area you are sure to get images to be proud of.""
You can find Stuart's photography in our issues KJ 84 and 88.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>Who’s Doing It? is a book about humility. It’s a book about failure. It’s a book about successful young entrepreneurs that have refused to wait until they were ready to follow their dreams and took it upon themselves to make their mark.<br/><br/>My name is Johnny Bui and I am the author of Who’s Doing It? I wrote this book because I felt a greater calling to hold myself and my peers responsible for committing to where we want to be in our lives. We owe it to ourselves to do so. The opportunity to write a book serendipitously came along just as when I was completing my college transfer application to attend Babson College. I was at a point in my life where I gave what I was for who I could be. I saw Babson College as this place of entrepreneurship, huge innovation and achievement by the student body; a place of opportunity and competition that I would thrive in. So I spent the next 6 months putting my head down and working for this one opportunity to switch schools. So here I am, writing this from San Francisco at a Babson study away program — my point is, once we expose ourselves to something greater, we can’t ever settle for less. So if this is what our peers can do — what is the extent to what we can achieve? Why don’t we take that risk? These young entrepreneurs that I am proud to call my peers are doing it. And while I could have written about any young entrepreneur, I selected these particular entrepreneurs because of their locality; these are the entrepreneurs that you may not have heard about in mainstream media and that’s what makes them special. They are not famous in the traditional sense, which makes them relatable to you and I. However, fame is relative. These young entrepreneurs are the talk of their town, they have each individually started something that have in one way or another affected the lives of those around them as well as themselves.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that as a young entrepreneur, creative, and/or individual, we are capable of more. In this book, I hope to instill the same type of passion and excitement that I have for youth empowerment in you. Coming from the perspective of a first generation background, it’s important to be exposed to and understand what is possible to achieve as a youth. It’s so easy to get stuck thinking that the world is small because of your daily routine but if you can see what other people (not that different from you) can do - maybe that will get you thinking. And that’s exactly what I want you to do. Then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realign your goals into a reality - that because some can achieve great success, it is proof that others can at well. It is the biggest obligation that we have to ourselves, to try.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about staying on your own unique path and coping with failure/setbacks from stories like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ariana Feygin - How she failed twice before earning her chance to compete on MasterChef Junior</li>
<li>David Zamarin - How he began his entrepreneurial journey selling G-Shocks and Beats before starting his Shark Tank winning company DetraPel</li>
<li>Brennan Stark - How he began building sustainable homes for his community without any construction experience</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love seeing young people do big things and enjoy reading a hero/heroine’s journey.</p>
<p>Who’s Doing It? is a non-fiction book that speaks to rising college students and ambitious high school students who are looking at what their role is in the world and how they hope to play a part for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Book - Who’s Doing It?</strong></h2>
<br/>The book is written in <strong>3 Parts.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + prologue. Here, I share my personal story about how I’ve applied the message of this book to my own life and the ‘it’ mindset that will be discussed throughout the book. Additionally, from this section of the book, the reader will get a greater scope of what to expect for the rest of the book followed by Ariana Feygin, Season 6 contestant of MasterChef Junior, and the story of how she rose from Excelsior, Minnesota to competing with other young chefs on the grandest stage of them all. Indicative of the stories to come, Ariana’s story is all about taking 1 step forward and 3 steps back on the way to conquering her goals.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains Chapters 1-2. This part focuses on recognizing one’s curiosity and taking small steps to draw that curiosity out through action. The chapter follows the stories of several young entrepreneurs who saw things a little differently and decided to push back on conventional norms. These chapters include stories of the power of saying ‘yes’ to opportunity and showing that youth and inexperience are not always weaknesses.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 3-5. This part discusses the the other side of entrepreneurship that is not often talked about. It dives into the battle with inexperience, fear, hesitation, and ultimately when your world crumbs down when things don’t work out the way you want it to. Why? Because it’s important to know that an entrepreneur’s journey is one with many challenges along the way and these young entrepreneurs are no exception. It was important for me to share their difficulties and setbacks with the reader because it would help shed the persona that entrepreneurship is ‘easy’ and that its the fast track to getting rich. In these chapters, readers will discover the stumbling blocks that these young entrepreneurs faced while growing their business/putting their business together and the wisdom to conquer them.<br/> <h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Spring of 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<br/><strong>Johnny Bui </strong>is a first semester senior at Babson College, concentrating in Strategic Management and Entrepreneurship. He is proactive, deep thinking, and is relentlessly passionate about pursuing a life of zero complacency. He enjoys practicing self-improvement, minimalism, and travel. He is interested in strategy, technology, and consulting.<br/><br/>Johnny wrote this book because the opportunity to do so arose at a point in his life where he realized that we as individuals are capable of achieving more - given our own permission. He was at a crossroads in his life of being content with what he had, or taking a chance at changing his world. In that latter decision, he became influence by what other young colleagues were doing - how they had become so accomplished at a young age and how there seemed to be no limit to what they can achieve. The spark of inspiration is what drove him to go all in on his transfer application and share the stories of the entrepreneurs that motivate him. He hopes that with his added perspective, that you are able to see from his point of view, the rewards of wanting to be more than what you already are and the cost of executing on your goals as well. In several different stories, you’ll see experiences cut from the same fabric of dissatisfaction with everyday life, that are equally riveting and insightful at the same time.<br/><br/>He believes in the sayings, “You are the aggregate of the 5 people you surround yourself with” (Jim Rohn) and “The best way to ensure that lucky things happen is to make sure a lot of things happen” (Bo Peabody). The two quotes illustrate a life of continuous improvement and upward movement toward the different goals you set to achieve. He believes that the mindset of wanting to be better than oneself is the central element to ascend from one’s certain circumstance.<br/><br/>In his down time, Johnny enjoys participating in service immersion trips, practicing personal and practical well-being, and martial arts. He is passionate about the outdoors and loves camping out at night with friends.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Johnny at <strong>JohnnyBui261@gmail.com</strong>, on LinkedIn at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/buijohnny/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/buijohnny/</a> and/or on Instagram <strong>@YKJohnnyBui</strong><p> </p>

<h3><strong>Do you love animals?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Have you ever had to have the tough conversation about the Rainbow Bridge?</strong></h3>
<h3>Introducing... <i>Rescued By Rico </i>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593443159/uxisw9ejffv4jkbssqv2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Rescued By Rico is the true story of a 12-14 year old chocolate lab pup from Puerto Rico who affectionately became known to us as ""Rico"". A year or so after his family had to abandon him to escape 2017 Hurricane Maria, he was found curled up in a ball, 20 lbs. underweight, with a litany of health issues. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593443929/ezzbqk4m4n7ie6kcynj5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Rico was something special.</strong> He was loved by everyone who had the privilege of meeting him. We're telling his story because we hope to inspire others. We want to help others understand how much a rescue animal can bring to your life. We also want to approach the hard conversation about a beloved family pet passing by painting the Rainbow Bridge so bright that it offers hope to little ones whose best fur buddy has passed on. </p>

Have you ever had to have the tough conversation about the Rainbow Bridge?
Introducing... Rescued By Rico 


Rescued By Rico is the true story of a 12-14 year old chocolate lab pup from Puerto Rico who affectionately became known to us as ""Rico"". A year or so after his family had to abandon him to escape 2017 Hurricane Maria, he was found curled up in a ball, 20 lbs. underweight, with a litany of health issues. 

Rico was something special. He was loved by everyone who had the privilege of meeting him. We're telling his story because we hope to inspire others. We want to help others understand how much a rescue animal can bring to your life. We also want to approach the hard conversation about a beloved family pet passing by painting the Rainbow Bridge so bright that it offers hope to little ones whose best fur buddy has passed on. 
About The Authors
We are Stace and Jules, the co-authors of this special book, and we also had the incredible privilege of being Rico's adoptive family for his last months on this earth. For our careers, we're founders of two companies: A Salty Rim, which is a coaching/consulting firm helping small business create a strategic plan for growth; and OME Gear, which is an outdoor gear product company changing the way people ""do it in nature"". We are also co-hosts of two podcasts: GSD Entrepreneur and Do It In Nature.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Displaced Generation: Stories of the Nation's Young, Homeless, and their Paths to Housing is a collection of innovative solutions to the present day problem of youth and young adult homelessness as well as the narratives of young individuals experiencing this problem personally.<br/><br/>My name is Jennifer Pitsch and I am the author of Displaced Generation. I wrote this book because I wanted to bring more awareness and advocacy around a problem that has been growing detrimentally in this nation, but even more importantly give people the tools and knowledge on what can be done to fix it.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about what lies behind the American crisis of the young and homeless as well as what steps are being taken by those passionate to make a difference and solve it. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the young homeless in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become an advocate in making your community a better place regarding this issue.</p>
<p><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why homeless youth are afraid of homeless shelters, and what alternatives are out there</li>
<li>Community challengers such as the Rapid Results Institute who work to eradicate youth homelessness in just 100 days</li>
<li>The story of Kate, a community activist who opened her house as a safe home to over thirty boys in just under four years</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to gain more knowledge on a sub-demographic of our nation that is being left behind, are an advocate, hoping to better your community, or researcher wanting to discover different paths that have been used to address homelessness.  Displaced Generation is a non-fiction book that speaks to the community, activists, innovators and organizations who are looking at the best approaches of housing youth and trying out a different approach for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Displaced Generation</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 focuses on laying out the purpose of this book as well as history of homelessness in the United States. It trails through what factors have led to the current homeless crisis as it is today.<br/><br/>Part 2 explains the main causes behind homelessness specifically for youth and young adults. It overlays what may push these individuals to the streets as well as what increased risks they face once they are out there.<br/><br/>Part 3 is all about solutions and models that have been invented to tackle youth homelessness. This problem is so wide ranging that there is no one clear cut, fix-all band-aid, but some methods are clearly more effective than others.<br/><br/>Part 4 addresses what YOU can do as the readers even when you feel like you can’t make an impact as one individual. It shows what others are doing through advocacy work, legislation, and reaching out to others in their community to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter</li>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Jennifer Pitsch is an Economics and Political Science undergraduate double-major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. She wrote this book after a personal experience witnessing the degradation of a young homeless man in her community and wanted to delve into this problem on a larger scale. Throughout the course of her book, she has interviewed over 20 different social innovators, researchers, activists, and leaders in non-profits, and homeless young individuals and has spent countless hours reading books and scientific articles that discuss the different paths to solving young adult homelessness. She hopes to devote her career to raising light on social issues and making substantial change.<br/><br/>By day, Jennifer is a spinach and avocado dip connoisseur and a firm believer that caramel is pronounced ‘car-ml’ not ‘car-a-mel.’ By night she is an amateur cornhole player and avid Nebraska Huskers fan. She is a caffeine and adrenaline addict (not a good combo) and can be found backpacking and traveling in her free time.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Jennifer at jdpitsch@gmail.com or at her Twitter and her Instagram: jennifer_pitsch.</p>

I wrote this book because I wanted to find and share the stories that are behind and within the texts themselves.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how the material book is art, art that is indispensable to our culture and how it will continue to be a dominant medium. In this book, I hope to instil the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for books in you.<br/><br/>And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you look past the surface of books to see the teams of people and the extended impact they have.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the process behind the creation of books and the impact they have after being created:</p><ul>
<li>Behind the creation and publishing of a single book lies hundreds of influential people shaping every aspect allowing the book to live.</li>
<li>The traditional publishing industry definitely needs to adapt to modern times by making continued efforts to promote systematically marginalized voices and to streamline the process in a way that more of the millions of voices can be heard. It might be broken currently, but it is not beyond repair.</li>
<li>The attachment that individuals have to hold a beautifully bond book is unparalleled. Not only does the material item foster a stronger connection than an e-book, but the passion behind the written word is immense and impossible to end.</li>

I wrote this book because I wanted to find and share the stories that are behind and within the texts themselves.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how the material book is art, art that is indispensable to our culture and how it will continue to be a dominant medium. In this book, I hope to instil the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for books in you.And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you look past the surface of books to see the teams of people and the extended impact they have.In this book, you'll learn about the process behind the creation of books and the impact they have after being created:
Behind the creation and publishing of a single book lies hundreds of influential people shaping every aspect allowing the book to live.
The traditional publishing industry definitely needs to adapt to modern times by making continued efforts to promote systematically marginalized voices and to streamline the process in a way that more of the millions of voices can be heard. It might be broken currently, but it is not beyond repair.
The attachment that individuals have to hold a beautifully bond book is unparalleled. Not only does the material item foster a stronger connection than an e-book, but the passion behind the written word is immense and impossible to end.
You will love this book if you are a lover of words and the stories behind written word; spend time in bookstores and libraries, or simply around books; curious about the publishing process and industry; and if perhaps you want to write your own book someday.Shelves of Art and the People Between is a non-fiction book that speaks to bibliophiles and doubters who are looking at the publishing industry and the passion books create for the first time. The Book - Shelves of Art and the People BetweenThe book is written in 3 Parts...Part 1 contains the introduction + five additional chapters. It looks into the people behind books themselves in the publishing industry or in bookstores across the country. Whether it be in larger spaces like Powell’s City of Books or in smaller independent bookstores around my corner of the world, like Dogtown Book Shop, every space where books are held has its own set of people behind it. They are businesses that run on the passion books are created from and continue to create after they are born. Part 2 contains Chapters 6-10. This more technical part dives into the processes behind books, from different ways to publish and aspects of the publishing industry to how people interact with books and the ways you can capitalize and market through them. Part 3 contains Chapters 12-15. The final part of the book centers on the deep passion books hold and create in every mind they touch. With advice and interviews from authors like Emma Straub, Suzanne Berne, and Robert Pinsky, it attempts to capture each part of the excitement and importance of a single book. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2019.

<h3>The OUTWORLD Library Project</h3>
<p>To commerate the two-year anniversary <em>OUTWORLD</em> by N. Harold Donley we are launching ""The <em>OUTWORLD</em> Library Project"" campaign. </p>
<p>Its incredibly simple, <strong>for each $20 donated to this campaign Lughnasa Press will send a copy of <em>OUTWORLD</em> to participating libraries in Oklahoma</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>Here's the Deal: </strong></p>
<p> ""Anyone who has read <em>OUTWORLD</em> knows the surprising and pivotal role a library plays in the unfolding of the story."" N. Harold Donley.</p>
<p>There are 230 public libraries in the state, some participating library systems have already acquired 10 copies of <em>OUTWORLD</em> for their patrons, leaving 220 libraries. At $20 a book / library it will take $4400 to reach the campaign goal.</p>
<p>If the campaign is fully funded, N. Harold Donley will conduct a tour to personally deliver book copies to participating library systems as well as mail copies to independent libraries. If we raise less than the campaign goal, we will purchase copies proportionate to the funds raised ($20 each) and distribute those copies to library systems and independent libraries throughtout Oklahoma.</p>
<p>In the event we should raise more than our goal...well, there are even more libraries in surrounding states. </p>
<p>The distribution will take place in the Autumn of 2013.</p>
<p><strong>What's the $20 cover?</strong></p>
<p>Each copy of <em>OUTWORLD</em> retails for $14, this pays for the actual printing of the book and the royalty to the author.  The remaining $6 covers shipping, handling, taxes and the fee to Indiegogo.com for the campaign.</p>
<p>(If you check our website, Outworldthebook.com, you'll see $20 is comparable to our normal purchase/shipping price. In fact, if you just want to purchase a copy, please use our website to do so.)</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>Those who have read<em> OUTWORLD</em> will quickly recognized the Perks are named after different positions within the Gnomon community, ""One Among Equals"",""One Born to the Land"", ""People of the Sky"", ""Guardian"", ""First Among Equals"".  </p>
<p>All who give to this project will be recognized on our website, Outworldthebook.com, and some will even receive their own autographed copy of OUTWORLD in recognition of their generosity.</p>

<h2>NEW PERK ADDED! $5 = $25 OF IN-GAME CASH!</h2>
<p><strong><br/>Donate $5, and you'll receive $25 of in-game cash when WeWrite hits Facebook.  WeWrite Cash can be used to purchase tons of stuff, like photos, illustrations, sound effects, advanced publishing options and more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You'll also have access to other cool features like ""More Chapters"" and ""Story Extenders,"" which give you extra space to work with when you've got something brilliant to write!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>OUTSTANDING SUCCESS! BUT WE'RE NOT YET FINISHED!</h2>
<p><em><strong>THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to everyone who's helped us get this far! We've met our $5,000 goal, and ahead of schedule! Now we're excited about how great the WeWrite Facebook app might be. Our ""stretch goal"" is $7,500. If we can get there, this game is going to be stellar!</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Could WeWrite! Do for the World?</h2>
<p>WeWrite! can become the largest writing network ever created!  We've set a goal to have a MILLION STORIES written by the end of 2014. It can happen with your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Could You Do for WeWrite?</h2>
<p>We need your help to MAKE THIS AN AMAZING GAME!.  We've already met out goal, but the more funders we get, the more features we can add. Donate $5 and get $25 of in-game cash!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Is ""WeWrite!""?</h2>
<p>WeWrite! is a collaborative storytelling game that lets you write with your friends, one or two lines at a time. You can write with people you already know, or make new friends through the WeWrite network. It's not just a writing game. It's a completely new way to connect with people!</p>
<p>We've already built a beta version for the iPhone that's being played in over 20 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD! (Click <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wewrite!/id576215042?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">THIS LINK</a> to see it. Or check out the screenshots below.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>You'll Become a Co-Creator of the Game!</h2>
<p><strong>By submitting a ""Story Starter"" at the $10 level or above, you'll be providing inspiration for dozens, if not HUNDREDS, of new short stories (written by authors from around the world).   </strong></p>
<p>If you haven't played the game yet, <strong>""Story Starters""</strong> are the titles and first lines that the game provides to help spark some creativity. The ""Story Starter"" is the starting point for a story that will end up taking countless twists and turns before it's completed.</p>
<p>The WeWrite! campaign is unique because (in addition to being listed as a ""Co-Creator"" in the credits) you have the opportunity to literally be a co-creator of the game! Just contribute $10 or more, and email us your ""Story Starter.""</p>
<p>Don't worry, ""Story Starters"" are actually really easy to come up with, and it's fun too! (It was our favorite part of developing the original prototype!) Here are two examples:</p>
<p><em><strong>TITLE:</strong> ""Stepdrag""</em></p>
<p><em><strong>FIRST LINE:</strong> They knew it was him in the hallway. They could hear him getting closer. ""I'm scared,"" Matty said as he...</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>TITLE:</strong> ""Three Guys, One Gun, No Lights""</em></p>
<p><em><strong>FIRST LINE:</strong> Barry's eyes suddenly lit up. ""How drunk are you guys, because I think I have an idea."" </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>SUBMIT YOUR ""STORY STARTER"" TITLES AND/OR FIRST LINES TO <a href=""mailto:WEWRITEGAME@GMAIL.COM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WEWRITEGAME@GMAIL.COM</a> (ALONG WITH YOUR NAME, SO WE CAN VERIFY YOU'RE AN ACTUAL ""CO-CREATOR."")</strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<h2>The Game Design</h2>
<p>We've put together some artwork to show you what we have envisioned for the Facebook version of WeWrite. New features include things like the ability to add photos, illustrations, and sound effects!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here's the beginning of an interactive story. We've come up with a title, invited some co-authors, and added a picture to give it some life.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here's the first page, with a few lines to kick it off.  Notice the ""Inspiration Button"" in the top right corner. You'll be able to access it at any time to add photos, illustrations, or break your writer's block.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://postimg.org/image/t8cd78h6l/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><img alt=""Story2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/1izd4j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Now a second writer has added to the story. Sombrero Man has a sidekick!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Prototype</h2>
<p>The beta version includes some great features, like a personal ""Library"" and the ability to earn ""Fame Points."" Here are some screengrabs from to give you a rough idea of what we're talking about.</p>
<p>The ""Story Starter"" buttton (top right corner) helps spark a little creativity. You can click it over and over again to get pre-loaded titles and first lines.</p>

</div></div>","NEW PERK ADDED! $5 = $25 OF IN-GAME CASH!
Donate $5, and you'll receive $25 of in-game cash when WeWrite hits Facebook.  WeWrite Cash can be used to purchase tons of stuff, like photos, illustrations, sound effects, advanced publishing options and more.
You'll also have access to other cool features like ""More Chapters"" and ""Story Extenders,"" which give you extra space to work with when you've got something brilliant to write!
 
OUTSTANDING SUCCESS! BUT WE'RE NOT YET FINISHED!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to everyone who's helped us get this far! We've met our $5,000 goal, and ahead of schedule! Now we're excited about how great the WeWrite Facebook app might be. Our ""stretch goal"" is $7,500. If we can get there, this game is going to be stellar!
 
What Could WeWrite! Do for the World?
WeWrite! can become the largest writing network ever created!  We've set a goal to have a MILLION STORIES written by the end of 2014. It can happen with your help!
 
What Could You Do for WeWrite?
We need your help to MAKE THIS AN AMAZING GAME!.  We've already met out goal, but the more funders we get, the more features we can add. Donate $5 and get $25 of in-game cash!
 
What Is ""WeWrite!""?
WeWrite! is a collaborative storytelling game that lets you write with your friends, one or two lines at a time. You can write with people you already know, or make new friends through the WeWrite network. It's not just a writing game. It's a completely new way to connect with people!
We've already built a beta version for the iPhone that's being played in over 20 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD! (Click THIS LINK to see it. Or check out the screenshots below.)
 
You'll Become a Co-Creator of the Game!
By submitting a ""Story Starter"" at the $10 level or above, you'll be providing inspiration for dozens, if not HUNDREDS, of new short stories (written by authors from around the world).   
If you haven't played the game yet, ""Story Starters"" are the titles and first lines that the game provides to help spark some creativity. The ""Story Starter"" is the starting point for a story that will end up taking countless twists and turns before it's completed.
The WeWrite! campaign is unique because (in addition to being listed as a ""Co-Creator"" in the credits) you have the opportunity to literally be a co-creator of the game! Just contribute $10 or more, and email us your ""Story Starter.""
Don't worry, ""Story Starters"" are actually really easy to come up with, and it's fun too! (It was our favorite part of developing the original prototype!) Here are two examples:
TITLE: ""Stepdrag""
FIRST LINE: They knew it was him in the hallway. They could hear him getting closer. ""I'm scared,"" Matty said as he...
 
TITLE: ""Three Guys, One Gun, No Lights""
FIRST LINE: Barry's eyes suddenly lit up. ""How drunk are you guys, because I think I have an idea."" 
 
SUBMIT YOUR ""STORY STARTER"" TITLES AND/OR FIRST LINES TO WEWRITEGAME@GMAIL.COM (ALONG WITH YOUR NAME, SO WE CAN VERIFY YOU'RE AN ACTUAL ""CO-CREATOR."")
 
The Game Design
We've put together some artwork to show you what we have envisioned for the Facebook version of WeWrite. New features include things like the ability to add photos, illustrations, and sound effects!
 
Here's the beginning of an interactive story. We've come up with a title, invited some co-authors, and added a picture to give it some life.

 
Here's the first page, with a few lines to kick it off.  Notice the ""Inspiration Button"" in the top right corner. You'll be able to access it at any time to add photos, illustrations, or break your writer's block.

 
Now a second writer has added to the story. Sombrero Man has a sidekick!

 
The Prototype
The beta version includes some great features, like a personal ""Library"" and the ability to earn ""Fame Points."" Here are some screengrabs from to give you a rough idea of what we're talking about.
The ""Story Starter"" buttton (top right corner) helps spark a little creativity. You can click it over and over again to get pre-loaded titles and first lines.
          
 
You can connect and play with Facebook friends. (But you can't play directly on Facebook... yet!)

 
The ""Genre Wheel"" helps you decide what type of story to write.

 
You can also save stories to your personal library.

 
Who Are We? 

We're five guys who grew up together in (and around) Bedford, Pennsylvania.  Now we're spread out all over the world! Three of us in SoCal, one in Pittsburgh, and one in Scotland.
 

LARS - Lead Programmer / Evil Genius - His last job was with Neversoft, specifically working on the ""Guitar Hero"" franchise. (We're not sure what he's scheming in this photo, but we're as frightened as you are.)
 

JAMI - Lead Designer / Billy Bob Thornton Impersonator - Corporate designer looking to escape his cubical. Also enjoys running extreme distances while eating extreme ethnic food.
 

NICK - Project Manager / Witch Doctor - His career history includes time as an ""inventor."" Seriously, that was his job title!
 

JAMES - Creative Director / Eye Model - Between eye modeling gigs, he's worked for ""Rolling Stone,"" ""Esquire,"" and ""Men's Journal,"" and currently writes/produces for radio shows around the U.S.
 

ZACH - Marketing Guru / Fashionista - Inspiring innovation with corporate teams in Europe, and also growing a beard (not pictured).
 


What We Need & What You Get
To get WeWrite! on Facebook with the features we think are essential, we needed $5,000 to cover programming and design costs.
Everything beyond $5,000 will go toward adding in other stuff that's on our list, like more social networking features, group writing contests, and publishing options (to name a few).
So what will you get out of it? Well, in addition to supporting the craft of writing and generally making the world a better place, we've put together some great perks, starting at the $5 level. For $5, you get $25 of in-game cash!
 
The Perks
NOTE: 
SUBMIT YOUR ""STORY STARTER"" TITLES AND/OR FIRST LINES TO WEWRITEGAME@GMAIL.COM (ALONG WITH YOUR NAME, SO WE CAN VERIFY YOU'RE AN ACTUAL ""CO-CREATOR."")
 With any donation of $10 or more, you become a CO-CREATOR of the game. That's not just talk. You'll actually be able to submit story titles and first lines to be used as pre-loaded ""Story Starters"" in the game.
At the $25 level, you can submit two ""Story Starters"" and also get THE WEWRITE! WRISTBAND:

 
At the $50 level, you get to choose from our collection of WEWRITE! T-SHIRTS.  (When the campaign ends, we'll email you for the color, phrase, and size.)

 
 
Also at the $50 level, you can get a handmade IPAD OR SMARTPHONE TOTE FROM ROSY TOES DESIGNS. These are really cool! They're eco-friendly and made of repurposed felted wool.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is John Hammer. Thank you so much for checking out my Indiegogo Site for this fundraising effort of my new book. </p>
<p>I am husband to the amazing Grace and Dad to 4 amazing children, Hailey, Emma, Justus and Addison. I reside in Everett, WA and am blessed to be a pastor at Sonrise Christian Center (<a href=""http://isonrise.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://isonrise.org</a>). I work with a passionate group of young adults and am the director or our school of ministry (<a href=""http://sgssm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sgssm.com</a>). I also really enjoy creativity expressed through poetry, spoken word and writing. I have a blog at <a href=""http://thefreedomletters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thefreedomletters.com</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in an awesome family but around middle school I was exposed to pornography. I ended up in a downward spiral of sexual addiction that controlled my life until I was 20. Right before I turned 21, Jesus Christ's power became very real to me and my entire life was changed by the grace of God. The sin of pornography lost it's place in my life. I then started a journey of replacing old habits, developing a renewed mind and finding out about who I was in Christ. </p>
<p>For over 12 years I have been sharing my story and helping people that are bound in pornography. This is an epidemic! This is affecting children, youth, men, women, families, marriages, churches, pastors and schools. Pornography is a sexual experiment that started bad and has left millions damaged in it's wake of destruction. I am convinced by the Scriptures that Jesus offers hope and healing to those that are bound. In this process of telling my story and preaching messages of freedom, many have come asking for help and advice. I often wished I had more time to tell people what I had learned through experience and mostly through the truth of Jesus as revealed in the Bible so that they could walk in freedom. This turned into a desire to write a book that would tell my story, share Scripture truth on sexuality and freedom, and ultimately bring people into freedom in Christ.</p>
<p>I have finished the first draft of my manuscript  and have a contract that I am waiting to sign with a great publisher. If you help me fund this project I would be so grateful. I cannot do this without you. I feel such an urgency to finish this project and release my book that those who have been bound and damaged by pornography can experience hope and freedom.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $8,000 to pay for the first printing of my book. This will include professional editing, cover design, pagination and lay out, as well as 1,000 copies of my book. Plus my book will be formatted for many different E-Book distribution channels.</p>
<p>All of the money that I raise will go to what I have stated above as well as helping pay for this fundraiser project and the completion of my perks. Should I raise the full amount of my goal, I am planning to sign the contract I have received from the great team at eGenCo publishing <a href=""http://egen.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://egen.co/</a>. </p>
<p>If I raise more than my goal, I will be able to purchase more copies of my book and/or pay for marketing my book and getting the word out to more people. </p>
<p>I have several perks here to thank you for your generous support that go anywhere from copies of my e-book, print book or do some creative writing in spoken word for you. Check out the perks!! You also have the option of donating and passing on the perks if you would like.</p>
<p>If I was to not reach my goal, the partial funds will still be used to get my book printed. I have had other offers and routes to go as well and would attempt work with my intended publisher should this situation arise. Anyway it goes, I will get this book published and fulfill my perks that I have promised (perks will be fulfilled after the money is raised, the contract is sign and the book is published). </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am believing that this book will impact young people, secret sinners, parents, educators, pastors and families. I believe people that never had hope before will have hope. I want to shout from the rooftops what is possible through the hope and freedom that we have in Jesus Christ! This book is full of what God has promised and because it is His Word in theprinciples that I set forth, I believe this can change the destiny of families. This book contains the Gospel and I believe that people will be introduced to a relationship with Jesus as they read it. If you help me fund this, you will help people be restored as they learn about the sex industry, God's plan for sex, the Gospel, forgiveness, healing of their hearts, freedom from dark powers, and how to be full of the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. Pray for me that I reach my goal and that this book gets before the people that need to hear the message of this book and experience the freedom that's in Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>2. Share! Share! Share! Please share this page via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter and more. You can use the social media links from here. If you are a blogger or vlogger, I would love to have you write a story about this or please feel free to contact me about an interview. The more we get the word out the better!</p>

<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>I recently started a Toronto-centric blog.  So far it's mostly focused on Toronto political news (read Rob Ford) and the like.  Almost all of the writing has been done by either me or my associate editor.  We have a new staff writer who's just coming on board and working for free.  <br/><br/>I'd like to expand the site to an actual alternative news source for Toronto.  There are some of these out there already, of course.  I'm looking to do something a little more biting and a little less pretentious than some of the current options, while retaining a sense of humour and a good dose of snark.  Sarcastic, intelligent, thought-provoking infotainment about T.O. would be as good a descriptor as any.  (And here I was talking about being ""less pretentious"" with this...)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>What we need is some startup capital.  Right now it's a simple Blogger site, there are no ads, and everyone is writing for free.  Writing for someone else for free is lame, and I hate asking people to do it.  What I'd like to do is raise a modest amount of startup funding to accomplish the three following goals:<br/><br/>1. Redesign the site into a proper news site with a good look that's easily accessible and readable.<br/><br/>2. Spend a reasonable, limited amount of money on promotion to drive readers to the site in order to eventually allow it to become revenue-generating and self-sustaining.</p>
<p>3. PAY WRITERS!  PAY WRITERS!  PAY WRITERS!  I'd like to be able to offer people who put time into writing for the site at least a little money to begin with for doing so.  This would probably be in the $15-20 range per post at least at first, which isn't exactly money to retire on, but it would provide a bit of a supplemental income for people taking the time to write four or five things a week.  It also means people would be compensated for their work.  <br/><br/>To accomplish these three things, I'm asking for (what I believe is) the reasonable sum of $5000.  This will provide enough to pay for a developer to put some shine on the site, to pay for some ads, and to pay for a month or two worth of posts while we grow the site.  I will not be taking a salary or paying myself for posts - I won't be making a cent off of this site until the day comes when it's independently profitable.  Even then, most revenue will be either reinvested in the site or used to increase writer pay.  I'd sure love this to become a business I could live off of one day, but that's a hell of a long way down the road.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We've Done So Far</h3>
<p>Not a ton, as the blog is only a week old at this point.  But what we have done has been promising.  Promising enough to have already generated over 10,000 reads as of the writing of this sentence in a little under six days. Of course, you can judge for yourself whether what we're doing is worthwhile by visiting the blog here:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.queenbathurst.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.queenbathurst.com<br/><br/></a></p>
<p>If I and the people helping me didn't think there was the potential for something really worthwhile here, we wouldn't be starting this campaign.  But we see possibilities, and we'd really like to explore them.  It's just hard to attract quality and dedication when we don't have a solid looking platform or a way to pay contributors at least SOMETHING.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Letting people know about this is always good.  And of course, if anyone with expertise in promotion or design would like to donate time and work instead of money, it would just leave more to pay writers with.  </p>

Spend a reasonable, limited amount of money on promotion to drive readers to the site in order to eventually allow it to become revenue-generating and self-sustaining.
3. PAY WRITERS!  PAY WRITERS!  PAY WRITERS!  I'd like to be able to offer people who put time into writing for the site at least a little money to begin with for doing so.  This would probably be in the $15-20 range per post at least at first, which isn't exactly money to retire on, but it would provide a bit of a supplemental income for people taking the time to write four or five things a week.  It also means people would be compensated for their work.  To accomplish these three things, I'm asking for (what I believe is) the reasonable sum of $5000.  This will provide enough to pay for a developer to put some shine on the site, to pay for some ads, and to pay for a month or two worth of posts while we grow the site.  I will not be taking a salary or paying myself for posts - I won't be making a cent off of this site until the day comes when it's independently profitable.  Even then, most revenue will be either reinvested in the site or used to increase writer pay.  I'd sure love this to become a business I could live off of one day, but that's a hell of a long way down the road.


What We've Done So Far
Not a ton, as the blog is only a week old at this point.  But what we have done has been promising.  Promising enough to have already generated over 10,000 reads as of the writing of this sentence in a little under six days. Of course, you can judge for yourself whether what we're doing is worthwhile by visiting the blog here:http://www.queenbathurst.com
If I and the people helping me didn't think there was the potential for something really worthwhile here, we wouldn't be starting this campaign.  But we see possibilities, and we'd really like to explore them.  It's just hard to attract quality and dedication when we don't have a solid looking platform or a way to pay contributors at least SOMETHING.  


Other Ways You Can Help
Letting people know about this is always good.  And of course, if anyone with expertise in promotion or design would like to donate time and work instead of money, it would just leave more to pay writers with.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>FISH QUILL POETRY BOAT:</strong></p>
<p>We are Leigh Kotsilidis and Linda Besner, two Canadian poets with critically acclaimed first books. In 2010, we wanted to organize a reading tour, and we talked about how author tours tend only to hit the big cities: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Halifax. We thought it would be great to get out to some smaller towns, and find a way to reach new audiences—people who might not ordinarily come out to a literary reading.</p>
<p>We wanted a tour that would make poetry feel like something people can relate to. And something that seemed like fun.</p>
<p>At first we thought we would ride horses from town to town, and call ourselves the Royal Canadian Mounted Poets (RCMP). Then we figured since we don’t know how to ride horses, don’t own horses, and would probably break all our bones on our way to the readings, that was probably a bad idea.</p>
<p>Then we thought of the perfect unconventional tour vehicle: the canoe.</p>
<p>We started Fish Quill Poetry Boat, which is now an annual ten-day poetry and music tour featuring five poets and one musician—2013 will be our fourth year. For riverside towns, the water is a huge part of the life of the community. Travelling along a river seemed like an ideal way to get to know a region rather than just parachuting in for a reading, talking about ourselves and our work, and then taking off.</p>
<p>We chose the Grand River in southwestern Ontario. The Grand is a beautiful river with tonnes of herons, turtles, wildflowers, and spots to camp along its shores. It flows 300 kilometres from the highlands of Dufferin County to Port Maitland, where it empties into Lake Erie.  It’s also a river that connects a whole string of small and medium-sized towns where we found fantastic local organizations willing to partner with us. In particular, our partnership with Treks in the Wild (<a href=""http://www.treksinthewild.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.treksinthewild.com/</a>) has been crucial to this tour.</p>
<p>This June 13-23, FQPB will be paddling from Elora to Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, camping every night and giving performances in pre-arranged and pre-advertised venues along the way.</p>
<p>Our poets this year are David Seymour, Gillian Savigny, Andy McGuire, Leigh Kotsilidis, and Linda Besner. All are accomplished poets, and between us we’ve been shortlisted for the CBC Literary Awards, the Gerald Lampert Award, and have had our work anthologized in publications such as The Best Canadian Poetry Anthology.</p>

<p><strong>HERE'S WHAT WE NEED YOUR CONTRIBUTION FOR:</strong></p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION: Our biggest cost is transportation; even though we get our canoe rental for free from our awesome sponsor, Treks in the Wild, we still need to pay them for the shuttling service they provide—the nature of running a tour by canoe means that sometimes where we sleep (campsites) and where we give our performances (cafés, heritage sites) aren’t very close to each other, and sometimes our campsites are too far from the river for us to lug our canoes and all our gear. If you’ve ever driven a huge van with a canoe rack with three canoes, eight people, and ten days worth of camping gear, you know it guzzles a lot of gas. We also need to get our participants and their gear out to Elora, and then back to Toronto at the tour’s end.</p>
<p>FOOD: We’re lucky to be reading in some great venues that are able to feed us for free, so some of our dinners are taken care of. But we still need to feed six people breakfast and lunch every day for ten days, with a few dinners as well. We cook at our campsites over Coleman stoves, so our budget is very reasonable.</p>
<p>CAMPING: We get some of our camping costs sponsored by the Grand River Conservation Authority, but a few campsites we have to pay for.</p>
<p>PROMOTION: We’ve worked out a great deal with Coach House Books who do our poster and flyer printing for free. But to get our promotional materials out, Leigh and Linda have to rent a car and drive out to the towns our tour goes to and put up posters and place flyers in local businesses and libraries.</p>
<p><em>And, if we exceed our indiegogo goal…</em></p>
<p>ADMINISTRATION: Leigh and Linda organize this tour in their “spare” time. If the four other performers on the tour were to pay a professional tour manager for a ten-day tour with eight performances, complete with all logistical and promotional activity, it would amount to a lot of money. We’d like to offer Leigh and Linda a small honorarium for all their work.</p>
<p>ARTISTS' FEES: Fish Quill Poetry Boat’s writers and musicians are professionals who have reached a high level of accomplishment in their fields. They’ll all be taking time off from other work to go on the tour. We’d like to offer each of them a professional reading fee for each performance.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL GET YOU:</strong></p>
<p>Perks! We’ve got perks galore. We’ve devised rewards for the following levels of Fish Quill supporter:</p>
<p>PERCH: 10$ will get you a Fish Quill tote bag stuffed with the gorgeous Fish Quill poster made by artist extraordinaire Ian Turner, and a Fish Quill magnet.</p>
<p>BASS: $20 will get you a copy of our Fish Quill anthology, a book with poems and song lyrics by Fish Quill performers past and present; that’s 50 acclaimed poets and musicians, including Nick Thran, Gabe Foreman, Asa Boxer, Helen Guri, and Jack Marks.</p>
<p>TROUT: $25 gets you a sweet Fish Quill t-shirt featuring artwork by the talented Ian Turner. Ian’s got serious chops.</p>
<p>SALMON: $50 gets you a plaque-mounted copy of our poster signed by all six of our 2013 participants. Literary wall art you can be proud of.</p>
<p>PIKE: $100 gets you all of the above. A great deal.</p>
<p>DOLPHIN: $300 means we’ll compose a poem just for you! You can commission an original piece on a topic of your choice; it’s an original and meaningful gift for a loved one (or for yourself).</p>
<p>SHARK: $500 gets you a Fish Quill-themed day with Leigh and Linda! First, canoeing on the Grand River, with a private reading on the water. Then, dinner with us at one of the region’s fine restaurants.</p>
<p>SHARK + ONE: $750 gets you AND A GUEST a Fish Quill-themed day with Leigh and Linda! First, canoeing on the Grand River, with a private reading on the water. Then, dinner with us at one of the region’s fine restaurants.</p>
<p>WHALE: $1000 will get you a personal manuscript workshop with acclaimed poets Leigh Kotsilidis and David Seymour. Leigh and David will read your work (up to 70 pages) and provide you with detailed feedback.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL:</strong></p>
<p>The show must go on!  If we don’t reach our funding goal, it means we’ll prioritize paying for transportation, food, and camping, and skimp on our promotion. We would nix any administration fee, so once again Leigh and Linda would do all the work for free and no participants would be paid.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong></p>
<p>What we love about Fish Quill Poetry Boat is that it really does get a different audience out to hear new poetry and music. Every year audience members who’ve been attracted by the quirky concept come up to us after the show to tell us they’ve never been to a poetry reading before, and they loved it. This really means a lot to us. Poetry doesn’t get a lot of exposure in our society, so a lot of people never get a chance to find out whether they like it or not! We always bring extremely high quality performers on our tour, and often their art isn’t what people are expecting.</p>
<p>For the past four years, we have also made a point of involving non-arts organizations who have a concern for the river and see it as an integral part of their environment that enriches lives. We believe it is extremely valuable for these distinct communities to be in conversation with one another. In most cases, we have more in common than we think.</p>
<p>Our track record makes us confident that our 2013 tour will be a success. It’s the fourth year we’ve run Fish Quill Poetry Boat, and every year we’ve had great audiences, great performers, and no one has drowned yet!</p>
<p>If you like the idea of modern-day troubadours heading down a river in canoes to share their music and words, we think you’ll see why Fish Quill Poetry Boat is something we want to run again in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong></p>
<p>Get the word out! If we do say so ourselves, our video is pretty funny—share it on your social media networks, email it to family, friends, and colleagues. You can use Indiegogo’s share tools to make spreading our campaign even easier.</p>

Following the site's 10th Anniversary summer, Dorothy put together a book about the site called ""Ten Summers: The Story of <a href=""http://www.dorothyswebsite.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorothyswebsite.org</a>."" The book includes poetry, photographs and other materials which have appeared online over the years, a history of the site, and other behind-the-scenes information, particularly the story of how the site's creation is related to Dorothy's experiences within the U.S. student loan system.</p>
<p>Dorothy is asking site visitors and others to please get in touch with their inner Santas this holiday season and help her make it past the final hurdles toward getting the book published. The goal of this ""10 Summers"" Indiegogo campaign has been set at a minimum $7,500 level to raise funds for a pre-publication legal review of portions of the book's contents, for pre-publication bound paper copies to be distributed to some of the many people who have been involved in some way with the site over the years, and for the replacement of some semi-working computer equipment which was purchased in 2006. Your generosity in helping this campaign reach its goal would be greatly appreciated! </p>
<p><b><u>THE SITE</u></b></p>
<p>The site was started in the summer of 2003 and was originally intended to be a computer exercise lasting about a month. The 10th Anniversary summer was celebrated in 2012, and <a href=""http://www.dorothyswebsite.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorothyswebsite.org</a> is now in its 11th year! Most people visit the site to find listings of free concerts in several areas of Southern California. There are two phases to <a href=""http://www.dorothyswebsite.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorothyswebsite.org</a> - the smaller Fall/Winter/Spring version (when there are fewer events, the current format), and the Summer version. In the summer the site has a particular theme which changes each year, and the site expands to include other sections: Guest Artists (poets, painters, photographers, sculptors, etc.), featured musical groups or individual performers, poetry, links, ""Extras"" (other things to do, get or see for free), and a series of essays on topics of technology-related consumer interest.</p>
<p>Over the period of its existence, the site has grown to be a steady source of information for concert listings, and to a lesser extent for other free products, services or events. Finding that information has given visitors access to everything from family-friendly activities to free birthday meals. Whether directly or indirectly, the site also has helped create jobs for musicians, support various aspects of the arts, provide information on a variety of science and technology- related topics in a manner which (hopefully) was easy to understand, and give others, particularly musicians and artists, the chance to let people know more about themselves and their work. </p>
<p><b><u>THE BOOK</u></b></p>
<p>As said above, the site was started in 2003 and has been operated since then by the author of ""Ten Summers: The Story of <a href=""http://www.dorothyswebsite.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorothyswebsite.org""</a>, Dorothy Birsic (which is where the name of the site comes from). On more than one occasion over the years someone has said, ""Why don't you put together a book about the site?"" The end of the milestone 10th Anniversary summer in September 2012 seemed to be an opportune time to do just that, but for more than one reason. The date reflected milestone anniversaries of two intertwined stories, the stories of the site and Dorothy's experiences within the U.S. student loan system.</p>
<p>The 228-page working copy of the book, with the cover depicted above, was completed earlier this year. The book includes everything previously listed, plus a detailed description of the summer themes and a photographic collectors' guide/appendix showing the 2 x 3.5 inch cards designed over the years to let people know about the site's existence. There have never been advertisements on the site, nor have advertisements for the site appeared anywhere. People have found out about the site primarily from the cards they were given before or after a concert, by word of mouth, or by an internet search for free concert information. A link to a pdf file of the book's table of contents can be found at <a href=""http://www.dorothyswebsite.org/FallBookPreview.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dorothyswebsite.org/FallBookPreview.html</a>, the site's book information page.</p>
<p><b><u>THE BUDGET</u></b></p>
<p>Your assistance is greatly appreciated in helping Dorothy clear the final hurdles to get the book through to publication. At this time no decision has been made on whether or not to independently publish the book. The $7,500 minimum campaign fundraising goal has been set to meet the following needs: </p>
<p>-- Replacing partially working computer equipment originally purchased in 2006. I typeset/did all the graphics for the working copy. However, the screen on the 2006 CRT monitor I have been using is not large enough to work on a page of the book at full size, and the 2006 all-in-one printer has only one remaining working function (and it's not the printing). A 2006 desktop computer died last year, and I have been using a borrowed one since then. (Estimates: monitor only: $100 - $300, good quality multi-function printer: $200 - $500; new desktop tower/laptop or re-do of overall system: $400 - $2,500).<br/><br/>-- A legal review of certain portions of the book (estimated at $3,000 - $5,000)<br/><br/>-- Following the review, making of 40 B/W and 10 full color bound pre-publication copies to distribute for courtesy review to those who have been involved in the site (estimates, even with volume copy discounts, range from $1,500 to $1,900, plus an estimated $200 - $350 for postage. Some people still need an actual physical copy to review).<br/><br/>-- Fees/expenses associated with the Indiegogo campaign: Will vary. There is an Indiegogo fee of 4% of all funds raised if the campaign goal is met, or 9% of the funds if the goal is not met (plus a 3% fee on credit card contributions).<br/><br/><b><u>ESTIMATED TOTAL BUDGET: $5,400 - over $10,000</u>.</b></p>

Following the site's 10th Anniversary summer, Dorothy put together a book about the site called ""Ten Summers: The Story of www.dorothyswebsite.org."" The book includes poetry, photographs and other materials which have appeared online over the years, a history of the site, and other behind-the-scenes information, particularly the story of how the site's creation is related to Dorothy's experiences within the U.S. student loan system.
Dorothy is asking site visitors and others to please get in touch with their inner Santas this holiday season and help her make it past the final hurdles toward getting the book published. The goal of this ""10 Summers"" Indiegogo campaign has been set at a minimum $7,500 level to raise funds for a pre-publication legal review of portions of the book's contents, for pre-publication bound paper copies to be distributed to some of the many people who have been involved in some way with the site over the years, and for the replacement of some semi-working computer equipment which was purchased in 2006. Your generosity in helping this campaign reach its goal would be greatly appreciated! 
THE SITE
The site was started in the summer of 2003 and was originally intended to be a computer exercise lasting about a month. The 10th Anniversary summer was celebrated in 2012, and www.dorothyswebsite.org is now in its 11th year! Most people visit the site to find listings of free concerts in several areas of Southern California. There are two phases to www.dorothyswebsite.org - the smaller Fall/Winter/Spring version (when there are fewer events, the current format), and the Summer version. In the summer the site has a particular theme which changes each year, and the site expands to include other sections: Guest Artists (poets, painters, photographers, sculptors, etc.), featured musical groups or individual performers, poetry, links, ""Extras"" (other things to do, get or see for free), and a series of essays on topics of technology-related consumer interest.
Over the period of its existence, the site has grown to be a steady source of information for concert listings, and to a lesser extent for other free products, services or events. Finding that information has given visitors access to everything from family-friendly activities to free birthday meals. Whether directly or indirectly, the site also has helped create jobs for musicians, support various aspects of the arts, provide information on a variety of science and technology- related topics in a manner which (hopefully) was easy to understand, and give others, particularly musicians and artists, the chance to let people know more about themselves and their work. 
THE BOOK
As said above, the site was started in 2003 and has been operated since then by the author of ""Ten Summers: The Story of www.dorothyswebsite.org"", Dorothy Birsic (which is where the name of the site comes from). On more than one occasion over the years someone has said, ""Why don't you put together a book about the site?"" The end of the milestone 10th Anniversary summer in September 2012 seemed to be an opportune time to do just that, but for more than one reason. The date reflected milestone anniversaries of two intertwined stories, the stories of the site and Dorothy's experiences within the U.S. student loan system.
The 228-page working copy of the book, with the cover depicted above, was completed earlier this year. The book includes everything previously listed, plus a detailed description of the summer themes and a photographic collectors' guide/appendix showing the 2 x 3.5 inch cards designed over the years to let people know about the site's existence. There have never been advertisements on the site, nor have advertisements for the site appeared anywhere. People have found out about the site primarily from the cards they were given before or after a concert, by word of mouth, or by an internet search for free concert information. A link to a pdf file of the book's table of contents can be found at www.dorothyswebsite.org/FallBookPreview.html, the site's book information page.
THE BUDGET
Your assistance is greatly appreciated in helping Dorothy clear the final hurdles to get the book through to publication. At this time no decision has been made on whether or not to independently publish the book. The $7,500 minimum campaign fundraising goal has been set to meet the following needs: 
-- Replacing partially working computer equipment originally purchased in 2006. I typeset/did all the graphics for the working copy. However, the screen on the 2006 CRT monitor I have been using is not large enough to work on a page of the book at full size, and the 2006 all-in-one printer has only one remaining working function (and it's not the printing). A 2006 desktop computer died last year, and I have been using a borrowed one since then. (Estimates: monitor only: $100 - $300, good quality multi-function printer: $200 - $500; new desktop tower/laptop or re-do of overall system: $400 - $2,500).-- A legal review of certain portions of the book (estimated at $3,000 - $5,000)-- Following the review, making of 40 B/W and 10 full color bound pre-publication copies to distribute for courtesy review to those who have been involved in the site (estimates, even with volume copy discounts, range from $1,500 to $1,900, plus an estimated $200 - $350 for postage. Some people still need an actual physical copy to review).-- Fees/expenses associated with the Indiegogo campaign: Will vary. There is an Indiegogo fee of 4% of all funds raised if the campaign goal is met, or 9% of the funds if the goal is not met (plus a 3% fee on credit card contributions).ESTIMATED TOTAL BUDGET: $5,400 - over $10,000.
PLEASE NOTE: THE $7,500 GOAL IS THE MINIMUM THAT NEEDS TO BE MET TO AVOID HAVING 9% OF THE FUNDS GOING TO INDIEGOGO. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT WHICH CAN BE RAISED, ONLY A DEADLINE, WHICH HAS BEEN SET FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 14. ANY AMOUNT RAISED BEYOND THE FIGURES LISTED IN THE BUDGET ABOVE WILL BE APPLIED TO THE REGULAR OPERATING EXPENSES OF WWW.DOROTHYSWEBSITE.ORG, KEEPING IT GOING IN THE SHORT TERM WHILE DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT ITS LONGER-TERM EXISTENCE.

</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact - Why is this book different?</h3><p>If you are still reading, THANK YOU! Here is a brief description of the book. While it is about Vampires, it also takes a deep look at the relationship and similarities between myth and religion. This story is quite controversial in the way that it paints a very different view of history and religion. I ask readers to question not only, 'What If' but 'What is...'</p><p></p><p><b>What do Jesus Christ, a Greek
goddess and a thousand year old Vampire have in common?</b></p>
<p><b>This intriguing and thought provoking journey will have you questioning
everything you think you know about myth and religion as Chhaya, a vampire born
more than a millennium ago, discovers she is the descendant of an ancient
bloodline, the blood of Christ.</b></p>
<p><b>As the power in her awakens, Chhaya must use her new gifts as the
Daughter of the Moon to fight against the corrupt coven leader Khai to protect the
door to heaven and hell and prevent the end of days.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Whether you are a fan of fantasy, religious theories or mythology you’ll
be inspired to ask, ‘What is good, and what is evil?’</b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>I completely understand that not all people have the spare cash to contribute financially, that's why I'm doing this! So please, if you do believe that this is a worthwhile campaign, share this link and tell your friends and connections. This small gesture can really do so much to help me build the funds to get this unique story out there. </p><p>The share tools are all easily accessible on this page, Thanks!</p></div>","How It All BeganHi, I'm T.

Middle Tier Donations will receive a signed copy of the book 'Daughter of the Moon: Awakening Ancient Bloodlines', offer of a short story tailor written for the donor or as a gift;
Minimal Donations will receive a signed copy of the book 'Daughter of the Moon: Awakening Ancient Bloodlines'.
The Impact - Why is this book different?If you are still reading, THANK YOU! Here is a brief description of the book. While it is about Vampires, it also takes a deep look at the relationship and similarities between myth and religion. This story is quite controversial in the way that it paints a very different view of history and religion. I ask readers to question not only, 'What If' but 'What is...'What do Jesus Christ, a Greek
goddess and a thousand year old Vampire have in common?
This intriguing and thought provoking journey will have you questioning
everything you think you know about myth and religion as Chhaya, a vampire born
more than a millennium ago, discovers she is the descendant of an ancient
bloodline, the blood of Christ.
As the power in her awakens, Chhaya must use her new gifts as the
Daughter of the Moon to fight against the corrupt coven leader Khai to protect the
door to heaven and hell and prevent the end of days.

Whether you are a fan of fantasy, religious theories or mythology you’ll
be inspired to ask, ‘What is good, and what is evil?’Other Ways You Can HelpI completely understand that not all people have the spare cash to contribute financially, that's why I'm doing this!

<p><b>The Grand Experiment</b><br/></p>
<p>Since childhood, we've always been told to be great people and pursue great things. As a Copywriter at an impasse in life, I finally understood that greatness could not be found, it had to be created. Well, this is my creation. This is my attempt to do something great. </p>
<p>This isn't about me or any one individual. This is about changing how people view an industry that's home to some of the world's most creative and talented individuals. That's why I'm calling upon anyone with a creative bone in their body to assist me in bringing this idea to life. If successful, this project can be the spark that ignited a revolution. Let's show the world just how great advertising can be. </p>
<p>So, throughout 2014, I’ll be
plying my craft at advertising agencies across North America. It’s about
discovering creative transcendency, experiencing native cultures and developing
a new understanding of what it means to be a part of this crazy world we call advertising. <b>That's
14 agencies in 14 months. </b></p>
<p>As a creative, I know how hard it can be to find an agency
that best fits one’s talents and interests. That’s why I’m making this trip a
reality. I’ll document the entire experience via a dedicated website and blog, and various other outlets such as
Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter. In the end, I’ll collect it all and publish it as
a hardcover book.</p>
<p>My goal is to show young, hungry creatives just how much
advertising, and creativity in general, varies around the world. Then, perhaps,
they can make better-informed decisions on where they would like to take their
careers and where they will be their happiest.</p>

</p>
<p>I
have received very good feedback that the book was helpful to women
in rural and urban areas to help empower them to empower for their
leadership in Turkey. 
</p>
<p>My
second book is also written for women in rural and urban areas to
support their access to real food and to be self reliant without any
dependence of author</p>
<p>This

in rural and urban areas to help empower them to empower for their
leadership in Turkey. 

My
second book is also written for women in rural and urban areas to
support their access to real food and to be self reliant without any
dependence of author
This
time my second book will help to audience in rural and urban for real
food and to be self reliant without any dependence of authorities. 

Your
support to make this happen will not only support me to share my
knowledge and experience to benefit for Turkish and English speaking
community, at the same time I'll support you with my small gifts.
Please take a look the perks on the right side of this page. Thank

More
about me/the author
I
am an independent researcher of ecology and gender, environmental
activist, and a freelance permaculture designer and teacher. Here’s
my profile on the World Wide Permaculture Network:
www.permacultureglobal.com/users/875-emet-degirmenci

In
2007, I founded Innermost Gardens in Aotearoa/New Zealand inspired to
create a place where refugee and migrant women could grow and share
food together. The project is still very successful to this day:

In
2010, I edited and published the book, 'Kadınlar Ekolojik Dönüşümde'
in Turkish, which translates as (Ecological Trasformation Through
Women's Hand):

The
$5,000 goal set for this campaign.
Indiegogo
charges 4% + 15%TAX 

$1000
travel expenses to visit some inspiring ecological projects to share

Merhaba
ve Indiegogo kampanyama hoşgeldiniz! 

Ben
Emet Değirmenci. Türkiye kökenli olmakla birlikte Avustralya ve
Yeni Zelanda dan sonra şu an ABD'nin Washington eyaleti Seattle
kentinde yaşamaktayım. Permakiltür tasarımcısı ve ekoloji
aktivistliğimi toplumsal adalet odaklı yürütmekteyim. 

Sizden
ikinci kitabımı yazmaya odaklanmak için destek istiyorum. Kitap,
Gıda Bağımsızlığı ve Toplumsal Ekoloji Prensipleriyle Topluluk
Oluşturmak gibi temellere dayanıyor. Pratik beceriler olarak alet
çantası bölümünde ise Etkin Mikroorganizmalarla (EM) çalışan
Bokaşi Kompostu, kurak alanlar için Malçlama teknikleri, Doğadan
besin  toplama bilgeliği ve Anadolu kültüründe bazı gıda
koruma yöntemleri olacak.
İlk
kitabım 2010 yılında çıkan Kadınlar Ekolojik Dönüşümde idi
ve oldukça geniş bir kitleye ulaştı.
http://kitap.radikal.com.tr/Kitap/kadinlar-ekolojik-donusumde-305661
Kitap kırsal ve kentli kadının yerel ekolojik olarak yaptıklarına
sahip çıkması ve sesini duyurmasına teşvik anlamında oldukça
yararlı olduğu yönünde geri bildirimler aldım. 

Bu
kez ikinci kitabım hem gıda bagımsızlığı anlamında işin
politikası hem de merkezi otoritelere bağlı olmaksızın yerel
topluluklar oluşturarak kendine yeterliliği odak alacak.
Yardımınız
yalnızca bilgi ve deneyimlerimi paylaşmaya değil, aynı zamanda
Türkçe ve İngilizce konuşan destekçilerimi gerçek gıda
yetiştirme anlamında kendine yeterlilik için küçük
armağanlarımla desteklemek. Lütfen yan tarafa göz atın. Bu
projeyi kendi netvorkünüzde paylaşırsanız memnun olurum.

Contested Memory: Israel’s Jews and Arabs and the Ghosts of Catastrophe</i>, has just been published by Dundurn Press. I’m
getting very positive feedback so far (see below); and the first review, in <i>Publishers
Weekly</i>, said “<span>Roberts does a masterful job</span> of presenting all perspectives in their proper context.” Now, I
just need to get the word out more widely! Can you help?</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b><b>How much am I trying to raise, and how would I use it?</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>These
days, the publishing industry’s in turmoil, and authors have to do most of
their own book promotion. I'm not expecting to make any money from this book— aside from some Arts Council writing
grants, and a $2,000 publishers' advance, I've been living off my savings.
But I feel passionately about this. I <i>know </i>that there’s a receptive audience out
there for books like mine – books on Israel/Palestine that seek to deepen
understanding, rather than fight a war of words. To reach that audience,
I need to get my book into the hands of people who are in a position to
recommend it widely.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>I’d like to raise <b>$2,500</b>. Here’s how I’d use it:</p>
<p><b>$2,000</b>: I’d buy copies of my book at cost, and mail them
with a personal letter to the people on my growing list. Your money would be
spent on books, mailers, and postage. Depending on postage variables, each book
will cost $<del></del>22-35 to buy and ship out.</p>
<p><b>$500</b>: I’d put this money aside for travel expenses, to
accept the out-of-town invitations to speak that are coming in. <b><u>If I

</i><p><i>After a war, the victors

<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b><b>Why I wrote my book</b></b></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>The debate around Israel/Palestine, and much of the
literature on the topic, is tremendously polarized. I have my own political
perspective, having been a human rights observer in the West Bank, but what I
wanted to do in this book is to convey how the memory of past trauma has shaped
both people’s collective understanding of themselves and each other. This gives
breathing room to the complexities of human experience, the fears and
vulnerabilities of human suffering. As one of the Israelis I interviewed said
to me, “We can’t communicate if we won’t acknowledge the pain the Other is
feeling.”</p>

<p>I’m discovering that these days authors are expected to do the lion’s share of promoting their
books. My publisher sent out some advance copies, and will send review copies
to anyone who has definite plans to review the book. I’d like to be more

(if a few profs choose a book as recommended reading for a course, that really

</h4><p>In the spring of 2011 Laura Lane and Laurie Nersten found
out that they both had 12 year old daughters, Celeste and Hayley, who were both
diagnosed with Pineoblastoma, a very rare form of brain tumour. They were even
both hospitalized and diagnosed within a month of each other.  These two mothers are now writing a book
together. It is the story of two beautiful girls and two mothers who prayed for
each other daily and the miracles they found in their two year journey
together.  It is the story of friendship
and inspiration, of struggles and miracles, of joy and sadness, of love and
loss as they share how they supported one another as the the girls went through
radiation, chemotherapy, as they watched the girls return to school and coped
with relapses and ultimately the death of one of the girls. Laura was inspired
to write the book and has spearheaded the project. She then asked Laurie to be
her co-author.  Both mothers share the initial
story of their girls, they share the relationship that developed between Laura
and Laurie as they supported their daughters in hospitals 500 miles apart from
each other.  Laura finishes the book by sharing
and summarizing the many things they learned about facing your child’s cancer
with Hope, Strength and Courage! </p><p></p><p>Laura Lane is a published children’s book
author, poet, artist, gallery owner and coaches clients on how to gain clarity
to live an inspired life filled with passion and purpose, not only in setting
goals but how to achieve them. In the
book, Laura shares how much of her back ground in personal growth and
development helped her to remain positive and help her daughter through
treatments and her end of life transition to her Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>The book is nearing completion, soon to be
edited with a manuscript completion date of February 24th, the third anniversary of Celeste surgery
and diagnosis and the first anniversary of Celeste’s passing, and to be published with a first release date of June 8<sup>th</sup> 2014, Celeste's 16th birthday.<br/></p>
<p>Laura has been working with other New York
Times bestselling authors to get this book “Two Mothers, One Prayer” into the
hands of hundreds of thousands of parents around the world whose children are
currently battling cancer in order to share the Hope, Strength and Courage that
they found to continue to brave the journey they take with their children every
day.</p>
<p>In order to finish the book, and the
editing, publishing, marketing needed to make it available to parents
worldwide, they need your support. Once they have 20,000 pre-orders of the book
they will pitch the book to major publishers such as Hay House, New World
Library and Simon &amp; Schuster. From there the book will be sold and marketed
online and in bookstores internationally. </p>

<br/><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></div>","About the Book
In the spring of 2011 Laura Lane and Laurie Nersten found
out that they both had 12 year old daughters, Celeste and Hayley, who were both
diagnosed with Pineoblastoma, a very rare form of brain tumour. They were even
both hospitalized and diagnosed within a month of each other.  These two mothers are now writing a book
together. It is the story of two beautiful girls and two mothers who prayed for
each other daily and the miracles they found in their two year journey
together.  It is the story of friendship
and inspiration, of struggles and miracles, of joy and sadness, of love and
loss as they share how they supported one another as the the girls went through
radiation, chemotherapy, as they watched the girls return to school and coped
with relapses and ultimately the death of one of the girls. Laura was inspired
to write the book and has spearheaded the project. She then asked Laurie to be
her co-author.  Both mothers share the initial
story of their girls, they share the relationship that developed between Laura
and Laurie as they supported their daughters in hospitals 500 miles apart from
each other.  Laura finishes the book by sharing
and summarizing the many things they learned about facing your child’s cancer
with Hope, Strength and Courage! Laura Lane is a published children’s book
author, poet, artist, gallery owner and coaches clients on how to gain clarity
to live an inspired life filled with passion and purpose, not only in setting
goals but how to achieve them. In the
book, Laura shares how much of her back ground in personal growth and
development helped her to remain positive and help her daughter through
treatments and her end of life transition to her Heavenly Father.
The book is nearing completion, soon to be
edited with a manuscript completion date of February 24th, the third anniversary of Celeste surgery
and diagnosis and the first anniversary of Celeste’s passing, and to be published with a first release date of June 8th 2014, Celeste's 16th birthday.
Laura has been working with other New York
Times bestselling authors to get this book “Two Mothers, One Prayer” into the
hands of hundreds of thousands of parents around the world whose children are
currently battling cancer in order to share the Hope, Strength and Courage that
they found to continue to brave the journey they take with their children every
day.
In order to finish the book, and the
editing, publishing, marketing needed to make it available to parents
worldwide, they need your support. Once they have 20,000 pre-orders of the book
they will pitch the book to major publishers such as Hay House, New World
Library and Simon & Schuster. From there the book will be sold and marketed
online and in bookstores internationally.

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is <em>Radical Family! Parenting?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Radical</em></strong><strong> <em>Family! Parenting</em> </strong>is the culmination of nearly two decades of supporting children and families. Having worked with hundreds of families and taught several conventional parenting curricula, Jess Robertson grew increasingly disheartened by the lack of compassion being shown to children. Books such as Alfie Kohn's <em>Unconditional Parenting </em>offered some perspectives that were helpful for supporting families but he was unable to find a parenting curriculum that personified the value of unconditional love. Discovering the world of Whole-Life Unschooling, in 2009, Jess was encouraged by the close and respectful relationships he saw between parents and children. Over the next few years Jess noticed that some families in the Unschooling community struggled to put into practice the values they held. He also believed that no matter a family's perspective on learning, values of kindness were applicable and needed by all. Thus began the two year journey of writing a guide book to support parents who were looking for help in their pursuit of having an unconditionally loving relationship with their children. </p>

<h3>Here's a brief synopsis of the story:</h3>
<p><em>Thirteen-year-old Charles Siskin is not like other boys. Set apart from everyone by his odd disposition and what his schoolmates see as a distinctly feminine way of speaking and walking, he has become an outcast. He talks his parents into letting him attend St. Ignatius Loyola High School, an all boys, military private school. And when he auditions for the spring play, he sets a series of events into motion that lead to a crushing and humiliating catastrophe.</em></p>

<h3>The need for this campaign:</h3>
<p>To be able to get the story of Charles Siskin out there, we still have some financial hurdles to jump. While I've been able to take care of many of the costs myself, creating a book like this and getting this important story out there simply takes a lot. The funds raised during this campaign will cover expenses including art, design, self-publishing (digital and print), website creation and marketing.</p></div>","I think it’s important to say a word or two about why I wrote this book.

I would like this to be a story that will start a conversation, or maybe a whole lot of conversations, among people who may believe that they have nothing in common. And maybe after these conversations, the reader might find her or himself a little closer to someone they previously thought was completely foreign to her or him.
Most of all, I would like this to be a story that offers hope. 
 
Here's a brief synopsis of the story:
Thirteen-year-old Charles Siskin is not like other boys. Set apart from everyone by his odd disposition and what his schoolmates see as a distinctly feminine way of speaking and walking, he has become an outcast. He talks his parents into letting him attend St. Ignatius Loyola High School, an all boys, military private school. And when he auditions for the spring play, he sets a series of events into motion that lead to a crushing and humiliating catastrophe.
 
The need for this campaign:
To be able to get the story of Charles Siskin out there, we still have some financial hurdles to jump. While I've been able to take care of many of the costs myself, creating a book like this and getting this important story out there simply takes a lot. The funds raised during this campaign will cover expenses including art, design, self-publishing (digital and print), website creation and marketing.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Book</h3>
</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>When her dreams start to suddenly, terrifyingly come true, Maggie Stuart realizes her life is something far from ordinary. Fortunately, Maggie is anything but an ordinary 13-year old girl.</em></div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;"">
<br/><em>First, her estranged father shows up out of the blue with a mysterious young man who shows an unnatural interest in Maggie. Then, she’s torn from home, school, and family and thrown into the middle of an ancient struggle between Char, a being of almost limitless power, and his terrifying children.</em><br/><br/><em>Will Maggie be pawn, or player? Will she escape from Char’s clutches, or be transformed? And above all, can she find a way to overcome her greatest fear — of what she herself is becoming?</em>
</div>
<div>
<br/>I'm raising money to launch a comprehensive publicity campaign to promote, distribute, and otherwise introduce Maggie to the world. Besides, I can't wait to write the sequels!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>THE LAST RITE is published by Wildcard Pictures Productions and Lulu.com. It's 338 pages long, which makes it somewhere around 147,000 words. This beautiful new edition is a trade paperback and features new cover art, illustrations and a schematic of Maggie's school inside, and what I believe is some of the best writing I've ever done.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wrote THE LAST RITE to fulfill a very basic desire: to put down on paper the kind of book I loved to read when I was a kid and still go back to year after year as an adult. I can't get enough of adventures stories that mix reality and hyper- or supernormal realities, that make ordinary (or slightly extraordinary) people face their fears, their weaknesses, and their baggage and just HAVE to step up to win.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have big plans for little Maggie Stuart. The sequel to this novel is called THE RED RING and it's almost ready to go once THE LAST RITE is properly launched. And I have two more books planned which will actually take Maggie from her baby steps at 13 through high school, into young adulthood, finally emerging as a fully grown woman in the final story.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's how we've structured the marketing campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted Ads</li>
<li>Email campaign</li>
<li>Wholesale book purchases for resale &amp; local stores</li>
<li>Local, national, and world-wide media campaign</li>
<li>Bookstore tour for readings and signings</li>
<li>Fan con presence for direct sales to our best audience</li>
</ul>
<p>If we raise 50% of the funds, our priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>attend conventions and market directly to fans</li>
<li>increase social media presence for the book, the characters, and Jen</li>
<li>a smaller number of targeted ads</li>
</ul>
<p>If we raise 33% of the funds, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>again lower the number of targeted ads, and</li>
<li>begin another campaign, but ONLY when we believe interest has increased enough for the goal to be met entirely</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, we'll use whatever you donate to make sure that we are constantly building awareness and an audience, and that the donations will be used in the most effective way.</p>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>I want the perks for you to be as personal and meaningful as the Maggie series is to me. Every book that you order directly from me will come signed, and personalized if you like. You'll also get a personalized thank you card from me featuring one of the original drawings from THE LAST RITE. For donations of $100 or more, you'll get a card with a drawing from the NEXT book, THE RED RING, as an extra special thanks.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>Although I can't say I ever write something just because it will sell, I also believe absolutely in writing something that will satisfy readers at the most elemental level. This means writing from the heart, and always learning more about humanity, psychology, storytelling, and the mechanics of being an author. There's a lot of passion that goes into what I write, but there's just as much a sense that I'm working my craft.</p>
<p>Here's why I love Maggie Stuart, the character and the series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maggie enters her adventures as barely a teenager, and is as unready for the challenges she confronts as any of us would be. Uniquely though, it's her flaws that provide her with the strength she needs to survive and ultimately triumph as much as her own positive attributes.</li>
<li>As she grows, Maggie faces real life problems in greater numbers than her occult issues. Not ever kid has a great upbringing, or all the advantages money or love can provide. When Maggie develops difficulties trying to succeed despite her advantages, I think readers will empathize, and see their own struggles reflected in her.</li>
<li>It's not easy to be different, and Maggie has to cope with that as well as the secrets she carries. Her journey to a fulfilled life is a long and often dark one, but it's going to be rewarding AND a lot of fun along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the reasons I haven't pursued a traditional publisher with this novel is maybe an ironic one: the very thing I think makes THE LAST RITE unique and valuable is the same thing that has made publishers say no. It's hard for a publisher to market a book with a young adult protagonist that is written, essentially, to appeal to both kids AND adults.</p>
<p>But if you love the same kind of books I do, you know that adults not only re-read the books they loved as kids, they also love to read well-written YA books. I want to bridge the gap in our thinking -- sometimes, a book can have as much appeal to a smart 13 year old as to a grown-up who still loves fantasy, sci fi, and horror.</p>
<p>The biggest reason I started writing is for the love of stories. I write the kind of books I want to read, and I think you will love Maggie as much as I do!</p>

<h3>Who You'll Meet - The Characters</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Maggie Stuart</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Maggie is 13 when we meet her, a bit of an oddball at school. Her mom has recently started dating again, which is something Maggie finds strangely disturbing. Her dad isn't in the picture - he ran away with her when Maggie was still a baby and it took Interpol and a long court process to get her back to Canada and her mother. Maggie's favorite teacher at Westbrook Elementary School is Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Mr. Hunt</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Hunt is the kind of teacher you like and fear in just about equal measure. He's strict, but fair. He's also kind of unpredictable - and Maggie thinks he may have more than his share of a sadistic streak. He's also in Westbrook for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with teaching.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Jason Lawson</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong></strong>Maggie's hopeless first crush. Jason is everything Maggie isn't - outgoing, athletic, and popular. But they have more in common than either might think, and their worlds collide after Jason accidentally spies on some very bizarre activities happening inside Mr. Hunt's room.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Arabella</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Aria seems to be a girl of about sixteen, but you don't have to know her very long to know that impression barely scratches the surface of the truth. She's brutal, and arrogant, and fearless. She's also heir to an underground kingdom of enormous scope and she'll do anything to secure her future throne.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Damon</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Arabella's older brother, but he has been passed over in the succession. He may even take the whole power struggle less seriously than she does, but that hardly means he can avoid the fallout of an ancient battle for supremacy which is only now coming to a head.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>John Tamblyn</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong></strong>In disgrace after an infamous investigation in Vancouver, Tamblyn works for the Toronto Metro Police in a mysterious capacity.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Carla Szaba</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A constable with the Toronto Metro Police, Carla has kept a close and surreptitious eye on John Tamblyn since he was hired. She doesn't like what she sees, and she's determined to find out what he really is and who he answers to.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Jan Stuart</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Maggie's mom, a single mother since her relationship with Maggie's dad Nick Marino blew up in her face. Slow to trust, she feels out of her depth with a teenage daughter, especially one as private and troubled as Maggie. But when Maggie vanishes, she realizes there is nothing she won't do to bring her back.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Nikolas Marino</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong></strong>Maggie's long-estranged dad. Even he's not sure why he's returned after all these years to rekindle a relationship with his daughter. Maybe that's because it wasn't entirely his own idea.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Char</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A being of immense power and influence. Char makes and unmakes kings, politicians, and potentates. He rules a shadowy underground kingdom that exists just below our own.

<h3>Worthy of Wonderful(TM)-Book, Workshops, and Online Classes Copyright 2013</h3>
<p>In 1993 I wrote a song entitled “I Am Worthy of Love”, inspired by her own challenging experiences of self worth. After recording and releasing the song, I began to travel as an inspirational singer, speaker and songwriter. I have performed this song for thousands of people across the county and around the world. Before each performance of the song I have the audience loudly decree “I am worthy, not because of what I know, not because of what I do, it’s simply because I am, I am, and so therefore I am worthy”. </p>
<p>Now I have written the book inspirired by that song. The book is entitled Worthy of Wonderful. The book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Places worthiness in a combined context of Relationships, Career, Finances, and Wellness.</li>
<li>Is embedded with a process enableing the reader to incorporate the information provided in each chapter and;</li>
<li>Includes original inspirational music that corresponds with each chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Excerpt from Worthy of Wonderful:</p>
<p><strong>""Clarifying Worthiness-</strong>The terms self-worth and self-esteem are frequently used interchangeably. But they are not the same. The Webster’s dictionary defines self-esteem as <em>a feeling of pride in oneself</em>. Self-worth is defined as <em>the quality of</em> <em>being worthy of esteem or respect</em>.... A person may have high self-esteem based on what they know, possess or how they look, but struggle endlessly to live up to their perceived potential because they lack a strong foundation of self-worth....When you embrace your self-worth, you know you are sufficient – you are okay as you are, even during times when you feel low and discouraged. And conversely, when you have the world by the tail, your success is at hand and everything you touch turns to gold...""</p>

</div></div>","Worthy of Wonderful(TM)-Book, Workshops, and Online Classes Copyright 2013
In 1993 I wrote a song entitled “I Am Worthy of Love”, inspired by her own challenging experiences of self worth. After recording and releasing the song, I began to travel as an inspirational singer, speaker and songwriter. I have performed this song for thousands of people across the county and around the world. Before each performance of the song I have the audience loudly decree “I am worthy, not because of what I know, not because of what I do, it’s simply because I am, I am, and so therefore I am worthy”. 
Now I have written the book inspirired by that song. The book is entitled Worthy of Wonderful. The book:

Places worthiness in a combined context of Relationships, Career, Finances, and Wellness.
Is embedded with a process enableing the reader to incorporate the information provided in each chapter and;
Includes original inspirational music that corresponds with each chapter.

Excerpt from Worthy of Wonderful:
""Clarifying Worthiness-The terms self-worth and self-esteem are frequently used interchangeably. But they are not the same. The Webster’s dictionary defines self-esteem as a feeling of pride in oneself. Self-worth is defined as the quality of being worthy of esteem or respect.... A person may have high self-esteem based on what they know, possess or how they look, but struggle endlessly to live up to their perceived potential because they lack a strong foundation of self-worth....When you embrace your self-worth, you know you are sufficient – you are okay as you are, even during times when you feel low and discouraged. And conversely, when you have the world by the tail, your success is at hand and everything you touch turns to gold...""


Worthy of Wonderful is more than a book
More than a book, Worthy of Wonderful is platform supporting workshops and online classes. Like the book, the workshops and classes are designed to uplift, enlighten, and inform audieneces on ways to improve overall well'being.
The workshops:

Combines physical activity with life coaching activity.
Combines positive music with video imagery.

The online classes:

Combines the positive music/video imagery with online curriculum.

A two-time Pushcart nominee and multi-award winner, Lovin’s writing has appeared in numerous journals and anthologies. The Society for Humanistic Anthropology chose her heroic crown sonnet, “Myth Information,” recipient of the 2009 Ethnographic Poetry Award. The Southern Women Writers’ Conference awarded Lovin the 2007 Emerging Poet Award. Her poetry has been named finalist for the 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Rita Dove International Poetry Award and the 7th Juried Reading at the Poetry Center of Chicago. She has received the Judson Jerome Scholarship from Antioch Writers’ Workshop, the Baron Wormser Scholarship for Stone Coast Writers’ Conference, and most recently was awarded the 2008 AWP WC&amp;C Poetry Scholarship. Lovin has served as Writer-in-Residence at Devil’s Tower National Monument and the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Central Oregon. She has been a resident fellow at Hopscotch House, Prairie Center of the Arts, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, Vermont Studio Center, and Footpaths House in the Azores. Her work has been generously supported on several occasions with grants from the Elizabeth George Foundation, the Kentucky Foundation for Women and the Kentucky Arts Council, including the 2007 Al Smith Fellowship. She lives with four dogs in centreal Kentucky, where she is currently a lecturer in the English Department at Eastern Kentucky University. </p>
<p> </p>Christina has been chosen to lead a writing group at the 2011 AROHO (A Room of Her Own) Retreat at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, August 8-14. Although half the registration fee has been waived for group leaders and presenters, lodging at the retreat, as well as transporation to and at the retreat remain as direct costs. 
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IMPACT: Having come to literary writing rather late in life, I feel I have a lot to contribute to a group of women over fifty. When I was fifty-one, I decided to take my writing seriously. That summer, I enrolled in Harvard University's summer writing program. I returned the next summer for more writing sessions. As a result of those two summers, I was encouraged to go for a Master of Fine Arts degree in Creative Writing. Now at sixty-two, I have completed that MFA and have spent the last seven years teaching writing at the college level, as well as presenting workshops at various venues around the U.S. I belive it's never too late to begin one's life work. I am a prime example of that idea. Leading a group of older women as we explore what ""women of a certain age"" have learned about life can inform and enrich our writing is an exciting prospect for me. Having time to converse and commune with nearly a hundred other women writers and artists in such an enchanted place (Ghost Ranch was the summer home of the artist Georgie O'Keefe) will be an added delight for this old girl. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT I NEED:  The registration for the week-long retreat is $294 for presenters. Room &amp; Board is just over $500. Travel has not yet been scheduled, but preliminary searches have shown that travel will be around $500 as well. Factor in a couple hundred dollars for incidentals and the total for the retreat will be around $1500. I will still be attending the retreat even if my goal is not made. It will just be a financial burden, as summers are when my income drops to about half of that during the academic year. </p>

Who is Kyle V. Hiller?
Just some dude from West Philly who wrote a book.

I'm a proud native from West Philadelphia. I've been writing since I was a shorty in Kindergarten. Hyperrealism is my jam. And I like the absurd: fantasy seems a lot more real to me than reality most of the time. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was kind of a big deal for me. I don't care if admitting that makes me basic. I'm a ""new writer,"" so I don't think I can list a bunch of awards and accolades. I haven't been all over the world. But I come from a place where passion runs deep and allows you to see things in unique ways. 





Where Are Contributions Going?

“This book ain’t free!""
The cost of writing a book adds up. There's professional editing and illustrating, ISBNs and printing fees, copyrights and marketing, and...
...Okay, that's the boring stuff. This campaign isn't about recouping funds. It's about investing in the future. And I want you to be part of it.
Everyone who contributes will receive a discount on all future independently published works from me. This means that your contribution is not merely a donation, but an investment that pays in the long run. And I'm in it for the long run.

Beyond the Book
Why is The Recital important to you and the rest of the world?
It's time to take independent authors seriously. I'm not the Messiah for self-publishing, but I do want to hold hands with all the other writers like me and move forward together. Publishing is changing. Writing is changing. Art is changing. We all are changing.
The Recital is a real, raw story of what it’s like to be twelve going on thirteen. As a black author, I’d like to send a message to the young diverse artists out there and encourage them to express themselves honestly without compromise. As a person raised in a low-income, single-parent home, I’d hope to send ripples of hope back to the neighborhood I grew up in, and whatever other places like it that I can extend my reach to.
The Recital taps into some sensitive themes like bullying, homosexuality, familial conflict, and drug use—all of which are real and confusing things for our budding young adults. 
Edith does so with bravery but she is flawed, thrust into the world of adolescence—a murky place that defines and then twists our fibers into knots for the rest of our lives. 
The Recital is honest: these things do happen to our preteens. It happened to us. Edith is here to help us understand it better through her journey as a seventh grade witch.

The Perks of Being A Wallflower




Simply Crafty is a small business with some nifty crafts and gifts. I'm excited to be partnering up to give you some exclusive gear for The Recital. The perks won't be available for sale beyond the campaign. Get your hands on some stuff and be one of the cool kids!
Please note that all contributions that have physical perks will incur a $2 shipping fee.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been working with children for over ten years, and ever since my first day a passion has continued to stir in my heart to nurture, encourage, and challenge children to grow in the Lord. </p>
<p>For the entirety of my elementary education I was homeschooled and grew to deeply appreciate the value of a parent's interaction with their children, and this book is designed to encourage that interaction. </p>
<p>I received my degree in Film from Western Kentucky University, where I learned and honed my skills of storytelling. It has been a great passion of mine to create art, as well as encourage young people. </p>
<p>Tuck Tuck's Tales is a way for me to accomplish both. Children are never more easily influenced than during their first several years and it is so important to nurture them with wholesome and rich entertainment that doesn't numb their spirit but encourages it. </p>
<p>By participating in this campaign, you are stepping forward to nurture young minds and broaden imaginations in a way that is God honoring. </p>
<p>Tuck Tuck's Tales: The Great White Horse is merely the beginning...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this book I am looking to raise $4,000. The majority of this money will go to pay for the rest of the illustrations, which are being masterfully crafted by Miss Niamh Sinclair of the U.K.  </p>
<p>Other expenses will include purchasing the book's ISBN #, and legal fees such as finalizing the trademark. I have already invested a good deal of my own funds over the 10 years, but am unable to clear the remaining hurdle alone. Every dollar given will be met with massive appreciation and gratitude. </p>
<p>We are offering some great perks in exchange for your generosity! These perks will include digital character sheets, where you can see the character designs Miss Sinclair crafted in bringing these characters to life! </p>
<p>Other perks include signed copies of the book for yourself as well as copies donated to various schools, libraries and charitable organizations! This book is meant to be in the hands of children, regardless of social status or financial capability and your gift can make that happen! </p>
<p>Finally, we are offering a limited run of illustration posters! You can have your very own poster of one of the beautiful illustrations completed by Niamh Sinclair. </p>
<p>In the event we do not reach our goal here, the funds we <i>do</i> raise will be used entirely on illustration work. Children respond well to visual elements such as illustrations, making those the highest priority at this juncture. </p>
<p>I hope you will considering partnering with this project financially. Every dollar is one step closer to this story being in the hands of the children it can impact. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We live in a world where technology reigns. Where the tablets and tv screens are rapidly replacing more traditional means of both entertainment and education. While I have no issues with technology (I received a degree in Film) I do believe there is great benefit in the breaking open of a good book, to turn the pages and let the story unfold before you. This book is an effort to preserve this medium and create a book of lasting impact for generations to come. </p>
<p>Children are smart, and will very often rise to the challenges we set before them. This book attempts to provide children with a mental challenge, encouraging them to rise up and tackle slightly more difficult words, sentence structures, and plots. </p>
<p>At <strong>no</strong> time in a person's life are they more easily influenced than in the early years of their childhood. This means that what we give our children in terms of entertainment is of the utmost importance. I have dedicated myself to creating uplifting and rich media that will have a positive impact on the children who read it. Tuck Tuck's Tales: The Great White Horse is only the first of what I hope to be many books that will enrich the spirits of kids everywhere and glorify the Lord who made them. </p>
<p>But I'm going to need your help in order to make that happen...</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any art form, there are some obstacles in the way!</p>
<p>Getting the word out concerning this project will be one of our largest hurdles. In utilizing the independent publishing route, every voice we have to raise awareness of the book is a huge help! </p>
<p>Of course, this presents the inherent risk that not enough awareness will be raised, thus having a negative impact on our mission.  </p>
<p>However, we have an answer to this problem: You. Your contact list, your circle of friends, is the answer to our potential issue of awareness. With only one share you've raised the awareness of this project dramatically. If enough people hit that share button, send that email, and tell that friend or family member, awareness will not be a problem for us. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, there are still major ways in which you can help this project come to life:</p>
<p>1) Pray for us. It is my sincerest hope that this project glorifies the Lord. The more people that we have supporting this project with their prayers, the better!</p>
<p>2) Spread the word! Social media, emails, word of mouth, and even Indiegogo itself are all excellent ways to spread the word about this project!</p>

Sin embargo, el resto de los barcos que componen la flota pesquera menorquina se quedaron amarrados y a buen cobijo en los puertos de Mahón, Ciudatella y Fornells, esperando a que remitiera el fuerte vendaval. Soportábamos la hostilidad de este mar que se encabritó en las últimas horas.

<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Mateo Cerdán Cárceles</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>

Llevábamos dos horas con el arte de pesca calado y navegando a una lenta velocidad de apenas tres nudos. Sin embargo, el resto de los barcos que componen la flota pesquera menorquina se quedaron amarrados y a buen cobijo en los puertos de Mahón, Ciudatella y Fornells, esperando a que remitiera el fuerte vendaval. Soportábamos la hostilidad de este mar que se encabritó en las últimas horas. Podríamos decir que es uno de esos días en los que a cualquier persona se le quitan las ganas de navegar y si se ha elegido el oficio de pescador no deja de preguntarse por qué ha optado por esta fatigosa profesión».
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Aviso para navegantes: La opción BACK IT es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Mateo Cerdán Cárceles vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

Finally, we take a peek at the issues championed by the activists and advocates in this book—from #MeToo in China, to Ukrainian civil service reform, to battling climate change—in order to give a bit of background before we hear their stories.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains 4 chapters. In this section, we get to explore the stories and triumphs of young female activists and advocates by looking at some of the tactics that they use to make them successful. From Social Media to Social Movement Organizations, and everything in between, we learn more about what it takes to become a successful activist and advocate.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains the last 4 chapters. To wrap things up, Part 3 aims to use the tactics and stories from the previous two sections in order to guide potential activists and advocates as they begin their own journeys.

<br/>
<b>Petit Pois Collection</b>, c'est un univers créé par <b>Manuella Côté</b>, illustratrice et designer graphique depuis plus de 8 ans déjà. J'ai toujours été une passionnée des contes et histoires, des personnages les habitant et des mondes les entourant. Durant mon baccalauréat en Design Graphique à l'Université Laval, j'ai toujours eu une préférence pour les cours d'illustrations dans le but de me perfectionner dans ce domaine. C'est d'ailleurs durant ces années que j'ai eu la piqûre pour l'illustration d'édition et surtout, l'<b>édition jeunesse</b>.
<br/><br/>
Depuis la fin de mon baccalauréat, j'ai toujours voulu œuvrer dans l'édition jeunesse, mais travaillant principalement dans un autre domaine, je n'avais pas, ou peu, de temps pour m'y consacrer. Le ""bon moment"" est arrivé durant mon premier congé de maternité. J'inventais des histoires pour mon petit garçon et je me suis alors dit : Pourquoi ne pas les illustrer et en faire des livres?  <b>Petit Pois Collection</b> était né. Depuis sa création, cinq tomes, un cahier à colorier et une foule de petits produits dérivés ont fait leur apparition pour le plus grand plaisir des enfants et des parents.
<br/><br/>
L'histoire de<b> Macha et Pasta</b> a toujours été très aimée des enfants et on m'a souvent demandé d'écrire d'autres histoires avec ces héros. C'est d'ailleurs pour cette nouvelle aventure que j'ai ouvert une campagne. J'ai toujours fait ces livres par <b>passion</b> plutôt que par profit et comme je suis maintenant travailleuse autonome, il m'est plutôt difficile de financer ce nouveau projet par moi-même. Je souhaite énormément pouvoir vous offrir ce nouveau livre qui mijote depuis 2 ans déjà, mais dont je n'ai pas été en mesure de finaliser pour diverses raisons.
<br/><br/>
C'est donc pourquoi je fais appel à vous. Grâce à cette campagne de financement, je pourrai me concentrer à terminer ce livre et à ne pas stresser quant aux coûts d'impressions qu'il va nécessiter. Je pourrai avoir la certitude que ce livre sera achevé et que les jeunes lecteurs pourront en profiter dès l'été/automne 2015. <div><br/></div><div>

<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Ce que cette campagne inclut?</h3>
<br/>
Pour le montant que je désire atteindre, soit <b>1 400$</b>, environ les deux tiers sont nécessaire pour permettre l'<b>impression du livre</b>.

</div></div>","C'est quoi, Petit Pois Collection?

Petit Pois Collection, c'est un univers créé par Manuella Côté, illustratrice et designer graphique depuis plus de 8 ans déjà. J'ai toujours été une passionnée des contes et histoires, des personnages les habitant et des mondes les entourant. Durant mon baccalauréat en Design Graphique à l'Université Laval, j'ai toujours eu une préférence pour les cours d'illustrations dans le but de me perfectionner dans ce domaine. C'est d'ailleurs durant ces années que j'ai eu la piqûre pour l'illustration d'édition et surtout, l'édition jeunesse.

Depuis la fin de mon baccalauréat, j'ai toujours voulu œuvrer dans l'édition jeunesse, mais travaillant principalement dans un autre domaine, je n'avais pas, ou peu, de temps pour m'y consacrer. Le ""bon moment"" est arrivé durant mon premier congé de maternité. J'inventais des histoires pour mon petit garçon et je me suis alors dit : Pourquoi ne pas les illustrer et en faire des livres?  Petit Pois Collection était né. Depuis sa création, cinq tomes, un cahier à colorier et une foule de petits produits dérivés ont fait leur apparition pour le plus grand plaisir des enfants et des parents.

L'histoire de Macha et Pasta a toujours été très aimée des enfants et on m'a souvent demandé d'écrire d'autres histoires avec ces héros. C'est d'ailleurs pour cette nouvelle aventure que j'ai ouvert une campagne. J'ai toujours fait ces livres par passion plutôt que par profit et comme je suis maintenant travailleuse autonome, il m'est plutôt difficile de financer ce nouveau projet par moi-même. Je souhaite énormément pouvoir vous offrir ce nouveau livre qui mijote depuis 2 ans déjà, mais dont je n'ai pas été en mesure de finaliser pour diverses raisons.

C'est donc pourquoi je fais appel à vous. Grâce à cette campagne de financement, je pourrai me concentrer à terminer ce livre et à ne pas stresser quant aux coûts d'impressions qu'il va nécessiter. Je pourrai avoir la certitude que ce livre sera achevé et que les jeunes lecteurs pourront en profiter dès l'été/automne 2015. 




Ce que cette campagne inclut?

Pour le montant que je désire atteindre, soit 1 400$, environ les deux tiers sont nécessaire pour permettre l'impression du livre. 
De plus, ayant épuisé la presque totalité des cartes d'affaires de Petit Pois Collection (puisque j'en inclut une à chaque achat et j'en donne aux boutiques qui tiennent la collection), il me faut renouveler mon inventaire. Donc sur le tiers restant, une partie ira pour l'impression de nouvelles cartes. Une autre partie des fonds iront pour les envois postaux de tout ces beaux livres et des commandes qui s'y rattachent, en lien avec la campagne de financement.  
Il y a bien sur les frais pour lancer cette campagne, qui sont inclus dans le montant.
Si je ne réussis pas à atteindre complètement mon objectif, sachez que la priorité va aller à l'impression du livre, donc les sous que j'aurai réussis à accumuler vont quand même m'aider à imprimer ce nouveau tome. 

Si nous dépassons l'objectif? J'aimerais grandement réimprimer le tome 1, puisqu'il me reste très peu de copies disponible. Donc si nous parvenons à atteindre 2 000$ je pourrai mettre le tome 1 en réimpression (pour la troisième fois!) J'aimerais aussi avoir la possibilité de réimprimer le tome 2, donc si jamais le montant arrive à 2 500$, le tome 2 ira en réimpression (pour la première fois!)Ce tout nouveau livre est prévus pour l'AUTOMNE 2015.

This book emerged from the influx of emotions I’ve experienced in the past few years, and grew into a way I could begin to express my fears and hopes and uncertainties about life. <br/><br/>There’s a little about the worry of not knowing what you want in life, not knowing where you see yourself in the future. About leaving behind a changing city and the fear that you’ll never be able to see it again, or at least that the next time you return, you wouldn’t be able to recognise it. About coming to terms of being trans and queer in an unsupportive family. The book doesn’t explicitly address any of these topics, but the story very much arose from my own experiences with this. <br/><br/>It took years of self-doubt and fear before I found the courage inside me to be true to myself. And I still don’t think I truly have what it takes to go where I need to go. But I hope that this book helps you on that journey, wherever you might be in life, struggling through times of uncertainty, of breaking expectations, of building futures. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside the characters about the struggles and joys we face. I hope that this book will remind people that there’s so much more out there, and there’s always so much more room to grow. <br/><br/>This book is written for everyone dealing with uncertainty in some sort of way. You’d love this book if you enjoy coming of age stories, or stories about discovery and courage with an ominous tone. </p><h3> </h3><h3>The Book - The Sky, Soft Red</h3><p>The book follows Jordan, our protagonist, as she discovers some terrifying truths about the city she lives in and the choices she makes in light of this knowledge. Jordan’s journey is rooted in the connections we build and break in our lives, from the relationships with our families and friends, to the bonds linking us to the places we grew up in. It’s a story about courage, and overcoming the trials and dangers of a city that has a mind of its own. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605950297/rfh9d5whnvlvzib4jich.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Visually, the book is set in a twisted, dystopian megacity, inspired by the urban landscape of Hong Kong in which I grew up. I want to capture a sense of wonder for the city, especially at night, and build an immersive environment for the characters to explore. <br/><br/>From where I am at right now, it’s like I’m caught between two different stages in life, and this space is where I am writing this story from. Ultimately, I hope that The Sky, Soft Red inspires you reflect on the connections and relationships around you, as well as how you fit into the spaces you’ve built, or will build for yourself. </p><h3> </h3><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get !!</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<i><strong>An anthology of influence</strong></i>...</h3><p>Maurice Kenny was a teacher for almost as long as he was a poet. He taught at North Country Community College in Saranac Lake, NY, the University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK, Paul Smiths College of the Adirondacks, the En'owkin Center in British Columbia, Canada, and at SUNY Potsdam. The corridors of each of these institutions were decidedly quieter and less interesting after he left them, and the rest of the world has come to know that state of unfortunate silence since his death in Saranac Lake at the age of 86 on April 16, 2016.</p><p>We -- Derek C. Maus and Donald McNutt -- would like to publish a volume of poetry and essays inspired by Maurice's wide-ranging influence as a colleague, a teacher, a writer, a performer, an editor, a friend, and more. Our idea for this volume that transcends the forms that such memorials generally take. There's nothing wrong at all with collections of writings that speak directly to someone's memory -- in fact, our friends at <i>Dawnland Voices 2.0</i> have already published <a href=""http://dawnlandvoices.org/maurice-kenny-a-tribute-in-poetry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>a wonderful compendium</strong></a><strong> </strong>of<strong> <a href=""http://dawnlandvoices.org/remembering-maurice-kenny-a-tribute/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">just such works</a></strong>. What we're proposing to do goes in a slightly different direction in order to honor and to reveal the effect that Maurice had on the world: we'd like to collect and publish new (that is, previously unpublished) work that is in some way inspired by Maurice, whether stylistically, thematically, politically, or otherwise (don't worry, we won't ask you to justify the connection). If you have a poem (long or short), a story (preferably fairly short), a photograph, an illustration, or some other form of artwork that you feel was inspired by Maurice, we'd love to consider it for inclusion in this volume. (please e-mail it to <a href=""mailto:derekmaus@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>derekmaus@gmail.com</strong></a>). The deadline for submissions is <strong>November 1, 2017. </strong>(please note, this deadline is absolutely not flexible, as we need to start production of the physical volume that soon to get it out by June 1, 2018)</p><p>But (of course), this isn't just a call for submissions, it's also a call for financial help. To produce a run of about 400 copies of this volume (which we're estimating will run about 100 pages with verbal and visual artistic contributions from about 30 people...including some previously unpublished work by Maurice himself!) will cost about $4,000 up front. We're pretty much starting from a budget of zero for this project and could use every bit of financial assistance possible to help make it a reality. We don't want to have to set the price for the collection prohibitively high in order to pay for it (such a strategy limits its audience in ways that we're pretty sure Maurice would have despised...), so we're asking for some help up front in the form of donations that will offset the cost of production and allow us to produce a book of high quality and low price. </p><p>In order to make advance sponsorship especially worthwhile, we're also offering some perks that will expand the value of a donation beyond just the positive feeling of helping to keep the legacy of one of <a href=""https://newyorkmakers.com/blogs/magazine/113201604-dr-maurice-kenny-new-york-writers-hall-of-fame-2014-inductee"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>New York's greatest writers</strong></a> going for years to come. You can help us out with even a donation of a couple of dollars, but for various levels of advance donations, you will not only be assured an inscribed copy of the book when it is published in the late spring of 2018, but also a choice of some of Maurice's past works to add to your collection. If you prefer simply to send a check to help fund the issue, you can also do that by <strong><a href=""mailto:derekmaus@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contacting us directly</a></strong>.</p><p>Any amount of funding, large or small, that you feel inclined to contribute is greatly appreciated, and all donors will be explicitly named and thanked (unless you choose to donate anonymously, which you certainly may do...) in the book. Furthermore, you can help us out even more by spreading the word via e-mail, social media, word-of-mouth, etc. about this call for contributions -- artistic and financial -- to anyone who you think might be interesting in helping out, one way or the other. There are buttons on the right side of this screen where you can add this campaign to your Facebook and/or Twitter feeds if that's your thing, and also a button to generate an e-mail to send to others. The fundraising campaign lasts until mid-October 2017, so there's plenty of time to consider whether you might be able to help us out with a donation.</p><p>We will keep everyone updated on the status of the publication as the process moves through its various stages toward completion. In the meantime, if you need some more of Maurice's beautiful words to get you through, there's his 2016 collection <a href=""https://gumroad.com/l/ghosts_physical"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Saranac Lake Ghost Poems</i></strong></a> available from Ghost City Press and his brand-new collection called <i><a href=""http://mongrelempire.org/catalog/poetry/monahsetah.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Monahsetah, Resistance and other Markings on Turtle's Back</strong></a> </i>that Chad Sweeney helped edit for Mongrel Empire Press. </p></div>","An anthology of influence...Maurice Kenny was a teacher for almost as long as he was a poet.

We don't want to have to set the price for the collection prohibitively high in order to pay for it (such a strategy limits its audience in ways that we're pretty sure Maurice would have despised...), so we're asking for some help up front in the form of donations that will offset the cost of production and allow us to produce a book of high quality and low price. In order to make advance sponsorship especially worthwhile, we're also offering some perks that will expand the value of a donation beyond just the positive feeling of helping to keep the legacy of one of New York's greatest writers going for years to come. You can help us out with even a donation of a couple of dollars, but for various levels of advance donations, you will not only be assured an inscribed copy of the book when it is published in the late spring of 2018, but also a choice of some of Maurice's past works to add to your collection. If you prefer simply to send a check to help fund the issue, you can also do that by contacting us directly.Any amount of funding, large or small, that you feel inclined to contribute is greatly appreciated, and all donors will be explicitly named and thanked (unless you choose to donate anonymously, which you certainly may do...) in the book. Furthermore, you can help us out even more by spreading the word via e-mail, social media, word-of-mouth, etc. about this call for contributions -- artistic and financial -- to anyone who you think might be interesting in helping out, one way or the other. There are buttons on the right side of this screen where you can add this campaign to your Facebook and/or Twitter feeds if that's your thing, and also a button to generate an e-mail to send to others. The fundraising campaign lasts until mid-October 2017, so there's plenty of time to consider whether you might be able to help us out with a donation.We will keep everyone updated on the status of the publication as the process moves through its various stages toward completion. In the meantime, if you need some more of Maurice's beautiful words to get you through, there's his 2016 collection Saranac Lake Ghost Poems available from Ghost City Press and his brand-new collection called Monahsetah, Resistance and other Markings on Turtle's Back that Chad Sweeney helped edit for Mongrel Empire Press.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When my (Greg) daughter was born, like many parents, my wife and I were concerned about what the world would look like when she grows up. Will there even BE jobs? We decided to take the responsibility upon ourselves to make sure she was prepared for any possible future.</p>
<p>“Science, technology, engineering, and math” — STEM. It’s all you hear about these days. But I soon became painfully aware of the shortage of STEM/STEAM role models and stories aimed specifically at young girls. So, I created my own characters and adventure stories for my daughter, and she loved them.</p>
<p>Pam and I wrote this book, STEAMTeam 5: The Beginning, based on these characters so that parents everywhere can inspire their children with great female role models who use STEAM in fun and exciting ways.   </p>

<p><strong>As former co-workers</strong>, Charly and Les spent many-a-lunch together, discussing the typical office politics, pop-culture (Les, being a closet Taylor Swift fan and Charly’s unhealthy love for Justin Bieber), and weekend shenanigans. When they both found ourselves newly engaged, the conversations turned a bit more serious, as they shared our experiences in pre-marital counseling and truly getting to know their partners. After going through the engagement process, they wanted to find a fun, alternative way to initiate these meaningful conversations on their own.

Many of those couple’s stories of challenging conversations, funny quirks, and romantic moments have greatly influenced the overall structure and narrative of the books. The final 250 pages of each book have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from couples and therapists alike. </p>

OUR STORY
The Very Engaging book was written by two recently-married guys who are super passionate about helping others live happy and fulfilling lives in fun and creative ways. Very Engaging is their first real solution to the many issues they think are worth solving. 
Charly Ligety is currently a graduate student at University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. Charly lives in Santa Monica with his wonderful wife, Carley, who has been patient enough to play through many iterations of the book over the past year. A native of Park City, UT, Charly received his BA from Dartmouth College in 2009. 
Les Starck currently works for a national bank. Les lives in Los Angeles with his supportive wife, Ashley, who has been generous enough to lend out her husband for many late nights writing the book with Charly. A native of Reston, VA, Les received his BA from University of Southern California in 2009. 
As former co-workers, Charly and Les spent many-a-lunch together, discussing the typical office politics, pop-culture (Les, being a closet Taylor Swift fan and Charly’s unhealthy love for Justin Bieber), and weekend shenanigans. When they both found ourselves newly engaged, the conversations turned a bit more serious, as they shared our experiences in pre-marital counseling and truly getting to know their partners. After going through the engagement process, they wanted to find a fun, alternative way to initiate these meaningful conversations on their own. So, after reflecting on their relationships with their wives, they started creating conversation prompts to help navigate some of life’s most significant (and…not so significant) discussions.  
Together, Charly and Les have been working on writing Very Engaging since early 2016. While the inception of Very Engaging derives from their own personal relationship experiences, the content of the books has been developed and honed after many long conversations with marriage and family therapists and interviews with dozens of dating, engaged, and recently married couples from around the country.

<p>Putting the Fun Back in Funeral: </p>
<p>A New Chesapeake Mystery </p>
<p>By Helen Chappell</p>
<p>  Two
retired ladies, Miss Doll Ball and Miss Lally Hollyday, find idleness so boring
that they have taken up the hobby of attending all the funerals they can find
in their area.  They come for the
service, the gossip and the drama and stay for the food and sweet tea. </p>
<p>  Although
their husbands and their families deplore their interest as morbid and
unbecoming, Doll and Lally are enjoying themselves enormously doing something
other than cooking, cleaning, waiting on their families and volunteer work. As
Lally points out, it beats waiting to die down at the Senior Center. And, Doll
adds, it prepares them for their inevitable ends by showing them how they don’t
want to go. </p>
<p>  It’s
all fun at the funeral until they attend the services for their late butcher
and a mourner shows up wearing the exact same outfit as the deceased in his
coffin. They wanted drama, and now they’ve got it as they find there may be a
killer afoot. Can they find the murderer before they’re found out? A cast of
suspects, each more likely than the last has plenty of reason to want the
butcher dead, including a pixilated funeral crasher who uses his skills to rob
the houses of the mourners while they’re at the funeral home. </p>
<p>  Chappell,
author of more than forty two books, including the Oysterback Tales and the Sam
and Hollis Mysteries, creates another hilarious tale of murder, mayhem, crabs
and characters we haven’t used yet on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. </p>

I'm an 18 year old homeschooled son of a pastor.
What Will I Be Doing?


I will be going to Australia and Papua New Guinea to learn about God and serve on a medical ship through YWAM. I'll be in Australia for roughly 3 months where I will be immersed in a cross-cultural classroom, study the word of God, take classes in healthcare, learn from missionaries and other teachers, and many other things.

<p>I started traveling seriously 5 years ago. Oh, the things I've seen: unimaginable landscapes, savory foods, culture and art I've only read about in books and magazines.</p>
<p>BUT, my travels have also revealed to me the destitute lives that many children and their families go through all around the world. To this day, I still can't get the image of the little Peruvian girl devouring a granola bar I gave her, the same one I was about to throw away because I didn't feel like carrying it around anymore... </p>
<p><b>That trip changed my life, my thinking, and my attitude. And I wondered how many others felt the same.</b></p>
</div><div>
<p>So I started this global book project (nicknamed <a href=""http://upupandabear.com/project-alpha/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Alpha</a>), pulling together travelers from all over the world to write about the one trip that changed their life. The intent is to show how powerful travel is AND to give back to the communities that have changed our lives for the better; thus, <b>all funds raised through this project will be donated to children charities <a href=""http://savethechildren.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Save the Children</a> and <a href=""http://unbound.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unbound</a>. </b></p>

<p><b>We are proudly supporting <a href=""http://savethechildren.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Save the Children</a></b>.

<p>These are really cool notebooks that will last forever. Seriously. It's refillable, with any A5 paper (just punch it to match). We use simple bindings, real buffalo leather, and hard work.We build them by hand, one at a time, and with enough TLC to make your significant other jealous.</p>
<p>We learned a lot last year. And found a way to make a compact notebook that gives you a ton of page to work with. We're offering two styles for this campaign at a great price:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476855526/nk0bcnlqkd2vgeh5fx0n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<p>The <strong>Companion Notebook</strong> is the A5 version of our <a href=""https://northboundnotebooks.com/collections/notebooks/products/authentic-notebook?variant=9723668101"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Original Notebook</a> from last year. And it's really cool. The Companion uses thick buffalo leather with a smooth finish. The results -- like above -- are aged perfection. The leather will weather to develop its own style. The Companion notebook is a bit thicker -- between 5 or 6 ounces, so it is more resistant to building a nice curve. You've got to work it in over time.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rugged Notebook</strong> is the same design, but the big difference is the leather. While the Companion boasts a smooth finish, the Rugged notebook is a bit more coarse, with a liiiiitle bit more character. It will mark quickly and beautifully. It's a little less thick, around 4 ounces or so, so it is more malleable and folds and creases more easily. If you want a rough-and-tough notebook, this is your guy (or gal).</p>
<p>And we now offer custom laser engraving, by our friend The Canadian Maker. You can check out his stuff <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thecanadianmaker/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Something like this hasn't happened before. It's an enormous risk, setting up a publication. Especially a print one. Do people read print anymore? Does anyone like that kind of stuff? Do people care about artists? Does anyone wanna share their thoughts? A <i>magazine</i>, really?</p>
<p>Yes, really. It's worth a shot.</p>
<p>I remember vividly the first time I had work published. It was in a little magazine run by students at Carleton University. And the sense of pride and belonging I felt afterwards can't be measured. It helped me grow. It helped me belong. I want to recreate that feeling for everyone.</p>
<p>Northbound Notebooks has been a modest success. The extra oomph from this campaign could turn it in to more than just a pass-time. With your help, we can grow our team and brand, and take over the world. The world of notebooks.</p>

Northbound & Notable Giveaway - Enter for a chance to win!
Last year, Northbound Notebooks launched to overwhelming success. Take it from me -- I'm Adam, by the way. Hello! I built most of those myself. One at a time. In the last year, we've made around three hundred of them. 
Recently, the company moved in to Makerspace North -- a creative hub for makers in Ottawa. And now that we've got a home, there's some great stuff on the horizon.
Get a great notebook and help an artist find their place in print. Northbound & Notable is a crowdfunded magazine available in print and online through northboundnotebooks.com. What makes us unique? We pay our contributors. Because good work should be celebrated and artists should be compensated. 
 

THE PERKS
 

 
These are really cool notebooks that will last forever. Seriously. It's refillable, with any A5 paper (just punch it to match). We use simple bindings, real buffalo leather, and hard work.We build them by hand, one at a time, and with enough TLC to make your significant other jealous.
We learned a lot last year. And found a way to make a compact notebook that gives you a ton of page to work with. We're offering two styles for this campaign at a great price:

 
The Companion Notebook is the A5 version of our Original Notebook from last year. And it's really cool. The Companion uses thick buffalo leather with a smooth finish. The results -- like above -- are aged perfection. The leather will weather to develop its own style. The Companion notebook is a bit thicker -- between 5 or 6 ounces, so it is more resistant to building a nice curve. You've got to work it in over time.
The Rugged Notebook is the same design, but the big difference is the leather. While the Companion boasts a smooth finish, the Rugged notebook is a bit more coarse, with a liiiiitle bit more character. It will mark quickly and beautifully. It's a little less thick, around 4 ounces or so, so it is more malleable and folds and creases more easily. If you want a rough-and-tough notebook, this is your guy (or gal).
And we now offer custom laser engraving, by our friend The Canadian Maker. You can check out his stuff here.
 

 
LEATHER: Full grain Buffalo hide,  hand-cut by rotary blade and hand-punched. We don't machine-make anything. Yours is one of a kind. Don't forget it.
BINDINGS: Standard chicago-style screws in silver or gold. Indiegogo orders include BOTH.
PAPER: Standard A5 sheets, 148 x 210 mm,5.8"" x 8.3"". 100% recycled paper. 80# thickness. Two-hole punched. Designed for single-side use. Available in blank, lined, and dot grid.
MAINTENANCE: Wash leather with a small amount of water. Avoid using harsh chemicals. Natural blemishes and scarring will occur; it is expected. Do NOT clean with alcohol or detergent. That makes me cry just thinking about it.
BUILD TIME: Northbound Notebooks is run by a guy who makes them by hand. We use local parts and resources (paper, leather, bindings, etc) when possible. We make 'em one at a time. We'll contact you with details every step of the way.
SHIPPING: We ship via Canada post world-wide. For international customers outside of the USA and Canada, expect 4-6 weeks for standard shipping. Tracking is not always available depending on shipping method. We ship internationally and respect the law. That means, sometimes, you might have to pay some customs fees.

<p>Cuisine On The Nile Cookbook comes from a restaurant that was in Atlanta in the late 80’s. The restaurant was staffed with friends that added their own personal recipes. Pamela Diana made a mean Enchilada and I don't know where we would have been with Rich Park's Lasagna and many more. The recipes in this book are healthy revisions of many favorite meals from different traditions. Of course we have New Soul Food, Caribbean Island Foods, Asian Cooking, African Dishes and many more.</p>
<p>I have been cooking vegetarian foods that have brought smiles to people’s faces for over 30 years. Biscuits are my specialty which I have been known to ship to other states. The recipe for these biscuits will be in this book.</p>
<ul><li> </li></ul>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What Others Are Saying</h3>
<p>I got inspired and just came up with some delicious new vegan/raw recipes this weekend that I'll be sharing shortly. But first I want to share some great news about about the person who inspired me most in vegetarian cooking. People ask me a lot where I learned to cook vegetarian food, if I have to narrow it down to one person, it would have to be Mama Lumumba. She has hands down inspired me more than any other cook, not just because of the ingredients she puts in her foodbut because of the pure essence or ""spirit"" she puts in it as well... She is the person who taught me the most important lesson in cooking, how to pray while I cook. This one very simple rule has enabled me to uplift, inspire, and Heal myself and others with the simple stir of a pot. One of the greatest gifts one can receive.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>-Shakti Vedas Atlanta, GA</h3>
<p>I'm excited and eagerly anticipate Aisha Lumumba's new cookbook. SHE Knows the secrets to creating wonderfully, satisfying dishes that are simple, delicious and wholesome...</p>
<p></p>
<h3>-Rukiyah Imani  Atlanta, GA</h3>
<p>Tofu Foo Yung is an exciting play on Egg Foo Yung for vegan enthusiast like myself! It combines tofu and vegetables in a unique way creating this tasty savory dish. It's it my very favorite dish of culinary genius Mrs. Aisha Lumumba. I would encourage all to try and guarantee you will crave more!!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>-Aima Peyton Washington, DC</h3>
<p>If you haven’t tried these yet – you are missing a treat!  Don’t be confused <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">with other recipes thinking that Aisha’s fried biscuits refer to dropping dough into a pot of oil and deep frying them.  NO – that is not what these are!  These fried biscuits are slowly fried in a minimum of oil while they are constantly being turned until they are done. </span></p>
<p>My Mom use to fry biscuits for me because she knew that I loved them.  Aisha is the first person whose recipe and method remind me of my mother’s biscuits.  There is nothing like them.  Try them.  I’ll bet you can’t eat just one…</p>
<p></p>
<h3>-Barbara Sirmans Birmingham, AL</h3>
<p>The food I remember eating back at Senbeb in Atlanta was excellent! I remember rushing from work just to eat the BBQ tofu sandwiches and getting my KMT brothers ""hooked"" on ALL the food from Sister Aisha!</p>

The recipes in this book are healthy revisions of many favorite meals from different traditions. Of course we have New Soul Food, Caribbean Island Foods, Asian Cooking, African Dishes and many more.
I have been cooking vegetarian foods that have brought smiles to people’s faces for over 30 years. Biscuits are my specialty which I have been known to ship to other states. The recipe for these biscuits will be in this book.
 
  
What Others Are Saying
I got inspired and just came up with some delicious new vegan/raw recipes this weekend that I'll be sharing shortly. But first I want to share some great news about about the person who inspired me most in vegetarian cooking. People ask me a lot where I learned to cook vegetarian food, if I have to narrow it down to one person, it would have to be Mama Lumumba. She has hands down inspired me more than any other cook, not just because of the ingredients she puts in her foodbut because of the pure essence or ""spirit"" she puts in it as well... She is the person who taught me the most important lesson in cooking, how to pray while I cook. This one very simple rule has enabled me to uplift, inspire, and Heal myself and others with the simple stir of a pot. One of the greatest gifts one can receive.

-Shakti Vedas Atlanta, GA
I'm excited and eagerly anticipate Aisha Lumumba's new cookbook. SHE Knows the secrets to creating wonderfully, satisfying dishes that are simple, delicious and wholesome...

-Rukiyah Imani  Atlanta, GA
Tofu Foo Yung is an exciting play on Egg Foo Yung for vegan enthusiast like myself! It combines tofu and vegetables in a unique way creating this tasty savory dish. It's it my very favorite dish of culinary genius Mrs. Aisha Lumumba. I would encourage all to try and guarantee you will crave more!!

-Aima Peyton Washington, DC
If you haven’t tried these yet – you are missing a treat!  Don’t be confused with other recipes thinking that Aisha’s fried biscuits refer to dropping dough into a pot of oil and deep frying them.  NO – that is not what these are!  These fried biscuits are slowly fried in a minimum of oil while they are constantly being turned until they are done. 
My Mom use to fry biscuits for me because she knew that I loved them.  Aisha is the first person whose recipe and method remind me of my mother’s biscuits.  There is nothing like them.  Try them.  I’ll bet you can’t eat just one…

-Barbara Sirmans Birmingham, AL
The food I remember eating back at Senbeb in Atlanta was excellent! I remember rushing from work just to eat the BBQ tofu sandwiches and getting my KMT brothers ""hooked"" on ALL the food from Sister Aisha!

-Nasara Gargonnu San Diego, CA

I wrote this book because as a first generation Afro-Latina graduate I had no guidance coming out of college. I had no one to tell me how apply to a job, how to start paying off my loans and much more. I had to figure it out on my own. I realized through sharing my story that there are many others out there who share a similar narrative. I decided to write this book to be used as a guide to empower and lead you to and through the life you deserve after graduating.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are capable of everything you set your mind to achieve. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for post-graduate success in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you gain the confidence you need to apply to a job, start a business, start a project, and most of all take care of yourself while also building a life you love.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to navigate post-graduate life to reap the highest levels of success:</p><ul>

These chapters dive deeper into financial wellbeing and how to approach the job seeking process through the hidden market.

In Chapter 7-11 we dig into physical wellbeing not only the power of staying active after you're done with school but how we need to take care of our bodies in order to reach our fullest potentials.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Stigmatized </i>is an inspiring story about a Mongolian girl’s fight with stigma and illness and how she overcame obstacles with resilience, hard work, and a change in perspective. In this book, Handaa intertwines her journey battling advanced stage Tuberculosis (TB) and social stigma attached to it, with her stories of growing up in a nomadic country like Mongolia, learning a foreign language, pursuing higher education abroad at the age of 17 on her own, and exploring cultural diversity in different parts of the world.<br/>---<br/><br/>My name is Handaa Enkh-Amgalan and I am the author of <i>Stigmatized</i>. I wrote this book because I want to change the narrative around owning your battle and turning it into your strength to positively change your life trajectory and ultimately, leverage your story to inspire others. We are all humans and all go through storms; nobody needs to be defined and stigmatized by their struggles. I hope that my book helps you understand that your struggle is your story and embracing every component of who you are, even the hidden parts, will influence your healing and growth process. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same curiosity I have in making sense of and articulating your previous experiences and allowing them to give you a new perspective.<br/><br/>When I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with TB and I was encouraged to hide my disease due to fears of social stigma and discrimination. Hiding such an important part of my life created an internal struggle of questioning my identity. However, living abroad pursuing higher education, exploring new perspectives, and befriending individuals from different backgrounds made me realize that being a TB survivor was part of my identity and I needed to embrace it. It took me almost a decade to realize that it is not something to hide, feel ashamed of, or be silent about. By remaining silent, I did not know then that I was unconsciously contributing to the root cause of the problem. And this is what compelled me to write this book; I could no longer be part of the silence.<br/><br/>After reading my story, I hope that people who are battling TB or other stigmatized diseases and challenges feel empowered to raise their voices and join me in the fight to break the silence and remove stigma together. I also hope that policy makers, civil society, and international organizations step up their efforts to not only treat TB medically, but also tackle the attached stigma. With this book, I aim to combine storytelling with activism around TB, stigma, and discrimination.<br/><br/><i>Stigmatized</i> is a creative non-fiction book that speaks to anyone looking for inspiring stories about the ups and downs of an ordinary journey and how the power of grit and vulnerability drives empowerment. You will love this book if you are someone who enjoys personal storytelling as a way to kickstart your own self-reflection.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Stigmatized</h2>
<p>The book is written with 3 core themes that intertwine storytelling with activism:<br/><br/>1: MY LIFE JOURNEY - this theme contains my childhood stories of growing up in an informal settlement in Mongolia, my parents’ work to educate me and my siblings, including how I learned English from scratch. My journey as I left home for the first time to study abroad on my own and explored cultural diversity in Bulgaria, Poland, Uganda, and the United States. Later, how I got admitted into New York University with a full scholarship, and landed the job that I love in humanitarian &amp; development sector in New York City.<br/><br/>2: TB &amp; SOCIAL STIGMA - this theme contains stories of my diagnosis, prolonged stay in a TB health clinic, and valuable friendships made with other TB patients at the hospital. Additionally, realizations from observing the experiences of TB patients and negative attitudes towards TB, the ways in which I was encouraged to hide my disease from society, and how I battled shame, guilt, fear, and isolation by leveraging the power of vulnerability and acceptance.<br/><br/>3: SURVIVOR CULTURE &amp; IDENTITY - this theme encourages readers to be vulnerable, accept every component of who they are, even the stigmatized, hidden parts of their identity to achieve internal reconciliation, empowerment, and confidence. It also promotes survivor culture that fuels sustainable change to empower and engage those with these lived experiences in policy, programming, and other decision-making processes.<br/> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Handaa Enkh-Amgalan works in the global humanitarian sector, focusing on refugee empowerment. Born and raised amid resilient, hard-working, and education-loving parents in an informal settlement in Mongolia, Handaa firmly believes in the power of pursuing and gaining higher education to become empowered and make a difference in the world. Through this book, Handaa shares her story of persevering through obstacles from financial hardship to stigma and illness, and obtaining education and achieving success despite the tough odds. Handaa holds a Master’s degree from New York University in public policy and a Bachelor’s in Economics from East Tennessee State University.<br/><br/>In many societies, including Mongolia, TB remains a highly stigmatized disease, making it difficult for TB patients to fight the disease in a dignified way. After finding out that she was the first Mongolian survivor to publicly share her story battling TB and social stigma attached to it, Handaa felt a sense of responsibility and urgency to break the silence and share her story. Her book, <i>Stigmatized</i>, explores the intersections of overcoming stigma and taking back the power to pave your own road in life. Refusing to be ashamed or silenced anymore, Handaa combines storytelling with activism to fight the TB stigma, raise awareness, and promote survivor culture to ensure that people with the lived experiences are at the decision-making table.<br/><br/>Handaa loves dogs and hopes to adopt a puppy in the near future.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Handaa at handaa.rea@gmail.com and on LinkedIn: Handaa Enkh-Amgalan, MPA, Facebook: Handaa Rea, Twitter: @Handaa-Rea, and Instagram: handaarea.</p>

I wrote this book because we’re now in the perfect storm of extreme change and rapid life-changing decisions while facing the unknown. When things are out of balance and completely new, the question becomes - what leadership skills are essential and how can they be learned and wielded?<br/><br/>Different fields of practice might call volatile times “disruption,” “crises,” or “critical incidents.” No matter the name, I believe that readers can embrace the six traits derived from the leadership stories to become their own forms of great leaders in volatile times.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll recognize F.O.R.G.E.D. traits within and bring them to bear when faced with the unknown. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement for leading in volatile times. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you respond with leadership awareness to situations that you’ve never before experienced.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the importance of building communal relationships, the power of trusting your gut when making decisions, and the overarching necessity to bring compassion to your leadership responses. You'll hear stories such as...</p><p>Naimeesha Murthy, Founder of Products by Women - Creates an online community based on a need she saw for women in product development.</p><p>Eric Yuan, Creator of Zoom - Steers Zoom Video Communications, Inc., through a 6000% increase in client scheduled meetings in only five months.</p><p>Robin Larkins and Marcelo Taiano, Co-leaders of the Dobbs Ferry Food Pantry - Take over a 428% increase in families in need within a month of suddenly being passed the reins at the start of the Covid19 pandemic.</p><p>You will love this book if you deal with important decisions that don’t have a road map, captain your organization through uncharted waters, or are building environments that require more creative thinking.<br/><br/>F.O.R.G.E.D. is a nonfiction book that speaks to experienced and new leaders who want to look at leadership and strategy in a new way.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - F.O.R.G.E.D.: Six Traits of Great Leaders in Volatile Times</h2><p><br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: </strong> The backdrop of disruption and rapid change forces us to take a fresh look at how we lead. The chapters in part 1 explore the foundations of F.O.R.G.E.D. leadership through the perspectives of case studies from Amazon, Kodak, Lego, and more.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: </strong>These core chapters visit each one of the six F.O.R.G.E.D. leadership traits. We’ll unwrap stories from leaders of large and small organizations across a diverse set of industries and settings. The chapters also provide opportunities to explore the ideas derived from the stories so that you can better incorporate them into your own leadership style.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3:</strong> The final chapters summarize the lessons learned throughout the book and visit alternative ways of working with moments of crisis focusing more deeply on stress, empathy, and intention. These two chapters allow us to see that the work of developing leadership is not static; it’s a continuous learning process.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Thanks so much to my friends, family, mentors, publisher, and other new members of my author community for coming together to support me on this endeavor. We couldn’t have done this without you! Story of My BookMy name is Douglas Scherer, and I am the author of F.O.R.G.E.D.: Six Traits of Great Leaders in Volatile Times. I wrote this book because we’re now in the perfect storm of extreme change and rapid life-changing decisions while facing the unknown. When things are out of balance and completely new, the question becomes - what leadership skills are essential and how can they be learned and wielded?Different fields of practice might call volatile times “disruption,” “crises,” or “critical incidents.” No matter the name, I believe that readers can embrace the six traits derived from the leadership stories to become their own forms of great leaders in volatile times.My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll recognize F.O.R.G.E.D. traits within and bring them to bear when faced with the unknown. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement for leading in volatile times. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you respond with leadership awareness to situations that you’ve never before experienced.In this book, you'll learn about the importance of building communal relationships, the power of trusting your gut when making decisions, and the overarching necessity to bring compassion to your leadership responses. You'll hear stories such as...Naimeesha Murthy, Founder of Products by Women - Creates an online community based on a need she saw for women in product development.Eric Yuan, Creator of Zoom - Steers Zoom Video Communications, Inc., through a 6000% increase in client scheduled meetings in only five months.Robin Larkins and Marcelo Taiano, Co-leaders of the Dobbs Ferry Food Pantry - Take over a 428% increase in families in need within a month of suddenly being passed the reins at the start of the Covid19 pandemic.You will love this book if you deal with important decisions that don’t have a road map, captain your organization through uncharted waters, or are building environments that require more creative thinking.F.O.R.G.E.D. is a nonfiction book that speaks to experienced and new leaders who want to look at leadership and strategy in a new way. The Book - F.O.R.G.E.D.: Six Traits of Great Leaders in Volatile TimesThe book is written in 3 parts.Part 1:  The backdrop of disruption and rapid change forces us to take a fresh look at how we lead. The chapters in part 1 explore the foundations of F.O.R.G.E.D. leadership through the perspectives of case studies from Amazon, Kodak, Lego, and more.Part 2: These core chapters visit each one of the six F.O.R.G.E.D. leadership traits. We’ll unwrap stories from leaders of large and small organizations across a diverse set of industries and settings. The chapters also provide opportunities to explore the ideas derived from the stories so that you can better incorporate them into your own leadership style.Part 3: The final chapters summarize the lessons learned throughout the book and visit alternative ways of working with moments of crisis focusing more deeply on stress, empathy, and intention. These two chapters allow us to see that the work of developing leadership is not static; it’s a continuous learning process.   What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

<br/><strong>ISSUE 1: DISRUPT</strong>
</h3><p>Myself and my Advisory Board are launching this campaign to raise money for the <strong>issue 1: DISRUPT.</strong> 2020 has been a year of disruption across the globe. Lives have been drastically altered in the face of pandemic uncertainty, political division and racial tension. As my own mother put it, ""it’s like the world is in the midst of a global panic attack."" In this issue, we look at this moment in time within the context of history. We unpack three neighborhoods in the United States that underwent immense disruption in the 60s and 70s and how these events have a rippling effect still today. We look at disruption from the lens of hope and healing. Reimagining worlds is something SPACEONSPACE does best. Included in this issue is a conversation with a group of Mamas from across the country, work from artists around the world processing 2020, as well as, two artist interviews on meditation, performance and the changing planet.<br/><br/><strong>Art Contributors</strong></p><p>*<a href=""https://jesseshussettphotos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jesse Shussett </a>                                      *<a href=""https://kaylakochanowicz.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kayla Kochanowicz</a><br/>*<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/molmolmolll/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Molly Root </a>                                               *<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lizabetcha/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Liz Lanphear</a><br/>*<a href=""https://kelechiazu.com/Gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kelechi Azu</a>                                              *<a href=""https://evaswitala.myportfolio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eva Switala</a><br/>*<a href=""https://minjoojung100.wixsite.com/mysite/c-v-and-contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emily Jung</a>                                                *<a href=""https://emilyruthhazel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emily Ruth Hazel</a><br/>*<a href=""https://ryota-kuwabara.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ryota Kuwabara</a>                                     *<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/youndty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brandon Youndt</a><br/>*<a href=""http://www.richardgayler.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Gayler</a>                                        *<a href=""https://lucyhwest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucy H.

The aesthetics of her work are guided by elements of place, memory, embodied practices, and relationality. Along with her scholarly work, Yesenia and the Hunter family explore questions of belonging through what they call “Hunter Gatherings,” events that invite others to participate in dialogue and making. Yesenia’s art and scholarship are fueled by her role as a mother and wife, and deeply influenced by the belief that belonging is more than a basic human need, it also operates as a motivation and expression and can link us to living big full lives.

Exploring themes of technology, innovation, and government bureaucracy, it calls into question our traditional calculus on adopting technological change, showing the value in understanding the youth perspective.<br/><br/>My name is Justin Potisit and I am the author of <i>The Silicon Leviathan: How Digital Natives will Transform Governance</i>. I wrote this because I wanted to introduce a new youth perspective in the formation of federal digital policy, think critically about the realities of an increasingly hyper-connected world and to provide a roadmap to the future of governance.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of the different ways that digital natives are unique—and what that might mean for the future of the government. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think about the significance of generational divides, and how we might liberate governance from its past to slay the Leviathan—the creature of the old ways—and raise a new creature better representing the new multitudes of future digital natives.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in science and technology policy, reading about the future, and thinking about emerging technologies.<br/><br/><i>The Silicon Leviathan </i>speaks to program managers and futurologists who want to grapple with the federal innovation system and digital nativism in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Silicon Leviathan</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>How has my life changed over the last 20 years and how it might change in the next 20?</li>
<li>What distinguishes digital natives from previous generations?</li>
<li>How might the federal government be best positioned to adapt to a new hyper-connected world?</li>
</ul><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

Exploring themes of technology, innovation, and government bureaucracy, it calls into question our traditional calculus on adopting technological change, showing the value in understanding the youth perspective.My name is Justin Potisit and I am the author of The Silicon Leviathan: How Digital Natives will Transform Governance. I wrote this because I wanted to introduce a new youth perspective in the formation of federal digital policy, think critically about the realities of an increasingly hyper-connected world and to provide a roadmap to the future of governance.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of the different ways that digital natives are unique—and what that might mean for the future of the government. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think about the significance of generational divides, and how we might liberate governance from its past to slay the Leviathan—the creature of the old ways—and raise a new creature better representing the new multitudes of future digital natives.You will love this book if you are interested in science and technology policy, reading about the future, and thinking about emerging technologies.The Silicon Leviathan speaks to program managers and futurologists who want to grapple with the federal innovation system and digital nativism in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that The Silicon Leviathan inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How has my life changed over the last 20 years and how it might change in the next 20?
What distinguishes digital natives from previous generations?
How might the federal government be best positioned to adapt to a new hyper-connected world?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing technology, innovation, digital nativism, and the future of the federal government will change us all for the better.  The Book - The Silicon LeviathanThe book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the Introduction + chapters 1-3.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>When You Stand Up To The Sun is a memoir of psychological and spiritual growth that occurs through traveling abroad and encountering unique romantic experiences. It takes one through both an inner and outer journey of self growth and awakening by embracing life as it comes to us. <br/><br/>My name is Deanna Amodeo and I am the author of When You Stand Up To The Sun. I wrote this book because of the unique experiences I have encountered while traveling both domestically and internationally.

In doing so I have shifted the way in which I view the world. I want to share my adventurous stories and vulnerable insights with the world, exposing that our hard-to-crack minds sometimes need a new way of understanding life. </p>

The Childish Entrepreneur is a book about how young entrepreneurs and change-makers overcome the obstacles associated with their age.My name is Aarav Gupta and I am the author of The Childish Entrepreneur.

In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for entrepreneurship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you achieve your goals and take action when it comes to entrepreneurship and making a difference in the world.In this book, you'll learn a plethora of lessons, including ways to overcome doubt and always learn no matter where you are in life.

<h3>A virtual ticket to ride on a real time adventure</h3>
<p><strong>Is it an experiment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it a celebration of the power of the word?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it  an art project comparing online platforms for connecting people, with good old fashioned real time eye-balling?</strong></p>

<p>Hi I’m Carmen I live in Melbourne, I'm an Art Therapy student. These are confused times. Connection &amp; disconnection come up a lot as themes in my work with clients.  I'm very interested in the role technology plays at both ends of this spectrum. Brendan lives in Burnaby outside of Vancouver, he's an ex-professional musician into sound design and composition for film. He's into the power of story and how it shapes our experience. We both write. We have a combined age of 87. That’s a lot of experience, but not enough to have dulled our curiosity, or crushed our spirit of adventure.</p>
<p>We've decided to co-create a story that's partially virtual and partly confrontingly real. We invite you to live vicariously through us as it happens. Down the track it needs to be a book.</p>

<p>This is the dangerous edge where life and art get blurry. The fine line between inspiration and insanity.</p>
<p>This experiment is the first stage in what I hope will be an ongoing exploration and body of work comparing virtual vs real mechanisms for human connection.</p>
<p>These are complex times where the world is at your finger tips, but no one smiles at you on the tram. Where personal experience no longer lives in your heart, but on your Facebook page, requiring virtual witnesses and validation to be meaningful.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Back Story</strong></p>
<p>We bumped into eachother kind of accidentally on-line early this year. Tens of thousands  of words have been exchanged since then. We've rummaged in eachothers brains, exposing hard edges and soft underbellies, taking full advantage of the candid protection a 14,000km divide provides. </p>

<p><em>As a side note:  Gentlemen, are you aware of how many ladies are repelled by small child like hands?</em></p>
<p><em>I recently conducted an informal survey on this, mistakenly under the impression I was the only one with a hand fetish.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>An independent feminist blog in Armenia</h3> <p>We are a group of feminists promoting gender equality and raising awareness about women's human rights in Armenia. We are passionate about our work, which is why the blog has been created, designed and filled with various content thanks to the full dedication of our group. It is important for us to continue working on the blog, since the popularity of the blog is growing and we have a chance to truly reach out to the general public of Armenia. Because feminist texts are more readily available and abundant in the English language, we need to translate various texts relating to feminism, gender issues, women's rights and concerns from English to Armenian, especially as it may relate to reality of women living in Armenia today. We need funds to hire translators and to continue this important work. In addition,  we need to buy a domain and hosting for the blog.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Even with the vast information flow of the 21st century, there are still certain groups in Armenian society, which remain on the margins. Most often these are women who are cut off from the media and alternative modes of obtaining information about their rights, opportunities, etc. This situation makes women more vulnerable to sustaining abusive relationships, dysfunctional family relations, abuse of their economic and political rights, etc. Even if these women have access to the media, the lack of coverage on topics that are considered taboo or irrelevant make these women subject to isolation, frustration, lack of acknowledgement. The general attitude of keeping quiet about taboo topics, which make people feel uncomfortable  contributes to the general attitude that there are no problems in society at all.</span></p>
<p>This is exactly why we need a strong independent feminist blog. Blogs are a perfect platform to express opinions, but also to disseminate information about general human rights concerns that people may not be encouraged to know about. The Armenian Feminist Blog is also a platform where multiple feminisms can receive coverage, and thereby ensure that the women's movement in Armenia does not corner itself in only one type of feminism. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This blog will address all the issues that are of public concern, including current events, which may be of relevance to the women's movement in Armenia. </span></p>
<p><span>It's time to empower women living in Armenia, to remind them of their rights, their strength and their potential. Being oppressed in a patriarchal system doesn't mean you can't speak out. Just the opposite. The Armenian Feminist blog will be a perfect tool for those who are victims of this inhumane and oppressive system to raise their voice, share their stories, find support among each other and share with others. </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need 6000 Euros, which will be enough to fund our project for a whole year. We will pay the translators to do the precious work of translating quality news and articles from English as well as Russian into Armenian. Our work is also concerned with finding interesting topics to cover in Armenia, including interviews with various people who are relevant for the topic of women. If we don't reach our goal we will still pay translators with as much money as we can. We are planning to pay translators 150 euros for several months as well as buy a domain and hosting for the blog. If we don't get the funding we will try to find alternative funding methods so we can keep going the amazing work of spreading feminist ideals in Armenian society. But the point is that we want to stay independent and be open to contributions and volunteer work. We don't want to be told what to publish and how to publish stuff just because we are being financed by a governmental or non-governmental organization. For this very reason, we need you to help us via this crowd-funding platform to reach our goal.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In the increasingly homophobic, sexist and patriarchal context of Armenia we need an alternative resource which will approach local and international events critically and provide quality, independent content to readers. </p>
<p>At first we were skeptical about being able to do this, but then we realized there is an obvious need for this kind of blog in our country. Our goal is to raise awareness, educate youth and adults about women's rights as well as make a space for discussion about different topics which are considered taboos. In addition, we hope that our blog will enable a more pluralistic feminism in Armenia, meaning that women and men who consider themselves feminist will have vast knowledge of different waves, schools and types of feminism in the world.</p>
<p>And here is a fun anecdote for you: We heard that there was a taxi driver who was driving some friends from Yerevan to Gyumri, and he said that he had read an article on our blog about insults and he was impressed, because he never thought about analyzing insults. We were so happy to know and realize that there are people actually reading our articles and thinking about criticizing oppressive norms in our society. We hope to hear more incidents like this with the growth of the Armenian Feminist blog in the upcoming months!</p>

We need funds to hire translators and to continue this important work. In addition,  we need to buy a domain and hosting for the blog.
Even with the vast information flow of the 21st century, there are still certain groups in Armenian society, which remain on the margins. Most often these are women who are cut off from the media and alternative modes of obtaining information about their rights, opportunities, etc. This situation makes women more vulnerable to sustaining abusive relationships, dysfunctional family relations, abuse of their economic and political rights, etc. Even if these women have access to the media, the lack of coverage on topics that are considered taboo or irrelevant make these women subject to isolation, frustration, lack of acknowledgement. The general attitude of keeping quiet about taboo topics, which make people feel uncomfortable  contributes to the general attitude that there are no problems in society at all.
This is exactly why we need a strong independent feminist blog. Blogs are a perfect platform to express opinions, but also to disseminate information about general human rights concerns that people may not be encouraged to know about. The Armenian Feminist Blog is also a platform where multiple feminisms can receive coverage, and thereby ensure that the women's movement in Armenia does not corner itself in only one type of feminism. This blog will address all the issues that are of public concern, including current events, which may be of relevance to the women's movement in Armenia. 
It's time to empower women living in Armenia, to remind them of their rights, their strength and their potential. Being oppressed in a patriarchal system doesn't mean you can't speak out. Just the opposite. The Armenian Feminist blog will be a perfect tool for those who are victims of this inhumane and oppressive system to raise their voice, share their stories, find support among each other and share with others.    What We Need & What You Get We need 6000 Euros, which will be enough to fund our project for a whole year. We will pay the translators to do the precious work of translating quality news and articles from English as well as Russian into Armenian. Our work is also concerned with finding interesting topics to cover in Armenia, including interviews with various people who are relevant for the topic of women. If we don't reach our goal we will still pay translators with as much money as we can. We are planning to pay translators 150 euros for several months as well as buy a domain and hosting for the blog. If we don't get the funding we will try to find alternative funding methods so we can keep going the amazing work of spreading feminist ideals in Armenian society. But the point is that we want to stay independent and be open to contributions and volunteer work. We don't want to be told what to publish and how to publish stuff just because we are being financed by a governmental or non-governmental organization. For this very reason, we need you to help us via this crowd-funding platform to reach our goal.
    The Impact In the increasingly homophobic, sexist and patriarchal context of Armenia we need an alternative resource which will approach local and international events critically and provide quality, independent content to readers. 
At first we were skeptical about being able to do this, but then we realized there is an obvious need for this kind of blog in our country. Our goal is to raise awareness, educate youth and adults about women's rights as well as make a space for discussion about different topics which are considered taboos. In addition, we hope that our blog will enable a more pluralistic feminism in Armenia, meaning that women and men who consider themselves feminist will have vast knowledge of different waves, schools and types of feminism in the world.
And here is a fun anecdote for you: We heard that there was a taxi driver who was driving some friends from Yerevan to Gyumri, and he said that he had read an article on our blog about insults and he was impressed, because he never thought about analyzing insults. We were so happy to know and realize that there are people actually reading our articles and thinking about criticizing oppressive norms in our society. We hope to hear more incidents like this with the growth of the Armenian Feminist blog in the upcoming months!

    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. One of the most important contributions anyone who wants to help us can do is to share our campaign with their family, friends, classmates, co-workers, networks they are a part of and anyone they think will benefit from this blog and will be able to help. Please feel free to use Indiegogo share tools!
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!

The story behind the story
Have you ever been sitting in a coffee shop found yourself eavesdropping on a really interesting conversation.  As international public speakers, Dani & Henry have had those kinds of conversations.  About a decade ago they wondered what would happen if they joined up and approached speaking from a conversational model, inviting the audience into their conversation.  Giving the audience permission to eavesdrop.  About three year ago, they made it happen.
As Dani & Henry have heard stories, told stories and lived stories, they have realized that these are not just stories, they are parables.  Henry’s childhood Pastor said, “A parable is an earthly story, with a heavenly meaning.""  Dani & Henry believe that the stories we all tell, and the stories we all live can be just that.
Like Henry and Dani moved from the coffee shop to the stage, they are moving again - this time to a book.  In “Pear-A-Bull: More Than a Story,” Dani and Henry will explore their stories, unpacking them and addressing the heavenly meaning through conversational writing. With their conversation as a model, they invite you to start living your own meaningful story by finding the purpose behind the story.

different cultures have interpreted Man and Woman – through myths, both ancient
and modern (Venus and Mars, Adam and Eve, or Isis and Osiris, for example).  The journey challenged our ability to
survive as a couple, and to stay true to our spiritual truths.

<p>Wherever
our family lived, James painted mythological stories, and I wrote about what I was learning, always following the trail
of how our cultural relationship dysfunction began -- why all the shame and guilt? -- and how to attain
satisfaction and integrity within our own relationships.</p>
<p>What
I discovered on our 15-year odyssey blew my mind.  I want to share with you the hard-won realizations, as well
as tips for a fuller life personally, sexually, and spiritually.  This book offers guidance for those
ready to look behind the veils, to face the shadow realms, and to embrace the

reveals with great love, skill and clarity the inner archetypal world we carry.
Her work points us to a path of choice where finally we can open to the
deliciousness of who we truly are and free ourselves.  It is a work dedicated to
birthing switched-on people who can give and receive love in truthful connection.

<p><i>Venus and Her Lover</i>  is right up my alley of interest almost in a
genetic sense. My mother taught me a great deal about <b>the history of the Patriarchy</b>
when I was very young and she wrestled – as have I – with the questions:  Where
did it all go off the rails?  What
caused the shift?  Where did we go wrong?

What
started the War Between the Sexes?  How can we heal it? 
These questions pulse through the book I am now ready to publish.    
Venus and Her Lover – Transforming Myth,
Sexuality, and Ourselves  is the first book of a larger Tantric art project (Venus and Her Lover – Transcending the
Myth);  this 700-page book is the travel adventure story of two artists driven by destiny to
explore the mysteries of the Feminine and the Masculine, and where they meet,
in sexuality.          Our quest took us around the world, where we experienced how
different cultures have interpreted Man and Woman – through myths, both ancient
and modern (Venus and Mars, Adam and Eve, or Isis and Osiris, for example).  The journey challenged our ability to
survive as a couple, and to stay true to our spiritual truths.

Wherever
our family lived, James painted mythological stories, and I wrote about what I was learning, always following the trail
of how our cultural relationship dysfunction began -- why all the shame and guilt? -- and how to attain
satisfaction and integrity within our own relationships.
What
I discovered on our 15-year odyssey blew my mind.  I want to share with you the hard-won realizations, as well
as tips for a fuller life personally, sexually, and spiritually.  This book offers guidance for those
ready to look behind the veils, to face the shadow realms, and to embrace the
pleasures of liberation.
The
most effective change agents in the world are IDEAS.   I
believe that if people were truthfully informed about the forces at work in our
world -- both seen and unseen, internal and external -- they could choose lives of greater harmony with
each other and the Earth. I have written a substantial, honest book.   It needs one final edit, and then it is ready to go.  Your contribution would help get this information more widely out into the world!  What Impact Could this Book Have?
COMMENTS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE READ THE MANUSCRIPT:  
It's a wonderful, wonderful read ~ soulful and
inspiring ~ weaving the personal & mythic realms.  I've worked
with Becca & James in an editorial/compositional capacity and know that
their passion & courage are singular!            ~ Mary Trainor~Brigham, author of DEEP CINEMA, and
Scribe~for~Hire                           Coastal Maine, USA
Once I started reading Venus and Her Lover, I couldn’t put it
down.  
I am a professional editor and have started two successful national publications.  This book is so exceptional that
I had virtually no edits.  I was
just honored to get to read it early!I honestly think this book will inspire a movement.  ~  Susan Davis Moora,  President, Capital Missions Company,  founder of                                KINSinnovation.org, and author of The Trojan Horse of Love                                         Vilcabamba, Loja, Ecuador
                                Certainly gripping but not in the
pulp fiction page-turner way, Venus and
Her Lover leads the reader into a very interesting world, enticing him/her
along with revealing and sometimes spicy doses of sexuality and spiritual
knowledge.  Tantalizing. The
combination of travelogue style and delivery of information is quite unique in
Becca’s easy-flowing voice; it is womanly writing as well. ~ Daniel Pugh, Humanitarian
Operations Consultant and Yoga Teacher                              Kathmandu,
Nepal


Toward the end of the book,
where Becca describes her past life vision, I felt it to the core of my being,
and I felt a shift and healing so deep, there are no words yet to describe it, for it goes to the depth of my spirit and limbic brain.
Venus and Her Lover is a life-affirming, transformative project
touching humanity’s spirit at a level deep into our DNA.
 ~ Mary L. Renaghan,  Spiritual Life Coach                                                                                 Palo Alto, California, USA 



Becca
reveals with great love, skill and clarity the inner archetypal world we carry.
Her work points us to a path of choice where finally we can open to the
deliciousness of who we truly are and free ourselves.  It is a work dedicated to
birthing switched-on people who can give and receive love in truthful connection.
Bravo, Becca, for providing this rich pool of reflection to reclaim our lost
selves - a delicious and crystal clear sensual vista of soul redemption
unfolds. 
 ~ Sienna
Lea                                                                                                                                      Founder, risemultiversity.org, radio show host, author of Stealing the Moon                 Chicago,
Illinois, USA


This is a
unique travel book, Becca’s own personal Lonely Planet guide for the masses of
yearning souls who know that there is something ""else"" out there,
another way...
 ~  Dana Teton,  CEO, Option 3                                                                                                        Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA


Reading Venus and Her Lover,  it felt as if I travelled with Becca and James on their journey:  behind the camera in the erotic photo shoots, dissolving boundaries, facing vestiges of shame and moving beyond it, tears flowing and heart aching as dear friends turned away from uncomfortable truths, healing lifetime wounds through naked transparency, opening my mind through the life-affirming discussions with the wonderful scientist Nassim Haramein, being there on the Caribbean beach as Becca and James communed with the Goddess/es, the moments of contraction and expansion and self-discovery with Kali and Lilith, the breathing practices and retreats to self-loving, facing the grief of closing certain life chapters, and then bravely moving forward.
A
shocking experience I had was Becca’s memories of patriarchal history –
shocking in that it brought back my own memory.  It is likely that others reading this work will have similar
resonances.  It is very helpful …
the style she has chosen of being so transparent with her personal experience.  I’m sure that others will find this
story an aid in people's own healing.
~  Premdaya Wajida Mathieu,  Wholistic Wellness Consultant                                               Boise, Idaho, USA


        
Wow, I felt so many parallels with my own life during the course of reading this impressive memoir.  Once the fire of Kali and Pele took hold of me, I had no choice but to surrender to the power of transformation.  It was quite a journey!In Venus & Her Lover, Becca artistically weaves her personal experience with mythology, science, religion, and history...and ultimately reveals that we have the ability to transcend it all.  So empowering!!!~  Ginna Grace, Vibrational Healing Artist, Vilcabamba, Loja, Ecuador


Reading Venus and Her Lover was very thought-provoking.  For the last one-and-a-half years I have been on an incredible journey,
following my own path learning about the Divine Feminine.  Funny how important
books turn up for me, just at the right time.  This was one of them.  I found it
riveting and picked up quite a few new
ways of looking at the development of human consciousness.
~ Walter Moora, Biodynamic Farmer,
Workshop Leader (on reconnecting to the             Earth), author of A Farmer’s Love                                                                                             East Troy,
Wisconsin, USA


I left Tuscany, my home, twenty years ago and
never looked back, and never wanted to go back until I read the Italian chapters
of Becca's book.  Her words brought
me back to the beauty of the Tuscan countryside, to the flavours and the scents
of my homeland.  I relived through
her writing the feeling of being home and the ancient mysteries of that magical
place that Tuscany is.  Thank you, Becca, for bringing home back to me.
~ Franco
Magrini,    Food
Artist                                                                                                      Vilcabamba,
Loja, Ecuador
                
Venus and Her Lover  is right up my alley of interest almost in a
genetic sense. My mother taught me a great deal about the history of the Patriarchy
when I was very young and she wrestled – as have I – with the questions:  Where
did it all go off the rails?  What
caused the shift?  Where did we go wrong? 
Becca presents so much to consider, I was not only totally intrigued but
also engaged and entertained.
  ~
Madeleine MacKenzie,   Writer,
Artist                                                                                      Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada


I am thankful to Venus and Her Lover  for relentlessly harvesting the
mythological wisdom of the world's diverse cultures.  Becca digs so deep and soars so high, breaking through our
societal restraints, to lead us on to a more integrated and healing place.
Becca and James are tour guides to our
deeper souls.

<p>EUROPE, 1925. The continent still licks its wounds from the devastating war that raged across it a few years before. Meanwhile, in London, an ageing professor has uncovered the clues to the whereabouts of pieces of an ancient statue, all but forgotten by history.</p>
<p>When his investigations lead him to fear for his life, he enlists the aid of an unlikely group of allies; a retired colonel, a secretive academic, a magician’s wife, and a Yorkshire matriarch with her reluctant assistant.</p>
<p>Together they will journey across Europe to recover the long-lost statue. They will travel in style, on the most luxurious train the world has ever seen. Unbeknownst to them, however, their activities have already attracted the attention of a sinister cult, desperate to acquire the artefact for their own dark purposes, and now a terrible creature, trapped for centuries, senses that the opportunity for revenge has come at last... </p>
<p>THE EXPRESS DIARIES is a tale of a journey into darkness and horror on the world's most famous train.</p>

<h3> About The Author</h3>
<p>Nick Marsh has never forgiven his parents for giving him a happy childhood, thus depriving him of the necessary angst and bottled-up rage to become a full-time writer. Not only that, his genetic inheritance has so far thwarted every attempt to grow a beard to make him appear dark and brooding. Four weeks of strenuous effort only result in a near-invisible fluffy covering that even a student would quickly shave off in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Since his late teenage years he is proud that he had managed to maintain his height at a constant five feet ten inches. If only everything in life were that simple. He currently works as a veterinary surgeon in Plymouth, and doesn’t think the job is all that bad really. On his days off he spends his time being cruel to pot plants, drinking cups of tea and, occasionally, writing.</p>
<p>He has been a weird fiction fan his whole life, and can still remember the good old days when going out with mates meant funny-shaped dice and dragon slaying, rather than nightclubs and loud music.</p>
<p>Nick is married (to another vet - it makes for some very boring after dinner conversations) and has three horses, two rescued greyhounds and a psychotic cat that he can't seem to get rid of.</p>

To make room for the ever-increasing number of mines, the government evicts people from their homes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I need your support to make the voices of some of these people heard, through a collection of oral histories of their experiences. I have 18 hours of recordings of interviews with them, but I don't have the money to hire someone to translate and transcribe them so I can publish them. </strong></p>
<p>The people interviewed are residents of what used to be Lat, a fairly typical agricultural village in the coalfields of Chhattisgarh, about an hour from the town of Raigarh in eastern India. A few years ago, the government decided that the coal under Lat was more important that the residents' way of life. </p>
<p>There aren't any official numbers on how many people have been displaced like this, but a widely cited figure comes from Dr. Walter Fernandes, who has estimated that about 60 million people were displaced or affected by development-related projects from 1947 to 2004. These are disproportionately people from India's most disadvantaged groups. </p>
<p>I'm an American journalist, working in Kolkata. While writing a book for a Delhi-based publisher last year about India's energy shortage, I discovered that increasing resistance to such displacement is slowing down government and corporate efforts to build new coal mines, dams, power plants and other energy-related projects. </p>
<p>I also found, however, that there are almost no sources available in English describing the experiences and views of such displaced people at length. Books by activists and reports by coal companies and government agencies push their agendas, news reporters occasionally decorate their prose with quotes from displaced people, but displaced people themselves almost never get to have their say. </p>
<p>""Lat Does Not Exist"" is meant to fill that gap, making available transcripts of conversations with people in one development-affected village, for researchers and other people who are unable to travel to such a village, live there, and chat with its residents for a couple of weeks -- as I was able to in January 2013 with a small team of journalists and photographers: Nikhil Roshan, Lo Kapila, Chandan Prasad and Devika Singh.   </p>
<p>""Lat Does Not Exist"" will include about 50,000 words of lightly edited transcripts of these conversations, and about 150 photographs. I'll write a 1,000-word introduction putting the village's experience in context but, other than that, the book will just be a forum for the people of Lat to tell the world about their experiences and their opinions about what has happened to them.   </p>
<p>Speakers include people who are refusing to leave the fragment of the village that remains, teetering on the edge of the massive pit that is the Chhal open-cast coal mine. They also include members of the Lat diaspora, who have already moved away from the village, to the official resettlement site provided by the coal company, and two unofficial resettlement sites.</p>
<p>From young guys excited that jobs at coal mines will pay for new motorcycles to women who miss farming as it was their chance to get out of the house, from families whose first days at the resettlement site were spent fending off elephants to those who refused to move and sit daily in protest at the mine gate, this is a collection of their stories.</p>
<p>We hope to get a commercial publisher for ""Lat Does Not Exist,"" but even if we don't, we'll publish it through Amazon.com's publish-on-demand service, and distribute it throughout the world.
