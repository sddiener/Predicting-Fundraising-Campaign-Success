The homeless are not invisible, and we should not act as if they don’t exist. We all deserve to be treated with dignity and kindness. None of us is less of a person for not having a home. With those principles as our guide, we simply fill backpacks with some essential supplies and basic comforts to share with our homeless neighbors, and our volunteers distribute these backpacks when the cold weather approaches. We make each of our backpacks to show its recipient that someone cares.</p>

<p>We have seen 75% first time donors in many cities and between 65 and 75% women under 35. I have found humor is a very powerful weapon in this war on women and want to keep the momentum going.</p>

<p>The money will go towards paying a filmographer, an editor and a director plus any equiptment rental we may have to pay for. </p>
<p>If I raise more than my goal, it will be donated to A is For so we can keep our awareness going as well as our continuing support for the Center For Reproductive Rights.</p>
<p>By helping me create this campaign we will be reminding America just how much erosion we are seeing in the area of reproductiove rights and we all know that humor poking at the underbelly of dipshittery makes a HUGE impact.</p>

<p><strong>YOU: So who will see this PSA after you make it?</strong></p>
<p>You will see this PSA on cable news shows and your favorite websites and blogs. </p>
<p>And you will also see that through your donation we can make an impact and remind people that we can combat the diarrhea of Super Pac cash with an impactful message.</p>
<p>And any support is welcome. If you have to choose between buying diapers and donating here, for God sakes, the diapers can wait. </p>

<h3>Who Are they? </h3>
<p>Fatma, Nuseybe, Hayat, Suad &amp; Imen are five refugee mothers currently living in Ankara, Turkey. The mothers are seeking funds and resources so that kids displaced by war (including their own)  can be assisted through art to approach their world in a more healthy manner and to expand on their sense of self. Art workshops often yield great designs by these kids which will then be used by the mothers to create stuffed toys. This can answer their needs for safe and sustainable employment.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What They Need</h3>
<p>We have already seen the benefit of involving refugee kids in creative art work that helps them reinvent themselves or imagine &amp; re-imagine their future. Local and international volunteers, especially university students (<i>some of whom are aiding in this project</i>) have been actively trying to create these opportunities. With your funds the mothers hope to continue , with longer more focused art workshops in a safe environment that really allows the kids to sink into their creativity.  A portion of the funds will therefore be spent on getting <i><strong>materials</strong></i> for the kids alone. </p>
<p>The mothers are also looking to purchase <i><strong>sewing machines</strong></i> for themselves and also <i><strong>training</strong></i> that will allow them to make the toys and other products for which their kids will act as creative designers!

<h3>How Important is Your Help? </h3>
<p>One thing greatly motivating this project is the sense of accomplishment and pride experienced by the kids and mothers through their creative collaboration.

<p>ABOUT: Robinhooding for Homeless (R4H) is a grass-roots organization that provides hygiene items to homeless shelters. Since its formation in 2005, R4H has collected, sorted, and delivered hundreds of boxes of needed hygiene items to shelters in the Northern California and San Francisco Bay areas such as PEACE for Families, Gathering Inn, Salvation Army, Shelter Next Door, Loaves &amp; Fishes, WEAVE, Peace Union Gospel Mission, and St. John.</p>
<p>MISSION: To provide hygiene items to shelters, creating mindfulness and being the change we wish to see in the world. Our goal is to alleviate some of the financial strain on shelters, so they may allocate more of their resources toward developing programs that assist with housing and job placement.</p>
<p>ISSUE: Up until now R4H has been solely funded, and with great success R4H has gained traction in Northern California. R4H was featured at the Celebrate Natomas community event, and has partnered with the City of Sacramento School District “4th R” After-School Program to encourage individuals and families to donate spare hygiene items. With this new growth have come new expenses for items such as fuel, sorting supplies, donation bins, and informational materials. In order to continue growing R4H it has become imperative to pursue a 501(c)3 status to be able to accept money and provide donation receipts.</p>
<p>FOUNDERS: Michelle Buller, is the outreach coordinator who adopted the idea and turned it into a cause. Our distribution manager you will find in most of the pictures, she's our grass-roots champion, only 12-years-old, Ms. Rachel Buller. She increases our region and number of shelters. Christopher Buller serves on the board of directors and is responsible for the jump start of the organization's direction.</p>
<p>DONATE: By donating towards this drive, you will enable R4H to work with a professional organization to correctly establishing our non-profit status, which is no small undertaking and very costly. </p>
<p>Also, please continue being mindful about this cause, we can pick up your donations or you can email us <a href=""mailto:robinhooding1@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">robinhooding1@gmail.com</a> to arrange a drop off. Please continue spreading the word!</p>
<p>EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECT: Filing fees $900, attorney fees $2500, process service fee $100, preperation &amp; review fees $200. Total amount required is $3,600, however Indiegogo charges 10% (factored into goal amount) </p>
<p>There's a lot of great organizations that need your help, but choosing ours will go right back into the communities we live in. Thank you so much for your consideration and your donation!</p>

<h3><strong><span><strong>Close Guantánamo, Support the Pelican Bay Prisoners' 5 Core Demands – End U.S.-sponsored Torture at home &amp; abroad</strong></span></strong></h3>
<h3><span><strong><strong><span>Let's wear 2.7 million orange ribbons <strong><strong>(it costs $2.7 million per year to maintain each <strong><strong>Gitmo detainee)</strong></strong></strong></strong>in solidarity with all prisoners who suffer torture <strong><strong>paid for</strong></strong> by U.S. taxpayers and perpetrated by U.S. federal, state, county &amp; municipal governments<strong><strong>.</strong></strong></span></strong></strong></span></h3>
<p><span><a href=""http://closegitmo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CloseGitmo.net</a> has set the goal for 2.7 million people to wear orange ribbons as a way to tell the world we oppose U.S. government-sponsored torture at all levels and in all cases. Our focus is on closing the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay and supporting the prisoners of Pelican Bay with their 5 core demands.  We call for an end to torture in municipal and county jails where suicide is epidemic among inmates who suffer from poor mental health. We condemn all state prisons who perpetrate the torture of long-term solitary confinement. We also oppose violations of human rights at U.S. federal detention centers as well as all U.S. secret detention centers around the world known as ""Black Sites"" and military bases where torture is well known, i.e. Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan (the ""other Guantánamo"").</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Our Appeal</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>We appeal to the conscience of all decisionmakers who control the fate of prisoners at Guantánamo and say: Close Gitmo!</span></p>
<p><span>We support the 5 Core Demands of detainees in prisons throughout California led by prisoners from the Pelican Bay SHU (Security Housing Unit) currently on their 5th week of hunger strike:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Eliminate Group Punishment;</span></li>
<li><span>Abolish the Debriefing (snitching) Policy and modify active/inactive gang status criteri;</span></li>
<li><span>End long-term solitary confinement;</span></li>
<li><span>Provide adequate food; and,</span></li>
<li>
<span>Provide constructive programs (education, self-help treatment, religious activities and other productive activities).</span> </li>
</ol>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Why 2.7 million orange ribbons?</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>In Senate Judiciary Hearings on July 24, 2013, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin announced that it cost $2.7 million/prisoner/year to keep a prisoner in Guantánamo. This amounts to $7400/inmate/day! Those who wear orange ribbons will help bring awareness to how Gitmo ant Pelican Bay prisoners are being subjected daily to torturous, inhumane conditions.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong><strong><span>Hunger Strikes in Guantánamo and in California led by prisoners in Pelican Bay</span></strong></strong></span></h2>
<p><span>The hunger strike in Guantánamo began February 6, 2013. Soon thereafter nearly all 166 prisoners participated. Sources report that 38 remain firm and have kept fasting (see ""track hunger strike"" at <a href=""http://closegitmo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CloseGitmo.net</a>). The inmates began refusing food in protest against the desecration of the inmates’ Korans and evolved to become a wider protest about President Obama's abandonment of his stated commitments over the past five years to close the facility.</span></p>
<p><span>The California prisoner hunger strike led by Pelican Bay detainees in the state's only supermax prison started July 8, 2013, with 30,000 prisoners from 22 prisons around the state and others outside the state. As they begin their 6th week on strike, over 250 refuse to eat. 14 prisoners identified as ring leaders have been put in Administrative Segregation Units (Ad. Seg. or ASUs), equivalent to the hole within the hole. They are subjected to cold air blown into their cells and other punitive actions.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong><strong><span><span>U.S. Government policy at the Municipal, County, State Federal &amp; Global levels perpetrates torture in 4 main ways:</span></span></strong></strong></span></h2>
<ul><li><p><span><strong>Extended solitary confinement</strong><strong><span>:</span></strong> The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Mendez, has stated that solitary confinement beyond 15 days is equivalent to torture. The U.S. leads the world in the number of those held in extended isolation with more than 80,000 detained in city and county jails as well as state and federal prisons and other detention centers. Prisoners in Guantánamo are routinely held in isolation for extended periods and some in California’s Pelican Bay State Prison Security Housing Unit have spent over three decades in the SHU, i.e. solitary confinement or “the hole”.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p><strong><span><strong>Indefinite detention</strong></span></strong><strong><span><span>:</span></span></strong><span> In both Guantánamo and in all four California Prison SHUs, prisoners suffer deep psychological torture, never knowing when they will be freed.  One California prisoner has suffered 42 years in solitary!</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond indefinite detention, the vast majority of Gitmo detainees are held without being charged and 86 out of 166 have been cleared for release but never freed. The Obama Administration has said 46 inmates will never be charged or tried. Both the military and civilian attorneys for the detainees, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, have said despair is widespread because of the prisoners' indefinite detention.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span><strong>Human contact and communication restricted</strong></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong><span>Prisoners in SHUs are not permitted <em>any</em> human physical contact and are forbidden from making phone calls. Guantánamo inmates are not allowed family visits or phone calls. Meetings with lawyers are monitored in Gitmo and the California SHUs which violates prisoners' rights to confidential communication with defense attorneys.</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span><strong>Forced feeding</strong></span></strong><strong>: </strong><span>Over 40 prisoners are currently on hunger strike in Guantánamo and are being forced-fed with nasogastric tubes twice daily.  In a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, President Dr. Jeremy Lazarus of the American Medical Association (AMA) said force-feeding competent prisoners who consciously choice to refuse food is against medical ethical standards. Dr. Gerald Thomson of the Constitution Project condemned the practice saying it is against international ethical standards. Those in Pelican Bay are threatened with this same kind of torture if they continue their hunger strike begun <span><span>July 8</span>, now in week 6.</span></span></p></li>

Let's wear 2.7 million orange ribbons (it costs $2.7 million per year to maintain each Gitmo detainee)in solidarity with all prisoners who suffer torture paid for by U.S. taxpayers and perpetrated by U.S. federal, state, county & municipal governments.
CloseGitmo.net has set the goal for 2.7 million people to wear orange ribbons as a way to tell the world we oppose U.S. government-sponsored torture at all levels and in all cases. Our focus is on closing the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay and supporting the prisoners of Pelican Bay with their 5 core demands.  We call for an end to torture in municipal and county jails where suicide is epidemic among inmates who suffer from poor mental health. We condemn all state prisons who perpetrate the torture of long-term solitary confinement. We also oppose violations of human rights at U.S. federal detention centers as well as all U.S. secret detention centers around the world known as ""Black Sites"" and military bases where torture is well known, i.e. Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan (the ""other Guantánamo"").
Our Appeal
We appeal to the conscience of all decisionmakers who control the fate of prisoners at Guantánamo and say: Close Gitmo!
We support the 5 Core Demands of detainees in prisons throughout California led by prisoners from the Pelican Bay SHU (Security Housing Unit) currently on their 5th week of hunger strike:

Eliminate Group Punishment;
Abolish the Debriefing (snitching) Policy and modify active/inactive gang status criteri;
End long-term solitary confinement;
Provide adequate food; and,

Provide constructive programs (education, self-help treatment, religious activities and other productive activities). 

Why 2.7 million orange ribbons?
In Senate Judiciary Hearings on July 24, 2013, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin announced that it cost $2.7 million/prisoner/year to keep a prisoner in Guantánamo. This amounts to $7400/inmate/day! Those who wear orange ribbons will help bring awareness to how Gitmo ant Pelican Bay prisoners are being subjected daily to torturous, inhumane conditions.
Hunger Strikes in Guantánamo and in California led by prisoners in Pelican Bay
The hunger strike in Guantánamo began February 6, 2013. Soon thereafter nearly all 166 prisoners participated. Sources report that 38 remain firm and have kept fasting (see ""track hunger strike"" at CloseGitmo.net). The inmates began refusing food in protest against the desecration of the inmates’ Korans and evolved to become a wider protest about President Obama's abandonment of his stated commitments over the past five years to close the facility.
The California prisoner hunger strike led by Pelican Bay detainees in the state's only supermax prison started July 8, 2013, with 30,000 prisoners from 22 prisons around the state and others outside the state. As they begin their 6th week on strike, over 250 refuse to eat. 14 prisoners identified as ring leaders have been put in Administrative Segregation Units (Ad. Seg. or ASUs), equivalent to the hole within the hole. They are subjected to cold air blown into their cells and other punitive actions.
U.S. Government policy at the Municipal, County, State Federal & Global levels perpetrates torture in 4 main ways:
Extended solitary confinement: The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Juan Mendez, has stated that solitary confinement beyond 15 days is equivalent to torture. The U.S. leads the world in the number of those held in extended isolation with more than 80,000 detained in city and county jails as well as state and federal prisons and other detention centers. Prisoners in Guantánamo are routinely held in isolation for extended periods and some in California’s Pelican Bay State Prison Security Housing Unit have spent over three decades in the SHU, i.e. solitary confinement or “the hole”.

Indefinite detention: In both Guantánamo and in all four California Prison SHUs, prisoners suffer deep psychological torture, never knowing when they will be freed.  One California prisoner has suffered 42 years in solitary!
Beyond indefinite detention, the vast majority of Gitmo detainees are held without being charged and 86 out of 166 have been cleared for release but never freed. The Obama Administration has said 46 inmates will never be charged or tried. Both the military and civilian attorneys for the detainees, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, have said despair is widespread because of the prisoners' indefinite detention.


Human contact and communication restricted: Prisoners in SHUs are not permitted any human physical contact and are forbidden from making phone calls. Guantánamo inmates are not allowed family visits or phone calls. Meetings with lawyers are monitored in Gitmo and the California SHUs which violates prisoners' rights to confidential communication with defense attorneys.
Forced feeding: Over 40 prisoners are currently on hunger strike in Guantánamo and are being forced-fed with nasogastric tubes twice daily.  In a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, President Dr. Jeremy Lazarus of the American Medical Association (AMA) said force-feeding competent prisoners who consciously choice to refuse food is against medical ethical standards. Dr. Gerald Thomson of the Constitution Project condemned the practice saying it is against international ethical standards. Those in Pelican Bay are threatened with this same kind of torture if they continue their hunger strike begun July 8, now in week 6.

2.7 million Orange ribbons – wear them in solidarity with Gitmo and Pelican Bay Hunger Strikers; place the orange ribbon on social media pages, i.e. Facebook
Our goal in the coming months is to get 2.7 million people to regularly wear the orange ribbons in solidarity with ending U.S.-sponsored torture and closing Gitmo. We fundraising campaign will renew until this many ribbons have been circulated or until Guantánamo is closed and prisoners on the Pelican Bay Hunger Strike find their 5 core demands met.
Thousands of ribbons have already been distributed in this effort to End U.S. Torture. A running count of the number of ribbons already distributed will be published at CloseGitmo.net.
Funds raised will build strategies to End U.S-sponsored Torture
In addition to distributing ribbons, funds raised from this campaign will go to building solidarity with prisoners on hunger strike in Guantánamo Bay and Pelican Bay.  Your generosity will go to strengthen the CloseGitmo.net initiative through organizing strategies to End U.S.-sponsored torture.  Strategies involve building educational campaigns, supporting direct nonviolent actions, networking with families of prisoners, encourage citizens to contact their members of the U.S. congress, building ties with human rights advocates, working with the coalition in solidarity with the Pelican Bay hunger strike and promoting the Guantánamo: A Comprehensive Exit Strategy.

You will receive an email confirmation that your donation is tax-deductible resulting from your gift to Nonviolence International.
Initial funding goal: $7,400, equivalent to the cost of detaining ONE prisoner in Guantánamo for ONE DAY.
Long-term goal: raise the needed funds to distribute 2.7 million orange ribbons to End U.S.-sponsored Torture at all levels.

<p>Please help Elias travel to the US for his speaking tour about the vision and mission of Holy Land Trust for peace . Your generous contribution will cover his flight and accommodation expense during his travel to the US in the month of December 2019. </p>
<p>His time in the US will help in raising awareness among the US citizen about Holy Land Trust work for peace and its vision for the future and to recruit International to join Holy Land Trust programs. </p>
<p>Elias Deis, born into a Christian family with a long history of nonviolent resistance in Beit Sahour, Elias Deis’s life was shaped during the First Intifada, watching his father and his community find the path towards justice through peaceful resistance. It was through his Christian upbringing, holding onto Jesus’s sacred words of “loving thy neighbor,” that led Elias into a life journey of engaging his community in transformation.</p>
<p>Through this challenge, he staked out a path of education that would lead him directly into the middle of peacemaking, seeking a deeper understanding of the nature of the violence, the historical roots, and how generational trauma contributes to cycles of unrest and bloodshed. Watching his father lead by example by organizing within the tax-resistance movement in Beit Sahour, being arrested several times, presented him a real-life example of how a community can combat violence in real ways, preparing him to be a community leader.</p>
<p>Joining Holy Land Trust in 2007 as a travel coordinator, Elias has grown the Travel &amp; Encounter program of Holy Land Trust. His department now facilitates tours and educational packages to some 1,500 peacemakers and sojourners a year. On top of his full-time job, his quest to change the communities around him has led him into an array of leadership positions across the Bethlehem Governorate. in July 2019 , Elias got promoted to be the Executive Director of Holy Land Trust. </p>
<p>Deis was recently elected to the Beit Sahour City Council - one of the youngest members in the history of the council. While on the board, he manages the tourism portfolio, engaging in international relations and community development projects and has been a critical representative to Japan, Turkey, and Lithuania.</p>
<p>Elias's lived experienced, growing up during the Second Intifada, challenging himself and others to find alternative modes to violence within a Christian framework, and the path it has led him down serves as a remarkable story for every Christian and peacemaker.</p>

<h3>About the 2019 SFA Encuentro</h3>
<p>The Student/Farmworker Alliance (SFA) is a national network of students and young people organizing with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) to eliminate sweatshop conditions in the fields. The Fair Food Program and the CIW’s model of worker-driven responsibility has given hope to many in an era of countless attacks on labor rights. </p>
<p>Students continue to make a difference in the fight for a food system based on justice and dignity for farmworkers. While Wendy’s remains the last major fast food company that refuses to sign on the Fair Food program, students are actively fighting to #BootTheBraids off our campuses. Building on this spring’s “4 for Fair Food Tour,” in which farmworkers visited four key campuses to support student demands to end ties with Wendy’s, SFA leaders are demonstrating that we are more than a market demographic — we are an unstoppable movement! </p>

</p><p><b>Sahodaran: </b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Due to the current legislation of India, the
LGBT-community consists of exposed individuals who face various issues; social
injustices, refused health care and sometimes even legal discrimination. </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sahodaran</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, which means “brother” in Malayam, one of South India’s official languages, is a safe space for people of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) and MSM (men who has sex with men) community of Pondicherry, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">where homosexuals and transgender women or men feel secure, accepted and loved.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Sahodaran works as a supporting association for
LGBTs and MSMs, providing health promotion and education for these vulnerable
groups. Since these groups have very little chance of proper health care, Sahodaran offers health counseling and treatment as well as counseling concerning mental
health and well-being.  Furthermore, Sahodaran promotes education both for
their own members and the rest of the community as well as offering
skill-building training and executing human rights campaigns.</p><p></p>
In the near future Sahodaran hopes to extend their activities
by offering shelter for those LGBTs who have no place to live, due to family issues
or other community challenges. Sahodaran also wants to fight discrimination in the
workplace by reaching out to different organizations and factories in order to help
them understand that homosexuals are equal members of society. However, with
the current regulation in India that is a difficult task.<div>
<br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Founder of Sahodaran:</b></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137802/files/20150108023735-IMG_5771.jpg?1420713455"" src="""" style=""width: 180.64788732394365px; height: 242px;""/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sheetal</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is the founder of
Sahodaran and a transgender. She has always known that she was different from the
other boys in her hometown. People used to ask her why she acted like a girl
and why she was only playing with the girls and not with the boys, but Sheetal
couldn’t answer them. Playing with girls just came natural to her. Sheetal, who
then was named Rajesh, was sexually abused for the first time by the neighbor
of her parents when she was 8 years old. He held her captive in his house for a
day and consistently raped her until the parents returned home. However, it
wasn’t until the age of 17, when she moved to Goa to study engineering, that
she was confronted with her sexuality. The first night she spent in her new
dorm the general secretary of the dorm came to her room and raped her. Sheetal
received no compassion from her friends. Instead they started calling her
“homo” and wrote it in big letters on the wall of the hallway where she lived. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sheetal didn’t know what “homo” meant so she contacted a doctor, who told her
to come back in the evening for a consultation. When she came back, the doctor
bound her and raped her. Eventually she came to understand what she was and she
found a small group of friends in Goa who supported her. As a group of
homosexuals they were exposed to scrutiny and discrimination, especially by
authorities. One night in particular stands out for Sheetal, when the police
took her and four of her friends to the police station, where they tortured and
abused them throughout the night for no reason other than that they were gay. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When
she returned to her hometown as gay or MSM (the Indian term for gay is “men who
have sex with men”) she came to realize that her sexuality was not a private
matter. Both of her parents got fired from their jobs, they threatened to

different than other boys her own age and she was therefore kept inside the
house of her parents throughout most of her childhood. She wanted to become a teacher,
but when she went to Chennai in order to pursue her dream, some of her old
classmates told her parents that she had gone to Chennai just to undergo the
sex reassignment surgery (SRS). When she came home to her family after a couple
of weeks in Chennai they all turned against her. She was forbidden to go back
to Chennai and at home she was tortured on a regular basis, beaten by her
father and brothers, she was often not allowed in the house and she was
deprived of both food and water. </p>
<p>Thus, she was forced to move, and as many
other transgender men, she moved to Mumbai, where she was quickly inducted into
the “transgender community”. This is a harsh community run by gangsters, and
due to lack of education, social acceptance and her looks, she was forced into
prostitution. She managed to escape and moved back to Pondicherry. Her
neighbors in Pondicherry were, however, far from welcoming. One evening in
Auroville seven of them attacked her, took her into a cashew field, held a
knife to her throat and raped her. They told her that she deserved it and that
“this was the way she should have sex with men.” After years of low-wage jobs
in Pondicherry, she finally saved up the money for the SRS procedure. </p>
<p>After
coming home to Pondicherry from the operation in Mumbai, her neighbors were
standing outside the building waiting for her to come home. They ripped the drain
out of her stomach and beat her to the point where she could no longer stand on
her feet. She was thrown on the street covered in blood and it was made clear
that she was not welcomed in the house again. At that point, Rukshana was
ready to commit suicide. But instead she called Sheetal, who saved her. And her
life has not been the same since. At Sahodaran she has found a place where she
belongs, a place that accepts her for who she is and for the first time of her
life, she has found real friends. Sheetal has helped her to get an identity
card as a transgender, she has helped her to get a job and first and foremost
she, and the community at Sahodaran, has helped her heal the psychological scars
her life has left her with. When her father died a couple of years ago she was
not allowed to attend the funeral. She came anyway, and as a consequence a
grave was dug next to her fathers and her family told her that this grave was
for her and if she ever came back, they would kill her. </p>
<p><i>“Everyday was a struggle and I wanted to kill myself,
because I thought that society didn’t want me. Sahodaran has given me a reason
to live. They’ve given me an identity. For that I’m forever grateful.” </i></p>

<p>When the community where the now 18-year-old <b>Madhavi</b> used to live realized that he was
gay, they excluded him from day-to-day life. His friends distanced themselves
from him and everywhere he went, he was met with closed doors, whispers and
homophobic names being shouted at him. In the classroom the teachers used to
put him down in front of the other students, calling him names and the other
children used to laugh at him. Throughout 10<sup>th</sup> grade, when Madhavi
was only 14 years old, he was left to himself. He had no friends and no support
from his family, which led him to two suicide attempts. When the senior students
at his school realized that he was gay they made his life a living hell. One
day, after school, 6 of them attacked him, dragged him into an empty room and
forced him to take off his pants so they could have sex with him. When Madhavi
refused, they beat him up until he fainted. While he was unconscious, they
raped and tortured him. Madhiva was hospitalized for a week after that incident
and the police refused to investigate the case further. Madhiva was only 14
years old when this incident took place. When he graduated high school he met
his first boyfriend. However, as soon as the relationship became sexual, his boyfriend
invited 4 of his friends over to his house, where Madhiva was staying, and he
forced Madhavi to have sex with them. </p>
<p>Only 6 months ago Madhavi decided to move to
Mumbai and he, as many others before him, got pulled into the destructive
transgender/homosexual environment of Mumbai. Because Madhiva is gay and it is
illegal for men to have sex with other men according to article 377 of the
Indian Penal Code, he was automatically excluded from society. When you are
homosexual in India, no one wants to be seen with you or even sit next to you
on the bus. Thus, you have two options in order to survive: begging or
prostitution. Madhiva chose the latter and worked as a prostitute for several
months in Mumbai. Today Madhiva lives in Pondicherry and is a proud member of
Sahodaran. Not only has he found friends at Sahodaran, he has found “best friends”, who
accept him for who he is and who makes him feel special. At Sahodaran he helps
other boys in his situation and he finally feels that his life has meaning. </p>

Rainbow Walk in order to help the Pondicherry government realize how large the
LGBT-community is in Pondicherry and that they need their rights as homosexuals to
be respected by society. As the situation is now, article 377 of the Indian
Penal Code is ruining the lives of numerous men and women in India.</span></p>
<p>Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code is the
law against “unnatural offences.”—<i>Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse
against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished
with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Article
377 entails the complete prohibition of the penetrative sexual acts engaged in
by homosexual men, which initially criminalizes their sexual expression and
identity. Furthermore, article 377 has a severe impact on their dignity and
self-worth. Police harassment, social exclusion and legal discrimination have
become everyday-life for most homosexuals in India. As in the case of Sheetal and Rukshana, homosexuals are often shunned by their families when they come out to their parents and they are often forced to live in the streets. It is very hard for homosexuals to enter the job market and discrimination on the
workplace and by employers is common. This often forces them into
prostitution and begging in the streets. </p>
<p>The
stigma and prejudice has fostered a culture of silence around homosexuality,
which results in a vast number of male rapes and male prostitutes in India.
Before Rukshana became
a woman, she was stopped one night by the police in the streets of Pondicherry, where they ordered her to take off all of her clothes in front of a
crowd of people. The police officers pocked her genitals with their knight sticks and made fun of her to great amusement for the surrounding bystanders. Sadly this situation is
far from unique. Thus,
many are forced to hide their sexuality because they are afraid. However,
hiding one’s sexuality is difficult and often the family will find out
eventually. One week ago Sheetal helped save a boy from a middle class family
in Pondicherry, whose parents had wrapped him in a fishing-net with the
intention of setting fire to him and drop him into the sea. Luckily he escaped. </p>

<p>Sheetal: <i>“The

Pondicherry have no voice. Whenever we seek funding for campaigns that aims at
creating awareness of homosexual’s rights, people refuse to have anything to do

an identity, they are just “men who have sex with men” and that is not right.
What about the lesbians? What about the bisexuals? Even though many are afraid
of coming out, it is a consolation for them to know that we are here. They just

<p>Imagine
that every time you take a seat on the bus, no one wants to sit next to you,
because people are disgusted by you. The repulsion the Indian society has for the
LGBT community is rooted in ignorance and the social stigma of being seen with
someone who is homosexual. This falls back on the government of India and article
377, which is still used as a tool by the police to harass, extort and
blackmail homosexual men, hindering them from seeking legal assistance because
they too would be penalized for having “unnatural sex.” Sadly, this is everyday life for homosexuals in India. By contributing to this project you’re first and foremost helping
Sahodoran fund their Rainbow Walk, but you’re also showing the government of India,
that a change is not only needed but also demanded. The money that is not spend on the Rainbow Walk will help Sahodaran in their further work for the LGBT community of Pondicherry! </p>

</div></div>","Sahodaran: Due to the current legislation of India, the
LGBT-community consists of exposed individuals who face various issues; social
injustices, refused health care and sometimes even legal discrimination. Sahodaran, which means “brother” in Malayam, one of South India’s official languages, is a safe space for people of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) and MSM (men who has sex with men) community of Pondicherry, where homosexuals and transgender women or men feel secure, accepted and loved.
Sahodaran works as a supporting association for
LGBTs and MSMs, providing health promotion and education for these vulnerable
groups. Since these groups have very little chance of proper health care, Sahodaran offers health counseling and treatment as well as counseling concerning mental
health and well-being.  Furthermore, Sahodaran promotes education both for
their own members and the rest of the community as well as offering
skill-building training and executing human rights campaigns.
In the near future Sahodaran hopes to extend their activities
by offering shelter for those LGBTs who have no place to live, due to family issues
or other community challenges. Sahodaran also wants to fight discrimination in the
workplace by reaching out to different organizations and factories in order to help
them understand that homosexuals are equal members of society. However, with
the current regulation in India that is a difficult task.
Founder of Sahodaran:

Sheetal is the founder of
Sahodaran and a transgender. She has always known that she was different from the
other boys in her hometown. People used to ask her why she acted like a girl
and why she was only playing with the girls and not with the boys, but Sheetal
couldn’t answer them. Playing with girls just came natural to her. Sheetal, who
then was named Rajesh, was sexually abused for the first time by the neighbor
of her parents when she was 8 years old. He held her captive in his house for a
day and consistently raped her until the parents returned home. However, it
wasn’t until the age of 17, when she moved to Goa to study engineering, that
she was confronted with her sexuality. The first night she spent in her new
dorm the general secretary of the dorm came to her room and raped her. Sheetal
received no compassion from her friends. Instead they started calling her
“homo” and wrote it in big letters on the wall of the hallway where she lived. 
Sheetal didn’t know what “homo” meant so she contacted a doctor, who told her
to come back in the evening for a consultation. When she came back, the doctor
bound her and raped her. Eventually she came to understand what she was and she
found a small group of friends in Goa who supported her. As a group of
homosexuals they were exposed to scrutiny and discrimination, especially by
authorities. One night in particular stands out for Sheetal, when the police
took her and four of her friends to the police station, where they tortured and
abused them throughout the night for no reason other than that they were gay. 
When
she returned to her hometown as gay or MSM (the Indian term for gay is “men who
have sex with men”) she came to realize that her sexuality was not a private
matter. Both of her parents got fired from their jobs, they threatened to
commit suicide and they burned her certificate in engineering from Goa. They
told her that she brought shame on the family and that she was dead to them.
Sheetal was devastated and left the home of her parents. She moved to Chennai
where she worked scrubbing floors to earn a living. Today she lives in
Pondicherry with her husband and she’s happy and hopeful. She started SCOHD as
a home where homosexuals and transgender can talk freely and be themselves,
however it has turned into so much more. Today Sahodaran has 2233 members and the
LGBT-community of Pondicherry is growing.

“We
will not stop being who we are, and at some point they will have to acknowledge
us. India is changing, but the government is not. We won’t give up and I am
hopeful. We will get there one day. I just hope I will be alive to witness it
once we do.”

<h2>Feed 2000 families in the month of Ramadan</h2>
<p>Ramadan Campaign for this year (2019) will be allocated to distribute food aid baskets to 2000 families in the capital Sana'a.</p>
<p>Mona Relief has carried out twice two campaigns for Ramadan we have been able reach out more than 3000 families just in the holy month of Ramadan the two last years.</p>
<h3>Food baskets</h3>
<p>Each food aid basket will contains 25 kg of flour, 5 kg of rice, 5 kg of sugar, 2 litters of cooking oil, 2 kg of red lentils, 1 kg of powdered milk, 4 kg of dates and 4 packages of pasta. Each food basket will cost $ 40 and will feed a family from 6-8 members for the whole month.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556314941/iwzopoaidq6uswcerjnp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why your donation and support is important</h3>
<p>Four years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need. This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors. And millions of Yemeni people have no idea how can they get their next meal.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, your donation and support are very important to help to alleviate the suffer of Yemeni people not only in Ramadan but for the whole year and much more in this holy month because there is many people if we don't help them by delivering food baskets they otherwise will have nothing for iftar, the nightly meal when families break their Ramadan fast.</p>
<p>In fact, After 15 hours of fasting these people need something to break their fast, as a gift they give their selves and because those people have nothing as they are almost poor, we are at Mona Relief trying to help them and delivering them food aid baskets for this holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>Since it was established in 2015, Mona Relief has been carried out over 250 projects in Yemen and reaching our more than 45000 families all over the country.</p>
<p>This year, 2019, unfortunately, the war is still going on, but that doesn't stop us. Our goal this year will be to provide Ramadan packages to 3000 families with food aid baskets which contains wheat, rice, sugar, cooking oil, powdered milk, dates, lentils, and pasta.</p>
<p>Mona Relief, a 100% Yemeni Organization based in Yemen took the initiative with this campaign. With as simple as 40 dollars, you are able to feed a family for a whole month.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance to every single person who donated and support our humanitarian work in Yemen.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Past work by Mona Relief</h2>
<p>Mona Relief has been carried out over 200 projects in Yemen since the war started in 2015.</p>

<h3>To get more information about the current situation in Yemen you have to read this</h3>
<p>Yemen has become a failed and devastated state. Since March 2015, 9,245 people have been killed and 52,800 injured. Coalition air strikes are the leading cause of civilian casualties. According to the U.N. Human Rights Council, civilians have repeatedly been the victims of ""unrelenting violations of international humanitarian law."" About 75 percent of the population — 22.2 million people — needs humanitarian assistance. Some 17.8 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from, and 8.4 million are considered at risk of starvation. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of 5. Half of the country's 3,500 health facilities are functioning and at least 16.4 million people lack basic health care. Medics have struggled to cope with the world's largest cholera outbreak, with more than 1 million suspected cases and 2,248 associated deaths since April 2017. More than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 2 million who remain displaced.</p>
<p><strong>Key Facts about Yemen</strong></p>
<p>Three and a half years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need. This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Food Security and Agriculture</strong></p>
<p>17.8 million people in Yemen are food insecure. Out of this, approximately 8.4 million people are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation - a worrying increase of 24 per cent. The conflict has destroyed people’s livelihoods and reduced their purchasing power, making it difficult for many Yemenis to meet minimal food needs.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>With only 50 per cent of health facilities fully functional, and a disruption of salaries paid to health personnel, 16.4 million people in Yemen require assistance to ensure adequate access to healthcare – 9.3 million of whom are in acute need.</p>
<p>The overriding humanitarian need is access to minimum healthcare for people whose lives are at risk due to illness or injury. The latest cholera outbreak has underscored the impact of the failing health system.</p>
<p><strong>Water, Sanitation and hygiene</strong></p>
<p>An estimated 16 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to establish or maintain access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, out of which 11.6 million are in acute need. Collapsing urban water and sanitation systems, deteriorating water and sanitation conditions in rural areas, and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene and purchase safe drinking water all contributed to one of the worst cholera outbreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p>
<p>Some 1.8 million children and 1.1 million pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under the age 5 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. An estimated 7.5 million people are in need of nutrition assistance, with 2.9 million people who will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Shelter and essential items</strong></p>
<p>An estimated 5.4 million people need emergency shelter or essential household items, including IDPs, host communities and initial returnees. Ongoing conflict-related displacements, as well as initial returns to some areas, are driving these needs. 2.6 million people are in acute need of assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Protection</strong></p>
<p>With the increasing conflict, Yemen is one of the world’s largest protection crises. About 12.9 million people need assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of IHL, grave violations of children’s rights and gender-based violence.</p>
<p>Displacement and conflict has impacted vulnerable households and persons with specific needs, resulting in negative coping mechanisms and mounting psychosocial support needs. 4.9 million people are living in acutely affected areas.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>The 2017/2018 school year started with a setback in the education process in 13 out of 22 governorates. This is due to the extended time of non-payment of salaries for teachers. Schools across the country are unfit for use due to conflict-related damage, hosting of IDPs, or occupation by armed groups. An estimated 4.1 million school-age children require assistance to continue their education.</p>
<p><strong>Livelihoods and community resilience</strong></p>
<p>Around 8 million conflict-affected individuals require livelihoods assistance to enhance their selfreliance to address basic needs and reduce dependency on relief assistance. Communities require support to promote resilience, including clearance of landmines and other explosives in up to 22 governorate</p>

</div></div>","Feed 2000 families in the month of Ramadan
Ramadan Campaign for this year (2019) will be allocated to distribute food aid baskets to 2000 families in the capital Sana'a.
Mona Relief has carried out twice two campaigns for Ramadan we have been able reach out more than 3000 families just in the holy month of Ramadan the two last years.
Food baskets
Each food aid basket will contains 25 kg of flour, 5 kg of rice, 5 kg of sugar, 2 litters of cooking oil, 2 kg of red lentils, 1 kg of powdered milk, 4 kg of dates and 4 packages of pasta. Each food basket will cost $ 40 and will feed a family from 6-8 members for the whole month.

 
Why your donation and support is important
Four years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need. This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors. And millions of Yemeni people have no idea how can they get their next meal.
As a matter of fact, your donation and support are very important to help to alleviate the suffer of Yemeni people not only in Ramadan but for the whole year and much more in this holy month because there is many people if we don't help them by delivering food baskets they otherwise will have nothing for iftar, the nightly meal when families break their Ramadan fast.
In fact, After 15 hours of fasting these people need something to break their fast, as a gift they give their selves and because those people have nothing as they are almost poor, we are at Mona Relief trying to help them and delivering them food aid baskets for this holy month of Ramadan.
Since it was established in 2015, Mona Relief has been carried out over 250 projects in Yemen and reaching our more than 45000 families all over the country.
This year, 2019, unfortunately, the war is still going on, but that doesn't stop us. Our goal this year will be to provide Ramadan packages to 3000 families with food aid baskets which contains wheat, rice, sugar, cooking oil, powdered milk, dates, lentils, and pasta.
Mona Relief, a 100% Yemeni Organization based in Yemen took the initiative with this campaign. With as simple as 40 dollars, you are able to feed a family for a whole month.
Thanks in advance to every single person who donated and support our humanitarian work in Yemen.
 
Past work by Mona Relief
Mona Relief has been carried out over 200 projects in Yemen since the war started in 2015.

Short Summary:
My name is Alonzo “Zochi” Young: I am a teacher, mentor, and founder of njiamovement, ""The Way of Embodied Leadership through Movement"".  I help youth and adults in underserved communities to discover and explore their untapped potential, empower them as leaders, and provide these communities with tools and interpersonal skills to manage conflict nonviolently. The core vehicles I use for this unique, transformative work are the introspective and centering peaceful practices of Taiji, Meditation, and Aikido. These modalities provide an intersection of self-sustaining life skills to support communities to: 
Manage Anger and Conflict
Reduce Stress

Increase Capacity
Face Fear
Improve Relationships
Enhance Health and Well-Being

Discover inner PEACE 

The OPPORTUNITYI have a unique opportunity to teach in Africa this winter in Ethiopia and Kenya - from  January to March  2015.  This journey will serve as a building block for a cultural bridge between communities in Africa and the communities I serve in the Bay Area and throughout the U.S.Hawasa Ethiopia:My first leg of this pilgrimage will be to Hawasa, Ethiopia.   With your assistance and the support of organizations such as Aiki Extension's Aikido Ethiopia Project (http://www.aikiextensions.org/programs/ae-progr...), Action For Youth ( http://actionforyouth.org ), Awassa.org http://awassa.org), and Pushing for Peace (http://www.pushingforpeace.org/)
 I will be able to:
Teach Aikido and introduce creative facilitation skills, games, and activities to various age youth throughout the region.
Prepare, support, and witness 9 youth with their historical ""Rite of Passage"" exam for their Black Belts in Aikido.  

 Assist with the opening of a new facility built specifically to provide youth with and adequate space to support future growth of youth to embody peace and leadership skills.  
Support various organizations and communites in the region with these practices
Nairobi, KenyaThe
 details for Kenya have not be full worked out yet.  There are 
several youth organizations in Kenya presently requesting me to bring  njiamovement and Peace Games 
 to their communities. As the details of this leg of my itinerary in Kenya become clearer I will update my 
schedule.What Is Needed
""If you want to go fast, go alone.  If you want to go far, go with others.” In order to take full advantage forward into this marvelous
opportunity, I need your help. As the African proverb states, “If you
want to go fast, go alone.  If you want
to go far, go with others.”  I  need your help to raise $5,000 (to cover transportation cost)
for this venture. 
The Impact

With your contribution to this journey, I will be able to extend this work and practice to the peoples of Ethiopia and Kenya - as well as create a cultural bridge that will connect many communities across continents and oceans.  This exchange will have a tremendous influence on the inner work I teach and will have positive impact on youth and communities I work with in the Bay Area and beyond.  Immediate and long term Impact of this work is to help communities: 
Develop
     and refine non-violent communication skills that can be used to transform
     conflict.
Hone
     critical thinking skills necessary to explore, appreciate, and articulate
     the complexity of cultural and national identity.
Develop leadership skills through experience, including the increased confidence to lead in formal and informal situations.

Cultivate
     internal capacity to manage responses to stressful external conditions and
     simultaneously maintain centered composure.
Restore community health and well-being, and reconnect communities with their own truth.

Share
     practices and knowledge with others, catching a world on fire with
     evolutionary, sustainable, and peaceful change.

RVA</a> is a musically oriented, youth empowerment non-profit based in Richmond, VA. Our mission is to facilitate a space in Richmond that empowers girls, gender non-conforming, and trans youth to collaborate creatively in an environment of mutual respect and positive self-expression.  We operate a week-long, free summer camp that focuses on empowering young people through collaborative musical learning and expression through performance.  Our organization is entirely volunteer-run, and camp week can involve the efforts of over 40 volunteers.  As we enter our 5th camp season, we are trying to build a more sustainable volunteer base.  </p>
<p>We would like to pay 25 camp volunteers a $200 stipend for their hard work during camp week.  We have asked a lot of our volunteers in the past - some committing to working as many as 50 hours during camp week, and many taking days off from jobs that don't provide paid vacation - for which they get a positive camp experience in return.  But we don't want our instrument instructors, band coaches, or camp counselors to have to make a choice between a positive experience and paying their electric bill.  We want to make it easier for these talented people to commit to volunteering with us year after year, and to start we have set a goal for 2015 of paying 25 volunteers a $200 stipend.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to pay $200 to 25 volunteers, we need at least $5,000 in contributions.  Girls Rock! RVA has focused on fundraising, camp coordination, and community partnerships to improve the camper experience, and now we want to focus on improving service to our volunteer staff.  We have been lucky to receive so much community support over the years, and we hope you will continue to support us in this initiative!</p>
<p>If we make our goal of $5,000, we will pay $200 stipends to 25 volunteers, prioritizing those who work full camp-days, take time off of work to join us without paid personal or vacation days, or commute from other cities in order to participate.  Girls Rock! RVA already provides two meals per day to our volunteers, and we feel that a $200 stipend plus free food is a great start.  If we exceed our goal, we will first extend the offer of stipends to other volunteers who may be in need.  If no other volunteers apply for a stipend, we will increase the stipend amount for our original 25 volunteers.  If we do not meet our goal, we will reduce the number of stipends offered, and give funds to the volunteers most in need of a stipend.</p>
<p>We have some exciting perks for you if you choose to donate!  If you donate $25 or more, we will give you a digital download code for a recording of last year's rock camp dress rehearsal, featuring all-original songs by Girls Rock! RVA campers.  If you donate $75 or more, we will send you an assortment of zines made by campers and camp staff over the past few years.  If you donate $200 or more, we will have the volunteer(s) you sponsored write you a letter detailing their work during camp, giving you an inside look at the work our volunteers do to instruct and empower young people at rock camp.  If you donate $500 or more, we will send you letters from the staff you sponsored, as well as have you over for a nice home-cooked meal with the Girls Rock! RVA organizers!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Girls Rock! RVA provides an opportunity for girls, gender non-conforming, and trans youth to create and express themselves in a safe, non-judgemental and non-critical space surrounded by working artists and musicians.  The experience of our volunteers as working artists, the musical instruction, and the unfettered creative process available to young people at camp are totally unique aspects of Girls Rock! RVA.  Our staff are not just instructors, but creative role models to our campers.  In addition, our camp is free to attend, because access is one of our top priorities.  There simply are no other summer camps like ours in Richmond.  Campers receive a crash course in an instrument, and through group work and encouragement from instructors, gain the confidence to write and perform an original song with a band in five days.  We also provide workshops on body image, healthy relationships, gender stereotypes, song and lyric writing, zine making, screen printing, and the history of women in popular music, among others.  </p>
<p>By contributing to Girls Rock! RVA for this fundraising initiative, you will help ensure that local artists and musicians can confidently choose to volunteer with us in 2015 and beyond.  We want to make the choice between camp and day job easier for a working musician.  We want our talented volunteers to continue to choose Girls Rock! RVA year after year.</p>
<p>In the past, we have handled funds raised from benefit shows, parental and other individual donations, and a grant from Richmond CultureWorks with the utmost responsibility.  The funds we raise from shows, individuals, and grants are used to run our Free Richmond Instrument Lending Library, repair equipment, replace components such as cables or guitar picks, purchase art supplies and camper tote bags, print zines of camper artwork, and to purchase ingredients for healthy meals for our volunteers and healthy snacks for our campers during camp week.  We successfully incorporated as an LLC in Virginia and received 501(c)3 non-profit status last fall.  We have been building trust and cultivating relationships within the Richmond community for five years, and can be trusted to be accountable with your donations.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> In the event we do not reach our goal, Girls Rock! RVA will award as many stipends as possible with the donated funds to the volunteers most in need of financial assistance.  We will determine need during the volunteer application process and through interviews thereafter if our funds raised from this initiative do not meet our $5,000 goal.  </p>
<p>In the event we exceed $5,000, we will either award additional stipends, or increase the amount of the stipend by no more than $50 to volunteers with the most need.  If we greatly exceed our goal, we will roll over funds to provide stipends to next year's volunteer staff.</p>

PAPUA NYA GUINEA. Det är gryning i Port Moresby. Utanför bussens fönster trängs morgontrafiken och på marknaden har försäljarna precis brett ut sina filtar täckta med betelnötter. Platserna i bussen fylls under färden in mot huvudstadens centrum. Kvinnor på väg till jobbet, skolflickor i ljusblå uniformer och damer som ska handla på marknaden. 
 

Papua Nya Guinea - Meri Seif
Här ombord möts kvinnor från olika kulturer, stammar, samhällsklasser, och som pratar olika språk, men på bussen upplever de en säker zon tillsammans - fri från män. 
 

Papua Nya Guinea - Meri Seif
I huvudstadens offentliga bussar blir kvinnor ofta utsatta för sexuella trakasserier. Det är svårt att åka fritt i staden. Därför trafikerar nu ett antal kvinnobussar, som kallas Meri Seif, Port Moresbys gator. Dagligen reser hundratals kvinnor och barn med bussarna. 
 

Östra Kongo - Sexuellt våld i krig
DEMOKRATISKA REPUBLIKEN KONGO. I Demokratiska republiken Kongo sker över 1 000 våldtäkter varje dag. På Panzisjukhuset och transitboende Maison Dorcas i Bukavu får utsatta kvinnor och barn en chans att läka fysiskt och själsligt. När Justine kom till centret var hon så rädd för andra människor att hon ofta svimmade och gömde sig under sängen. 
Hon hade våldtagits av flera män när hon gick till skogen för att samla ved. Under lång tid var hon djupt deprimerad och vågade inte närma sig andra människor. I dag deltar hon i flera olika aktiviteter och i framtiden vill hon starta sin egen syateljé.
 

Östra Kongo - Maison Dorcas
En grön oas omringas av de olika huslängorna som utgör Masion Dorcas. I en av salarna hörs glada röster och en sliten bandspelare spelar hög musik. Dansterapeuten Amie Alices vägleder eleverna i rörelserna. Svettdroppar yr genom den kvava luften. I slutet av lektionen fylls salen med mammor och barn som spontandansar tillsammans.

Kenya - Utbildning
KENYA. För tio år sedan var ""Skolan under trädet"" allt som fanns. I skuggan intill den tjocka trädstammen lärde Mama Ledo byns barn allt hon kunde. Hon ville ge dem en annan framtid.
    – Om jag inte hade gått i skolan hade jag varit gift nu. I vår kultur gifter man bort flickor tidigt, ibland är de inte äldre än nio år, berättar 14-åriga Dorah Apetet Emase.
 

Kenya - Mama Ledo
 

Västra Kongo - Mödradödlighet
DEMOKRATISKA REPUBLIKEN KONGO. Byn Mimia är omgiven av tät regnskog. Här lever människor så gott som helt isolerade från omvärden. Att resa på floden till närmaste stad skulle ta flera dagar. Det är på dessa stigar som många av omgivningens kvinnor färdas i timmar - ibland dagar - för att komma till en läkare.
 

Västra Kongo - Mödradödlighet
– Hade jag inte tagit mig hit till Mimia hade varken jag eller mina barn levt idag, berättar Joceline Ngongona, en av de unga nyförlösta kvinnorna som skjutsades med värkar till Mimia på pakethållaren på en cykel.
 

Västra Kongo - Mödradödlighet
 

Bangladesh - Frihet
BANGLADESH. Det som kan tyckas vara en självklarhet i många länder - att äga en cykel eller att som kvinna ha rätt att cykla - är långt ifrån verkligheten för många i Bangladesh. 2007 startades ett cykelprojekt för flickor. Målet är att kvinnor ska vara likvärdiga män, socialt och ekonomiskt, med samma frihet och möjlighet att röra sig överallt utan ledsagare.

<p>We are now hoping to <strong>exceed</strong> the $500 goas for information for his booth and there is not much time for that happen.  Please consider a small donation now.  You will be helping an organization that is working for GLBT rights in a country where the majority - so far - are less than supportive.</p>
<p>                       --------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As gay men who are fortunate enough to live in a country that values the rights of the GLBT community my partner and I were thrilled to meet Zdravko last year while visiting Montenegro. He is an amazing young man who has been bold enough to come out in a country that is far from supportive of its gay community.  In fact Zdravko made the bold decision to come out, after being attacked because of his sexual orientation, so that others would ultimately feel safe to be who they are in a country that is presently less than supportive. He has since gone on to create the first Gay Rights organization in Montenegro that is doing great work to create improvements in the situation for the GLBT community.</p>
<p>Despite his work he continues to be greeted each day by taunts and threats by the general population of his country. And yet he continues to tirelessly fight for what he feels is right.</p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">Vancouver Gay Pride Parade 2013</strong></h3>
<p>I am thrilled to say that I nominated Zdravko to be one of the 3 Grand Marshals at the Gay Pride Parade in Vancouver and he was unanimously voted in.  This is a huge honour and well deserved in his case.</p>
<p>Zdravko is not only excited to be a Grand Marshal but he is excited about the opportunity to help others become aware of the issues that the community have in Montenegro and throughout the Balkans. He will have a booth in the community area of the parade where he will talk to people about the situation in Montenegro as well as the progressive and powerful work that he is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the funds go?</strong></p>
<p><em>The funds that you contribute will pay for a large, professionally developed, banner that will appear above the booth on Gay Pride day as well as offset the costs of print materials that Zdravko would like to have available for interested parties. Any remaining money will go directly to Zdravko to support the work of his organization</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What this will mean for the GLBT community in Montenegro.</strong></p>
<p>The fact that Zdravko will be a Grand Marshal in one of the largest Gay Pride Parades in the world is already hugely significant for him and his organization. Bringing awareness to human rights issues in a country such as Montenegro not only supports those who have been repressed but also challenges the country to move forward. </p>

When I went to India before, I used to rent a small house where we could work together, but between paying a rent or providing them with more work, I always chose the second option.

It will give the women an opportunity to develop their own dreams in a safe space, rebuilding their confidence and a change of a bright future. There, they will also be able to sell our products directly to tourists and to welcome volunteers and visitors from all over the world to exchange skills with them. With our center, it will be possible to provide shelter for the most vulnerable ones in cases of abuse or divorce, being the first shelter to offer all this in Anjuna, Goa, where we are located.</p><p>By reaching our goal, I will be going to India one month after the campaign ends, documenting all the process of getting our space ready, as well as the feedback from our artisans on how do they feel with the progress, sharing their life-changing experiences and what their expectations for the future are.</p><p>I hope you join us making this vision becoming a reality because everyone involved, from wherever in the world you might be, will be responsible for every and each little detail we will accomplish from now on.</p><p> </p><p>Love and light always,</p><p> </p><p>Carla.</p><div>

Es ist jetzt die Zeit gekommen unabhängiger und mehr organisiert zu werden mit unserem Zentrum.

When I went to India before, I used to rent a small house where we could work together, but between paying a rent or providing them with more work, I always chose the second option. But to put ourselves in a next level and unlock bigger opportunities, is time for us to have a permanent space.In the past 2 years, we have managed to grow, we have learned so much, changed so many lives, but having this center for empowerment and development of individuals, will give us the opportunity to master what we already do and expand. It will give the women an opportunity to develop their own dreams in a safe space, rebuilding their confidence and a change of a bright future. There, they will also be able to sell our products directly to tourists and to welcome volunteers and visitors from all over the world to exchange skills with them. With our center, it will be possible to provide shelter for the most vulnerable ones in cases of abuse or divorce, being the first shelter to offer all this in Anjuna, Goa, where we are located.By reaching our goal, I will be going to India one month after the campaign ends, documenting all the process of getting our space ready, as well as the feedback from our artisans on how do they feel with the progress, sharing their life-changing experiences and what their expectations for the future are.I hope you join us making this vision becoming a reality because everyone involved, from wherever in the world you might be, will be responsible for every and each little detail we will accomplish from now on. Love and light always, Carla.
 
  
 Money breakdown:The money we fundraise will be used to rent our space in Goa for at least one year, cover the expenses with the furniture, machines, and tools we need to set up our space, investment in new techniques (handloom training, tools for natural dying, organic fabrics).We need at least 10,000 USD to make this project come to life.We will be doing this campaign on 2 different platforms, Indiegogo (worldwide) and Benfeitoria (Brazil) to raise the whole amount.Follow below the estimated costs we will have during the campaign: Pledges:For the assorted pledges, the pictures are just one example, you will not be able to choose exactly which color or design of that product you are getting it.For the exclusively developed products, after you choose your reward, we will get in touch with you over email to start the exclusive product development.For the “Giving Back Pledges” covering the school fees of our kids, the average school expenses yearly per kid is around 200 USD. The difference donated in these categories will be invested in the realization of our center.ASSORTED REWARDS - your item will be randomly selected from our collection, colors and style may vary. Assorted bracelets and keychains - sizes, colors, and handwork will vary - Pledge comes with one OR another:  Assorted necklaces - design and colors will vary: Assorted make-up bags - sizes, colors, and handwork will vary:Assorted pillows - sizes, colors, and handwork will vary: Assorted scarves - sizes, colors, and handwork will vary:  Chetan elephant pillow: Illustration by Carolina Buzio - unframed - SOLD OUTT-shirt by Carolina Buzio:T-shirt by Paola Saliby:Silver Earring + Recycled Soapstone: Recycled Soapstone Necklace:Production + shipment timeline:Some of the products we are offering in the campaign are ready to go!

SPENDEN VON “DONATE NOW” SIND OHNE GESCHENK!  Liebe Leute,Project Três geht in die nächste Runde und ich hoffe ihr unterstützt uns mit unseren neuen Vorhaben.Der Traum ein eigenes kleines Zentrum in Indien zu haben ging bisher nicht in Erfüllung, da wir an erster Stelle die Gehälter unserer Frauen zahlten und sonstige anfallende Kosten, wie Arztrechnungen etc. Bisher mietete ich (Carla) ein kleines Haus in Indien, in dem wir zusammen arbeiten konnten, denn ich wollte als erstes sicherstellen, dass ich die Gehälter bezahlen konnte.Aber jetzt wollen wir den nächsten Schritt wagen - ein eigenes kleines Zentrum für “Women Empowerment”.In den letzten 2 Jahren ist Project Três deutlich gewachsen, wir haben viel gelernt und das Leben unserer Frauen verbessert. Es ist jetzt die Zeit gekommen unabhängiger und mehr organisiert zu werden mit unserem Zentrum. Ein eigene Begegnungsstätte für “Women Empowerment” bietet unseren Frauen einen sicheren Arbeitsplatz, der Platz bietet für persönliche Entwicklung und an dem sie sich vollkommen auf die Arbeit konzentrieren können. Außerdem können wir so direkt vor Ort unsere Produkte verkaufen und Freiwillige sowie Besucher willkommen heißen.

<p>Welcome to the Warriors for Women Campaign! Warriors for Women is a group of students at the University of Tennessee partnering with the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) of Knoxville &amp; the Tennessee Valley. Our goal is to raise money for the YWCA to assist them in fulfilling their mission statement: eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. We ask that you use this page as a resource to learn more about the YWCA and donate to their cause to make a difference in the lives of women and children in our community.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>The main focus of our campaign is to raise money for Keys of Hope, a program facilitated by YWCA that provides transitional housing to women. Women come to the YWCA for a variety of reasons and needs. Some are victims of domestic violence, one of the most common crimes committed in the United States. According to studies, at least 1 in every 3 women will become victims of a form of domestic violence. Since 1899, the YWCA Knoxville has been serving women and their families in the community. The YWCA provides support and assistance to women that are survivors of domestic violence in addition to housing needs, allowing them to escape dangerous or abusive situations. While women are living in the facilities provided by YWCA, they are also provided with career counseling and a support system to help them get back on their feet and find an independent and safe living environment. This program has changed the lives of hundreds of women by allowing them to regain control over their lives and get a fresh start.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>As a non-profit, the YWCA relies on the donations and volunteer work of others to continue assisting women in the Knoxville community. That’s where you come in! The YWCA needs your help to continue empowering the women of Knoxville &amp; the Tennessee Valley through their programs. By donating to our campaign, you will be helping to change the lives of women in our community. Anything you are able to give will go directly towards the YWCA and the Keys of Hope Women's Housing program to help with renovation, furnishing, and simply providing for the residents of the transitional housing programs. If you are unable to donate monetarily, you can still show your support by volunteering at any of the YWCA’s numerous locations or by working to raise awareness about domestic violence. The YWCA also welcomes any donations of food, clothing, and gently used household items. If you do decide to donate, you may be eligible to receive “perks” as a thank you. For donating $5, you will receive a handwritten thank you note from our team members. For donating $10, you will receive a Warriors for Women sticker. We value any and all donations that we receive, and want to express our gratitude to you!</p>

of my daughter, I moved back to India to provide clean toilets so that no
daughter, no mother or sister ever has to lose her dignity just in relieve
herself.



                   Join me in protecting dignity of 1
daughter at a time.
You only have few days to become part
of our journey and to create enormous impact in the lives of 5000 Girls.It is an undeniable fact that the absence of safe toilet adds to the vulnerability of women. A man can unzip anywhere without fear and shame. It is the women, who lack access to private toilets and have to wake up before sunrise or wait for the sky to get dark and walk miles to find the right and safe place to defecate. If not a human issue, toilets certainly are a women’s issue.  SCENARIO
Imagine being a
mother of a bubbly 12 year old girl in a house, the size of 2 dining tables, in
an urban slum.You don't have a toilet not just because of a financial crunch, but also because of a space crunch. In dense Urban slums, in-home toilet is rarely an option. So Community toilets are an appropriate sanitation solution. But many urban slums do not have community toilets and even if community toilets are present, they are FILTHY and unused as not properly maintained.
CONSEQUENCES
At dinner you eat little and drink less to reduce the pressure of the basic call of nature, because you know that  it might be too difficult to find a clean toilet and too dangerous to find a safe place amidst the evil  forces of night; when men shine torch on women defecating, or hide behind the adjacent bush to peep and pelt stones to tease. Moreover, you also ask your daughter not to take more than a few sips of water else she would have to step out of the house at night, And you know it's not going to be safe. You get up early in the morning, walk a mile (or two or three) to find a spot away from the normal gaze and finally relieve. And this continues. Day-after-day-after-day until eternity. Holding your pee and poo leads to severe health complications like UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections).
SAMAGRA SOLUTION
Samagra brings you its award-winning Toilet Design and Operation Model through which we provide clean, hygienic and safe toilet access 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a

Family and friends always offered help of course, but my pride got in the way.<br/><br/>Now that I understand that help is something that is necessary and not optional in times of despair, I want others to learn that too.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago I offered a homeless man a fresh bottle of water since I had no cash and he furiously refused it saying he was hungry.People started bashing him tryna make me feel better but I stood up for him. I bumped into him last night but thought he'd a) forgotten me or b) hated me.. Instead he pointed, smiled and said I remember youuu, and started chatting with me then I remembered the plate of fries I didn't eat and offered it to him and for each thank you he said another beat in my heart skipped. <br/><br/>He isnt the first homeless person to accept my blessing, nor the first to tell me everything he wants to eat off the menu he only dreams about so <b>on December 23, im planning on raiding Jetro and BJ's for supplies and making sandwiches/food, packing hygiene kits and getting stocking stuffers for my own Midnight Run. A midnight run is when a group of volunteers travel out to homeless sheters or just random spots where homeless people usually are (ie subway, churches, parks) and give out the things listed.</b><br/><br/>Ive done it a couple times with my church and it was the funnest and greatest experience of my life, and im pleading for you guys to join me on the 23rd at around 7-8PM to get things packed.<br/><br/>The only things i ask of you guys, is that if you are interested please bring your biggest duffel bag, any kind of supplies you think would help ( i can also assign what to bring if necessary), and if you can throw some $ (any amt) to help buy food and gloves/hats that would be great.<br/><br/>If you have my number contact me through phone and let me know what youre bringing if not, a fb message always works, or just post if youre coming and what youre bringing on this page :) THANK YOU, GOD BLESS, AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS <p></p>

Family and friends always offered help of course, but my pride got in the way.Now that I understand that help is something that is necessary and not optional in times of despair, I want others to learn that too.A few weeks ago I offered a homeless man a fresh bottle of water since I had no cash and he furiously refused it saying he was hungry.People started bashing him tryna make me feel better but I stood up for him. I bumped into him last night but thought he'd a) forgotten me or b) hated me.. Instead he pointed, smiled and said I remember youuu, and started chatting with me then I remembered the plate of fries I didn't eat and offered it to him and for each thank you he said another beat in my heart skipped. He isnt the first homeless person to accept my blessing, nor the first to tell me everything he wants to eat off the menu he only dreams about so on December 23, im planning on raiding Jetro and BJ's for supplies and making sandwiches/food, packing hygiene kits and getting stocking stuffers for my own Midnight Run. A midnight run is when a group of volunteers travel out to homeless sheters or just random spots where homeless people usually are (ie subway, churches, parks) and give out the things listed.Ive done it a couple times with my church and it was the funnest and greatest experience of my life, and im pleading for you guys to join me on the 23rd at around 7-8PM to get things packed.The only things i ask of you guys, is that if you are interested please bring your biggest duffel bag, any kind of supplies you think would help ( i can also assign what to bring if necessary), and if you can throw some $ (any amt) to help buy food and gloves/hats that would be great.If you have my number contact me through phone and let me know what youre bringing if not, a fb message always works, or just post if youre coming and what youre bringing on this page :) THANK YOU, GOD BLESS, AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Mai and Naomi. Our vision for <i>The Birth Talks Presents! </i>began in Naomi's living room, one year ago. We both believe in the power of story telling and that women and girls are and can be community leaders, change-makers and healers.</p>
<p>We are both mothers with different lived experiences. This is what brought us together. Naomi's work with Branch Out Theatre came out of her love of acting, story telling and dedication to working with marginalized communities all over the world. </p>
<p>Mai's passion project, The Birth Talks Podcast, came out of her desire to tell stories of pregnancy, birth and parenting that often got left out of the mainstream. She began working on it with a laptop and recorder in her closet at home. </p>
<p>When we got together a year ago it was simply to record the first episode of The Birth Talks. We laughed and joked as both of our baby girls played on the ground and realized we had a shared desire to celebrate and showcase the stories/experiences of women and girls in our community. <br/><br/>We will work with 10 women-identified-folk from across all walks of life so they can celebrate and share their experiences of pregnancy, birth and parenting, while building community, solidarity and support with one another. Our participants will go through a facilitated training with Naomi to learn how to write and perform their experiences. Mai will produce 5 episodes so their stories are shared via podcast. </p>
<h3>More about The Birth Talks and Branch Out Theatre</h3>
<p>The Birth Talks is a 2018 Femmy award winning podcast about pregnancy, birth and parenting with an intersectional feminist twist. The podcast gives listeners the lowdown on how gender, race, sex, sexuality, class and life experiences affect pregnancy, birth and parenting. The producer and host, Mai Ngo, is a birth advocate in Ottawa who is committed to powerful stories from the lived experiences of women across diverse communities.<br/><br/>Branch Out Theatre uses popular theatre to create transformative social change for individuals and communities. Trained in New York, its artistic director Naomi Tessler has been working with communities globally for 13 years, using theatre and storytelling to inspire community building, conflict transformation and positive change. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need $4,500 for our campaign which we plan to use for launching and implementing the program.</p>
<p>We will be using workshop and performance space that is accessible and close to transit. </p>
<p>We will be renting equipment for the program that includes a projector, videographer, sound equipment, lighting and microphones.</p>
<p>We would like to produce a short video that will allow us to showcase the program.</p>
<p>We would also like to provide light refreshments, transportation, childcare and beverages for the rehearsals and performance.</p>
<p>The money raised will also go to the overall design, facilitation, and promotion of the program so that we can reach as many people as possible. </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>When we bring the stories of women and girls from the page to the stage, we can continue to grow and empower people through arts/media. We can also continue to do what we do best - that is to teach others how beautiful and important their experiences and stories are to the vibrancy of our community. We want to create an environment that is nurturing and inclusive for women-identified-folk to be a part of. We hope that you can contribute and be part of our vision.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We grew our work from word of mouth and social media. Share our video, our story or tell all your friends what we are doing at <i>The Birth Talks Presents!</i>. Use Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or whatever social media platform you use to get our story out and reach other networks. And come to the performance on JUNE 10, 2018 - 4PM LOCATION TBA!!</p>
<p>THANK YOU (all of you) for your support in our vision that women and girls across all walks of life matter. The stories of our experiences - the loss, the joy, the fears, the pain, the triumphs - is the stuff life's made of.</p>

<h3>Justice for Donald</h3>
<p></p>
<p><br/>Donald Perry is a 60 years-old loving family man. He is a compassionate 
community servant, with a generous spirit. Donald has earned the 
respect, admiration, and trust of countless community members who have 
witnessed his tireless work on behalf of poor and homeless persons in 
Hampshire County.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Donald was working full time as the coordinator for the 
single room occupancy Outreach program and kitchen manager at the local 
soup kitchen when he was pulled over and arrested in 2011. <b>The MA Parole
 Board imprisoned him for 2 years and 8 months for a crime he did not 
commit, and was acquitted of.</b><a href=""http://justicefordonald.wordpress.com/the-case/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://justicefordonald.wordpress.com/the-case/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> (Read about The Case)</a>
</p>
<p>At present, Donald is on parole for life based on his imposed 
sentence. Donald, Elaine, close family members, and friends well 
understand after this recent incident, that Donald can be picked up and 
returned to prison any moment regardless of what he does or doesn’t do. <i>Donald says 
he’ll never be FREE until he’s off parole, period.</i><br/></p>
<h4><b>The idea and much effort now is Donald going back into court on a

obtaining record's, processing evidence, etc. Donald’s supporters can mobilize
to raise funds that will ensure that he has resources for the trial, increasing
his chances of securing freedom.</p>
<p>2. Our
continued organizing will make sure that justice will be served in Donald’s
case and that our commitment to his true freedom remains active. It also
creates opportunities for us to continue to raise awareness about mass

The last one was held all the way back in 1787 by the original Constitutional Framers! (It was originally deemed that a con con should occur every 20 years by those same founders, so this is way overdue!).</li></ul><p><strong>What <i>exactly</i> does this initiative do?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Instructs the Governor of the State of California to convene a Constitutional Convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, for the purpose of devolving power from the Federal Government.</li>
<li>In particular it requests calling a constitutional convention with the express goals of:<ul>
<li>Protecting all Californians regardless of national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or race;</li>
<li>Limiting corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance and political speech;</li>
<li>Requiring women to receive equal pay for the same job as men;</li>
<li>Requiring the federal government to allocate funding to the states according to the amount each respective state paid in federal taxes;</li>
<li>Enabling states to negotiate binding agreements with other nations, sub national states, and nongovernmental organizations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. If left with no other recourse to defend California’s values, creating a clear and reasonable path for states to secede if they choose to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>What is Article V?</strong></p><ul>
<li>A working section in the USA Constitution that allows for its own amendments.</li>
<li>Amendments can be proposed by a) Congress, b) By a vote of ⅔ of House of Representatives and Senate, or c) By a Convention of the States (which is what this is), called for by ⅔ of State Legislatures, which has already happened.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How likely is it to happen?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Very. Americans of all political stripes recognize that we need big changes to fix this country and that if left with no other recourse, must be prepared to let states - like California - go our own way.</li>
<li>27 states have already supported the call for a constitutional convention and a growing number of groups have come together to advance the cause.</li>
<li>Some experts say that the constitutional requirement for a constitutional convention has ALREADY been satisfied as the US Constitution makes no mention of rescinding an application or limiting to a single subject and every state has called for a constitutional convention at some point.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Who else is calling for this?</strong></p><ul><li>Americans of all political persuasions, colors and creeds. It is a shared desire to come together to devolve power from the federal government and address individual State’s concerns about self-governance vs. Federal governance.</li></ul><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><ul><li>Because USA is big, very very big, and is filled with people who want different things to make their lives run better, and more harmoniously.  Those divergent political persuasions make one-size-fits-all national solutions impossible, as we are seeing with the increasingly erratic state of national politics.</li></ul><p><strong>Have proposals to change the Constitution ever happened before?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Yes! Approximately 11,539 measures to amend the Constitution have been proposed from 1787 to Dec 16, 2014.</li>
<li>33 amendments have been approved by Congress and sent to States for ratification: 27 of these were ratified. So yes, it happens!</li>
<li>The first 10 were proposed and ratified simultaneously: The Bill of Rights.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Does approval at the Convention mean it automatically becomes USA Law?</strong></p><ul><li>Good question! There are two stages: Once an amendment gets voted on it then needs to be ratified (confirmed) by ¾ of the Legislatures of ¾ of States of USA or through State rallying Conventions in ¾ of States of USA. Ratification means it will be adopted into the USA Constitution and becomes the binding law of the land.</li></ul><p><strong>How many votes does CA get?</strong></p><ul><li>Most experts agree that any amendment proposed at the convention should receive a double majority of states voting and a majority of delegates, similar to our current bicameral Congress.  The delegates should be allocated by population size and former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Brennan suggests that the convention have one delegate for every 50,000 people for a total of around 6420 for America as a whole and 780 delegates for California.</li></ul><p><strong>Why should CA get in on this?</strong></p><ul><li>Because it's going to happen. There will be a Constitutional Convention within a few years, with or without us. We want to be in on the conversation, to make sure California values are represented, protected and instituted.  In fact, more than that, we want California to lead and help get in front of the forces in the federal government that are holding California and every state from reaching their potential.</li></ul><p><strong>If I support this petition does that mean I'm supporting secession?</strong></p><ul><li>Not necessarily. It means you are supporting CA's right to speak up for itself and re-determine its current relationship with the rest of USA, with the Federal Government. Secession is the last step if absolutely all else fails and we cannot reach agreement. Even then it'd need a 3/4 majority vote to pass. This kind of thing happens slowly and surely.

<li>This Proposal enables individual States to take ownership of their future, should that be deemed - by them - to be better for their common success and well being.</li>
<li>It opens the doors on dialogue around quality of life and mechanisms of governing that might be way outdated!</li>
<li>CA gets to have a voice in how things are done. What that really means is that, as Californians, we get to make our own decisions about how we protect what we value, and grow more of what we love.</li>
<li>It also means we get to review how we spend our tax dollars! (i.e. will we continue to pay federal tax? How much? Would we like to increase the amount of return we get back from Federal Government taxes if we do?? Or do we think we’d prefer to manage our own money, as an Independent Nation?)</li>

</ul><p><strong>Why file an initiative that asks for a Con-Con? What’s the problem with the way things are?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Californians are already saying by a majority percent that they want to ignore Federal law on Climate Change and Immigration.</li>
<li>California’s government already filed a bill that would direct CA law enforcement officials to not work with the Federal government on enforcing American law on immigration.</li>
<li>California’s government already filed a bill that would direct CA law enforcement officials to not work with the Federal government on enforcing American law on marijuana.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Why is now a great time to take a stand?</strong></p><ul>
<li>More USA States have filed bills to call for a Con Con than ever before, just in the last two decades. So now is the time; there is so much support to do this.</li>
<li>CA recently (2014) filed a bill to call for a Con Con. This is a ‘reminder’ request and effort to catalyze actually calling a constitutional convention by showing “we the people” demand it.  Now is the time.</li>
<li>You saw the last election! Californians are upset. They are fighting against Federal laws that oppose their peaceful, life affirming, values. For the first time in 2 centuries liberal Californians are talking about State rights against Federal intrusion - rallying, marching and almost rioting to show their disgust for life-negating values being enforced by Federal government; something needs to be done. Californians have the heart of a bear, and the power of our forests, mountains and lakes. We know how to fight for what we love.</li>
<li>The concern and incompatibility of differing values has been building up over years; not just since November 2016. Different values need different rules of conduct and different laws to protect them.</li>
<li>This means that for the first time ever in the history of America, CA is sharing “some of the concerns” that - previously - only recognisably conservative States of America have talked about; such as overreach of Federal authority, and a run-away Federal budget.</li>
<li>The States that are interested in calling for a Con Con have already shown a willingness for liberals and conservatives to work side by side to find a new Status Quo. With this current spirit of Con Con, it is highly likely CA could work with America’s conservative States. Now that’s a first!</li>
</ul><p><strong>What are the specific details that California is asking for in the Constitutional Convention?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Limit corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance, political speech and legal loopholes for unethical behaviour commensurate with a ‘too big to fail’ monopoly, and further declare that money does not constitute speech and may be legislatively limited;  </li>
<li>Create a clear and reasonable path for a state to follow its own laws on specific policies instead of Federal laws;</li>
<li>Create a clear and reasonable path for a state to secede if they should choose to do so;</li>
<li>Demand that greenhouse gas levels linked to Climate Change are reduced to 1990 levels by 2035, in accordance with Global Goals (as per Paris Agreement);</li>
<li>Demand that women receive equal pay for the same job;</li>
<li>Call for a balanced budget every year;</li>
<li>Demand protection and respect of LGBTQ rights;</li>
<li>Protect vulnerable peoples.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why is this good for California, specifically?</strong></p><ul>
<li>California has a tradition of acting like a separate nation from America with values that are not shared with America, such as opposing American invasions in Vietnam and Iraq, protecting Undocumented Immigrants, allowing LGBTQ people the ability to feel safe on University campuses, along with working to mitigate Climate Change, legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana, recognizing the Genocide of Armenian peoples by Turkey, and banning cruel treatment of animals by banning certain practices, such as the preparation of the dish Foie Gras, to name a few examples.</li>
<li>This independence trend has only increased in intensity - if you consider the following recent examples, where California has wanted to;<ul>
<li>Collaborate internationally to reduce Climate Crisis, pursue Stem Cell Research, reject Common Core Education tests when they were pushed by the Federal government under America’s leader George W Bush. We have had to comply, against our better judgment and against scientific facts.</li>
<li>Legalize Marijuana under America’s leader Barack Obama. We were unable to do anything but State legalization and protection.</li>
<li>Give immigrants much-needed security, rather than behave in a hostile manner towards them. In that spirit, we also do not see the value in creating a wall across the Southern border with Mexico. And yet, America's current administration, under Donald Trump’s leadership, is directing America to do these things. We do not wish to be a series of Sanctuary Cities but, rather, a Sanctuary State, or Nation.</li>
<li>Protect the Environment, rather than collude in exacerbating Climate Crisis. This contrasts with the new political regime in America.</li>
<li>Protect women’s health and professional rights, as well as all people’s rights to love and marry whomever they want, in contrast to the new political regime in America.</li>
<li>Improve the political process, with increased transparency and more ease of public involvement in decision making, in contrast to the new political regime in America.</li>
<li>This trend of California “butting heads” with the American Federal government will continue – so California recognizes the need to limit the power that the Federal Government currently has to interfere with its smooth running. Being a separate Nation protects our values and our assets, and may be a necessary step, which is why this Constitutional convention is important because it will give California a clear path to this ultimate “backup plan”. However, the Constitutional Convention will also give California a less radical solution, which is allowing California to be able to not follow certain Federal laws that are directly in contradiction with California values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Do this mean conservative States of USA can change the constitution in a way that is out of line with CA values?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Yes. That is democracy. If California wishes to ensure its own values, it has to allow America to make its own choices, as its citizens see fit. However, California is also going to ask for a path where CA can legitimately disregard Federal law on selected issues so that, even if conservatives change the constitution in a way CA does not like, CA can disregard that law, thus protecting itself from the worst of the legal changes.  And, if no other path exists to protect California values, we will create a reasonable path to secession so California can go its own way, in peace.</li>
<li>Yes, a Constitutional Convention opens up the ability for conservatives to remake America in their image, however CA by participating in the Constitutional Convention, can mitigate and limit the negative impact of policies that could repeal social progress in America. If the Con Con happens without us (and it will happen with, or without, us), we will have NO SAY in what happens next and progressive values become even more vulnerable. California’s participation in a Constitutional Convention is our window of opportunity to protect at least some of America’s land, people and values from the American political threat. If we ultimately secede, then we stood up for the values that some of our liberal brothers and sisters hold, in other parts of USA, on their behalf - at a time when it matters most, and when we could. Count on California pushing for the American law to back up CA values at the Con-Con.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How does this help Calexit? Or does it?</strong></p><ul>
<li>The number one complaint against the Calexit secession movement is that the rest of America will have to approve CA secession, and that it isn’t just as simple as Californians agree to leave America. California, by calling for a Constitutional Convention, directly addresses this critique.</li>
<li>The Calexit movement has always dealt with the image that it is a bunch of “California dreamers” who do not actually understand the way that government works. By filing an initiative of this detail and with this kind of reach, through two governments, we are demonstrating that when dreamers ACT they become ACTIVISTS. We could not do this successfully without a detailed knowledge of the law. By following due process we demonstrate that Californians are intelligent, socially innovative visionaries, not just dreamers. Knowledge is power.</li>
<li>By filing an initiative in California that is designed to attract the support of conservative states of America, we increase the likelihood of the initiative's success.  When conservative American states support this initiative, which indirectly creates a pathway for secession, it will be the first time that a majority of America have talked positively, in any capacity, about the idea of CA being able to leave America. This answers the other critique of the Calexit movement - that America will never allow CA to leave.</li>
<li>Having conservative states support a California initiative also means that this initiative will stay in the news longer - because it will likely be discussed by newspapers in 30 different states outside of CA. This can drastically increase Californians' support of this initiative, seeing USA support the call for a Convention. This only increases the potential for a Constitutional Convention to happen.</li>
<li>Having American people talk about the idea of CA secession positively, and having the news say that CA is actually doing the correct thing in order to actually leave America – raises the profile of the Calexit idea to levels it has never seen before. This higher profile of respect will bring many new Californians to support a possible path to Calexit who never supported the idea of CA leaving America under any conditions before - because they will believe it could actually happen and is not any longer just a “dream” i.e. It has become reasonable.</li>
<li>While ⅓ of CA supported Calexit in polls over a solid three month period a majority of Californians never came around to supporting secession. However, at the same time as polling about a Calexit was done, other polls asked Californians if they would want to ignore Federal law on immigration and Climate change and ⅔  of Californians said yes. Ignoring the Federal government’s laws is secession but because that word was not used a majority of Californians supported acts that were secessionist in nature. What this shows is that the word secession is very strong, and with this word removed, or put to the background of an idea, a majority of Californians are willing to support the act of being an independent California nation. This initiative is designed to reach out to those Californians who like the activities included in secession but not the word.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why will this succeed?</strong></p><ul>
<li>More states of the American Federal government have said they support a Con Con than at any time before in the last couple decades.</li>
<li>California is a huge “state” and it is very liberal – so when it comes to the support of a Con Con, newspapers in general will cover this initiative because it is very strange that liberal California would support something that American states that believe in conservative values are talking about.   </li>
<li>News in the nearly 30 states of America that already support a con con – will also talk about this CA initiative because it makes what they want more likely to happen – because large California is now supporting the cause.</li>
<li>The CA initiative is worded in a way to say to conservatives states that CA is not going to fully stop you from doing what you want – we just want to be able to secure what we want – this will encourage conservative states to support CA – which will get news in conservative states to talk well about this CA initiative.</li>
<li>This combined news coverage will mean a lot of news about this initiative is generated - all of that news coverage will make a lot of Californians excited and they will believe – this could happen. When Californians believe a big idea could actually happen, they come and support that idea.</li>

If 34 state legislatures actually were to formally agree on a Convention call, it would be the first time in history. When we reflect on the magnitude of such an accomplishment—all the coalitions formed in each state and across the country, the massive increase in public awareness of the crisis that would result, and the effect of all this on public opinion and voting behavior—we see that the well-intentioned concerns of those fearing a runaway convention miss the mark. They miss the effect on the U.S. Congress, the Executive Branch, and the U.S. Supreme Court of such an unprecedented popular movement. Faced with an historic uprising by We The People, unscrupulous delegates and/or Congress would be unable to pull strings from behind closed doors without exciting a national uproar.”</p><p><strong>Can red states and blue states actually collaborate, with our conflicts of interests?

""California Constitutional Convention Initiative"" - FAQ'sTHE FACTS:Who can I contact if I have questions, or want an interview? marcus.ruiz.evans@gmail.com What is this initiative called?California Constitutional Convention Initiative!What??California calls for a Constitutional Convention or ""Cal Con Con"" ... for short.What is a Con Con?It’s a media friendly name for Constitutional Convention.What does this initiative do?Asks for a Constitutional Convention. The last one was held all the way back in 1787 by the original Constitutional Framers! (It was originally deemed that a con con should occur every 20 years by those same founders, so this is way overdue!).What exactly does this initiative do?
Instructs the Governor of the State of California to convene a Constitutional Convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, for the purpose of devolving power from the Federal Government.
In particular it requests calling a constitutional convention with the express goals of:
Protecting all Californians regardless of national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or race;
Limiting corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance and political speech;
Requiring women to receive equal pay for the same job as men;
Requiring the federal government to allocate funding to the states according to the amount each respective state paid in federal taxes;
Enabling states to negotiate binding agreements with other nations, sub national states, and nongovernmental organizations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. If left with no other recourse to defend California’s values, creating a clear and reasonable path for states to secede if they choose to do so.


What is Article V?
A working section in the USA Constitution that allows for its own amendments.
Amendments can be proposed by a) Congress, b) By a vote of ⅔ of House of Representatives and Senate, or c) By a Convention of the States (which is what this is), called for by ⅔ of State Legislatures, which has already happened.
How likely is it to happen?
Very. Americans of all political stripes recognize that we need big changes to fix this country and that if left with no other recourse, must be prepared to let states - like California - go our own way.
27 states have already supported the call for a constitutional convention and a growing number of groups have come together to advance the cause.
Some experts say that the constitutional requirement for a constitutional convention has ALREADY been satisfied as the US Constitution makes no mention of rescinding an application or limiting to a single subject and every state has called for a constitutional convention at some point.
Who else is calling for this?Americans of all political persuasions, colors and creeds. It is a shared desire to come together to devolve power from the federal government and address individual State’s concerns about self-governance vs. Federal governance.Why?Because USA is big, very very big, and is filled with people who want different things to make their lives run better, and more harmoniously.  Those divergent political persuasions make one-size-fits-all national solutions impossible, as we are seeing with the increasingly erratic state of national politics.Have proposals to change the Constitution ever happened before?
Yes! Approximately 11,539 measures to amend the Constitution have been proposed from 1787 to Dec 16, 2014.
33 amendments have been approved by Congress and sent to States for ratification: 27 of these were ratified. So yes, it happens!
The first 10 were proposed and ratified simultaneously: The Bill of Rights.
Does approval at the Convention mean it automatically becomes USA Law?Good question! There are two stages: Once an amendment gets voted on it then needs to be ratified (confirmed) by ¾ of the Legislatures of ¾ of States of USA or through State rallying Conventions in ¾ of States of USA. Ratification means it will be adopted into the USA Constitution and becomes the binding law of the land.How many votes does CA get?Most experts agree that any amendment proposed at the convention should receive a double majority of states voting and a majority of delegates, similar to our current bicameral Congress.  The delegates should be allocated by population size and former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Brennan suggests that the convention have one delegate for every 50,000 people for a total of around 6420 for America as a whole and 780 delegates for California.Why should CA get in on this?Because it's going to happen. There will be a Constitutional Convention within a few years, with or without us. We want to be in on the conversation, to make sure California values are represented, protected and instituted.  In fact, more than that, we want California to lead and help get in front of the forces in the federal government that are holding California and every state from reaching their potential.If I support this petition does that mean I'm supporting secession?Not necessarily. It means you are supporting CA's right to speak up for itself and re-determine its current relationship with the rest of USA, with the Federal Government. Secession is the last step if absolutely all else fails and we cannot reach agreement. Even then it'd need a 3/4 majority vote to pass. This kind of thing happens slowly and surely. If CA can have a healthy and equitable relationship with Fed Gov that protects the things we love, then why leave? This is a chance to improve California’s relationship with the federal government.How would CA benefit from devolving power from Federal Government?
This Proposal enables individual States to take ownership of their future, should that be deemed - by them - to be better for their common success and well being.
It opens the doors on dialogue around quality of life and mechanisms of governing that might be way outdated!
CA gets to have a voice in how things are done. What that really means is that, as Californians, we get to make our own decisions about how we protect what we value, and grow more of what we love.
It also means we get to review how we spend our tax dollars! (i.e. will we continue to pay federal tax? How much? Would we like to increase the amount of return we get back from Federal Government taxes if we do?? Or do we think we’d prefer to manage our own money, as an Independent Nation?)
We can focus on self-management to do the following:
Improve our infrastructure,
Research innovations,
Protect our planet and environment,
Meet climate change head on,
Protect our hard won civil liberties,
Promote women’s success in workplace and increase women, minority and diversity leadership positions and presence,
Protect people’s rights to choose who they love and how they live,
Increase our ability to help immigrants settle into a secure lifestyle,
Subsidise education and health for all - and that’s just off the top of our heads!


What would you like to see happen in a healthy, unobstructed CA, if we were serving only one leadership… our own?
Why file an initiative that asks for a Con-Con? What’s the problem with the way things are?
Californians are already saying by a majority percent that they want to ignore Federal law on Climate Change and Immigration.
California’s government already filed a bill that would direct CA law enforcement officials to not work with the Federal government on enforcing American law on immigration.
California’s government already filed a bill that would direct CA law enforcement officials to not work with the Federal government on enforcing American law on marijuana.
Californians have some of the most active protests against the current Federal government.
Which leads a logical Californian to know that things aren’t working and that having a state actively work against enforcing the American government’s law is hazardous.
So California needs a way to allow it to be able to follow its own policies instead of Federal ones - but in a way that is clearly recognized by everyone.
California already did this with Clean air, Environmental, and Insurance regulations where Federal law has allowed California for decades to have its own standards – this was a neat and orderly way for California to follow different policies than those the Federal government assigned - that did not end up creating a sense of anarchy.
Why is now a great time to take a stand?
More USA States have filed bills to call for a Con Con than ever before, just in the last two decades. So now is the time; there is so much support to do this.
CA recently (2014) filed a bill to call for a Con Con. This is a ‘reminder’ request and effort to catalyze actually calling a constitutional convention by showing “we the people” demand it.  Now is the time.
You saw the last election! Californians are upset. They are fighting against Federal laws that oppose their peaceful, life affirming, values. For the first time in 2 centuries liberal Californians are talking about State rights against Federal intrusion - rallying, marching and almost rioting to show their disgust for life-negating values being enforced by Federal government; something needs to be done. Californians have the heart of a bear, and the power of our forests, mountains and lakes. We know how to fight for what we love.
The concern and incompatibility of differing values has been building up over years; not just since November 2016. Different values need different rules of conduct and different laws to protect them.
This means that for the first time ever in the history of America, CA is sharing “some of the concerns” that - previously - only recognisably conservative States of America have talked about; such as overreach of Federal authority, and a run-away Federal budget.
The States that are interested in calling for a Con Con have already shown a willingness for liberals and conservatives to work side by side to find a new Status Quo. With this current spirit of Con Con, it is highly likely CA could work with America’s conservative States. Now that’s a first!
What are the specific details that California is asking for in the Constitutional Convention?
Limit corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance, political speech and legal loopholes for unethical behaviour commensurate with a ‘too big to fail’ monopoly, and further declare that money does not constitute speech and may be legislatively limited;  
Create a clear and reasonable path for a state to follow its own laws on specific policies instead of Federal laws;
Create a clear and reasonable path for a state to secede if they should choose to do so;
Demand that greenhouse gas levels linked to Climate Change are reduced to 1990 levels by 2035, in accordance with Global Goals (as per Paris Agreement);
Demand that women receive equal pay for the same job;
Call for a balanced budget every year;
Demand protection and respect of LGBTQ rights;
Protect vulnerable peoples.
Why is this good for California, specifically?
California has a tradition of acting like a separate nation from America with values that are not shared with America, such as opposing American invasions in Vietnam and Iraq, protecting Undocumented Immigrants, allowing LGBTQ people the ability to feel safe on University campuses, along with working to mitigate Climate Change, legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana, recognizing the Genocide of Armenian peoples by Turkey, and banning cruel treatment of animals by banning certain practices, such as the preparation of the dish Foie Gras, to name a few examples.
This independence trend has only increased in intensity - if you consider the following recent examples, where California has wanted to;
Collaborate internationally to reduce Climate Crisis, pursue Stem Cell Research, reject Common Core Education tests when they were pushed by the Federal government under America’s leader George W Bush. We have had to comply, against our better judgment and against scientific facts.
Legalize Marijuana under America’s leader Barack Obama. We were unable to do anything but State legalization and protection.
Give immigrants much-needed security, rather than behave in a hostile manner towards them. In that spirit, we also do not see the value in creating a wall across the Southern border with Mexico. And yet, America's current administration, under Donald Trump’s leadership, is directing America to do these things. We do not wish to be a series of Sanctuary Cities but, rather, a Sanctuary State, or Nation.
Protect the Environment, rather than collude in exacerbating Climate Crisis. This contrasts with the new political regime in America.
Protect women’s health and professional rights, as well as all people’s rights to love and marry whomever they want, in contrast to the new political regime in America.
Improve the political process, with increased transparency and more ease of public involvement in decision making, in contrast to the new political regime in America.
This trend of California “butting heads” with the American Federal government will continue – so California recognizes the need to limit the power that the Federal Government currently has to interfere with its smooth running. Being a separate Nation protects our values and our assets, and may be a necessary step, which is why this Constitutional convention is important because it will give California a clear path to this ultimate “backup plan”. However, the Constitutional Convention will also give California a less radical solution, which is allowing California to be able to not follow certain Federal laws that are directly in contradiction with California values.


Do this mean conservative States of USA can change the constitution in a way that is out of line with CA values?
Yes. That is democracy. If California wishes to ensure its own values, it has to allow America to make its own choices, as its citizens see fit. However, California is also going to ask for a path where CA can legitimately disregard Federal law on selected issues so that, even if conservatives change the constitution in a way CA does not like, CA can disregard that law, thus protecting itself from the worst of the legal changes.  And, if no other path exists to protect California values, we will create a reasonable path to secession so California can go its own way, in peace.
Yes, a Constitutional Convention opens up the ability for conservatives to remake America in their image, however CA by participating in the Constitutional Convention, can mitigate and limit the negative impact of policies that could repeal social progress in America. If the Con Con happens without us (and it will happen with, or without, us), we will have NO SAY in what happens next and progressive values become even more vulnerable. California’s participation in a Constitutional Convention is our window of opportunity to protect at least some of America’s land, people and values from the American political threat. If we ultimately secede, then we stood up for the values that some of our liberal brothers and sisters hold, in other parts of USA, on their behalf - at a time when it matters most, and when we could. Count on California pushing for the American law to back up CA values at the Con-Con.
How does this help Calexit? Or does it?
The number one complaint against the Calexit secession movement is that the rest of America will have to approve CA secession, and that it isn’t just as simple as Californians agree to leave America. California, by calling for a Constitutional Convention, directly addresses this critique.
The Calexit movement has always dealt with the image that it is a bunch of “California dreamers” who do not actually understand the way that government works. By filing an initiative of this detail and with this kind of reach, through two governments, we are demonstrating that when dreamers ACT they become ACTIVISTS. We could not do this successfully without a detailed knowledge of the law. By following due process we demonstrate that Californians are intelligent, socially innovative visionaries, not just dreamers. Knowledge is power.
By filing an initiative in California that is designed to attract the support of conservative states of America, we increase the likelihood of the initiative's success.  When conservative American states support this initiative, which indirectly creates a pathway for secession, it will be the first time that a majority of America have talked positively, in any capacity, about the idea of CA being able to leave America. This answers the other critique of the Calexit movement - that America will never allow CA to leave.
Having conservative states support a California initiative also means that this initiative will stay in the news longer - because it will likely be discussed by newspapers in 30 different states outside of CA. This can drastically increase Californians' support of this initiative, seeing USA support the call for a Convention. This only increases the potential for a Constitutional Convention to happen.
Having American people talk about the idea of CA secession positively, and having the news say that CA is actually doing the correct thing in order to actually leave America – raises the profile of the Calexit idea to levels it has never seen before. This higher profile of respect will bring many new Californians to support a possible path to Calexit who never supported the idea of CA leaving America under any conditions before - because they will believe it could actually happen and is not any longer just a “dream” i.e. It has become reasonable.
While ⅓ of CA supported Calexit in polls over a solid three month period a majority of Californians never came around to supporting secession. However, at the same time as polling about a Calexit was done, other polls asked Californians if they would want to ignore Federal law on immigration and Climate change and ⅔  of Californians said yes. Ignoring the Federal government’s laws is secession but because that word was not used a majority of Californians supported acts that were secessionist in nature. What this shows is that the word secession is very strong, and with this word removed, or put to the background of an idea, a majority of Californians are willing to support the act of being an independent California nation. This initiative is designed to reach out to those Californians who like the activities included in secession but not the word.
Why will this succeed?
More states of the American Federal government have said they support a Con Con than at any time before in the last couple decades.
California is a huge “state” and it is very liberal – so when it comes to the support of a Con Con, newspapers in general will cover this initiative because it is very strange that liberal California would support something that American states that believe in conservative values are talking about.   
News in the nearly 30 states of America that already support a con con – will also talk about this CA initiative because it makes what they want more likely to happen – because large California is now supporting the cause.
The CA initiative is worded in a way to say to conservatives states that CA is not going to fully stop you from doing what you want – we just want to be able to secure what we want – this will encourage conservative states to support CA – which will get news in conservative states to talk well about this CA initiative.
This combined news coverage will mean a lot of news about this initiative is generated - all of that news coverage will make a lot of Californians excited and they will believe – this could happen. When Californians believe a big idea could actually happen, they come and support that idea.

Indiana
Louisiana
Michigan
Missouri
Nebraska
Nevada
New Hampshire

Close calls:
Delaware filed a resolution for a Con Con after 1990, but rescinded their application in 2016.
Kansas almost passed a resolution calling for a Con Con in 2016.
Arkansas almost passed a resolution calling for a Con Con in 2017.
Iowa almost passed a resolution calling for a Con Con in 2017.
Kentucky is considering a resolution, currently.
How many more American states need to call for a Con Con for it to actually occur?7 American states, plus the 27 that have submitted paperwork to enact a Con Con would equal the 34 America states needed to call for a Con Con.What were the main things American states demanded at a Con Con?
Fiscally restrained spending by Federal government
That the Federal government have to pass a balanced budget
Repeal Corporations are persons
Has California called for a Con Con before?California has called for a Con Con many times before in the last century -- to deal with a variety of issues:
Demanding the direct election of senators 1911
Demanding the ability to tax government securities 1935
Demanding modified labor laws 1935
Asking for America to create a world government 1949
Demanding the ability to tax vehicles to pay for highways 1952
Demanding that corporations are not legally described as people 2014

What is the difference between the California attempt to call for a Con Con in 2014, and this version?The California bill to call for a Constitutional Convention previously was limited to only looking at overturning the American Court ruling that corporations are people. This attempt includes that language and asks for more things to be defined at the convention.Is a Constitutional Convention likely to turn into a ‘runaway” event, where the convention passes laws that no one who called for a Con Con –ever thought of?Extremely unlikely - consider this commentary from Forbes magazine, 2016:“This is a reasonable fear, but here’s why there is no cause for worry: Consider where the logic leads from the correct “long-shot” description of the Convention of States. If 34 state legislatures actually were to formally agree on a Convention call, it would be the first time in history. When we reflect on the magnitude of such an accomplishment—all the coalitions formed in each state and across the country, the massive increase in public awareness of the crisis that would result, and the effect of all this on public opinion and voting behavior—we see that the well-intentioned concerns of those fearing a runaway convention miss the mark. They miss the effect on the U.S. Congress, the Executive Branch, and the U.S. Supreme Court of such an unprecedented popular movement. Faced with an historic uprising by We The People, unscrupulous delegates and/or Congress would be unable to pull strings from behind closed doors without exciting a national uproar.”Can red states and blue states actually collaborate, with our conflicts of interests? If Cal Con Con is asking California to work with red states - who propose to modify the Constitution in ways that absolutely oppose progressive values - why support that? Wouldn't that make their goals more possible? Isn't there a conflict of interests here?Given that California's government is already having less connections with the red states, such as Californians version of the Travel ban preventing government officials from CA from traveling to American red states, we are already standing in 'different camps'.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We provide community resources, educational workshops, a HiveMind Community digital mental health social network and Blog, a multimedia library, and a meeting and workspace or those who identify as Lifestyle, KGLBTIAQ, or are survivors of trauma and seek a space of tolerance and acceptance. We are currently pursuing Non-for-Profit Status and a Center Location in Tampa, Florida. We estimate that our center will open the Summer/Fall of 2018.</p><p>The Primary Mission of Sanctuary Center is to provide a safe meeting space, advocacy, and resources for the KLGBTIAQ, survivors of trauma, those who identify as Lifestyle, and cultural and relationship minorities. Through education, community resource collaboration, and advocacy we are committed to supporting and developing resources and tools for these communities.</p><p>Our hope is to make the next generation far more ethical than those before, empower individuals and to provide help to those who cannot help themselves.</p><p>We believe Kinkphobia kills people. Our hope is to move society past tolerance into acceptance of consensual sexuality and intimate relationships outsiders as a healthy, integral part of the being existence.We support people in finding the type and amount of sexual pleasure that is right for them, respecting the spectrum from asexual to omnisexual.  We aim to create a better world by promoting respectful interaction through consent and safety education.</p><p>We believe that access to affordable mental health, healthcare education, and healthcare options are necessary and important for all humans, We hope to teach professionals about trauma-sensitive care and how to best serve this and our other communities. Our desire is to find and develop affordable treatment options and resources for those who struggle with access to healthcare, especially mental health care, and work towards removing the stigma of mental health and mental health challenges.</p><p>We believe that intimate partner violence is an epidemic and our culture does not serve “special populations” areas of the community especially men, teens, and the KGLBTIAQ communities.

My name is Dr. Patsy Evans a.k.a. Dr. Harmony (drharmony.net) and I am the owner of HarmonyUs Inc. (http://harmonyusinc.net). HarmonyUs Inc. is a life transition center that has been serving the Tampabay Community and global market since 2010. We provide mental health, coaching, and other health-related services. After spending a number of years identifying the holes in the community resources that service the KLGBTIAQ communities, a group of professionals and volunteers have developed the Sanctuary Center. Dr. HarmonyDr. Harmony, our fearless leader,  is one of the country's leading Mental Health Counselors, trauma specialists, and Clinical Sexologists. She is also a popular resource for documentarians, authors, and the press. Being involved in this project, she adds tremendous value to the future our Sanctuary Center and making sure that our community is taken care of.Our MissionThe Sanctuary Center is a Membership-Based Community Center designed as a trauma-sensitive “safe space”. We provide community resources, educational workshops, a HiveMind Community digital mental health social network and Blog, a multimedia library, and a meeting and workspace or those who identify as Lifestyle, KGLBTIAQ, or are survivors of trauma and seek a space of tolerance and acceptance. We are currently pursuing Non-for-Profit Status and a Center Location in Tampa, Florida. We estimate that our center will open the Summer/Fall of 2018.The Primary Mission of Sanctuary Center is to provide a safe meeting space, advocacy, and resources for the KLGBTIAQ, survivors of trauma, those who identify as Lifestyle, and cultural and relationship minorities. Through education, community resource collaboration, and advocacy we are committed to supporting and developing resources and tools for these communities.Our hope is to make the next generation far more ethical than those before, empower individuals and to provide help to those who cannot help themselves.We believe Kinkphobia kills people. Our hope is to move society past tolerance into acceptance of consensual sexuality and intimate relationships outsiders as a healthy, integral part of the being existence.We support people in finding the type and amount of sexual pleasure that is right for them, respecting the spectrum from asexual to omnisexual.  We aim to create a better world by promoting respectful interaction through consent and safety education.We believe that access to affordable mental health, healthcare education, and healthcare options are necessary and important for all humans, We hope to teach professionals about trauma-sensitive care and how to best serve this and our other communities. Our desire is to find and develop affordable treatment options and resources for those who struggle with access to healthcare, especially mental health care, and work towards removing the stigma of mental health and mental health challenges.We believe that intimate partner violence is an epidemic and our culture does not serve “special populations” areas of the community especially men, teens, and the KGLBTIAQ communities. We advocate for the restructuring of the family court system in order to reduce the use of the legal system to continue the chain of violence and abuse.We believe the emotional abuse is as significant and life-threatening as physical abuse and desire to raise awareness and reform the court system to better recognizing, reforming, and punishing these abusers.

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>Twitter Brought friends together, friends who had either experienced or seen poverty first hand to discuss about the situation in Yemen, the most impoverished country in the Middle East with 90% of their food being imported.<br/><br/>With a single intent and single goal, and idea was born. An idea to somehow go around the current Blockade on Yemen and help people who are displaced by war.</p>
<p>In 2015 we started the #20foryemen campaign on Twitter and later on <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/humanitarian-emergency-fund-for-yemen-20foryemen/x/11256427#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a> which rasied over $3000. We fullfilled our goal even and distributed every single supply we bought from the raised money.</p>
<p>In 2016 we started another campaign, this time which gained over £20.000.</p>
<p>This year we are starting a new campaign - helping 1000 families around Yemen - with your help. Dont forget to visit our website <a href=""https://www.monareliefye.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.monareliefye.org</a> to see our previous projects.</p>

<p>America is a great place. There are always some things that could be better, but it’s undoubtedly a great place. Yet here we have this fella Trump saying it’s broken, and his prescription for making it great is to go back in time.</p>
<p>The policies he is espousing would take us back centuries.</p>
<p>America is a nation of immigrants founded by people who fled religious persecution. If Trump wants to curtail immigration and limit religious freedom then he’s looking to unmake the country from its very foundation. We don't mean to slight to our friends in the United Kingdom with this message, we're simply noting how far back in time Trump is trying to drag the country.</p>
<p>So we’re doing something about it: selling ironic Trump hats. By wearing a Make America Great Britain Again hat, you’re not just making a statement that you think Trump is epically regressive, but you’re also actively supporting three organisations who are doing the hard work to make America a more diverse, safe, inclusive and pluralistic. </p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p><span>From his grand entrance gliding down the golden escalator to launch his campaign of vitriol, Donald Trump has been particularly successful in insulting his way through much of the American population; POWs, minority groups, muslim-americans, and the LGBTQ communities are only the beginning of the list. We wish we could be equally comprehensive in our support, but unfortunately, he has just insulted too many people.</span></p>#MAGBA has decided to support three excellent organisations in response to three of his most high-profile rants. </div><div><ol>
<li>
<span>We were first inspired by the rant that started it all, or Donald Trump’s Presidential Election speech (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jaz1J0s-cL4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> if you need a reminder).

</div></div>","Overview
America is a great place. There are always some things that could be better, but it’s undoubtedly a great place. Yet here we have this fella Trump saying it’s broken, and his prescription for making it great is to go back in time.
The policies he is espousing would take us back centuries.
America is a nation of immigrants founded by people who fled religious persecution. If Trump wants to curtail immigration and limit religious freedom then he’s looking to unmake the country from its very foundation. We don't mean to slight to our friends in the United Kingdom with this message, we're simply noting how far back in time Trump is trying to drag the country.
So we’re doing something about it: selling ironic Trump hats. By wearing a Make America Great Britain Again hat, you’re not just making a statement that you think Trump is epically regressive, but you’re also actively supporting three organisations who are doing the hard work to make America a more diverse, safe, inclusive and pluralistic. 



Causes
 
From his grand entrance gliding down the golden escalator to launch his campaign of vitriol, Donald Trump has been particularly successful in insulting his way through much of the American population; POWs, minority groups, muslim-americans, and the LGBTQ communities are only the beginning of the list. We wish we could be equally comprehensive in our support, but unfortunately, he has just insulted too many people.#MAGBA has decided to support three excellent organisations in response to three of his most high-profile rants. 

We were first inspired by the rant that started it all, or Donald Trump’s Presidential Election speech (here if you need a reminder). In support of the Latino community, we have selected to support La Raza, America's largest Latino advocacy organization to further their support of progressive immigration reform.

A series of rants that left us bleeding from our ears, and Trump from his wherever, (some highlights here), have inspired us to support one of the women’s health organizations Trump wants to defund, Planned Parenthood.
Calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” this Trump jem gives us no choice but to support the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR to further their mission to counter the misrepresentations of Islam. 
  About the Hats 
Our prototype hats are made in China and embroidered locally. In order to keep the costs down and donations to a maximum, we will be making the rest of the hats like this too.We won’t know the exact cost of each hat, and thus how much goes to the donations, until we have a total order number. The samples were $6, but the more we order they cheaper they get. Perks!
$5: Virtual Pat On The BackWowsa, you get that every little bit counts even if you couldn’t get yourself a hat. Way to be!
$10: Virtual High fiveWay to go! You didn’t quite get an epic hat, BUT, you gave money to some awesome organizations and for that you get a virtual high five.
$20: ONE. Awesome. Hat.Go you! You just got yourself an epic hat AND donated to three awesome organizations. Way to counteract all this endless verbal poison!
$50: TWO. Awesome. Hats.Yes, you’re reading that correctly. Not only do you get TWO awesome hats, you gave a little extra to three fantastic organizations!
$100: THREE. Awesome Hats.Whoa there! You got yourself THREE awesome hats, AND gave so much extra to these great organizations. Way to do your part in dealing Trump more than just electoral defeat.

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>The synthesis of music and photography came early, it all started at age 14 when I was at a rock and roll concert in a small, intimate theater in New Jersey. At the concert, older friends were photographing this cool English rock band 'The Kink's', and I found myself becoming fascinated by their little black machines with the tiny white numbers, the next day I followed them into the darkroom and that very afternoon I decided to become a photographer. I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from The School of Visual Arts and a Associate of Science Degree from Endicott College. I moved to Europe where I began my career in fashion photography. During the last twenty years my fashion and celebrity photographs have appeared in numerous international magazines, represented by galleries and private collectors, as well as shown in international photography exhibitions. </p>
<p>In 2015 I spearheaded a Indiegogo fundraiser for 'Breakthrough', a human rights organization in India, which works to make violence against girls and women unacceptable. Our goal was $10,000.00 and we raised $12,000.00 during our 60 day campaign on Indiegogo, it was a great success!</p>
</div><p>In 1990 I moved to Europe on my own and traveled around by train exploring as much as I could afford. My camera was my steady companion photographing strangers on the streets of European villages and wandering the large unknown cities.

The synthesis of music and photography came early, it all started at age 14 when I was at a rock and roll concert in a small, intimate theater in New Jersey. At the concert, older friends were photographing this cool English rock band 'The Kink's', and I found myself becoming fascinated by their little black machines with the tiny white numbers, the next day I followed them into the darkroom and that very afternoon I decided to become a photographer. I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from The School of Visual Arts and a Associate of Science Degree from Endicott College. I moved to Europe where I began my career in fashion photography. During the last twenty years my fashion and celebrity photographs have appeared in numerous international magazines, represented by galleries and private collectors, as well as shown in international photography exhibitions. 
In 2015 I spearheaded a Indiegogo fundraiser for 'Breakthrough', a human rights organization in India, which works to make violence against girls and women unacceptable. Our goal was $10,000.00 and we raised $12,000.00 during our 60 day campaign on Indiegogo, it was a great success!
In 1990 I moved to Europe on my own and traveled around by train exploring as much as I could afford. My camera was my steady companion photographing strangers on the streets of European villages and wandering the large unknown cities. In recollection it was a mix of inspiration, excitement and loneliness, loneliness until I heard music and music that I knew, wafting from cars, bars and houses and suddenly I didn't feel alone, I felt someone knew me, and I knew them, music and photography became my companions. With these memories a fundraiser is born.MUSIC HEALS, MUSIC EQUALIZES, MUSIC BUILDS!                             Stephanie Pfriender StylanderPERKS = GIFTS = FOR YOUThis print collection is designed exclusively for the METAdrasi organization, each print is signed in a limited edition.

You may have passed a victim in the streets, on your way to work. Someone you know may have been trafficked. The following story is real. We have left out information in order to protect the identities of the victims and to avoid interfering with the prosecution of this particular case. </p>
<p>What we CAN tell you is heartbreaking.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>Details:</strong></h3>
<p>The victims involved in this case were hard working Central Americans who wanted to provide a better life for their families. They were extorted by ""recruiters"" who promised to get them into the United States for lawful employment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The traffickers required large sums of money for various fees related to obtaining their work visas.</li>
<li>Once the exorbitant fees had been paid, the victims were told that their applications were lost, and the fees would need to be paid again.</li>
<li>Once at the airport, the traffickers said that the airlines would not honor their tickets, and so the victims were forced to scrounge additional funds to buy a second set of tickets.</li>
<li><strong>Many of the victims had to mortgage their homes in order to cover these required costs.</strong></li>
</ul><p>After finally arriving in the United States, the victims were immediately put to work without being allowed to eat or rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their living conditions were deplorable. As many as twelve victims were crammed into a single trailer. These trailers did not have working toilets or ventilation.</li>
<li>The victims were not paid their promised wages, and what they did receive was well below the legal minimum.</li>
<li>The money that they did earn was garnished by the traffickers to cover utility costs in excess of their earnings. This created the false idea that the victims were indebted to the traffickers for their living expenses.</li>
<li>The traffickers told them that if they left, their visas would be revoked and that they would be tracked and arrested.  They were told that the sentence for a visa violation was 25 years, and they would be deported to serve their terms in their home countries.</li>
</ul><p>These deceptions created an emotional prison that allowed the traffickers to exploit these individuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The victims were worried about their families back home, who were now indebted to local money lenders and were in danger of losing their property, which in some cases held three generations.</li>
<li>They were not making enough money to support their families' financial needs.</li>
</ul><p>Despite the mental and economic enslavement these workers faced, they found the courage to escape either singly or in small groups and are scattered across the United States. Several made their way to Pittsburgh.</p>
<h3><strong>What They Need:</strong></h3>
<p>The victims have no money and are unable to work legally at this time.  They need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shelter</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Clothes</li>
<li>Medical care</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Legal representation</li>
</ul><p>In addition, these people are in danger of losing their homes back in Central America.</p>
<h3><strong>How you can help:</strong></h3>
<p>We are raising $2000 for these trafficking victims to provide housing, food, clothing, transportation and also to make small interest payments on the lands they mortgaged.  This is an emergency stop-gap until government resources kick in and they are able to work. We will be helping at least four people, but we know there are many more victims and we are reaching out to them as well.  As other victims associated with this case turn up, the need for resources will likely increase.  <strong>All donations processed through PayPal are tax deductible.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways to Help:</strong></h3>

But it happens right here, at home, every day. You may have passed a victim in the streets, on your way to work. Someone you know may have been trafficked. The following story is real. We have left out information in order to protect the identities of the victims and to avoid interfering with the prosecution of this particular case. 
What we CAN tell you is heartbreaking.
Details:
The victims involved in this case were hard working Central Americans who wanted to provide a better life for their families. They were extorted by ""recruiters"" who promised to get them into the United States for lawful employment.

The traffickers required large sums of money for various fees related to obtaining their work visas.
Once the exorbitant fees had been paid, the victims were told that their applications were lost, and the fees would need to be paid again.
Once at the airport, the traffickers said that the airlines would not honor their tickets, and so the victims were forced to scrounge additional funds to buy a second set of tickets.
Many of the victims had to mortgage their homes in order to cover these required costs.
After finally arriving in the United States, the victims were immediately put to work without being allowed to eat or rest.

Their living conditions were deplorable. As many as twelve victims were crammed into a single trailer. These trailers did not have working toilets or ventilation.
The victims were not paid their promised wages, and what they did receive was well below the legal minimum.
The money that they did earn was garnished by the traffickers to cover utility costs in excess of their earnings. This created the false idea that the victims were indebted to the traffickers for their living expenses.
The traffickers told them that if they left, their visas would be revoked and that they would be tracked and arrested.  They were told that the sentence for a visa violation was 25 years, and they would be deported to serve their terms in their home countries.
These deceptions created an emotional prison that allowed the traffickers to exploit these individuals.

The victims were worried about their families back home, who were now indebted to local money lenders and were in danger of losing their property, which in some cases held three generations.
They were not making enough money to support their families' financial needs.
Despite the mental and economic enslavement these workers faced, they found the courage to escape either singly or in small groups and are scattered across the United States. Several made their way to Pittsburgh.
What They Need:
The victims have no money and are unable to work legally at this time.  They need:

Shelter
Food
Clothes
Medical care
Transportation
Legal representation
In addition, these people are in danger of losing their homes back in Central America.
How you can help:
We are raising $2000 for these trafficking victims to provide housing, food, clothing, transportation and also to make small interest payments on the lands they mortgaged.  This is an emergency stop-gap until government resources kick in and they are able to work. We will be helping at least four people, but we know there are many more victims and we are reaching out to them as well.  As other victims associated with this case turn up, the need for resources will likely increase.  All donations processed through PayPal are tax deductible.
Other Ways to Help:
Please forward this appeal to everyone you know.  Get the word out, we need your help.A terrible injustice has been done, but we have the opportunity to make it right.

This is a tremendous thing. More than 300 of us--many individuals and several groups of people--contributed so that RB can not only survive but thrive.</strong></p><p>To the donors and participants in the drive who have been part of the Revolution Books community, a warm thanks. To those who gave and participated and are new to the RB community: welcome and our warm thanks. <br/><br/><strong>You are part of a community of donors and supporters</strong> that includes prominent authors and scholars; people from the neighborhood; artists, professors, lawyers, teachers, and other professionals; unemployed; students; and so many others. Some of you were part of matching challenges; some of you came to the wine-tasting benefit hosted by the Pompette Wine Shop. Some of you spread the word on social media, including in Mexico. A 10-year old neighbor of RB sold his used books, and was joined by other children in the neighborhood. Several immigrants made a group donation and issued a powerful statemeht calling on people to support a bookstore that “tells the truth about how people live and the revolution to emancipate humanity.”</p><p><strong>RB is a precious resource. </strong>At RB you can dig into why humanity faces this fascist Trump-Pence monstrosity.

In Harlem, on the stretch of Lenox Avenue also known as Malcolm X Boulevard, across the street from St. John’s Pentecostal and two doors down from the House of Seafood, that time persists—at least inside Revolution Books, which is either a throwback to a bygone era or the vanguard of a strikingly new one, depending on whom you ask and whether a bigoted oligarch has recently been elected to serve as President of the United States.

<h3>REVOLUTION BOOKS IS MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE.</h3>
<p>Since opening, RB has hosted dozens of author programs and cultural events. Two 2017  Pulitzer Prize winners, novelist Colson Whitehead (<i>Underground Railroad</i>) and historian Heather Ann Thompson (<i>Blood in the Water</i> on the Attica rebellion), have appeared in conversation with RB spokesperson Andy Zee. </p>
<p>Programs on mass incarceration have gotten into how America’s history of white supremacy and current political economy have produced this situation. A scientist/author who spoke at RB was asked: “What would be the ideal way for science to be taught and conducted in a just society?” The Revolution Club’s “Future People” open-mic nights have become a platform for music, spoken word, poetry -- and for discussion over what young people’s lives should be about.</p>
<p>The possibility of a radically different world opens up at RB; the fiction, poetry, plays and performance reveal the soaring heights of human achievement; and there is stimulating discussion, sharp and often jolting debate that challenges preconceptions. But it’s more than that. People who experience and are part of the life of RB—they go back out into the world. They influence and challenge others … and some become part of the movement for revolution. Yes, Revolution Books changes lives.  </p>

We Raised $25,000+ For the Bookstore About the World, For a Radically Different World To All of You Who Made It Possible...A HEARTFELT THANKSOn Wednesday night at 9:30pm, the Revolution Books Indiegogo Fund Drive met its $25,000 goal (and by the final deadline of 3am, an additional $885 was donated). This is a tremendous thing. More than 300 of us--many individuals and several groups of people--contributed so that RB can not only survive but thrive.To the donors and participants in the drive who have been part of the Revolution Books community, a warm thanks. To those who gave and participated and are new to the RB community: welcome and our warm thanks. You are part of a community of donors and supporters that includes prominent authors and scholars; people from the neighborhood; artists, professors, lawyers, teachers, and other professionals; unemployed; students; and so many others. Some of you were part of matching challenges; some of you came to the wine-tasting benefit hosted by the Pompette Wine Shop. Some of you spread the word on social media, including in Mexico. A 10-year old neighbor of RB sold his used books, and was joined by other children in the neighborhood. Several immigrants made a group donation and issued a powerful statemeht calling on people to support a bookstore that “tells the truth about how people live and the revolution to emancipate humanity.”RB is a precious resource. At RB you can dig into why humanity faces this fascist Trump-Pence monstrosity. Here you discover that a radically different and better world is possible--and engage the strategy to get to a new world, and a more scientific method and approach for understanding and changing the world, all of which is in the New Communism developed by Bob Avakian. At RB people get into the biggest questions confronting humanity…and on that foundation of knowing and changing the world, RB opens up discovery of an incredible range of literature, science, and scholarship.The $25,885 raised will go towards a vibrant promotion campaign—so 1000s more can find out about and make RB a destination, and for hundreds of new titles that speak to the urgent  issues of our times, and for Spanish-language, children’s literature and more. Go to www.revolutionbooksnyc.org&nbsp;to find out about our exciting, upcoming programs and events. Consider becoming a monthly SUSTAINER of RB. And come visit us at the store in Harlem!THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING THIS VICTORY POSSIBLE.* * *REVOLUTION BOOKS SUMMER 2017 FUND DRIVESupport the Bookstore About the World…and For a Radically Different WorldA Bookstore That Changes LivesThere is no place else, none that plays the role that Revolution Books does.If you have spent any time at RB you experienced what we say about the store: that people come to Revolution Books from all over the world and around the corner -- from the projects to the brownstones of Harlem -- to find the books and the deep engagement with each other about why the world is the way it is and the possibility of radically different way the world could be. How much does that matter at a moment when the Trump/Pence fascist regime threatens the seven billion people on the planet, and the planet itself?Every dollar you donate to Revolution Books opens up possibility: for children to discover books with humane values, for young people to grapple with the big questions of our time, for people of all ages and nationalities from ex-prisoners to college professors -- to know, grapple with, and be a part of changing the world. This can be life changing.  But it only happens with your financial support.Curiosity about everything, discovery of different cultures, learning of lives of peoples hidden from view, and the stories of history suppressed course through Revolution Books. Here you feel the vibe of certitude about the potential for a better world and a deep critique and intolerance for the unnecessary suffering of people. Authors, artists, and customers comment that programs or just hanging out here is different, richer -- an engagement filled with a thirst for what is true.RB spokesperson, Andy Zee, with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Heather Ann Thompson (Blood in the Water:  The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy) at RB in January .This vitality stems from the breakthrough in revolutionary theory that is the new communism developed by the revolutionary leader Bob Avakian. Most of all, this is a more scientific method and approach to understanding the world as it actually is. The passion for changing the world at RB comes from his vision and the strategy for an actual revolution and a radically new society on the road to real emancipation.
 More than a bookstore, Revolution Books is the political, intellectual, and cultural Center of a movement for revolution. Important Books. Pulitzer and Grammy award winners mixing it up with youth and ex-prisoners. Scholars and writers engaging with spokesperson Andy Zee and other revolutionary thinkers and fighters.

Your contribution makes it possible for the new Revolution Books in Harlem to be viable and thrive.This can't happen on the sale of books alone, especially when so many still don't know about the new RB in Harlem. Your contribution this year will go to a vibrant promotion campaign so that many more people learn about and make our RB a destination. This is crucial to getting the store on a sustainable path.RB has an important curated collection of thousands of books... but more titles are needed to serve the wide scope of our global mission and as part of making RB viable.Without you, RB cannot meet the needs of today.

Watching RevBooks' Indiegogo video on Sunday afternoon in the bookstore
RB is a unique and vibrant space: a bookstore that is the political, intellectual, and cultural center of a movement for revolution. This summer Revolution Books launches its third annual crowd-funding campaign. RB must expand its reach and base of support at a time when this bookstore matters more than ever. 

From an NGO consultant: ""...This fund drive for Revolution Books is not just a ""feel-good"" moment but an absolute imperative for anyone who sees what is going on in this country and around the world and who desperately wants to learn more, do more, have more of an actual impact ...""To read the whole statement, go here: http://www.revolutionbooksnyc.org/NGOstatement.htm


""At Revolution Books the lights are holding steady and people are talking..."" 
--so wrote LitHub on Nov 30, 2016... ""There was a time when it wasn’t so peculiar to believe that a new world order might be launched from a bookstore. In Harlem, on the stretch of Lenox Avenue also known as Malcolm X Boulevard, across the street from St. John’s Pentecostal and two doors down from the House of Seafood, that time persists—at least inside Revolution Books, which is either a throwback to a bygone era or the vanguard of a strikingly new one, depending on whom you ask and whether a bigoted oligarch has recently been elected to serve as President of the United States. On that latter subject, the signs propped up on the sidewalk and hanging in the front window make the store’s position fairly clear: “Mein Trumpf: A Thoroughly American Fascist Pig!” declares one, with a graphic mashup of Trump, Hitler and a Klansman. Another: “In the Name of Humanity We REFUSE to Accept a Fascist America”... Read whole article here
 
A BOOKSTORE THAT CHANGES LIVES… 
* Parents bring their kids to discover books that promote values of cooperation, appreciation for diversity, and the ability to learn about the world and make it better. One Saturday morning program taught young children about evolution.
* A high school intern on his first day says he doesn’t know much about the world and wants to learn. He talks to RB staff, finds the book Enrique's Journey about children from Central America who travel to the US on top of trains; he observes: “People are forced to escape to America because of what it does to their countries, but when they come, America  doesn’t want them.”
* Professors and Harlem neighbors come to find the new scholarship on slavery and the true history of Black people in the US; high school and college students come to explore and debate the causes of women’s oppression and how that oppression can be overcome.  
Revolution Books can change more lives -- with your donation today.
""...When an HIV awareness event I was planning could no longer be accommodated at our first venue, Rev Books became a home for the event. I'm thankful and pleased that Revolution Books has a place in our community. It's more than a bookstore; it's a panel discussion on Mondays, or an open mic night on Fridays. Its purpose morphs and serves our neighborhood and its people as a hub for exploration and knowledge. -- Marvin, works at Harlem social service organization
MISSION: THE EMANCIPATION OF HUMANITY… 
This is a place where people of all ages find the books and discussion with each other about why the world is the way it is, and how it could be transformed in the interests of the people of the world. At RB, revolution is the foundation for the rich engagement with the world of ideas. Rev Books features incredible books: fiction, history, art, philosophy, science, memoir, revolutionary theory... children’s literature.

Carl Dix, RB spokesperson Andy Zee and Dr. Cornel West, October 2016,at the launch of Bob Avakian's book The New Communism
At RB, people discover and can take up a truly scientific approach to the problems confronting the 7 billion on this planet, and the way out of the madness--the new synthesis of communism developed by Bob Avakian—and the leadership he is giving to the revolution to emancipate humanity. Watch BA here.

A GREAT BEGINNING, NOVEMBER 2015…
We converted a former beauty parlor into a beautiful bookstore and performance space. A local architect donated the design. Students and neighborhood people helped spackle and paint. Intellectuals, people in the book world, and neighborhood activists fed in ideas and helped spread the word. People from different walks of life and raised the funds to acquire new books and make the initial renovations.

REVOLUTION BOOKS IS MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE.
Since opening, RB has hosted dozens of author programs and cultural events. Two 2017  Pulitzer Prize winners, novelist Colson Whitehead (Underground Railroad) and historian Heather Ann Thompson (Blood in the Water on the Attica rebellion), have appeared in conversation with RB spokesperson Andy Zee. 
Programs on mass incarceration have gotten into how America’s history of white supremacy and current political economy have produced this situation. A scientist/author who spoke at RB was asked: “What would be the ideal way for science to be taught and conducted in a just society?” The Revolution Club’s “Future People” open-mic nights have become a platform for music, spoken word, poetry -- and for discussion over what young people’s lives should be about.
The possibility of a radically different world opens up at RB; the fiction, poetry, plays and performance reveal the soaring heights of human achievement; and there is stimulating discussion, sharp and often jolting debate that challenges preconceptions. But it’s more than that. People who experience and are part of the life of RB—they go back out into the world. They influence and challenge others … and some become part of the movement for revolution. Yes, Revolution Books changes lives.

AT THIS DANGEROUS TIME, RB MATTERS EVEN MORE.
When Donald Trump came to power, RB swung into action with “65 Defiant Days of Talks, Culture, and Dialogue: In the Name of Humanity, We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America.”  We’ve continued to hold programs on and debated the roots of fascism in America, the lessons of history, and the kind of movement and struggle necessary to stop it.

At a recent Future People Open-Mic at Revolution Books
At a moment of peril for humanity and the world, RB is providing a forum for addressing the specific crisis facing humanity, with the rise of a fascist regime in America and with repression, displacement and proxy wars sweeping across the world. Come to Revolution Books to find the questions being asked and debated and the scientific means being put forward for answering them. We all need to help make sure – right now – that Revolution Books will be there when it is most needed. – International human development consultant, Brooklyn

BUT WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS.YOUR DONATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE: 
* We need thousands more people coming to the store, buying books, attending our programs and donating—in order to generate revenue to pay our rent and expand our selection. But that potential customer base doesn’t yet know about the store! Your contribution will enable us to publicize and promote RB, buy advertising including in social media, and improve our signage.
* When the thousands come, they need to find hundreds more of the books that open pathways to understanding the past and present, the possibilities of the future, and the yearnings of humanity.

<p><b>Until there are enough beds and programs made available for those of us who need them, we want to help people living on the street be as self-reliant as possible.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 36,000 homeless people in the Bay Area, and only about 10,000 beds available to them. There is an untold number of people in our community living on the street. Large numbers of visibly homeless residents started to appear in the Bay Area during the 1980’s, when many of the social protections introduced in programs like the New Deal were eroded in the name of the free market. President Reagan cut the budget for Section 8 assistance in half during his first year in office. This funding was meant to keep low-income Americans off the streets by subsidizing their housing costs.</p>
<p>In 1987, an economic downturn did even more damage to people on the brink, who had already been left behind by unequally distributed prosperity earlier in the decade.  According to the <a href=""http://www.sfgov3.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=4819"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 2013 Homeless Point-In-Time Count &amp; Survey </a>released by San Francisco’s municipal authority, the last decade has seen the same relationship between economic failure and increased homelessness.</p>
<p><b>1 in 3 homeless people in the Bay Area suffer from a mental health condition</b>, with 23% citing a specific illness such as Schizophrenia, 42% suffering from chronic depression, and 15% with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  According to Dr. E Fuller Torrey’s 2013 article,<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/09/29/ronald_reagans_shameful_legacy_violence_the_homeless_mental_illness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> “Ronald Reagan’s shameful legacy: Violence, the homeless, mental illness,”</a> the increase in mentally ill homeless people is also relatively recent. Just as Reagan ended many of the New Deal programs, he also closed state mental hospitals and cut mental health funding during his time as Governor of California and as President of the United States.  <br/></p>
<p><b>29% of respondents said they became homeless after losing a job, while only 11% cited alcohol or drug use as the main cause.</b></p>

In 1987, an economic downturn did even more damage to people on the brink, who had already been left behind by unequally distributed prosperity earlier in the decade.  According to the  2013 Homeless Point-In-Time Count & Survey released by San Francisco’s municipal authority, the last decade has seen the same relationship between economic failure and increased homelessness.
1 in 3 homeless people in the Bay Area suffer from a mental health condition, with 23% citing a specific illness such as Schizophrenia, 42% suffering from chronic depression, and 15% with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  According to Dr. E Fuller Torrey’s 2013 article, “Ronald Reagan’s shameful legacy: Violence, the homeless, mental illness,” the increase in mentally ill homeless people is also relatively recent. Just as Reagan ended many of the New Deal programs, he also closed state mental hospitals and cut mental health funding during his time as Governor of California and as President of the United States.  
29% of respondents said they became homeless after losing a job, while only 11% cited alcohol or drug use as the main cause.

  The Vision For 6 months out of the year, we go on a national tour with electronic musician Phutureprimitive, so we will be able to teach people across the country how to crowdfund through social media to provide for homeless people in their local communities.

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION </b><br/></p>
<p>The people of the Earth have entered in varying degrees into a universal community, and it has developed to the point where a violation of rights in one part of the world is felt everywhere. In our rapidly changing world, we are more connected and more aware of the human rights violations and crimes against humanity, even if they are unfolding oceans apart. Whether human rights violations are being committed locally, or internationally, all humans should regard themselves as being part of a single community where it is our responsibility to take collective action to protect the most vulnerable from suffering and injustice. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>DECEMBER 16<sup>TH</sup> 2012</b></p>
<p>Almost everyone today has heard of the gang rape of
a young Indian student that occurred in Delhi on December 16th, 2012. The
newspapers reported that the victims’ intestines were ripped out by the group
of men who also suggested that she be thrown naked from the bus. </p>
<p>The rape resulted in the young girls death. Immediately
following the announcement of the incident, a series of demonstrations in
support of the victim followed. The demonstrators were demanding legal and
policing reforms from the Indian government. </p>
<p>The mass
demonstrations, outrage and media coverage is illustrative of how communal the
world has become and that women’s issues in India, or any part of the world,
are personal issues too. </p>
<p>The
significant amount of attention attracted by the tragic event and the indignation
expressed by demonstrators and international organizations worldwide led the
Indian government to openly recognize the existence of a problem and adopt some
measures to address it. </p>
<p>The details
of this brutal rape are difficult to shake, however it is encouraging to know
that we, as a collective community, can make a difference in various ways. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/133759/files/20131014225734-protestor.jpg?1381816654"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>A protester at Jantar
Mantar in New Delhi - The crowds chanted slogans against the government for its
perceived inaction in preventing cases of rape and being unable to better
protect women in the capital. </span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>THE SITUATION IN INDIA </b><br/></span></p>
<p>Rape in India
has been described as one of India's most common crimes against women and by UN's human-rights chief as a “national problem”. </p>
<p>According to 2012 statistics, New Delhi has the
highest number of rape-reports among Indian cities, while Jabalpur has the per capita incidence of reported rapes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over
the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>A new case is reported every
20 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us take
a closer look at the situation in India. Almost all newspapers repeat the sad fact that
Delhi can be described as a world capital of rape. However, more generally, we can see that rape
is a wide-spread and silently tolerated phenomenon in India, especially in its
northern provinces. Reports often link
this prevalence of rape with patriarchal and degrading traditional attitudes
towards women. </p>
<p><b>CASTE DISCRIMINATION</b> -
Caste-based discrimination remains a problematic practice in India which labels
individuals as ‘outcastes’ or dalits. This
deep-rooted discrimination causes marginalisation, social and economic
exclusion, severely poor work conditions, and limited access to basic services
such as water, sanitation and employment. In India, caste systems divide people
into social groups (castes) where their rights are determined by birth and are
permanently fixed.<span>  Unequal and
hierarchical, those at the top enjoy comfortable social positions, while those
at the bottom struggle without any rights. </span></p>
<p>Dalit
women and girls are especially vulnerable, experiencing not only the
discrimination of caste, but also of class and gender – ‘triple discrimination’
as it’s called in India – leaving them in a vicious cycle of marginalisation
and exploitation. National crime statistics indicate an average of over 1,000
rape cases against dalit women are reported annually, the highest of any social
group.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In addition,
such factors as insufficient punishment and unsatisfactory judicial system which
is particularly slow and overloaded are also often cited as being part of the
problem. </p>
<p>Many other
shocking stories of rape have made headlines in Western media, but we’ve
forgotten them. For some reasons, at
certain points of time, one or another particular case is able to mobilize
opinion and action. </p>
<p>India can be seen as a
country permeated with a violent mentality. Few can claim not to have been on the
receiving end of physical violence from family members and many who suffer at
the hands of violence go on to perform similar acts themselves. Ninety per cent of sexual attackers are known
to their victims, dispelling the myth of attackers as random offenders. </p>
<p><b>WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?</b> India needs to
chip away at the patriarchal and misogynistic mentality.<span>  Education on gender equality has to begin with
the youth, within homes and primary schools, and be reinforced with a strong
and sustained anti-violence government-funded campaign. </span></p>
<p>India needs to start at the fundamental
basics and reprogram the way that Indian society thinks about gender, about
masculinity, about femininity and women’s position in society. These are basic
notions that have been accepted into the Indian Constitution but have NOT been
accepted into India’s social mentality and actions. </p>
<p>More preventative measures are required to
tackle the problem. </p>
<p>One of my projects will focus
on the <u>lack of gender education in the Indian curriculum.</u> Youth needs to
be asked and encouraged to think about certain questions. </p>
<p><u>1. How do young Indian
boys and girls grow up to think about sex and about gender and about sexual
relationships or even emotional relationships?</u></p>
<p><u>2. What is adolescent
education, and what should it be, and what are the issues that really need to
be in the public sphere?</u></p>
<p>People generally are not
comfortable talking about sexuality or reproductive rights or issues like sexual
desire, even within the family, let alone within the classroom or the
workplace. These issues are avoided. As a
result, there’s an enormous amount of ignorance and denial. Teachers are likely
to have difficulty answering questions about sexuality as well. </p>
<p>It’s hard to generate the political will for
people in senior positions in the education system to support teachers and to
train teachers to talk about these issues. So there is a second critical element: finding
ways to challenge boys and girls to think about what it means to be “cool,” to
impress one’s peers, and what it means to be a strong boy or man. </p>
<p>What is needed is a dramatic shift in the
gender norm balance. There are all sorts of ways one can do that: of course,
formally in the classroom, but also through extracurricular activities. </p>
<p>We need to work on education and on promoting
healthy and non-predatory relationships between boys and girls, and getting
away from a lot of the hypocrisy that exists. <br/></p>

<br/><p><b>ABOUT ME</b></p>
<p>As a recent
University graduate, writer, and humanitarian, I have a wide array of skills I
can contribute to a non-profit organization. Throughout my university career I
developed a strong interest in community work, sustainable development,
political relations, women’s issues, human rights, and animal rights
advocacy.<span>  Considering my interests I
have decided to study law at Leeds University, focusing on human rights. My
studies don’t begin until September 2014 and in the meantime I would like to utilize
knowledge, volunteer experience, and passion for improving the lives of others
by providing social and legal assistance to disadvantaged Indian women. My
experience and knowledge has left me feeling very equipped to volunteer as an
intern with a non-profit organization. <br/></span></p>

I am seeking funds to cover airfare, a travel visa, travel
     insurance, and internship costs so that I can live and work in Jodhpur
     India. I will be engaging in community outreach, sustainable development,
     teaching youth and women, and legal advocacy. FSD partners in India have pledged to
     provide full room and board. 
All additional
     funding will go directly to the successful growth and expansion of the
     FSD. 

WHAT IS THE GOAL? 


To live and volunteer in Jodhpur, India where
I will impact the lives of disempowered and marginalized Indian women by working
as a legal advocate for victims of rape and abuse, and together with other
local non-profits groups, ensure that women are protected from abuse, rape, and
discrimination. 


To implement gender sensitivity education into
the Indian curriculum for young boys. 

To provide support and counselling, assist in
the development of community workshops on rights, leadership, life skills and
empowerment

I will also be living with a host family, and
chronicling my work for all of you to see on my blog

CALL TO ACTION 
The people of the Earth have entered in varying degrees into a universal community, and it has developed to the point where a violation of rights in one part of the world is felt everywhere. In our rapidly changing world, we are more connected and more aware of the human rights violations and crimes against humanity, even if they are unfolding oceans apart. Whether human rights violations are being committed locally, or internationally, all humans should regard themselves as being part of a single community where it is our responsibility to take collective action to protect the most vulnerable from suffering and injustice. 


DECEMBER 16TH 2012
Almost everyone today has heard of the gang rape of
a young Indian student that occurred in Delhi on December 16th, 2012. The
newspapers reported that the victims’ intestines were ripped out by the group
of men who also suggested that she be thrown naked from the bus. 
The rape resulted in the young girls death. Immediately
following the announcement of the incident, a series of demonstrations in
support of the victim followed. The demonstrators were demanding legal and
policing reforms from the Indian government. 
The mass
demonstrations, outrage and media coverage is illustrative of how communal the
world has become and that women’s issues in India, or any part of the world,
are personal issues too. 
The
significant amount of attention attracted by the tragic event and the indignation
expressed by demonstrators and international organizations worldwide led the
Indian government to openly recognize the existence of a problem and adopt some
measures to address it. 
The details
of this brutal rape are difficult to shake, however it is encouraging to know
that we, as a collective community, can make a difference in various ways. 

A protester at Jantar
Mantar in New Delhi - The crowds chanted slogans against the government for its
perceived inaction in preventing cases of rape and being unable to better
protect women in the capital. 

THE SITUATION IN INDIA 
Rape in India
has been described as one of India's most common crimes against women and by UN's human-rights chief as a “national problem”. 
According to 2012 statistics, New Delhi has the
highest number of rape-reports among Indian cities, while Jabalpur has the per capita incidence of reported rapes.


Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over
the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011

A new case is reported every
20 minutes

Let us take
a closer look at the situation in India. Almost all newspapers repeat the sad fact that
Delhi can be described as a world capital of rape. However, more generally, we can see that rape
is a wide-spread and silently tolerated phenomenon in India, especially in its
northern provinces. Reports often link
this prevalence of rape with patriarchal and degrading traditional attitudes
towards women. 
CASTE DISCRIMINATION -
Caste-based discrimination remains a problematic practice in India which labels
individuals as ‘outcastes’ or dalits. This
deep-rooted discrimination causes marginalisation, social and economic
exclusion, severely poor work conditions, and limited access to basic services
such as water, sanitation and employment. In India, caste systems divide people
into social groups (castes) where their rights are determined by birth and are
permanently fixed.  Unequal and
hierarchical, those at the top enjoy comfortable social positions, while those
at the bottom struggle without any rights. 
Dalit
women and girls are especially vulnerable, experiencing not only the
discrimination of caste, but also of class and gender – ‘triple discrimination’
as it’s called in India – leaving them in a vicious cycle of marginalisation
and exploitation. National crime statistics indicate an average of over 1,000
rape cases against dalit women are reported annually, the highest of any social
group.  
In addition,
such factors as insufficient punishment and unsatisfactory judicial system which
is particularly slow and overloaded are also often cited as being part of the
problem. 
Many other
shocking stories of rape have made headlines in Western media, but we’ve
forgotten them. For some reasons, at
certain points of time, one or another particular case is able to mobilize
opinion and action. 
India can be seen as a
country permeated with a violent mentality. Few can claim not to have been on the
receiving end of physical violence from family members and many who suffer at
the hands of violence go on to perform similar acts themselves. Ninety per cent of sexual attackers are known
to their victims, dispelling the myth of attackers as random offenders. 
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? India needs to
chip away at the patriarchal and misogynistic mentality.  Education on gender equality has to begin with
the youth, within homes and primary schools, and be reinforced with a strong
and sustained anti-violence government-funded campaign. 
India needs to start at the fundamental
basics and reprogram the way that Indian society thinks about gender, about
masculinity, about femininity and women’s position in society. These are basic
notions that have been accepted into the Indian Constitution but have NOT been
accepted into India’s social mentality and actions. 
More preventative measures are required to
tackle the problem. 
One of my projects will focus
on the lack of gender education in the Indian curriculum. Youth needs to
be asked and encouraged to think about certain questions. 
1. How do young Indian
boys and girls grow up to think about sex and about gender and about sexual
relationships or even emotional relationships?
2. What is adolescent
education, and what should it be, and what are the issues that really need to
be in the public sphere?
People generally are not
comfortable talking about sexuality or reproductive rights or issues like sexual
desire, even within the family, let alone within the classroom or the
workplace. These issues are avoided. As a
result, there’s an enormous amount of ignorance and denial. Teachers are likely
to have difficulty answering questions about sexuality as well. 
It’s hard to generate the political will for
people in senior positions in the education system to support teachers and to
train teachers to talk about these issues. So there is a second critical element: finding
ways to challenge boys and girls to think about what it means to be “cool,” to
impress one’s peers, and what it means to be a strong boy or man. 
What is needed is a dramatic shift in the
gender norm balance. There are all sorts of ways one can do that: of course,
formally in the classroom, but also through extracurricular activities. 
We need to work on education and on promoting
healthy and non-predatory relationships between boys and girls, and getting
away from a lot of the hypocrisy that exists. 




THE VISION & THE WORK 
As an intern
for FSD I will work to support and educate the women of the local communities. The work I do will change their lives.  
I will be
focusing on three projects. 
1. Education for Youth on
Equality and Women’s Rights 


Gender education
in the Indian curriculum that we aim to teach young boys about gender equality.  

Support teachers
and equip them with tools so they can educate and discuss issues such as
sexually, reproductive rights, and women’s equality with students. 

2. Legal Counseling, Education
on Rights, & Social Support 


I will be supporting marginalized women by educating them to better
understand their basic human rights and how to assert these rights. The aim
here is to promote self-efficacy and empower these women so that they may
effectively combat violence.

Educate local women through a series of workshops about the Indian
Constitution, laws that benefit and protect women and their families, gender
sensitivity, leadership, and empowerment  


Provide legal and/or psychological support for victims of violence who
decide to take legal action

3. Lobbying 


Support the lobby of government and legislative authorities about issues
and solutions regarding violence against women

Connect on a global level— create more international
awareness, engage in demonstrations, and mobilize collective action. 



WHAT IS FSD? 
The Foundation for Sustainable
Development (FSD) is a volunteer-based organization specializing in
international development and operations in Nicaragua, Bolivia, Argentina, Kenya, Uganda, and India. 
FSD's volunteers are primarily
college students or recent graduates who focus their work in one of several areas,
including 


Health 

Education

Community development

Women's empowerment

Human rights 

Micro-enterprise 


Environment

The mission of FSD is to enhance
the capacity of international communities in hopes of improving health, social
issues, environmental and economic issues. 
FSD, together with many indigenous
entrepreneurs, is trying to lessen a variety of environmental, social and
economic deficiencies that haunt global communities. 



ABOUT ME
As a recent
University graduate, writer, and humanitarian, I have a wide array of skills I
can contribute to a non-profit organization. Throughout my university career I
developed a strong interest in community work, sustainable development,
political relations, women’s issues, human rights, and animal rights
advocacy.  Considering my interests I
have decided to study law at Leeds University, focusing on human rights. My
studies don’t begin until September 2014 and in the meantime I would like to utilize
knowledge, volunteer experience, and passion for improving the lives of others
by providing social and legal assistance to disadvantaged Indian women. My
experience and knowledge has left me feeling very equipped to volunteer as an
intern with a non-profit organization. 




BUDGET BREAKDOWN

<p>On Tuesday, November 6, 2018, Massachusetts is voting on Transgender Rights. Two years ago, the State House added gender identity to the list of protected classes in public accommodations law, but this November, these rights are at risk! This isn’t just about ‘bathrooms;’ public accommodations are about health care, jobs, housing, education, parks, restaurants, and so much more.</p>
<p>To encourage people to VOTE YES ON 3, and support transgender rights in Massachusetts, community members and I are filming a short video featuring transgender people from MA, talking about what this ballot question means to them. This equally educational and personal video will be featured on social media, and we would also love to air it on t.v., at least via the news.</p>

Two years ago, the State House added gender identity to the list of protected classes in public accommodations law, but this November, these rights are at risk! This isn’t just about ‘bathrooms;’ public accommodations are about health care, jobs, housing, education, parks, restaurants, and so much more.
To encourage people to VOTE YES ON 3, and support transgender rights in Massachusetts, community members and I are filming a short video featuring transgender people from MA, talking about what this ballot question means to them. This equally educational and personal video will be featured on social media, and we would also love to air it on t.v., at least via the news.

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for support in any form possible.
Our primary needs include:

Funding toward transportation for filming
Funding toward production and editing so that we may

      -Rent equipment
     -Compensate talent and labor.

We are also seeking donations of production equipment.
Above all, we would greatly appreciate endorsements of our message by public figures in the form of a brief recorded statement expressing your support.
We will complete filming by the end of August, and production by mid-September, at which point we can send final video prior to endorsement recordings, and we can edit your support into the video. Our goal is to have the video online by the end of September.

Perks for Our Contributors:
TBD

<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""> </p>
<p> <img alt=""Prism"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d233eq3e3p3cv0.cloudfront.net/max/700/0*ybSEkeSnhq14U80T.jpeg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prism""/></p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Recent international events have made it crystal clear to all that the time has come to establish<strong><em> a Universal Declaration of Digital Rights</em></strong> that clearly defines the rules on how our governments and third party organisations can use our data online.</p>
<p><img alt=""NSA Inside"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.futuristgerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nsa-inside.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We at Digitterra believe that<strong> <em>'We The People'</em> should create this Declaration</strong> and have it <strong>ratified by the United Nations</strong> through official channels as a natural extension of our Human Rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  </p>
</div>
<p><img alt=""Every Human has rights"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i726.photobucket.com/albums/ww268/MilkshakeE3/human-rights-every-human-has-rights1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Though there have been some attempts to address digital rights in the past there is still no single holistic guideline to which all nations can be held accountable as there is for human rights. Our team has produced a </span><strong>first draft</strong><span> of what such a guideline and Declaration might look like.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Our project is to </span><strong>build a digital platform to refine or rewrite this draft with a community of privacy and human rights specialists</strong><span> and to develop a robust document that can be presented to the United Nations for endorsement and support.</span></p>
<p><span><span>We will also develop an</span><strong> e-petition tool to</strong><span> </span><strong>gather at least 100,000 signatures from citizens of the EU, US, UK </strong><span>and other countries to present to the White House, 10 Downing Street and other governments calling on them to endorse our Declaration and for them to sponsor our request to the UN for Universal Digital Rights. With 100,000 signatures from US supporters and 100,000 from UK supporters we can demand White House and Parliamentary debates on our Declaration.</span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Our plan can be thought of as three step process:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Build a platform:</strong> Technology is part if the solution, not the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Use the platform to change the world</strong> - Technology will help us but we need to help ourselves as much as we need technology.  We need your help!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Open source the platform</strong> to other world changing causes.</p>
<p>Critically this is a social entrepreneurial project to build a digital platform that will enable a team of experts to develop and publish a document that will be  provided to government agencies at the end of the project to catalyse material changes in the way the internet is governed and used. The platform will also be used to generate awareness and support for the declaration using gaming mechanics and e-petitioning tools to drive adoption. </p>
<p>In addition we will <strong>launch an international campaign to promote the Declaration</strong> that will peak with a <strong>Digital Rights Festival</strong> to be held between the United States and Europe (locations to be confirmed) <strong>on the 10th of December</strong> as part of the <strong>UN’s Human Rights Day</strong>.  </p>
<p><img alt=""human rights"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/11/full/hrday2011.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We will invite thought leaders, artists and digital rights activists from around the world to speak at this festival and seek to present our declaration to the UN. We will close with a concert to promote our Declaration and to encourage<strong> One Million people to sign a global petition to be presented to the UN.</strong>  Project donors and supporters will be able to suggest and vote on locations for the festivals and concerts.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h1><strong>In summary-</strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Your contribution will develop:</strong></h1>
<p><em><strong>1)</strong> <strong>A platform for digital human rights specialists and advocacy groups</strong></em> to use to craft and crowd source a robust Universal Declaration of Digital Rights and a framework for its implementation.</p>
<p><strong>2) A Universal Declaration of Digital Rights</strong> that we can all stand behind.</p>
<p><strong>3) An e-petitions tool that citizens of the world can sign</strong>, and present to our national governments, forcing national and international debates on digital rights and seeking the endorsement and support of our declaration. The tool will also be used to collect 1,000,000 signatures to be used to petition the UN to recognize and establish our universal declaration of our digital rights.</p>
<p><strong><em>4) A campaign to promote our Declaration and to encourage One Million people to sign</em></strong> its petition concluding with a Digital Rights Festival to be held in The United States and Europe (locations to be confirmed) on the 10th of December as part of the UN’s Human Rights Day.  Potential locations include New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C, Brussels and Geneva.  We aim to hold the festival in one US and one European location.</p>
<p>If you value your privacy, freedom of thought, speech and expression and feel the need to protect your rights to these then please contribute to our project and sign our petitions to the UN and your government.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Launching a project of this scale and scope invariably comes with a few risks. Here are what we see as the key ones:</p>
<h3>1) Platform complexity risk. </h3>
<p>It may prove that our digital platform ambitions prove to be more complex to execute with the funds that we raise through the project than we had anticipated. To mitigate this risk we will adopt a minimum viable product software development approach. We will develop our platform using an agile methodology and ensure that the first sprints are focused on mission critical features. These will include a robust wiki resource and effective e-petition resource with tried and tested collaboration and social utilities baked in. We will use open source standards and resources for the core platform code, again reducing costs.</p>
<h3>2) Consensus risk on the draft declaration. </h3>
<p>Digital rights are a complex subject and there is a risk that we will not achieve a consensus on which articles should be included in the draft declaration or on the precise wording of the articles. This risk can increase with more participants involved in crafting the declaration. We will use crowd technology solutions to reduce this risk. With wikis and other collaboration tools we can ensure that as the number of participants increase the quality of the output is kept high and that the speed of progress is maintained. We will also mitigate this risk by keeping a strict deadline on completing the draft and having it ready for launch on the 10th of December on Human Rights day.</p>
<h3>3) Policy Risks </h3>
<p>There are any number of risks and challenges in making good policy. Our project is hugely ambitious; to create a set of guiding principles that should be future-proof, global and address the real needs of citizens on the web. By crowdsourcing expertise from the worlds’ foremost privacy and human rights specialists to work on a platform built by expert technologists we hope to overcome the problem of policy being made by few non-expert decision makers and manage the breadth and depth of expertise that we hope to attract to this project. We will embed advanced voting, polling and collaboration capabilities into the platform to enable the Law and Framework inner caucus developing the draft to quickly come to a consensus on the policy and detailed wording of the declaration.</p>
<h3>4) Diversity of views risk</h3>
<p>There is a risk that one group or approach to digital rights dominates the tone of the articles of the declaration. We will mitigate this by ensuring that we reach out and include privacy and human rights practitioners and advocacy groups from across the world from a broad political spectrum into the project's Law and Framework inner caucus. We will propose that all collaboration is done in English but aside from this restriction all relevant groups and individuals from anywhere in the world will be welcomed into the inner caucus developing the declaration. That said the platform’s inner caucus will be a private forum. People will need to apply to be admitted as a participant. All recognised digital rights, human rights and privacy advocacy groups and their members will be given automatic access to the community. Also any recognised person or professional in the field will be given access and invited to join. People without a track record in the space will be invited to apply to join the caucus and asked to give a brief description on why they feel they should be admitted and how they can contribute to drafting the declaration. Some people may not participate in crafting the declarations language directly but may be invited to vote on articles or particular terms being proposed. The idea is to keep the inner caucus responsible for developing the declaration focused and meritocratic, with specialized expertise that can enable it to reach an internationally defensible declaration at pace. We will work out the detailed mechanics for swelling the membership of the inner caucuses in a democratic process with the earliest members to embrace our project.</p>
<h3>5) Apathy risk </h3>
<p>There is a risk that people and advocacy groups do not care enough about digital rights to be motivated to participate sufficiently to achieve the required results to draft the declaration and also to get enough signatures on the e-petitions to mandate the appropriate level of response from our governments. For example there is the risk that we do not generate 100,000 signatures for our US and UK petitions to force national debates.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the biggest risk of all and in many ways speaks to the core reason of why we’re doing this project. There is a dangerous sentiment that is often cited in response to the question of how to enable privacy in a modern digitally connected age which proposes that we are moving into a world where all of our data will be in the cloud and hence available to all and that we should really just accept what, is positioned as an inevitable loss of privacy as a price for modern living. This idea proposes that privacy is effectively disappearing in the emerging digital world as a result of our data being ubiquitously available in the cloud.</p>
<p>It is our view that privacy in the modern world is not so much about the presence of our personal data in cyberspace as it is about the controls around who is allowed to have access to that information. On the basis that technology potentially accords us more controls today than we have ever had in the past to determine who can access our information, there is a valid argument to be made that we are in fact moving to a world with potentially greater privacy, not less. What however is required for such a world to become truly viable is a clear set of rules around who is allowed to do what with our data when. That is the heart of what this project is about and why we are doing it. We believe if we can get this message out to enough people then people will care. Not simply because this is important and fundamental but more importantly because it is a problem that can be solved, a problem for which there is hope as opposed to hopelessness.</p>
<p>We will launch a campaign to promote the project with which we hope will turn people’s apathy, which we believe is really underpinned by a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness to inspiration, empowerment and action.</p>
<h3>6) Ineffectiveness risk</h3>
<p>There is also a risk that with our best efforts and even if we amass several hundred thousand signatures to our petition that we will effect little or no change. This could be a result of having a team that is adept at crafting the declaration but lacks influence in getting any real endorsement of the declaration or it could be due to lack of political support. If we are successful in launching this project and in building this platform, developing this declaration and in securing the petition signatures we aim for but are not able to achieve our goal or endorsement and support of our declaration then we will launch another campaign next year aiming to raise more signatures and to make more noise and the same again the following year as necessary until we cannot be ignored any further. We will also from the outset seek the support of several influential politicians in the support of our project from both sides of the political isle to increase the viability and effectiveness of our campaign.</p>
<h3>7) Festival Risks </h3>
<p>There are several risks around the staging of the Digital Rights Festival and concert planned for the end of the year. There are risks that it could cost more to organise than we have anticipated, that we are not able to secure appropriate venues, that we are not able to secure supporting performing artists for the concert or that they don’t show up. We believe the key to managing the risks around the festival and concert is to get a realistic sense of scale very early on. By the end of our Kickstarter campaign we will have a good view of the velocity and momentum of our initiative. With that in mind we will scale the festival and concerts appropriately for our trajectory. We will also look to work with corporate partners that can help us with logistics and operational support for the festival, which will also considerably de-risk it. We believe that the Digital Rights Festival could be a regular event. One that is held every year or couple of years to promote, enable and protect digital rights. The most important thing now is to plant the right seed for this.</p>
<p>We at Digitterra believe that nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come, and that Universal Digital Rights is an idea whose time has come.</p>

</div></div>","Crowdsourcing a
         UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF DIGITAL RIGHTS
 to outline what
   WE THE PEOPLE should demand as DIGITAL RIGHTS FOR ALL
 
 

 
Recent international events have made it crystal clear to all that the time has come to establish a Universal Declaration of Digital Rights that clearly defines the rules on how our governments and third party organisations can use our data online.

We at Digitterra believe that 'We The People' should create this Declaration and have it ratified by the United Nations through official channels as a natural extension of our Human Rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  




Though there have been some attempts to address digital rights in the past there is still no single holistic guideline to which all nations can be held accountable as there is for human rights. Our team has produced a first draft of what such a guideline and Declaration might look like.
Our project is to build a digital platform to refine or rewrite this draft with a community of privacy and human rights specialists and to develop a robust document that can be presented to the United Nations for endorsement and support.
We will also develop an e-petition tool to gather at least 100,000 signatures from citizens of the EU, US, UK and other countries to present to the White House, 10 Downing Street and other governments calling on them to endorse our Declaration and for them to sponsor our request to the UN for Universal Digital Rights. With 100,000 signatures from US supporters and 100,000 from UK supporters we can demand White House and Parliamentary debates on our Declaration.

 
Our plan can be thought of as three step process:
Step 1 - Build a platform: Technology is part if the solution, not the problem.
Step 2 - Use the platform to change the world - Technology will help us but we need to help ourselves as much as we need technology.  We need your help!
Step 3 - Open source the platform to other world changing causes.
Critically this is a social entrepreneurial project to build a digital platform that will enable a team of experts to develop and publish a document that will be  provided to government agencies at the end of the project to catalyse material changes in the way the internet is governed and used. The platform will also be used to generate awareness and support for the declaration using gaming mechanics and e-petitioning tools to drive adoption. 
In addition we will launch an international campaign to promote the Declaration that will peak with a Digital Rights Festival to be held between the United States and Europe (locations to be confirmed) on the 10th of December as part of the UN’s Human Rights Day.  

We will invite thought leaders, artists and digital rights activists from around the world to speak at this festival and seek to present our declaration to the UN. We will close with a concert to promote our Declaration and to encourage One Million people to sign a global petition to be presented to the UN.  Project donors and supporters will be able to suggest and vote on locations for the festivals and concerts.
 

In summary-
Your contribution will develop:
1) A platform for digital human rights specialists and advocacy groups to use to craft and crowd source a robust Universal Declaration of Digital Rights and a framework for its implementation.
2) A Universal Declaration of Digital Rights that we can all stand behind.
3) An e-petitions tool that citizens of the world can sign, and present to our national governments, forcing national and international debates on digital rights and seeking the endorsement and support of our declaration. The tool will also be used to collect 1,000,000 signatures to be used to petition the UN to recognize and establish our universal declaration of our digital rights.
4) A campaign to promote our Declaration and to encourage One Million people to sign its petition concluding with a Digital Rights Festival to be held in The United States and Europe (locations to be confirmed) on the 10th of December as part of the UN’s Human Rights Day.  Potential locations include New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C, Brussels and Geneva.  We aim to hold the festival in one US and one European location.
If you value your privacy, freedom of thought, speech and expression and feel the need to protect your rights to these then please contribute to our project and sign our petitions to the UN and your government.

Digital Rights are Human Rights. Stand up for yours.
“Unwarranted government surveillance is an intrusion on basic human rights that threatens the very foundations of a democratic society.  I call on all web users to demand better legal protection and due process safeguards for the privacy of their online communications, including their right to be informed when someone requests or stores their data."" - Tim-Berners-Lee to the FT on June 7th 2013
""No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."" - Article 12  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10th 1948.
""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."" -Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, July 4th 1776

 
Risks and Challenges
Launching a project of this scale and scope invariably comes with a few risks. Here are what we see as the key ones:
1) Platform complexity risk. 
It may prove that our digital platform ambitions prove to be more complex to execute with the funds that we raise through the project than we had anticipated. To mitigate this risk we will adopt a minimum viable product software development approach. We will develop our platform using an agile methodology and ensure that the first sprints are focused on mission critical features. These will include a robust wiki resource and effective e-petition resource with tried and tested collaboration and social utilities baked in. We will use open source standards and resources for the core platform code, again reducing costs.
2) Consensus risk on the draft declaration. 
Digital rights are a complex subject and there is a risk that we will not achieve a consensus on which articles should be included in the draft declaration or on the precise wording of the articles. This risk can increase with more participants involved in crafting the declaration. We will use crowd technology solutions to reduce this risk. With wikis and other collaboration tools we can ensure that as the number of participants increase the quality of the output is kept high and that the speed of progress is maintained. We will also mitigate this risk by keeping a strict deadline on completing the draft and having it ready for launch on the 10th of December on Human Rights day.
3) Policy Risks 
There are any number of risks and challenges in making good policy. Our project is hugely ambitious; to create a set of guiding principles that should be future-proof, global and address the real needs of citizens on the web. By crowdsourcing expertise from the worlds’ foremost privacy and human rights specialists to work on a platform built by expert technologists we hope to overcome the problem of policy being made by few non-expert decision makers and manage the breadth and depth of expertise that we hope to attract to this project. We will embed advanced voting, polling and collaboration capabilities into the platform to enable the Law and Framework inner caucus developing the draft to quickly come to a consensus on the policy and detailed wording of the declaration.
4) Diversity of views risk
There is a risk that one group or approach to digital rights dominates the tone of the articles of the declaration. We will mitigate this by ensuring that we reach out and include privacy and human rights practitioners and advocacy groups from across the world from a broad political spectrum into the project's Law and Framework inner caucus. We will propose that all collaboration is done in English but aside from this restriction all relevant groups and individuals from anywhere in the world will be welcomed into the inner caucus developing the declaration. That said the platform’s inner caucus will be a private forum. People will need to apply to be admitted as a participant. All recognised digital rights, human rights and privacy advocacy groups and their members will be given automatic access to the community. Also any recognised person or professional in the field will be given access and invited to join. People without a track record in the space will be invited to apply to join the caucus and asked to give a brief description on why they feel they should be admitted and how they can contribute to drafting the declaration. Some people may not participate in crafting the declarations language directly but may be invited to vote on articles or particular terms being proposed. The idea is to keep the inner caucus responsible for developing the declaration focused and meritocratic, with specialized expertise that can enable it to reach an internationally defensible declaration at pace. We will work out the detailed mechanics for swelling the membership of the inner caucuses in a democratic process with the earliest members to embrace our project.
5) Apathy risk 
There is a risk that people and advocacy groups do not care enough about digital rights to be motivated to participate sufficiently to achieve the required results to draft the declaration and also to get enough signatures on the e-petitions to mandate the appropriate level of response from our governments. For example there is the risk that we do not generate 100,000 signatures for our US and UK petitions to force national debates.
This is perhaps the biggest risk of all and in many ways speaks to the core reason of why we’re doing this project. There is a dangerous sentiment that is often cited in response to the question of how to enable privacy in a modern digitally connected age which proposes that we are moving into a world where all of our data will be in the cloud and hence available to all and that we should really just accept what, is positioned as an inevitable loss of privacy as a price for modern living. This idea proposes that privacy is effectively disappearing in the emerging digital world as a result of our data being ubiquitously available in the cloud.
It is our view that privacy in the modern world is not so much about the presence of our personal data in cyberspace as it is about the controls around who is allowed to have access to that information. On the basis that technology potentially accords us more controls today than we have ever had in the past to determine who can access our information, there is a valid argument to be made that we are in fact moving to a world with potentially greater privacy, not less. What however is required for such a world to become truly viable is a clear set of rules around who is allowed to do what with our data when. That is the heart of what this project is about and why we are doing it. We believe if we can get this message out to enough people then people will care. Not simply because this is important and fundamental but more importantly because it is a problem that can be solved, a problem for which there is hope as opposed to hopelessness.
We will launch a campaign to promote the project with which we hope will turn people’s apathy, which we believe is really underpinned by a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness to inspiration, empowerment and action.
6) Ineffectiveness risk
There is also a risk that with our best efforts and even if we amass several hundred thousand signatures to our petition that we will effect little or no change. This could be a result of having a team that is adept at crafting the declaration but lacks influence in getting any real endorsement of the declaration or it could be due to lack of political support. If we are successful in launching this project and in building this platform, developing this declaration and in securing the petition signatures we aim for but are not able to achieve our goal or endorsement and support of our declaration then we will launch another campaign next year aiming to raise more signatures and to make more noise and the same again the following year as necessary until we cannot be ignored any further. We will also from the outset seek the support of several influential politicians in the support of our project from both sides of the political isle to increase the viability and effectiveness of our campaign.
7) Festival Risks 
There are several risks around the staging of the Digital Rights Festival and concert planned for the end of the year. There are risks that it could cost more to organise than we have anticipated, that we are not able to secure appropriate venues, that we are not able to secure supporting performing artists for the concert or that they don’t show up. We believe the key to managing the risks around the festival and concert is to get a realistic sense of scale very early on. By the end of our Kickstarter campaign we will have a good view of the velocity and momentum of our initiative. With that in mind we will scale the festival and concerts appropriately for our trajectory. We will also look to work with corporate partners that can help us with logistics and operational support for the festival, which will also considerably de-risk it. We believe that the Digital Rights Festival could be a regular event. One that is held every year or couple of years to promote, enable and protect digital rights. The most important thing now is to plant the right seed for this.
We at Digitterra believe that nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come, and that Universal Digital Rights is an idea whose time has come.
Digital Rights are Human Rights. Stand up for yours.

Just a few days to step away from the reality of day to day work life and relax in what we thought was paradise. After a few of Coconuts on the beach, laughs over a bonfire and mediocre attempts of surfing, we decided to dive deeper into the countrysides of Indonesia and came to an island off the coast of Bali called Lombok. A beautiful Island that was recently devastated by a magnitude 6.9 earthquake leaving over 500 dead and over 350,000 people without homes. Some villages that we came to visit were 100 percent destroyed, all houses collapsed, roads were cracked and bridges were broken.</p><p>350,000 people left without homes or a way to consume clean drinking water. This was the first time in our lives where we ever saw people in the world struggling for a basic need like getting access to clean water and it was truly an eye-opening experience.</p><p>We knew while on the island we needed to do our part to help out, but didn’t know where to start. That was until we met a man by the name of Jeroen van Overbeek from Social Impakt. A former Vice-President of an international corporation managing over 800 employees, who quit his job in 2011 to follow his dream of helping those in need.</p><p>Jeroen founded Social Impakt in 2013 after moving to Asia and coming across the alarming statistics of children’s deaths from consuming unsafe water. After 6 years Jeroen and Social Impakt have continued to do an amazing job distributing safe, affordable, high impact ceramic water filters to remote villages in Indonesia.</p><p>We spent the remainder of the trip traveling to remote villages in Northern Lombok distributing water filtration systems to those in need.</p><p>The amount of compassion and love these people shared with us after providing them water was something we would never forget. They were climbing trees to pick us coconuts to drink… They were inviting us into their homes to meet their entire families… They were willing to take the shirt off their back and give it to us as a token of appreciation for the water we provided.</p><p>But we knew that this was just the beginning. In order for us to spread the word and continue providing water to those in need, we needed to put the power in the consumer's hand to make a difference. Everybody wants to make a difference but they don’t know how; which is why we created the Creations For A Cause Water Bracelet.

Some of these waterborne illnesses include Diarrhea, Giardiasis (intestinal illness from microscopic parasites), Dysentery, Salmonellosis, E Coli, Typhoid Fever, Cholera, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis E, and Campylobacter. It is quite evident that this is a worldwide epidemic and requires attention on a global scale. Unfortunately, world government programs and NGO’s are not enough to solve this issue. This global epidemic requires the attention of private citizens to come together and take action.Our mission and goal are quite simple, yet a significant challenge - to help end the global water crisis and provide everyone in the world access to clean water in our lifetime.So how do we plan to take on a goal of this magnitude? By creating a universal symbol and by providing an immediate resource to those in need to have access to clean water. We’re crowdfunding $15,000 to give us the capital necessary to continue to distribute our water filters and provide a sustainable water filtration resource to families and schools in rural east Bali. By distributing these water filters to rural families and schools, the Balinese will be able to experience first-hand the economic, environmental, and health benefits these filters provide. With your help, we will be able to continue to distribute these water filtration systems to families in Indonesia and expand all over the world.By contributing, you will receive our signature Creations For A Cause Water Bracelet. This bracelet is not just a normal bracelet. It is a symbol of hope and a symbol of support for Clean Water for all. By wearing this bracelet, we hope that it will start conversations about the global water crisis and we hope that it will empower you and others to take action and help raise awareness of the global water crisis.It all started with a backpacking trip to Bali, Indonesia. Just a few days to step away from the reality of day to day work life and relax in what we thought was paradise. After a few of Coconuts on the beach, laughs over a bonfire and mediocre attempts of surfing, we decided to dive deeper into the countrysides of Indonesia and came to an island off the coast of Bali called Lombok. A beautiful Island that was recently devastated by a magnitude 6.9 earthquake leaving over 500 dead and over 350,000 people without homes. Some villages that we came to visit were 100 percent destroyed, all houses collapsed, roads were cracked and bridges were broken.350,000 people left without homes or a way to consume clean drinking water. This was the first time in our lives where we ever saw people in the world struggling for a basic need like getting access to clean water and it was truly an eye-opening experience.We knew while on the island we needed to do our part to help out, but didn’t know where to start. That was until we met a man by the name of Jeroen van Overbeek from Social Impakt. A former Vice-President of an international corporation managing over 800 employees, who quit his job in 2011 to follow his dream of helping those in need.Jeroen founded Social Impakt in 2013 after moving to Asia and coming across the alarming statistics of children’s deaths from consuming unsafe water. After 6 years Jeroen and Social Impakt have continued to do an amazing job distributing safe, affordable, high impact ceramic water filters to remote villages in Indonesia.We spent the remainder of the trip traveling to remote villages in Northern Lombok distributing water filtration systems to those in need.The amount of compassion and love these people shared with us after providing them water was something we would never forget. They were climbing trees to pick us coconuts to drink… They were inviting us into their homes to meet their entire families… They were willing to take the shirt off their back and give it to us as a token of appreciation for the water we provided.But we knew that this was just the beginning. In order for us to spread the word and continue providing water to those in need, we needed to put the power in the consumer's hand to make a difference. Everybody wants to make a difference but they don’t know how; which is why we created the Creations For A Cause Water Bracelet. For every 4 Bracelets sold we donate 1 water filtration system to a family in need. When you purchase a bracelet from Creations For A Cause, you’re getting much more than a bracelet. You’re changing the lives of people all around the world. The filter is a ceramic filter which can filter 7000 liters of rain, tap or well water, which translates to 2 - 3 years of proper usage before needing to replace the filter. Our filter uses dutch technology which is proven to remove and kill 99.99% of bacteria from the water. Our Water Filter consists of ceramic that is mixed with silver and with a core of activated carbon. The filter itself contains pores smaller than 0.4 microns, which prevents microorganisms, bacteria, cyst, parasites, fungi, and other dangerous particles from getting through the filter and into the filtered water. The filter also contains activated carbon which reduces chemicals such as pesticides, chlorine as well as eliminates unpleasant odors and makes the water taste fresh. The silver stops microorganisms at its surface of the ceramic and helps to keep the stored water clean and fresh.By using this filter, households can properly filter their own tap, well, river or rainwater and ensure themselves a safe water solution. The filter is designed to remove bacteria and dirt from water and does so very effectively. Another benefit to this filter is the economic benefits for the end user. This filter is 30X cheaper than purchasing water and 5x cheaper than boiling water which provides immediate cost savings. Finally, these filters have a long lifespan. Each filter can support the usage of 7000 Liters of water, which will provide Clean Water to a family for 2-3 years.There are immediate cost savings to using the Our Filter compared to the alternatives. This filter is 30X cheaper than purchasing a 19 Liter water gallon and 5x cheaper than boiling water yourself at home. This allows users to save an average of $100 per year, which is quite significant as the average income in Indonesia is around $250/mo. Many third-world countries do not have any sanitation or recycling systems to properly remove plastics and waste from the environment. As a result, people throw away trash, plastics, and other wastes into their land and rivers which contaminates their waterways and causes sanitation hazards. Our filter removes the need for plastic bottles and reduces the waste which is littered around the world. Additionally, our filter reduces CO2 emissions and deforestation as gas and wood are currently being used to boil water in third-world countries to make it drinkable.  The Creations For A Cause Water Bracelet is not just a bracelet. It is a universal symbol for providing hope and life to the 844 Million people in the world that don’t have access to clean drinking water. By purchasing and wearing this simple, yet elegant bracelet, you are empowering yourself and the people around you every day that we all can make a difference in this world.Our Water Bracelet is created using sustainable, eco-friendly materials featuring glass beads, wax-coated polyester thread as well as a stainless steel charm. With a unisex design, this bracelet is perfect for both women and men of all ages.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

After viewing the film I was emotionally moved like many.  But unlike most I thought to myself that this practice did not need to continue and I had no choice but to do something about it.  I had very limited resources and was actually on food stamps at the time, I convinced a group of entrepreneurs and social influencers to contribute essays to a book to sell to raise money for charity. I raised $10k by myself so that the book could be published.  </p>

In the U.S., we are often inundated with images of Iraqis as victims of death and destruction. But this is an opening to show solidarity with actual people doing the hard work of organizing in their communities.</p><p></p><p>THE ASK:</p><p></p><p>I was asked to by the Federation to raise $1,500 to underwrite a portion of the costs of a conference, held in Baghdad the weekend of March seventh. This gathering brought together workers from across the country whose livelihoods and rights are under attack so that they could develop their strategy and determine next steps.</p><p></p><p>These funds will be used to pay for transportation, housing, and food for workers attending the conference, and to help underwrite organizing activities that follow (Iraqi unions are unable to collect dues because the Saddam-era law still enforced by the Iraqi government does not allow public and state enterprise employees to organize unions).</p><p></p><p>THE URGENCY:</p><p></p><p>Right now, public-enterprise workers in Iraq are under attack.</p><p></p><p>The Iraqi government is seeking to further privatize and slash the public sector by taking aim at state-owned companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and have a status called “self-financed,” meaning they are supposed to operate without government support.</p><p></p><p>Strangled by a dozen years of U.S.-led war and occupation, a divisive sectarian government, and now the related crisis of ISIS, many of these “self-financed” companies have simply stopped paying their workers and slashed jobs in the textile, leather, food production, petrochemical, electrical and other industries. The state, instead of pooling public resources to support the tens of thousands of workers who are impacted, is using this crisis as a pretext for further privatization.</p><p></p><p>The consequences include job-loss, wage theft, and an erosion of workplace rights with nation-wide implications.</p><p></p><p>The gutting of Iraq’s public sector is not taking place in a vacuum. Since the 2003 invasion, the U.S. government, along with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, has pressed for rapid privatization, down-sizing of the public sector and austerity. Furthermore, the U.S.-backed Iraqi government continues to embrace anti-worker labor policies carried over from the regime of Saddam Hussein.

In the U.S., we are often inundated with images of Iraqis as victims of death and destruction. But this is an opening to show solidarity with actual people doing the hard work of organizing in their communities.THE ASK:I was asked to by the Federation to raise $1,500 to underwrite a portion of the costs of a conference, held in Baghdad the weekend of March seventh. This gathering brought together workers from across the country whose livelihoods and rights are under attack so that they could develop their strategy and determine next steps.These funds will be used to pay for transportation, housing, and food for workers attending the conference, and to help underwrite organizing activities that follow (Iraqi unions are unable to collect dues because the Saddam-era law still enforced by the Iraqi government does not allow public and state enterprise employees to organize unions).THE URGENCY:Right now, public-enterprise workers in Iraq are under attack.The Iraqi government is seeking to further privatize and slash the public sector by taking aim at state-owned companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and have a status called “self-financed,” meaning they are supposed to operate without government support.Strangled by a dozen years of U.S.-led war and occupation, a divisive sectarian government, and now the related crisis of ISIS, many of these “self-financed” companies have simply stopped paying their workers and slashed jobs in the textile, leather, food production, petrochemical, electrical and other industries. The state, instead of pooling public resources to support the tens of thousands of workers who are impacted, is using this crisis as a pretext for further privatization.The consequences include job-loss, wage theft, and an erosion of workplace rights with nation-wide implications.The gutting of Iraq’s public sector is not taking place in a vacuum. Since the 2003 invasion, the U.S. government, along with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, has pressed for rapid privatization, down-sizing of the public sector and austerity. Furthermore, the U.S.-backed Iraqi government continues to embrace anti-worker labor policies carried over from the regime of Saddam Hussein. The austerity imposed on Iraq is part of a global—and devastating—trend, from Greece to Egypt to the United States.THE ORGANIZING:Workers and unemployed people are fighting back.Building on years of organizing, the Federation of Workers Councils and Unions in Iraq is mobilizing resistance to escalating attacks on the public sector. “We are in daily confrontations with the government, holding demonstrations, sit-ins, seminars, and agitating other sectors to take part,” Falah Alwan, president of the Federation, told me over email.The most recent convergence in Baghdad followed two previous conferences in Kut and Babil.The Federation—which strongly opposes U.S. occupation and military intervention—has repeatedly shown solidarity across national bounds. From the People’s Hearing on the legacy of the U.S. occupation of Iraq to a statement of solidarity with the Southern Maine Workers’ Center, the Federation has organized alongside international workers, anti-militarist organizers, veterans, and Diaspora communities displaced by militarism. Even while they are involved in their own struggle for their rights and survival, the Federation's electricity sector workers recently sent a message of support to the striking U.S. refinery workers. They understand the power of international solidarity. This is a chance for us to show we do too.WHO I AM:I’m raising this money as an individual.

<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>August 11, 2007 was a day of great pride for me. With the help of so many generous contributors like you, we were able to dedicate the Airborne Monument at Heartland of America Park. This statue stands as a testament to our nation’s fighting forces and veterans alike. The monument has become a popular destination not just for the local community, but for visitors from across the world. Each year, different veteran’s organizations travel to our community to visit this special tribute, which has helped establish Omaha as a premier meeting site for military veterans’ conventions and reunions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, it’s time to honor those Airborne Medal of Honor recipients by creating an addition to the Airborne Monument site. The addition will:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Include the names of all Airborne recipients across all branches of the military, from the Airborne’s inception in 1940 to present day</li>
<li>Show our gratitude to the veterans who have served and support those in active military</li>
<li>Be <strong><em>the only monument of its kind in the United States</em></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see the proposed marble wall addition below as a new mark of respect for our Airborne Medal of Honor recipients, and how it will enhance the Airborne Monument:</p>

<p>If you care about fair treatment for victimized LGBTI people 
worldwide, please help make it possible for me to defend a Cameroonian man sentenced to nine years in prison for homosexuality.<br/>
</p>
<p>I am one of a very few lawyers in Cameroon who are willing to defend LGBTI clients. Hate-filled residents from my region of Cameroon have threatened to kill me unless I let my client rot in prison. I won't do that, but I need your help with legal expenses.   I cannot do it all on my own.</p>

<h3>The shaky case against Cornelius Fonya</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Cornelius
 Fonya, 35, of Limbe, Cameroon, was convicted of same-sex relations with a man who appears to be more than 20 years old, but who submitted a fraudulent birth certificate that 
put his age as 16. In its verdict, the court relied on that 
evidence as accurate.<br/></p>
<p>In Cameroon, same-sex relations are against the law, punishable by a prison  sentence 
that's normally limited to five years. But if  someone between the
 ages of 16 and 21 is involved, the maximum 
sentence is doubled. Cornelius was sentenced to nine years in prison, plus an additional nine months because he cannot afford to pay a fine of 80,000 FCFA (US$139, or 122 euros). He is currently at Buea Central Prison, where prisoners live in overcrowded cells, They receive only one meal a day of 
poorly prepared, starchy food and only 4.4 ounces of soap every 
six months. <br/><br/>The prison is a breeding ground for scabies, eczema,
 head lice, thrush, skin rashes and ring worm. Cornelius has a fever and suffers from 
almost all of those ailments. He needs medication.</p>His trial was a travesty of justice. The relations between Cornelius and the young man were consensual, but the man's family denies that and even claims that the young man was driven insane by the encounter. The young man gave a statement to police, but stopped showing up in court. In the end, there were no witnesses against Cornelius, but the judge convicted him on the basis of statements that people had given to police. In addition, medical/legal documents 
were presented by prosecution witnesses that had never been introduced during 
police investigations.<br/><br/>
<p>Cornelius has been behind bars since Oct. 29, 2012, when he was attacked by a
 mob that hauled him to the police station and accused him of homosexuality. Before his trial, Cornelius posted money for bail 
and was set free, but he was re-arrested after the youth’s mother 
complained to the judge. I will appeal his conviction because of all the procedural irregularities that marred the trial. I will also seek his release on bail so he can be at liberty while we await the appeal court's decision.</p>I'll do all that even though people in Cameroon have threatened to kill me and my family if I continue representing Cornelius.  Right now my wife and I are in London for safety, but I will soon return to Cameroon to pursue the case.
<br/><br/><h3>The costs of defending him</h3>
<p>Here is what's needed to defend Cornelius:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Money to pay the costs of preparing and filing necessary legal documents in the case.</li>
<li>Money to cover the costs of additional court requirements, such as the paperwork required to 
allow Cornelius to
 appear in court each time his case is discussed. (Courts in Cameroon 
work slowly. Often a case is extended by multiple adjournments that 
occur when some of the judges on a legal panel fail to appear on the 
scheduled hearing dates. When that happens, I and my team must drive 
back home,  
return on the new date for a hearing -- and then it happens again.)</li>
<li>Two-way transportation by car from my home in Kumba to the court of appeals in Buea.</li>
<li>Food
 and lodging at a moderate-priced hotel in Buea before each court 
session. I don't want to risk arriving in court late if I'm delayed on my drive from 
Kumba to Buea.</li>
<li>Medicines and food for Cornelius while he is in prison. Without outside help, he gets no medical care and barely enough food to keep him alive.</li>

</div></div>","The Bead People International Peace Movement
Are you a dreamer?  What do you think will happen when hundreds of thousands of us make a call for peace?  We want to find out.  Our little thumb-sized peace ambassadors (The Bead People) are on the move carrying a message of peace around the world.  7000 have already gone to 20 countries with their story (The Wind of a Thousand Years).   We want to those numbers to grow. 
Our goal is to make The Bead People an international sign of peace and we want you to help us both by contributing to this campaign and by wearing your own Bead Person and spreading the word.    This campaign is designed to work both locally and on a larger scale.   Because of this all of our perks (except the first) give you--guess what--Bead People.  That way you can pass the message forward to your circle of friends.  Then go to www.thebeadpeople.org or go to our facebook page and become a friend.  We have plans to build curriculum, start chapters, and infect the world with small actions designed to create a global environment where people celebrate their differences instead of killing each other.  It's a simple plan, really. 
Our
Bead People on the Go Go campaign has three goals:  
1)   
To generate the funds to offer free
events to ten Boys and Girls Clubs or other summer youth programs. ($200 per
event x 10=$2,000) Our focus for now will be on northern Minnesota.
2)   
Provide the funds to print the next
1000 Wind of a Thousand Years books ($444.00).
3)   
And finally, to introduce people to The Bead People and invite them to include a project in their programs, conferences, classrooms and
communities as a way to engage conversation about creating peace. 
The Impact
I
would love to imagine that The Bead People will end war and world hunger—but
that is magical thinking.  I do, however,
believe that by engaging in peaceful actions, peace is the result.  Peace begins with the
small action, the smile, the gesture, the inner state of creating.  And it begins one person at a time.  We want you to join our community.
My husband, Milt, and I live in northern Minnesota and have done a number of youth projects already.  It is always a struggle for them to help with
even a small materials charge.  We want
to offer the children in the ten selectecd programs the excitement, fun, and
learning of this project at no cost to them. 

What We Need & What You Get
Like a yellow ribbon, we want the Bead People to stand for peace.  When you
see a Bead Person—you will recognize a relative and know that person stands for
peace and tolerance of each other. 
All
contributors will be honored on our Celebrate Each Other Peace Wall on our
website whether you give $1 or $10 or a $1000.  $25 donations include one Bead Person and a copy of the Wind of a Thousand Years in the mail. For this campaign, all of the Bead People given as campaign gifts will
be handcrafted by author, Jamie Lee, and include an autographed copy of the story.  For a $1000 donation, we personally invite you to visit us at Two Poles, our straw bale home in northern MN and spend a day making Bead people with Jamie.  (Travel not included.)
Following
the close of our campaign, we’ll immediately begin running the ten programs through
July and August.  You will continue to be
updated with pictures and film clips.  Your
contributions will help with travel, supplies and the time to do the ten
projects.
Other Ways You Can Help
Can you imagine a Bead People explosion across the planet?  
Here are all the ways that you can help. Top on the
list is to tell your friends about the project and invite people to get
involved through face to face, your favorite social media sites, or email.

Sometimes
it seems like we get blasted with the bad news from around the world.  We need to reverse that and begin to spread a
little good news.  Act in peace, smile,
play, enjoy one another, grow communities, celebrate our differences—all of
these are the core message of The Bead People International.  Please do join us.  We need your help. 
 Thanks you for helping us reach out to others.

</div></div>","Will you join us, the crazy ones? Find out why we believe we CAN make the world a better place!



CAABS is a radical way of thinking that can help improve the lives of vulnerable children regardless of where they live or the language they speak. 





We have to 'think differently' about how we encourage children to seek help and we should not be afraid of what they tell us, rather, we must support the child by tackling the issues effectively. 


We are a Social Enterprise in every meaning the word and proceeds from the licensing of this software to child protection agencies will be reinvested to provide Respite Holiday and Care Centres for the most vulnerable children. 


If you are a parent, teacher, social worker, child consultant, hospital or police staff, a child protection agency or a children's charity then you should JOIN US. 


CAABS is arguably the greatest project to be involved with TODAY that can bring real improvements to children's lives TOMORROW. 


Product One is CAABS Report for schools that allows children, especially those with disabilities, to raise awareness of any form of abuse with just 2 clicks of the mouse with No need to Read, Write or Talk using Visualisation.



 Real Time Demonstration of CAABS Report













Product Two is CAABS Safe which is a Visualised Risk Analysis Software made accessible as a web-based application that helps schools, social workers and child protection agencies to better understand the risks faced by a child and to deliver the quality of support they desperately need. 









By helping social workers and child protection agencies they will be better equipped to help children and their families rebuild their lives. Addressing the identified issues quickly is important because the longer a child is involved with the social care system the worse the outcome will be for the child.  






What we need and where the money will be spent. 
We have proven what such a tool will look like and what it can do using private funding. Our final hurdle requires us to raise a huge one off sum of $175,000 however:

We will not wait until we reach our target before we start work. Once we have reached $3K our developers who are working at a 1/4 rate will begin work. Time is of the essence, if we delay, more children will needlessly suffer. 


Every child abuse story you read is preventable. Help us to provide a cultural shift in how we deal with child abuse.

<p align=""center""><strong>United Students Against Sweatshops </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Bangladesh Delegation August 14-24<sup>th</sup> 2013</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>On April 24<sup>th</sup>, 2013 an eight-story building called Rana Plaza in Dhaka, Bangladesh collapsed claiming the lives of over 1,100 garment workers who produced clothing for US and European multi- billion dollar brands. This garment industrial disaster was the largest in history and claimed the lives of some of the most exploited workers in this world, most of them young women my own age. This tragedy happened on the heals of a victory against Adidas, where Indonesian workers from an illegally shut down factory, PT Kizone, fought and won their $1.8 million in severance pay that they were legally owned. United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) fought in solidarity demanding that our Universities cut contracts with Adidas due to these and other labor rights violation in order to pressure Adidas to respect workers rights. I was part of the struggle at Brown University to sever our contract with Adidas and with Brown Student Labor Alliance, a USAS affiliate, we successfully got the University to non-renew business with Adidas over labor rights violation. It was a bittersweet moment when days-later a thousand lives were taken by sweatshop conditions.</p>
<p>USAS is sending a delegation of seven students, myself included to Bangladesh with the goal of eradicating the death trap factory conditions in the Bangladesh garment industry, while building strong, sustainable unions of workers. USAS is the largest youth led solidarity network in the nation with 150 affiliated campus groups. We use the unique leverage of our Universities lucrative contracts with brands to pressure corporations to improve wages, working conditions and respect for basic workers rights on the garment factory floor. We are doing this delegation in recognition that this is a historic opportunity for change in Bangladesh. The Rana Plaza factory collapse is the biggest tragedy along a trend of fire-safety violation related tragedies in Bangladesh. Not only do Bangladeshi workers receive a poverty wage rate of $37 a month to produce apparel for multinational brands like Wal-Mart, the Children’s Place, and Joe Fresh, but since 2005, over 1,800 garment workers have died in factory fires and building collapses in Bangladesh alone. These tragedies are often preventable with workers aware of danger often reporting the conditions to management but are then threatened with withholding wages or being fired for speaking up. Multinational brands pressure factory owners to produce more apparel faster for very little money, forcing them to cut corners in safety and conditions.</p>
<p>But workers are fighting back and demanding that brands sign on to the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. This binding agreement between multinational brands and unions requires independent safety inspections with public reports, mandatory repairs and renovations, the obligation by brands and retailers to underwrite the costs and to terminate business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety upgrades, and a vital role for workers and their unions. More so, the National Garment Worker Federation in Bangladesh organized a sit in by 200 orphans of the Rana Plaza Factory collapse calling on brands to take monetary responsibility over the deaths from the factory collapse and demanding brands sign onto the Accord. On our delegation we will meet with these organizers and think through ways we, students and workers in the US, can organize in solidarity. This delegation will help us build the case to force brands like Wal-mart and GAP to sign on to the Accord.</p>
<p>Upon returning from our delegation we will produce materials for political education, including worker interviews, wage analysis, and reports of working conditions. These materials will be available for our broader USAS network to utilize in our fight for brand responsibility here on our front and to motivate students in the US to fight along side of the workers that are demanding better working conditions and who live the exploitative reality.  After the delegation, myself and the other delegates will be organizing report-backs and we will be available for interviews or presentation.</p>
<p> I appreciate the support that you have already shown me, the anti-sweatshop movement, USAS, and I hope you strongly consider this proposal for funding the delegation to Bangladesh. I am asking for donations to support me going on this delegation, which includes the cost of flights, housing, food, and visa expenses.

<li>Hello, my name is Sonja!</li>
<li>Having volunteered since I graduated to gain experience and exposure to work within child protection, criminal law and clinical settings, My research and passion to fight for the welfare of children, has enabled me to be accepted to pursue my PhD Project.</li>
<li>Through the Child Maltreatment and Child Wellbeing Project,  I aim to update and extend the current evidence on child abuse and child death in order to directly benefit victims within legal settings by comparing evidence from the UK, Australia and USA.  </li>
<li>So Why do people abuse children? --- &gt; My research into the similarities and differences between cases like Baby P, Jimmy Savile, (etc), in different countries may uncover clues to preventing abuse.</li>
<li>This international comparison has never been done before and is essential if I am to directly improve and challenge current policies, in order to reduce the number of victims of child abuse and child death, and gain justice for those who have suffered. <br/>
</li>

Hello, my name is Sonja!
Having volunteered since I graduated to gain experience and exposure to work within child protection, criminal law and clinical settings, My research and passion to fight for the welfare of children, has enabled me to be accepted to pursue my PhD Project.
Through the Child Maltreatment and Child Wellbeing Project,  I aim to update and extend the current evidence on child abuse and child death in order to directly benefit victims within legal settings by comparing evidence from the UK, Australia and USA.  
So Why do people abuse children? --- > My research into the similarities and differences between cases like Baby P, Jimmy Savile, (etc), in different countries may uncover clues to preventing abuse.
This international comparison has never been done before and is essential if I am to directly improve and challenge current policies, in order to reduce the number of victims of child abuse and child death, and gain justice for those who have suffered. 

I have known women and men who have suffered personally, but have not gained justice or the support they deserve, due to current policies and this needs to change. 
The money you donate is essential for this project to commence it will not only help children now but will impact on their futures and future generations. 
  What's Needed & What You Get: 
In order to gain unique access to multiple research facilities within the UK, Australia and America,  which will provide me with the academic resources, official documentation on current child abuse cases and relevant government policies, I am asking for a sum of £200,000.  
This money will provide me with the first building block which is essential for this project to start, only then will I have the opportunity to change policies and improve the wellbeing of children. 
Being accepted to pursue a personal PhD project is very rare so this is a unique opportunity that won't come round again. 
I have spent time gaining the specific knowledge and experience to enable the evidence I gather to be analysed efficiently. I can use the research I gather to implement changes and gain justice as soon as possible. --- The longer it takes for this research to occur, the more children will suffer and not only will they not get the support they need at the time and beyond but also justice they need and deserve. 
This will be ground-breaking and a chance to help protect children both through education and at home, as well as provide the latest evidence and research to the government and police forces to push for changes in current policies. WITHOUT THE EVIDENCE .... NO CHANGES CAN OCCUR!   The Impact your donation will have: 
Your donations, however big or small, will all contribute. 
They will enable me to gain access, collect and analyse current literature, interviews, court and police transcripts --- which is essential if any changes are to occur. 
You are the first building block and without this fund the project will take years if not longer to start, in which time more children will suffer and die. 
If I am unable to raise the full amount for this project to commence then I will of course donate the money that I do raise to charities who help protect children, such as the NSPCC. 
I have a 'can-do' attitude and I won't give up until changes are made to protect and reduce child abuse and death within the UK and across the world. 
With the evidence and research, I aim to attend conferences and public arenas to raise awareness of current issues AND provide new initiatives and policies which must be implemented to put an end to child maltreatment and promote child wellbeing.
 
Risks & Challenges

Challenge One: Finding the finance is the main challenge for this project---- >  I need YOUR HELP to make this happen.
Challenge Two: Raising awareness about my project, as well as awareness around the issue of child abuse and child death. A highly sensitive issue, it needs to be handled with care.
My relentless attitude, hard working nature and problem solving abilities has provided me with this opportunity and I won't let it slip me by until I have explored every avenue and no stone is left unturned.    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you cannot provide funds then please please spread the word about this project, whether that be when you are at work, or on the bus, or if you could link it on you social media websites - using the Indiegogo share tools. 
Without the money this project WONT happen but the MORE people know about it the higher the chances I will have of raising this money and pursuing the Child Maltreatment and Child Wellbeing Project.

<p>I’m very encouraged as I write this letter to you. The Lord has been doing tremendous things through our family. We have been overwhelmingly blessed in so many ways, not the least of which included the arrival of our little man Max this past February.<br/></p>
<p>Over the past several years God has impressed upon me a heart for a certain part of the world.

The purpose of this trip is to learn from my friends and<br/>partners in the country, identify areas of need and ways that God can use me to<br/>support these ministries over the long term. </p>
<p>My trip will take me to Guinnea Bissau, West <span>Africa where I will be<br/>staying with a family that I have built a tremendous relationship with over the<br/>last several years.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are working with the protestors of Capitol Hill, Seattle to create a safe and sustainable environment for them to protest for Black lives and BIPOC. This movement has gained national media attention and is setting a precedent for occupy protests around the country.</p>
<p>We are raising funds to help sustain this for as long as it lasts. The funds raised will be providing shelter, medical care, mental health services, food and water, as well as countless of other opportunities to people who might not necessarily afford these. There were days where we were on the front lines treating people who had been tear gassed and shot, and we need to prepare for this to be a possibility for upcoming weeks, if not months. It takes a village to make a city safe, so support us in our fight.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are doing this fundraiser without perks because we fully believe that you shouldn't need a deal-sweetener to make a difference in somebody's life. The funds we raise will be going to supplies for different stations, these include: medical, cooking, coffee, security, transportation, and more. You would be helping us get supplies akin to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical supplies (such as blood pressure cuffs, glucose strips, trauma supplies, etc.)</li>
<li>Blankets, pillows, sleeping bags, and tents for those without shelter</li>
<li>Handmade sink units for keeping us clean</li>

<li>Containers to hold supplies in</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, you can still share! COVID-19 has put a lot of us out of a job and the reason we're asking for financial help is because we can't afford it ourselves. With your donation or your share, you can help make a difference on hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>

<p>When Nasreen Sheikh was a 12 year old girl she did something no girl in her village had ever done before. She fled the poor farming village where she was born and traveled far away to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484967794/u4iyvu0xsdsafulhozvo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Nasreen at about 12 years</i></p>
<p>Her adult brother was based in Kathmandu and agreed to support Nasreen so she could escape the inevitable plight of a rural village girl: a forced arranged marriage to an older man, no education, domestic servitude and quite possibly violence at the hands of her spouse.</p>
<h3>Nasreen's Dream</h3>
<p>Her dream was to educate herself out of poverty and to decide her own destiny. Not long after arriving in Kathmandu Nasreen's brother became unable to support her and decided to send her back to village.</p>
<p>She yearned for an education, but was contemplating an inevitable return to the village where the cycle of poverty would continue.</p>
<p>She saw an American expat walking his dog in Kathmandu and, out of desperation, approached him and shared her plight. He agreed to help her stay in Kathmandu and since then he has helped her to learn a wide range of subjects including English, maths and philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>She started to think differently about a woman's role in the world and it inspired her to make a difference.</strong></p>
<p>Although Nasreen worked in a 'sweat shop' in order to survive, she had much bigger plans.</p>
<p><strong>At 14</strong> she recruited seven women at the sweat shop to join her in a fair trade sewing business that she planned to start.</p>
<p><strong>At 16</strong> she founded Local Women's Handicrafts, a fair trade handicrafts business which has now trained and employed over 100 women from disadvantaged backgrounds: women who have escaped arranged marriages, violence and oppression and are trying to raise children on their own.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484967865/rooicuthwpgvk0l5zpkc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Escaping an arranged marriage</h3>
<p>When Nasreen was 18 years old and had 20+ women working for her, her parents arranged for her to be married to a man from her village who she didn't know and was unlikely to meet before the marriage.</p>
<p>Marriage would have meant returning to her village and walking away from her business and her purpose. She refused and went into hiding and so far she has avoided being married (although was shunned by her village).</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485228692/bjvd2ityem2qjceuwqyu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>To help local girls, Nasreen and her sister Saheen also design, make and distribute free sanitary packs for local high school girls, including re-usable sanitary pads, underwear and soap.</p>
<p>Saheen visits local schools and teaches adolescent girls basic sanitation and how to use the pads. She also tries to break down the taboos about menstruation that exist in Nepal so that girls know it is perfectly natural and normal to have periods each month.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485223110/xdxippuhsxnwc1dmevhj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Initially the ladies working for Nasreen worked above the retail shop in Kathmandu but the landlord was unhappy about lower caste woman working there so Nasreen was forced to look for an alternative.</p>
<p>Kind-hearted customers came to the rescue via a crowdfunding campaign and a loan, enabling her to buy some land on the outskirts of Kathmandu and build a small brick structure for a work space. She still needed to rent a bamboo shack next door to fit everyone in.</p>
<p>The lease is nearly up on the rented shack and it cannot be renewed as the landlord plans to use it for himself.</p>
<p>Nasreen urgently needs help to complete the second floor of her building so that everyone can be under the one roof. It will give her the opportunity to employ more women as she currently has to turn needy women away.</p>
<p>For $15,000 AUD (approx $11,300 USD) Nasreen can complete the building to lock up and move everyone in.</p>

</div></div>","Some of the ladies of Local Women's Handicrafts



When Nasreen Sheikh was a 12 year old girl she did something no girl in her village had ever done before. She fled the poor farming village where she was born and traveled far away to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.

Nasreen at about 12 years
Her adult brother was based in Kathmandu and agreed to support Nasreen so she could escape the inevitable plight of a rural village girl: a forced arranged marriage to an older man, no education, domestic servitude and quite possibly violence at the hands of her spouse.
Nasreen's Dream
Her dream was to educate herself out of poverty and to decide her own destiny. Not long after arriving in Kathmandu Nasreen's brother became unable to support her and decided to send her back to village.
She yearned for an education, but was contemplating an inevitable return to the village where the cycle of poverty would continue.
She saw an American expat walking his dog in Kathmandu and, out of desperation, approached him and shared her plight. He agreed to help her stay in Kathmandu and since then he has helped her to learn a wide range of subjects including English, maths and philosophy.
She started to think differently about a woman's role in the world and it inspired her to make a difference.
Although Nasreen worked in a 'sweat shop' in order to survive, she had much bigger plans.
At 14 she recruited seven women at the sweat shop to join her in a fair trade sewing business that she planned to start.
At 16 she founded Local Women's Handicrafts, a fair trade handicrafts business which has now trained and employed over 100 women from disadvantaged backgrounds: women who have escaped arranged marriages, violence and oppression and are trying to raise children on their own.

 
Escaping an arranged marriage
When Nasreen was 18 years old and had 20+ women working for her, her parents arranged for her to be married to a man from her village who she didn't know and was unlikely to meet before the marriage.
Marriage would have meant returning to her village and walking away from her business and her purpose. She refused and went into hiding and so far she has avoided being married (although was shunned by her village).

To help local girls, Nasreen and her sister Saheen also design, make and distribute free sanitary packs for local high school girls, including re-usable sanitary pads, underwear and soap.
Saheen visits local schools and teaches adolescent girls basic sanitation and how to use the pads. She also tries to break down the taboos about menstruation that exist in Nepal so that girls know it is perfectly natural and normal to have periods each month.

New sanitary packs for 35 girls

Initially the ladies working for Nasreen worked above the retail shop in Kathmandu but the landlord was unhappy about lower caste woman working there so Nasreen was forced to look for an alternative.
Kind-hearted customers came to the rescue via a crowdfunding campaign and a loan, enabling her to buy some land on the outskirts of Kathmandu and build a small brick structure for a work space. She still needed to rent a bamboo shack next door to fit everyone in.
The lease is nearly up on the rented shack and it cannot be renewed as the landlord plans to use it for himself.
Nasreen urgently needs help to complete the second floor of her building so that everyone can be under the one roof. It will give her the opportunity to employ more women as she currently has to turn needy women away.
For $15,000 AUD (approx $11,300 USD) Nasreen can complete the building to lock up and move everyone in.

Nasreen: “If I do not succeed I will shame my family and the people from my village will point to me as an example of what happens when a woman tries to move above her place”.
PLEASE JOIN WITH US TO HELP HER SUCCEED!

A l'issue de ces rencontres, nous avons tous dû créer notre propre ""projet d'action"", afin de prouver notre engagement au quotidien contre la discrimination et l'exclusion. J'ai donc choisi de lancer cette campagne.


What is this ? Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette campagne ?





I have created this campaign because what struck me most, upon my arrival in Los Angeles, is the incredible number of humans living in homelessness, in spaces yet neighbored by Hollywood or Beverly Hills. Los Angeles has the highest population of homeless people in the entire nation : according to the Institute for the Study of Homelessness and Poverty at the Weingart Center, an estimated 254,000 individuals experience homelessness in Los Angeles County during some part of the year and between 33% and 50% of them are women, most of them women of color. The challenges they face everyday are immense, as everything is harder to come by, even the most simple things. Feminine hygiene products are one of those : they are seldom donated, expensive and desperately needed. Observing this, I saw the opportunity of building my ""Action Project"" around this issue, for I so deeply believe that all women should have access to basic personal care products.

Si j'ai choisi de lancer cette campagne, c'est parce que ce qui m'a le plus marquée, dès mon arrivée à Los Angeles, c'est le nombre de personnes sans domicile fixe, pourtant à deux pas d'Hollywood et Beverly Hills. Los Angeles a la population de SDF la plus large de tous les Etats-Unis : selon une étude du Weinghart Center, l'on en dénombre quelques 254 000 tout au long de l'année et entre 33% et 50% de ces sans abris sont des femmes, le souvent plus noires et hispaniques. Les défis que relèvent chaque jour les femmes sans abris, pour qui chaque produit, même des plus basiques, parait hors d'atteinte, sont innombrables. Parmi eux, les produits d'hygiène féminine : rarement font-ils partis de la liste de dons reçus par les associations, alors même qu'ils sont très chers, et absolument nécessaires. Devant ce constat, j'ai donc pris contact avec une structure spécialisée dans l'accompagnement de sans abris, qui a accepté de s'unir à mon projet.



This is where you come in ! C'est là que vous intervenez !

I called this campaign ""We All Want Dignity, Period !"", because, to me, this is what it all comes down to.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hi, my name is Carolyn. I'm a 59 yr old mom/grandma/FT student trying to make a better life. My youngest child (24) has been in trouble with the law, he has had drug/alcohol issues. He just spent 2 1/2 yrs in prison (on a 15 yr sentence) for stealing $10 from a man while he was drunk. Randy is now clean and sober, has job, trying to do what is right but after 8 weeks out he is arrested on warrant for ""alledgedly"" trying to call his 4 yr old son on his mom's cell while he was in prison last August. In May 2011 he filed a case to get visitation, didn't go to court until Nov. Judge gave him 1 phone call a week with son. If he goes back to prison he loses parental rights, Karson gets adopted by step-father, my family will never see him again till he is 18 or more. Please help, a Public Defender cannot help this case, we need a good Atty. Even the Atty's have said it is a 'witch hunt'.</div>

<p>They need $2500 down to even take the case. McKenzie Law Denise Sheldon Atty. Boise, Idaho. Many have quoted me $3500-6000 down.</p>
<p>I just got a PT job which hasn't started yet. I also drive school bus during school year. I'm going to have a BS in Criminal Justice in Sept. and want to go on to get an MSW (Master's in Social Work) to be a drug/alcohol counselor. I would like to eventually work with Vets w/PTSD. I have no extra money. School is Student loans.</p>
<p>My family means everything to me. No one is without mistakes in their lives, I am just trying to give Randy and Karson a fair chance at a future. I have never tried to do this before because I felt he made the mistake, now pay for it. This is just wrong. He was doing everything right and needs a chance to show he is clean and sober and loves his son.</p>
<p>Any amount will help, we are not giving up. His friends are going to have a Car Wash. We are trying anything. Please help, God Bless you all!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Atty told me if he goes to trial and the parole hearing without an Atty (not a PD) his chances of losing are 90% greater than if he has an Atty.</p>
<p>If he loses he will probably go back to prison for the remainder of the sentence which is 12 more years. His son will be 17 by then and Randy will be 37. I will be 71! In Idaho if he goes away that long he will lose parental rights, the son will get adopted by step-parent, and I lose any chance of Grandparent rights! After adoption in Idaho there are no Grandparent rights. Now I have a chance to sue to see my grandson.</p>
<p>The mother has tried to cut me and my family out of Karson's life since she got involved with the guy she married. Before that we were okay. I have bent over backward trying to do the right thing to see my grandson. Now I'm about to lose my son and grandson together. Please help this is unjust and unfair.</p>
<p>I don't have parents that can give me a free house and car. I just have me and my children and grandchildren. My firends help where they can.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have tried to get a Pro Bono Atty for the Family court case and for the Criminal Case to no Avail. We have tried that avenue for over a year for the Family court issues.</p>

Hi, my name is Carolyn. I'm a 59 yr old mom/grandma/FT student trying to make a better life. My youngest child (24) has been in trouble with the law, he has had drug/alcohol issues. He just spent 2 1/2 yrs in prison (on a 15 yr sentence) for stealing $10 from a man while he was drunk. Randy is now clean and sober, has job, trying to do what is right but after 8 weeks out he is arrested on warrant for ""alledgedly"" trying to call his 4 yr old son on his mom's cell while he was in prison last August. In May 2011 he filed a case to get visitation, didn't go to court until Nov. Judge gave him 1 phone call a week with son. If he goes back to prison he loses parental rights, Karson gets adopted by step-father, my family will never see him again till he is 18 or more. Please help, a Public Defender cannot help this case, we need a good Atty. Even the Atty's have said it is a 'witch hunt'.

<p><strong>Are you crazy?</strong></p>
<p>Some might say so, but I adhere to the idea that those who are crazy enough to think they can make a difference are the ones who actually do.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think this will be helpful to the libertarian community?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's important for us to connect with people on a personal level in order to advance this movement. We cannot simply rely on our computer or television screens in order to spread the message. Unfortunately, most people cannot dedicate 100% of their time to talking to others about libertarianism, answering questions, giving advice, etc. That's what I'm hoping to do. I'll speak with hundreds, and possibly thousands, of individuals about the topics important to them, and they might just be willing to talk to their friends, family, and neighbors afterwards. It's hard telling how many people I could introduce to the philosophy when we factor in the butterfly effect.</p>
<p><strong>You expect people to pay for your vacation?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know what sort of person would consider a 3184 mile, 8 month, misearble and grueling walk across the country a vacation. I'll be doing a lot of work on this trip to spread the message of liberty and share my experiences with others.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of homeless person needs $2500?</strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for donations so that I can focus on my message and not have to worry about how I'm going to pay for food and the other supplies I'll need to survive. I assure you that I will be sleeping outside 90% of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you taking your cat? Will he be safe and comfortable?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, I feel that Gooby is my responsibility and I cannot ask someone else to take care of him. He's like a child to me, and I will be loaded up with supplies to take care of him in case of an emergency. The cart will be outfitted with a fan to ensure that he isn't too hot, and it will be loaded with blankets and a heating pad to ensure that he doesn't get too cold. He's been training with me in preparation for this journey and I would not take him if I didn't feel confident that he is equipped to handle it. Here he is helping me plan our route through Arizona!</p>

<p>Amigos y amigas, hace 8 meses el arzobispo de Piura, Jose Antonio Eguren Anselmi, querelló a mi papá por difamación agravada. Tanto la petición que empecé yo en ese entonces, como la que propuso Amnistía Internacional hace poco, así como las fiestas que se hicieron para recaudar fondos, ayudaron a recibir un montón de apoyo solidario que hizo que mi padre no se sienta solo en todo este proceso. Como ya sabrán, ayer el sistema judicial nos volvió a decepcionar y mi papá fue sentenciado a un año de prisión suspendida, y encima tiene que pagarle al arzobispo sodálite 80, 000 soles por un delito que no cometió. Este juicio ha sido una sangría; el costo económico y emocional que ha significado para él y para toda nuestra familia es inimaginable. Lo mismo está por ocurrirle a Paola Ugaz, quien es coautora de la investigación que desmanteló los abusos perpetrados por el Sodalicio.</p>
<p>Con esta iniciativa, quería pedirles nuevamente su ayuda. Se ha abierto una cuenta para recaudar fondos con el propósito de financiar los gastos legales y de viajes.</p>

<h3>What is Queers 4 Queers?</h3>
<p>Queers 4 Queers is a Seattle-based, locally-focused non-profit organization working to improve queer quality of life in our city. We prioritize the needs of queers of color, as well as those who are disabled, immunocompromised, and/or impoverished.</p>
<p>Last summer, founder Xhavier Jacobsen was inspired by the grassroots efforts &amp; activism in our city. In the absence of a traditional, in-person Pride celebration, he wanted to support the local BIPOC transfemme community. He rallied the skills and involvement of Jonah St. Croix and Andy Wise, and the first Trans BIPOC Care Kit project was underway. Our tiny team contacted dozens of local businesses, collected thousands of dollars in gifts and donations for the cause, and ultimately created over 30 custom Care Kits for BIPOC transfemmes in Seattle, as well as almost 100 assorted Mini-Care Kits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622591639/t34vqoaodj9dghimuch1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Before the first Care Kits were delivered, we knew that providing material support to our queer peers was how we wanted to spend our time and effort going into the future. It was the beginning of a long and enthusiastic brainstorming session, beginning with Xhavier's notion to aptly name our organization Queers 4 Queers. We added Cort Olson's savvy to our petite Board of Directors, and began weekly remote meetings to hash out our hopes and expectations for the project.</p>
<p>Now, almost a year later, Q4Q is a state-certified non-profit with a website and a bank account - and big ideas to start putting into action.</p>
<p>Q4Q's biggest sophomore goal is to establish our most far-reaching regular program: <a href=""https://queers4queersorg.wixsite.com/q4qorg/peoples-pantry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the People's Pantry</a>. Developed by Jonah &amp; Xhavier in collaboration, the People's Pantry will be both a monthly event as well as a perpetual resource supplying the marginalized queer community of Seattle with a range of necessities, including personal &amp; household supplies, sexual health products, ungendered menstrual products, and HRT supplies. In order to collect, organize, safely store, and effectively distribute these goods, Q4Q needs a brick and mortar location.</p>
<p>But we're still working on existing projects (albeit on a smaller scale than we'd like) in the meantime:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622591712/rshvvgsm98nlcvtcemoi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>You read that timeline right: We're about relaunch our Trans BIPOC Care Kits project, and, at the same time, we are reaching for federal non-profit registration. Federal registration will open doors to grant and funding opportunities no amount of hustle alone can achieve. Being able to pursue grants and donations as a federally-recognized non-profit is the fastest - and arguably only - route to achieving the means to launch more Q4Q programs like the People's Pantry.</p>
<p>We just need the capital to gain the position to swing for the bigger capital, and that is where you as a donor come in.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>There are just a few, essential items Q4Q is trying to accomplish with this fundraiser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for the Q4Q federal non-profit application - a cost of $600</li>
<li>Secure a Q4Q phone number - a cost of ~$150</li>

</div></div>","What is Queers 4 Queers?
Queers 4 Queers is a Seattle-based, locally-focused non-profit organization working to improve queer quality of life in our city. We prioritize the needs of queers of color, as well as those who are disabled, immunocompromised, and/or impoverished.
Last summer, founder Xhavier Jacobsen was inspired by the grassroots efforts & activism in our city. In the absence of a traditional, in-person Pride celebration, he wanted to support the local BIPOC transfemme community. He rallied the skills and involvement of Jonah St. Croix and Andy Wise, and the first Trans BIPOC Care Kit project was underway. Our tiny team contacted dozens of local businesses, collected thousands of dollars in gifts and donations for the cause, and ultimately created over 30 custom Care Kits for BIPOC transfemmes in Seattle, as well as almost 100 assorted Mini-Care Kits.

Before the first Care Kits were delivered, we knew that providing material support to our queer peers was how we wanted to spend our time and effort going into the future. It was the beginning of a long and enthusiastic brainstorming session, beginning with Xhavier's notion to aptly name our organization Queers 4 Queers. We added Cort Olson's savvy to our petite Board of Directors, and began weekly remote meetings to hash out our hopes and expectations for the project.
Now, almost a year later, Q4Q is a state-certified non-profit with a website and a bank account - and big ideas to start putting into action.
Q4Q's biggest sophomore goal is to establish our most far-reaching regular program: the People's Pantry. Developed by Jonah & Xhavier in collaboration, the People's Pantry will be both a monthly event as well as a perpetual resource supplying the marginalized queer community of Seattle with a range of necessities, including personal & household supplies, sexual health products, ungendered menstrual products, and HRT supplies. In order to collect, organize, safely store, and effectively distribute these goods, Q4Q needs a brick and mortar location.
But we're still working on existing projects (albeit on a smaller scale than we'd like) in the meantime:


You read that timeline right: We're about relaunch our Trans BIPOC Care Kits project, and, at the same time, we are reaching for federal non-profit registration. Federal registration will open doors to grant and funding opportunities no amount of hustle alone can achieve. Being able to pursue grants and donations as a federally-recognized non-profit is the fastest - and arguably only - route to achieving the means to launch more Q4Q programs like the People's Pantry.
We just need the capital to gain the position to swing for the bigger capital, and that is where you as a donor come in.
What We Need
There are just a few, essential items Q4Q is trying to accomplish with this fundraiser:

Pay for the Q4Q federal non-profit application - a cost of $600
Secure a Q4Q phone number - a cost of ~$150
Secure an independent domain for the Q4Q website - a cost of ~$400
Cover printing, shipping, and administrative expenses - an estimated cost of ~$200
Further fund the Summer 2021 Trans BIPOC Care Kits Program!

Once we've covered these costs, every additional dollar this campaign collects will be applied toward both enhancing the Summer 2021 Trans BIPOC Care Kits and saving up for offices.  

The Impact
The Community
Getting Queers 4 Queers off the ground and operating on a federally-recognized level empowers us to facilitate not just a better quality of life for Seattle's most at-risk queer demographics, but tangible, material security and joy. In the words of some of the 2020 Care Kit recipients:

Not only did it make me cry, but it brought a HUGE smile to my face to know what lengths Xhavier and company were willing to go to make sure others in the community were reminded that they were loved, cared about and in the their thoughts. 10/10 they have my support!!!!”

Risks & Challenges
As practical queers, we like to ask ourselves - as we throw ourselves entirely into our shared passion project - what's the worst that could happen?
In a world where our goal is not reached, we put our noses to the grindstone & keep searching for ways to meet these fundamentals so that we can engage with the real work of benefitting the community. Meeting - or exceeding - our goal with this campaign will put us on track to deliver an incredible Holiday Gift program this winter! It will also allow us to focus on securing the funding for physical offices where we can stage more elaborate programs.

<p>Why this Campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m just your average red-blooded American; husband; father of two; looking to partake in the freedom to bear arms for sport, recreation and personal protection while that freedom is still being afforded to us in this country.</li>
<li>I am asking for your support because this freedom doesn’t come cheap.  I don’t have the individual means to currently provide the funding on my own while at the same time being responsible to the needs of providing for my family. </li>
<li>My sincere hope is that like-minded sportsmen will see this as an opportunity to make a public statement of solidarity for gun rights.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>I seek financial support for the purchase of a pistol caliber carbine from a community of like-minded sportsmen who understand the values of liberty &amp; freedom.</p>

<p>I’ve read story after story about how campaigns and contributions have brought people together around a cause:</p>

<li>Support the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment.  Support shooting sports.  Support liberty and freedom.</li>
<li>Perhaps this gets some larger attention… Show the media and Congress that liberty can also be sourced through crowdfunding.</li>

<p>I understand that not everyone can afford to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>

I am asking for your support because this freedom doesn’t come cheap.  I don’t have the individual means to currently provide the funding on my own while at the same time being responsible to the needs of providing for my family. 
My sincere hope is that like-minded sportsmen will see this as an opportunity to make a public statement of solidarity for gun rights.
What I Need
I seek financial support for the purchase of a pistol caliber carbine from a community of like-minded sportsmen who understand the values of liberty & freedom.

The gun has a retail price of $1,488. Goal – Fees = my Take-away $1,600 - Fees = $1,488.  Follow this link for more information: http://www.thureondefense.com/content/thureon-defense-ga-slide-fire-solutions-stock-octagonal-handguard-picatinny-rail-kit

If I don’t reach my entire goal, funds raised will be set aside in savings until such time as I can make this purchase.
The Impact
I’ve read story after story about how campaigns and contributions have brought people together around a cause:

Support the 2nd Amendment.  Support shooting sports.  Support liberty and freedom.
Perhaps this gets some larger attention… Show the media and Congress that liberty can also be sourced through crowdfunding.
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everyone can afford to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

Maybe you know someone who can support this campaign financially.  Help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
Remember, you can use the Indiegogo share tools to tell others who might be interested in helping fund the campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Humanitarian Aid: A Human Tragedy on our shores.</b></p>
<p>The refugee crisis is on OUR shores.
Here at the Archipelagos Institute of Marine conservation we are asking YOU to
help us help those desperately seeking safety. THOUSANDS of refugees are
arriving on the Eastern Aegean Islands EVERY DAY. They arrive exhausted having
left behind all their worldly belongings. Witnessing the fear and vulnerability
of these men, women and children has compelled us to try and provide basic
amenities to these people with the few supplies we have. The refugee crisis
worsens every day and we fear a hard winter is ahead of them, we need to do
more. Will you help us help them?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What will my money be used for?</b></p>
<p>Our priority is to provide refugees who
reach the shores of Samos and Agathonisi islands with basic amenities including
water, food, nappies, baby milk, clothes, shoes and medication, with priority
given to those who are most vulnerable, namely children, women and the elderly.
However if we receive sufficient donations we will be able to purchase
additional supplies such as sleeping bags, tents and waterproof jackets to make
the rough journey to Northern Europe they have ahead of them easier. 100% of
donations will go straight into buying products and providing services to make
the lives of the refugees better and bring smiles to the faces of those most in
need. For transparency we will be publishing invoices of EVERYTHING we buy with
YOUR donations so you can know how YOU made a DIFFERENCE.</p>
<p>EVERY LITTLE COUNTS! €1 = 4 litres of
water. €5 = 10 boxes of biscuits. €10 = 1 packet of nappies/diapers. €50 = 1
week of provisions for 1 person. €100 = 7 sleeping bags or 10 waterproof
jackets. Please give anything you can.</p>
