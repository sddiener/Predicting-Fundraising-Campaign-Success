<h3>Consumers Like Us are the Engine That Drives 70%
of the American Economy</h3>
<p><b>The average American has far more power</b> to effect positive change than we realize. Help publish the book that will show the average consumer how to use that power to bring about real change for all Americans, not  just the wealthiest 400 people that together own most of the assets in the country.</p>
<p><b>The book shows how to make small painless changes to where we</b> deposit, spend, insure, invest, etc. and earn our money to places where we actually own part of the place. We can save money and pay less in fees because these places aren't large corporations who's main goal is to earn profits from you to pay investors. <br/></p>
<p><b>Because you own the place</b> you also have a say in the way they're run. If you have an idea about how to improve something or have a complaint you have a right to be heard. You can even put your hat in the ring to help run it if you wish. Try that at Mega-mart. Many of these places are already quietly in your area, if not the book shows how to help get them started. <br/></p>

<p>My name is Laurenn Barker. I have been a lifetime artist and writer, having spent more than 30 years in the fields of communications and publishing.  My career has incorporated graphics, illustration, photography and writing and I have designed and produced six books, in addition to the five Lae Lae books which are currently available.</p>
<p>At the same time, however; I have also been active in children's causes in three states across the U.S. and have been on the boards of several organizations devoted to child and family services.  I am also a mother of three and a grandmother of six.</p>
<p>The future of the world literally depends on what we teach our children today and I am deeply committed to the well-being of children now and into the future. Children need love, support and positive guidance to grow into happy, self confident, responsible adults.  The Lae Lae collection is devoted to these goals.</p>
<p>In this era of the ""disappearing book"" when everything is online and children are left in front of the television for long periods, books like the Lae Lae books are increasingly important.   It has been proven that reading to a child for just twenty minutes a day makes a huge positive difference in the life of the child.  The Lae Lae books are developed for children, ages 2 to 6, a most vulnerable and impressionable age, to be used for the all important ""cuddle time"" with a parent or caregiver.  The lessons children learn at this age will stay with them for life.  The books feature a real child not a cartoon character and real experiences which a child will have, both happy and also challenging.  </p>
<p>Each book is 8.5 x 8.5, 4 color, soft cover, and 40 pages in length. Each includes a short story, coloring pages and activities for the child to enjoy with an adult.  Each book also includes a CD with pages from the book and stickers that can be printed out on the computer.  A separate insert of parent's notes with suggestions of teachable moments and thought provoking questions to ask a child based on the story are also included with each book.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Funding from this campaign will be used to develop new books and to translate all books into languages other than English.  The next two books are in development now; one is about Lae Lae's learning to play with a new friend who has a physical challenge and the other is about Lae Lae and her friends visiting the ocean and learning about the life of the ocean.  </p>
<p>The books are being produced by a major print on demand company and will be sold primarily through Internet sales but also locally through preschools and organizations devoted to very young children.  If the entire funding goal is not met, whatever funding does come in will be stretched as far as it can be to reach those goals.</p>
<p>A portion of the sales of the books is being donated to causes that benefit children, animals and the environment.</p>
<p>I am asking for contributions for <strong>$10 to $500.</strong></p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$10</strong>, the contributor will receive a thank you via email and a thank you on the Lae Lae Facebook fan page.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$25</strong>, the contributor will receive a signed copy of the first book in the series, the <strong>""Lae Lae Adventures""</strong> and a thank you on the Lae Lae Facebook fan page.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$50</strong>, the contributor will receive a signed <strong>""Lae Lae Adventures""</strong> book, a signed Lae Lae print suitable for framing, a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$75</strong>, the contributor will receive a signed copy of all five books currently available in a beautiful gift box, a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$100</strong>, the contributor will receive a signed copy of all five books currently available in a beautiful gift box, a Lae Lae T-shirt for you or your child (please designate size), a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$150</strong>, the contributor will receive all of the above and a small gift box with personal accessories for the child which matches the collection. The box will ship flat.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$250</strong>, the contributor will receive all of the above and a framed and autographed Lae Lae book cover.</p>
<p>For contributions of <strong>$500</strong>, the contributor will receive all of the above and the option of helping write a Lae Lae collection book which will be dedicated to the contributor.

Funding from this campaign will be used to develop new books and to translate all books into languages other than English.  The next two books are in development now; one is about Lae Lae's learning to play with a new friend who has a physical challenge and the other is about Lae Lae and her friends visiting the ocean and learning about the life of the ocean.  
The books are being produced by a major print on demand company and will be sold primarily through Internet sales but also locally through preschools and organizations devoted to very young children.  If the entire funding goal is not met, whatever funding does come in will be stretched as far as it can be to reach those goals.
A portion of the sales of the books is being donated to causes that benefit children, animals and the environment.
I am asking for contributions for $10 to $500.
For contributions of $10, the contributor will receive a thank you via email and a thank you on the Lae Lae Facebook fan page.
For contributions of $25, the contributor will receive a signed copy of the first book in the series, the ""Lae Lae Adventures"" and a thank you on the Lae Lae Facebook fan page.
For contributions of $50, the contributor will receive a signed ""Lae Lae Adventures"" book, a signed Lae Lae print suitable for framing, a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.
For contributions of $75, the contributor will receive a signed copy of all five books currently available in a beautiful gift box, a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.
For contributions of $100, the contributor will receive a signed copy of all five books currently available in a beautiful gift box, a Lae Lae T-shirt for you or your child (please designate size), a thank you on the Lae Lae fan page and acknowledgement in upcoming books.
For contributions of $150, the contributor will receive all of the above and a small gift box with personal accessories for the child which matches the collection. The box will ship flat.
For contributions of $250, the contributor will receive all of the above and a framed and autographed Lae Lae book cover.
For contributions of $500, the contributor will receive all of the above and the option of helping write a Lae Lae collection book which will be dedicated to the contributor. The book subject must be compatible with the collection as it is being developed and must be suitable for the 2 to 6 year old age range.

<br/><h3>What is the book about?</h3>
<p><i>-Not-Forgotten: The Writer Who Overcame Anxiety and Depression </i>is about four individuals that I met during my last South American trip. A <b>Writer</b>, a <b>Musician</b>, an <b>Old Sculptor</b>, and a<b> Nurse</b>. These four had an extraordinary creativity and peculiarity that they used to fight their life problems. Their stories were simply majestic. And, although their stories are entirely true, I wrote the book using a poetic writing-style. </p>
<h3>The Main Protagonist: The Writer<br/>

<br/><p>Amanda is an introverted girl who struggles with her speech. She can't communicate well with others because of her frequent anxiety attacks. Because of that, she doesn't have friends and family. This leads her to have several suicide attempts. However, she discovers the power of writing. <br/></p>

Moreover his anxiety increases monumentally. Nonetheless, before his anxiety makes him insane, he decides to dedicate the rest of his life to inspire his fellow citizens for a political change. Then, he meets Amanda.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><h3></h3>

-Not-Forgotten: The Writer Who Overcame Anxiety and Depression


What is the book about?
-Not-Forgotten: The Writer Who Overcame Anxiety and Depression is about four individuals that I met during my last South American trip. A Writer, a Musician, an Old Sculptor, and a Nurse. These four had an extraordinary creativity and peculiarity that they used to fight their life problems. Their stories were simply majestic. And, although their stories are entirely true, I wrote the book using a poetic writing-style. 
The Main Protagonist: The Writer



Amanda is an introverted girl who struggles with her speech. She can't communicate well with others because of her frequent anxiety attacks. Because of that, she doesn't have friends and family. This leads her to have several suicide attempts. However, she discovers the power of writing. 
The Musician

 Tania is an extroverted musician who is trying to get recognition in a world where musicians are not taken seriously. Her constant failures cause her to consider her life worthless and unimportant. Her life changes when she meets Amanda.The Old Sculptor

Gaudencio Tómas is a Politician and an Sculptor. He dedicated his whole life to politics in order to save his country; however, he achieved nothing. He is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has only a few months left to live. Moreover his anxiety increases monumentally. Nonetheless, before his anxiety makes him insane, he decides to dedicate the rest of his life to inspire his fellow citizens for a political change. Then, he meets Amanda.  
The Nurse


Eduarda is a young nurse. She believes that there is no ""bad"" in the real world.  However, her notions are shattered when several revolts take place. (Based in the recent Venezuelan Revolts)
Where are the funds going to?
As an inexperienced and new author, I didn't know a lot of things. In fact, I almost fell for a ""vanity publisher"". I know that being a new author is not an excuse for not knowing things that I should have known. Now, thanks to numerous persons in my life, I was able to know more about the publishing industry and the publishing process; and I also got to know how much better it is to self-publish. And now, that I'm self-publishing, I also understand that I'm not an expert. I understand where I'm standing. And I also understand that I need the help of experts in order to do a professional work.  That's exactly where the funds are going.  The funds are in order to pay properly the professionals who will help me in the tasks listed above. 

  What Do You Get?

If you contribute $1-5, you will receive a customized thank-you email. Or if you just want a normal thank-you email, that's also fine.
If you contribute $10-15, you will receive a customized illustrations. You can ask me anything you want me to illustrate and I will do so. It can be your portrait or the portrait of a loved one. Or, a feeling, an emotion, a memory, a story. Anything you want me to illustrate. 

If you contribute $25, you will receive a PDF version of -Not-Forgotten , one week before the official launch release. 

If you contribute $50, you will receive a printed version of -Not-Forgotten, one week before the official launch release.

financially, that's okay. Here's how you can help... and yes, it 
will really help!

<p>This summer, 6 dynamic young people from Atlanta will be
representing our city in the 2014 <a href=""http://youthspeaks.org/bravenewvoices/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brave New Voices International
Youth Poetry Slam Festival</a>. For those who aren’t already aware, Brave New
Voices can best be likened to the youth poetry Olympics, which was first
organized in 1998 by <a href=""http://youthspeaks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouthSpeaks</a> and remains the largest ongoing
spoken word event in the world. Brave New Voices is so inspiring and impacting that<a href=""http://www.hbo.com/russell-simmons-presents-brave-new-voices#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HBO
even made an entire series</a> in 2010 about the participating teams preparing
for and competing in the festival. But even when not in the limelight, at its
core, Brave New Voices is a platform for over 1,000 youth poets from all across
the world to perform on an international stage and partake in fellowship with
one another. </p>
<p>This year, the 17<sup>th</sup> annual Brave New Voices will be hosted
in Philadelphia, PA from July 16-19. And for the 6<sup>th</sup> straight year, Atlanta
Word Works will be fielding the official Atlanta Team, hoping to surpass last

will be attending Howard University in Washington, D.C. this fall. Though she
was born in Dallas, TX, she lives in East Point, GA with her
professional-singer mother, from whom she has inherited her own vocal talent.
Jai’s favorite things to do around town are sitting in her secret writing spot
on a shaded hill in Old Fourth Ward Park and eating her favorite hot lemon
pepper wings at one of Atlanta’s many American Delis, which she supplements
with a daily green apple and kale salad. Her favorite book is <u>The Skin I’m
In</u> by Sharon G. Flake, and she loves to watch historical documentaries. The
band that has influenced and inspired Jai the most is Paramore, citing their
“Misguided Ghosts” as her favorite song. Maya Angelou is her favorite poet
because she gave Jai a voice to believe in when she was still trying to find
her own. The first spoken word artist she’d ever heard of was Jasmine Mans, and
she has inspired Jai to keep writing ever since. Jai loves Atlanta Word Works for
helping her to uncover those things we all keep hidden, and she believes that
it is a place where one can find “healing through writing.”</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4 align=""center""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Anthony Gagliardi</span></h4><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646548/files/20140613064523-IMG_1545.JPG?1402667123"" src="""" style=""width: 420px; height: 280px;""/></p>Anthony is
17 years old and attends Hillgrove High School in Powder Springs, GA. Despite
being born between the Powder Springs and Marietta areas, he loves the downtown
Atlanta space –especially at night or early in the morning – and he’s awed by the
energy and atmosphere in Little 5 Points. Anthony relates most to John Green’s
debut novel <u>Looking for Alaska</u>, and The Mountain Goats is his favorite
band, which he enjoys because of the lead singer’s longevity and consistency.
His favorite poet is Allen Ginsberg, and his favorite spoken word artist is Eric
Darby. Anthony specifically recalls Darby’s “Scratch and Dent Dreams” as the
first poem that drew him into the art of spoken word poetry.  Anthony thrives from living outside of his
comfort zone and building new friendships to take in new experiences, which is
why he likes being a member of Atlanta Word Works.<br/><br/><p></p><h4 align=""center""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Jessica Vernon</span></h4><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646552/files/20140613064654-6P1A8886_pp.JPG?1402667214"" src="""" style=""width: 234.324px; height: 351px;""/></p>Jessica is

Georgia Southern University in the fall. She was born and raised in Atlanta, and
her favorite places to frequent are Little 5 Points and downtown. Not only is
Jessica a phenomenal writer, she is also a professional photographer. Of all the
books she has read, <u>Siddhartha</u> by Hermann Hesse has stimulated and
encouraged her the most, and the film version of <u>RENT</u> has influenced her
tremendously. Jessica’s favorite band is Coldplay, describing them as an
“honest and touching collective.” Walt Whitman is her favorite poet – as his
words often inspire her to be original and honest – and she is moved by the
unapologetic presence that Kai Davis provides by simply stepping on stage. More
than anything else, Jessica loves Atlanta Word Works because of the group’s love,
closeness, and that “it feels like family.”<br/><br/><p></p><h4 align=""center""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Francisco Ormando Velasquez</span></h4><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646554/files/20140613064745-6P1A8791_pp.JPG?1402667265"" src="""" style=""width: 232.23px; height: 348px;""/></p>Francisco is
a 16-year-old Shiloh High School student who plans to be enrolled in the Savannah
College of Art and Design by fall of next year. He’s an unexpected “underdog”
who is far more industrious than people typically perceive. He lives in
Snellville, not far from the landmark Stone Mountain, and his two favorite
spots in Atlanta are Atlantic Station at night and, as one might expect, standing
atop Stone Mountain. Francisco has been inspired by the storytelling in both
the book and the film adaptation of <u>The Wolf of Wall Street</u>, as originally
written by Jordan Belfort. The spoken word artist who has encouraged him the
most is Joshua Stewart, but Francisco has not settled on a favorite poet as of yet.
His favorite aspect of Atlanta Word Works is that “we all come from different

be attending Georgia State University in the fall. When he’s not writing poems,
you’ll likely find him somewhere in Atlanta sharpening his chess skills, and
one would expect nothing less from the president of the high school chess club,
which he also founded. Cole hails from the East Atlanta/Decatur region, and one
of his favorite places to frequent in the city is Atlantic Station, which he
enjoys for its open and inviting atmosphere. His favorite book, <u>Holes</u> by
Louis Sachar, is also his favorite movie, which Cole likes because the story
“centers on hope, faith, and the importance of friendship.” He cites Linkin
Park as his favorite band, and their song “Waiting for the End” as his most
loved. The poet from which Cole draws most of his inspiration is Kali Scurdy, and
his most revered spoken word artist is Christopher Wallace (better known by his
stage names Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls). Finally, the main thing Cole
likes about Atlanta Word Works is the group’s loving atmosphere, and that it truly
exists as a “safe zone.” </p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

part of his life, he now needs to find more hobbies. His favorite places to
frequent in the Atlanta area are Piedmont Park and The Goat Farm Arts Center. Josh
has never been an avid reader, but the book that has stuck with him most
throughout the years is <u>The Giving Tree</u>, by Shel Silverstein. He draws
inspiration from so many profound poets and writers, but at this moment, Buddy
Wakefield and Natalie Cook are the main poets/spoken word artists who motivate
him to be better. He is in love with music, and the band Explosions in the Sky

Brave New Voices, and he has since become a mentor for the group and a coach
for the 2013 and 2014 teams. His favorite part about being a member of Atlanta

Atlanta’s amazingly talented youth poets have
the esteemed opportunity to attend and compete in the Brave New Voices poetry
slam festival this summer. But to get there, we need your help! There are only
50 spots for teams at the competition, and Team Atlanta's invitation is contingent upon our
raising the money to register for and get to the competition. We have already selected
a strong team of youth poets, and have experienced coaches and mentors training
and preparing them for the competition, but now we need the backing of our
community. And with your support, we’ll have the chance to put our southern city
on the literary map and our team of poets upon the finals stage.
So please consider contributing to the arts, to
youth in arts, and to the Atlanta spoken word movement by donating your money,
your time, your talent, and your love.

More About Brave New Voices (BNV)
This summer, 6 dynamic young people from Atlanta will be
representing our city in the 2014 Brave New Voices International
Youth Poetry Slam Festival. For those who aren’t already aware, Brave New
Voices can best be likened to the youth poetry Olympics, which was first
organized in 1998 by YouthSpeaks and remains the largest ongoing
spoken word event in the world. Brave New Voices is so inspiring and impacting thatHBO
even made an entire series in 2010 about the participating teams preparing
for and competing in the festival. But even when not in the limelight, at its
core, Brave New Voices is a platform for over 1,000 youth poets from all across
the world to perform on an international stage and partake in fellowship with
one another. 
This year, the 17th annual Brave New Voices will be hosted
in Philadelphia, PA from July 16-19. And for the 6th straight year, Atlanta
Word Works will be fielding the official Atlanta Team, hoping to surpass last
year’s achievement of verbally sparring in the semi-finals round. Meet Team Atlanta 2014
The top 6 youth poets from the greater Atlanta area have already
proven themselves in 2 local, qualifying slams, and now they’re primed and ready
to share their words with the world. Our 2014 team is comprised of the
brilliant minds and truthful poetics of these talented young people. Read
more about how awesome they are below.The Youth Poets
Jai Amirrah Rodgers 
Jai is an 18 year old Tri-Cities High School graduate who
will be attending Howard University in Washington, D.C. this fall. Though she
was born in Dallas, TX, she lives in East Point, GA with her
professional-singer mother, from whom she has inherited her own vocal talent.
Jai’s favorite things to do around town are sitting in her secret writing spot
on a shaded hill in Old Fourth Ward Park and eating her favorite hot lemon
pepper wings at one of Atlanta’s many American Delis, which she supplements
with a daily green apple and kale salad. Her favorite book is The Skin I’m
In by Sharon G. Flake, and she loves to watch historical documentaries. The
band that has influenced and inspired Jai the most is Paramore, citing their
“Misguided Ghosts” as her favorite song. Maya Angelou is her favorite poet
because she gave Jai a voice to believe in when she was still trying to find
her own. The first spoken word artist she’d ever heard of was Jasmine Mans, and
she has inspired Jai to keep writing ever since. Jai loves Atlanta Word Works for
helping her to uncover those things we all keep hidden, and she believes that
it is a place where one can find “healing through writing.”Anthony GagliardiAnthony is
17 years old and attends Hillgrove High School in Powder Springs, GA. Despite
being born between the Powder Springs and Marietta areas, he loves the downtown
Atlanta space –especially at night or early in the morning – and he’s awed by the
energy and atmosphere in Little 5 Points. Anthony relates most to John Green’s
debut novel Looking for Alaska, and The Mountain Goats is his favorite
band, which he enjoys because of the lead singer’s longevity and consistency.
His favorite poet is Allen Ginsberg, and his favorite spoken word artist is Eric
Darby. Anthony specifically recalls Darby’s “Scratch and Dent Dreams” as the
first poem that drew him into the art of spoken word poetry.  Anthony thrives from living outside of his
comfort zone and building new friendships to take in new experiences, which is
why he likes being a member of Atlanta Word Works.Jessica VernonJessica is
a 17-year-old Southwest Dekalb High School graduate who will be attending
Georgia Southern University in the fall. She was born and raised in Atlanta, and
her favorite places to frequent are Little 5 Points and downtown. Not only is
Jessica a phenomenal writer, she is also a professional photographer. Of all the
books she has read, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse has stimulated and
encouraged her the most, and the film version of RENT has influenced her
tremendously. Jessica’s favorite band is Coldplay, describing them as an
“honest and touching collective.” Walt Whitman is her favorite poet – as his
words often inspire her to be original and honest – and she is moved by the
unapologetic presence that Kai Davis provides by simply stepping on stage. More
than anything else, Jessica loves Atlanta Word Works because of the group’s love,
closeness, and that “it feels like family.”Francisco Ormando VelasquezFrancisco is
a 16-year-old Shiloh High School student who plans to be enrolled in the Savannah
College of Art and Design by fall of next year. He’s an unexpected “underdog”
who is far more industrious than people typically perceive. He lives in
Snellville, not far from the landmark Stone Mountain, and his two favorite
spots in Atlanta are Atlantic Station at night and, as one might expect, standing
atop Stone Mountain. Francisco has been inspired by the storytelling in both
the book and the film adaptation of The Wolf of Wall Street, as originally
written by Jordan Belfort. The spoken word artist who has encouraged him the
most is Joshua Stewart, but Francisco has not settled on a favorite poet as of yet.
His favorite aspect of Atlanta Word Works is that “we all come from different
walks of life, but we all accept our differences,” and he is most excited for
the connections he now has the opportunity to make, not only through Atlanta
Word Works, but also with the various poets at Brave New Voices. Cole Xavier Jones-FordCole is an 18-year-old graduate of Martin Luther King, Jr. High School who will
be attending Georgia State University in the fall. When he’s not writing poems,
you’ll likely find him somewhere in Atlanta sharpening his chess skills, and
one would expect nothing less from the president of the high school chess club,
which he also founded. Cole hails from the East Atlanta/Decatur region, and one
of his favorite places to frequent in the city is Atlantic Station, which he
enjoys for its open and inviting atmosphere. His favorite book, Holes by
Louis Sachar, is also his favorite movie, which Cole likes because the story
“centers on hope, faith, and the importance of friendship.” He cites Linkin
Park as his favorite band, and their song “Waiting for the End” as his most
loved. The poet from which Cole draws most of his inspiration is Kali Scurdy, and
his most revered spoken word artist is Christopher Wallace (better known by his
stage names Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls). Finally, the main thing Cole
likes about Atlanta Word Works is the group’s loving atmosphere, and that it truly
exists as a “safe zone.” 
Ruby GleberRuby is
an 18-year-old Habersham Central High School graduate from Gainesville, GA who
will be attending the Georgia Institute of Technology in the fall. She loves cross
fit training and also works a personal fitness trainer. Her favorite movie is The
Rocky Horror Picture Show simply because it “defies normalcy and crosses
boundaries.” Her most-loved musician and artist is Michael Jackson, and one of
her many favorite songs of his is “Human Nature.” Siddhartha, by Hermann
Hesse, is Ruby’s favorite book because the main character’s efforts of finding
peace within herself mirror those of her own. The revolutionist poet Pablo
Neruda has influenced Ruby mostly through his love poems, and the spoken word
artist Alysia Harris inspires her to have an insightful and creative
perspective of life. Above all else, what Ruby likes most about Atlanta Word
Works is “the honesty and immediate acceptance” the group extends to all its
members.The CoachesNatalie Cook: 21, Head Coach, AWW Founder and Executive DirectorNatalie is a writer, performance artist, and

Works, she has also taught numerous workshops in writing and spoken word at The Global Village, as well as at her
alma mater, the DeKalb School of the Arts. Natalie was once a competing member
of the Atlanta slam team she now coaches, has individually won several writing
contests and poetry slams, and has performed at many venues around the country
and across the globe. She has also shared the stage with artists such as John
Legend, Nikki Giovanni, Saul Williams, Sonia Sanchez, and MC Lyte. Natalie
premiered her own-woman show, “Some May Think Light Isn’t Heavy,” in Madison,
WI in March 2013.Joshua Stewart: 22, Assistant Coach, 2011 BNV Team MemberJosh was born in Stone Mountain, GA and is currently studying the rhetoric
of revolutionary social and political movements at Georgia State University. Poetry
was once his “unexpected x-factor,” but since it has become such an integral
part of his life, he now needs to find more hobbies. His favorite places to
frequent in the Atlanta area are Piedmont Park and The Goat Farm Arts Center. Josh
has never been an avid reader, but the book that has stuck with him most
throughout the years is The Giving Tree, by Shel Silverstein. He draws
inspiration from so many profound poets and writers, but at this moment, Buddy
Wakefield and Natalie Cook are the main poets/spoken word artists who motivate
him to be better. He is in love with music, and the band Explosions in the Sky
has ushered him through many rough and beautiful moments. 
Josh was one of the youth poets for the 2011 team that Atlanta sent to
Brave New Voices, and he has since become a mentor for the group and a coach
for the 2013 and 2014 teams. His favorite part about being a member of Atlanta
Word Works group is that he is afforded an opportunity to pour back into an
organization that continues to instill so many great values in him.Justin Barisich: 25, Assistant CoachThough he originally hails from New Orleans, Justin earned his poetry
chops at Vanderbilt University (where he majored in English Literature and
Secondary Education) in Nashville before moving to Midtown Atlanta. As an
inaugural member of Vandy Spoken
Word, the school’s only performance poetry group, Justin grew from a mediocre
poet (and a rather pitiful performer who knew nothing of stage poetry) into the
group’s president in just 3 short years – all the while learning the art form
from those wiser and more experienced. He’d go on to mentor more than 30 other collegiate
poets, as well as teach workshops, organize events, and even start a
scholarship for many ofNashville’s SouthernWord
youth poets.
Outside of mentoring, coaching, and organizing with Atlanta Word Works,
Justin runs his own freelancing company, Little
Writing Man, and moonlights as an organizer in the local crowdfunding
community. 
Justin has performed his poetry to over 6,000 folks and has been
published in multiple literary journals. His poetics have been influenced by
various spoken word artists such as Rives and Rudy Francisco, and by poets such
as W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin, and Tyehimba Jess. Justin is forever learning
from his writing – both about himself and about others. He hopes that you do
too.The Mentors
The youth poets also benefit from the insights and wisdom of local Atlanta poets and past BNV Atlanta team members including Kali Scurdy, Janetta Hill, Aurielle Lucier, and Itsel Lira.More About Atlanta Word Works (AWW)
Atlanta
Word Works is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that supports,
guides, and provides a safe space for young artists and writers to express
themselves through written and spoken word poetry. Located in metro Atlanta, our
youth ranging from ages 13-19 explore the complexities and challenges of life
through weekly oral literacy and writing workshops, monthly open mics, and
annual youth poetry slams. 
We believe that the arts are a means of
developing critical thinking skills, social responsibility, and creative
problem solving. Moreover, providing youth with these necessary tools to enter
a world in need of fresh and innovative perspectives to build peace and bring
much-needed change.
And we’re getting noticed for helping to make that change. Watch CNN’s 2013 spotlight on Atlanta

</div></div>","Nat. Brut (pr. nat broot) is a biannual journal of art and literature dedicated to advancing equality and inclusivity in all creative fields. 


While gender representation in literary publishing may be gradually improving, it has by no means been solved, and it's still as serious a problem as ever in the fields of art and comics publishing.We took a look through the table of contents in recent issues of three magazines on our shelves, and the proportions were troubling.



In an interview in Issue Five of Nat. Brut, novelist Merritt Tierce offers an eloquent summary of these concerns from her perspective as a writer, suggesting that “what is published, in contemporary fiction especially, is a myopically distorted view of reality. It’s too straight . . . too cis-het. And too white.” 
____________________All this being said, the publishing world has reached a tipping point. Organizations like VIDA and individuals who are experiencing these disparities on the front lines are working hard to raise public awareness and amplify the conversation, and the call to carve out safe spaces for marginalized voices is louder than ever. As for the question, “What can be done?”, in her 2014 essay, “Beyond the Measure of Men”, Roxane Gay puts it simply: “The solutions are obvious. Stop making excuses.” Nat. Brut wholeheartedly agrees with Gay’s assertion that change merely requires intent and effort. More importantly, writers, artists, and publishers who want to create this change for themselves must work together and push each other to do better.
At Nat. Brut, we strive to be mindful and inclusive in everything we do. 
We strive for the highest standards in the quality of the content we publish, and in the social responsibility we hold as a publication. Fortunately, these two goals go hand in hand. Part of what makes our content so stunning is the array of diverse perspectives we feature.Our magazine is a broadly interdisciplinary safe space. We publish short fiction,  poetry,  visual art,  comics,  found photos,  and artifacts from the public domain. Most of our staff and contributors are women, and we work hard to draw attention to voices that advance intersectional feminist perspectives.____________________

At Nat. Brut, we promote environmental sustainability in both form and content. We use only 100% post-consumer recycled and FSC-certified materials for all of our printed products, and we make an effort to publish work and curate features that confront environmental issues. ____________________After moving into print earlier this year with Issue Five, we've learned through experience exactly how much we need to produce an issue. Each issue costs just over $8,000 to print, shipping runs about $1,300, and 7% of our donations go to our fiscal sponsor. Any further funding we receive is reserved for our Issue Six launch event. Our previous launch event  took place at Harvard University's Carpenter Center, and involved a film screening and a panel in which Kayla E., Alexis Wilkinson, Koa Beck, Phoebe Robinson, and Robyn O'Neil discussed gender disparities in their respective fields. We're currently planning a launch event for Issue Six, which will take place in New York City this October.Lto R:  Alexis Wilkinson,  Kayla E.,  Koa Beck,  Phoebe Robinson,  Robyn O'NeilWe recently gained 501(c)(3) status through fiscal sponsorship with our umbrella organization, Fractured Atlas, which means all of your donations are tax-deductible. It will take us about a year to benefit from this status by securing grants to offset our production costs, but in the meantime, we rely solely on your readership.Earlier this year, we successfully crowdfunded the printing of our fifth issue. We've since since developed a strong relationship with our eco-friendly printer in Canada, The Prolific Group, and what was a handful of staff members has grown into a passionate team of 20 skilled professionals who have served as editors, publishers, and art directors for magazines such as The Harvard Lampoon and The Harvard Advocate.Nat. Brut has always been, and continues to be, a labor of love.

<p>Hello Dear Ones,</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what happened to kindness, to love and to gratitude in today’s society? Have you ever thought about how to make our world a better place for all so that our children, our future leaders, will live in a respectful and dignified world? Have you ever thought about imparting wisdom and understanding to both children and adults alike? If so, you know either consciously or not, that you are on this planet for a special reason; and it is why you were guided to this Campaign.</p>
<p align=""center"">Who am I? What is my mission? Why now?</p>
<p>My name is Marilyne Woodsmall. I began asking these questions decades ago. In my work as an International Trainer, professional Behavioral Modeler, Author, Mind Coach®, Speaker, and Expert in Human Typological Studies, I have addressed these issues using my knowledge and wisdom to help others grow to new levels of being. This has always been and continues to be my mission and passion!</p>
<p>I know that understanding is the key to all learning. And it is my goal to impart this wisdom and understanding in a variety of contexts and content in my writing, coaching and in my teaching. In so doing, I help people enhance their knowledge base and performance, remove behavioral blocks, and connect to their true mission in life. And I have known that the other part of my mission has to do with guiding children to be enlightened future leaders who are creative, who are able to think critically and who operate out of the heart center with respect, integrity and dignity. My book,<i> Alphabet Angels™</i>, and the <i>Alphabet Angels™</i> <i>Coloring Book</i> for which I am fundraising in this Campaign, is an integral part of my mission.</p>
<p>So, I welcome you with heartfelt, gracious gratitude to my <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ Indiegogo Campaign! By contributing to my passionate mission, you are participating in my movement to bring hope and to spread kindness around the globe one person at a time, and in particular to a group of courageous, precious children….to the amazing, young cancer patients at St. Jude’s Children's Research Hospital!</p>
<p>By donating my <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ Book and <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ <i>Coloring Book</i>, your Act of Kindness will leave its mark by giving back, and offering them the Light of Hope, the Beauty of Divine Grace, the Power of Divine Love, the Blessing of Angelic Support, the Joy of Appreciation, the Expression of your Gratitude and the Power of Healing!</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used for the printing and shipping of these books. You are also doing your part in shifting global consciousness as <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ brings upliftment to all! This Campaign is my personal Act of Kindness that will spark a wave of kindness among all those who take part…</p>
<p>You will also be helping children to learn the Alphabet by means of angelically inspired verses which express what I call the simple, basic “Truths of Being” which are enhanced with beautiful Winged Letters! There is so much more to my personal mission, which you will come to understand as you listen to my audio presentation.</p>
<p>In my heart, I know that the time has come for this work to be out in the world. <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ was from the very start, a major element in my desire to contribute to the world as part of my life mission. For almost thirty years, my work has involved intellectual subject matter in my writings, teachings as a professional Behavioral Modeler, and expert in human typologies and learning.  My work in modeling involves decoding what experts do on an unconscious level (hence, I am known as “the expert on experts.” In most of my work, I have always combined the behavioral with the spiritual, left brain with right brain. Interestingly, <i>Alphabet Angels™ </i>was born in the middle of an analytic task that was not at all connected to Angelic inspiration.</p>
<p>This book came about for a special reason. I totally believe that there are no coincidences in life…there is only Divine Timing! And for this reason, I know that given the current state of affairs in the world, with the growing violence and hatred, and the utter disconnect that exists among people in all walks of life, that the timing of this Fundraising Campaign is happening exactly when it is supposed to be. In fact, it is twenty years ago today, on 2/22, February 22, 1998, that I was inspired to write this work. And I can tell you from experience over the years, that you will now begin to notice the number 222 more and more, and in places and at times that you might not have imagined before….</p>
<p><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Alphabet Angels</i><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>™ i</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>s </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>part of a series of books and audios that I have created over the years to inspire both children and adults to higher levels of being, to engender what I have always referred to as “The New Way of Being.” It is a new paradigm, a new essence for thinking, for doing, for understanding, for seeing, and, most importantly, for being.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">          So why now?</p>
<p>As always, it is truly Divine Timing perfectly at work because <i>Alphabet Angels™ </i>is coming out at a time when the world really needs it. There is so much discord, disrespect, incivility, and hatred appearing in many different forms throughout our society. There is great turmoil and more and more violence on the world stage with each new day. As frustrating as it was to me to have written this book so long ago and not get it out into the public at that time, it was, in fact, the Angelic Kingdom that made it very clear that 1998 was not to be the date of publication.</p>
<p>Our world is now at a crossroads of the battle between the forces of Light and Dark. At present, we are living in an extremely challenging, muddled, and confused reality on all levels: socially, politically, culturally, and educationally. More than ever, people everywhere need to be reminded of the power and importance of kindness, eternal love, and compassion towards all life.</p>
<p>We are confronted every second of every day with the challenges of technological advances. We live in a world in which technology has accomplished some incredibly wonderful things. At the same time, technological advances have manipulated the minds of so many young and old (and particularly teens and young adults) to the point where reality and fantasy are no long distinguishable.</p>
<p>The popularity of video games has negatively impacted our youth such that some (more and more) are turning to violent behavior at school, in the home and elsewhere. We are bombarded on all levels with images of that which is “unreal” from a spiritual perspective. We live in a culture that respects all that is not true reality, where the masses are programmed to adore all that is fake and devoid of dignity and meaning.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ shines the Light of Hope!</p>
<p>Just as disconcerting is the fact that with the onset of gadgets and cell phones, tablets, and the like, we are connecting less and less with our hearts. Human beings are totally disconnected from one another. We are encouraging Duality Consciousness. We are ignoring that special place within us, which I call the “sacred space” that embodies our Essence qualities of Being. People are in their own little worlds, at times, totally isolated from each other because technology has replaced real time heart to heart connection. Have you ever noticed people eating at a restaurant with cell phones in hand, not even talking to each other? Teens, young children and of course, many adults, have lost that ever so precious human connection. This is insane! The time has come to reconnect with one another, to express unity consciousness, and to reestablish the all-important bonds of true friendship and family, and to connect on a higher level to shift global consciousness one person at a time by spreading positive vibrations!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ shines the Light of Hope!</p>
<p>A big part of my Mission is to support parents as they take on the greatest responsibility of their lives: raising a child with love and to teach them the path to powerful personal growth evolution where they can make a positive difference in the world. <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ teaches children the alphabet using angelically inspired verses that reflect simple, basic Truths of Being that embody the all-important life qualities of kindness, gratitude, respect, integrity, dignity, and more. It is our duty to teach children manners and responsibility for their actions. It is important both to explain things and to teach your children for understanding, and to do so in a kind way. We are living in the most challenging times to raise children, and they need love and guidance more than ever before. May <i>Alphabet Angels™</i> serve as a guide for “being” as you teach your children and others the alphabet and the Essence Qualities.</p>
<p><i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ elegantly transforms the letters of the alphabet into beautiful Winged Letters. In turn, each letter represents a quality of being which is not only manifest among the heavenly Angels...Each winged letter also embodies the innate qualities and values that children, who are some of our terrestrial angels, exhibit when they come into this life before exposure to negative societal influences. </p>
<p>So, how can you help get the message out by supporting this Campaign? You have several ways to “Spread Your Kindness”! You can donate books and coloring books to St. Jude’s Children's Research Hospital. You can buy them for your family and friends. You can also participate by spreading the word to your loved ones and even to people you don’t know well. Remember this is about performing an Act of Kindness in whatever way you see fit!</p>
<p>You may also donate to my Mission by choosing to have a personal coaching session with me, the Mind Coach® in the context of your choice: performance enhancement, eliminating emotional obstacles, building self-esteem, personal growth, parenting, values, entrepreneurship, behavioral change, spirituality, learning, cultural change, discovering your personal typological template, or other areas of my work and expertise over the years. You can even have dinner with me and my husband, experience my personalized coaching and receive autographed copies of my other books! Even if you don’t choose to donate books to St. Jude’s or buy them for yourself, you can also contribute by sending positive thoughts and energetic support to the success of this <i>Alphabet Angels</i>™ Campaign!</p>
<p>Most of all, trust your Inner Knowing and you will do what you are meant to do!  I invite you to be creative!  Share it with friends, teachers, parents, talk to your hair stylist, to people at the grocery store, to fellow students, business associates and to all those who cross your path! Remember that you are spreading a powerful vibration in so doing! Remember, too, that whatever Act of Kindness you choose with the<i> Alphabet Angels™ </i>Campaign, it is wonderful in itself, in that it is a reflection of your personal goodness! I believe that it expresses your appreciation of the precious nature of life in all of its wonder. Remember that your gesture will contribute to the printing of these books so that we can bring hope and joy and love to the Children of St. Jude’s and to all those who would like to be reminded of our innate Essence Qualities: kindness, goodness, compassion, gratitude, eternal love, truth and Dignity!</p>
<p>Be uplifted and part of a noble cause to create a unified world in which mutual love and respect prevail!</p>

We are bombarded on all levels with images of that which is “unreal” from a spiritual perspective. We live in a culture that respects all that is not true reality, where the masses are programmed to adore all that is fake and devoid of dignity and meaning.
Alphabet Angels™ shines the Light of Hope!
Just as disconcerting is the fact that with the onset of gadgets and cell phones, tablets, and the like, we are connecting less and less with our hearts. Human beings are totally disconnected from one another. We are encouraging Duality Consciousness. We are ignoring that special place within us, which I call the “sacred space” that embodies our Essence qualities of Being. People are in their own little worlds, at times, totally isolated from each other because technology has replaced real time heart to heart connection. Have you ever noticed people eating at a restaurant with cell phones in hand, not even talking to each other? Teens, young children and of course, many adults, have lost that ever so precious human connection. This is insane! The time has come to reconnect with one another, to express unity consciousness, and to reestablish the all-important bonds of true friendship and family, and to connect on a higher level to shift global consciousness one person at a time by spreading positive vibrations!
Alphabet Angels™ shines the Light of Hope!
A big part of my Mission is to support parents as they take on the greatest responsibility of their lives: raising a child with love and to teach them the path to powerful personal growth evolution where they can make a positive difference in the world. Alphabet Angels™ teaches children the alphabet using angelically inspired verses that reflect simple, basic Truths of Being that embody the all-important life qualities of kindness, gratitude, respect, integrity, dignity, and more. It is our duty to teach children manners and responsibility for their actions. It is important both to explain things and to teach your children for understanding, and to do so in a kind way. We are living in the most challenging times to raise children, and they need love and guidance more than ever before. May Alphabet Angels™ serve as a guide for “being” as you teach your children and others the alphabet and the Essence Qualities.
Alphabet Angels™ elegantly transforms the letters of the alphabet into beautiful Winged Letters. In turn, each letter represents a quality of being which is not only manifest among the heavenly Angels...Each winged letter also embodies the innate qualities and values that children, who are some of our terrestrial angels, exhibit when they come into this life before exposure to negative societal influences. 
So, how can you help get the message out by supporting this Campaign? You have several ways to “Spread Your Kindness”! You can donate books and coloring books to St. Jude’s Children's Research Hospital. You can buy them for your family and friends. You can also participate by spreading the word to your loved ones and even to people you don’t know well. Remember this is about performing an Act of Kindness in whatever way you see fit!
You may also donate to my Mission by choosing to have a personal coaching session with me, the Mind Coach® in the context of your choice: performance enhancement, eliminating emotional obstacles, building self-esteem, personal growth, parenting, values, entrepreneurship, behavioral change, spirituality, learning, cultural change, discovering your personal typological template, or other areas of my work and expertise over the years. You can even have dinner with me and my husband, experience my personalized coaching and receive autographed copies of my other books! Even if you don’t choose to donate books to St. Jude’s or buy them for yourself, you can also contribute by sending positive thoughts and energetic support to the success of this Alphabet Angels™ Campaign!
Most of all, trust your Inner Knowing and you will do what you are meant to do!  I invite you to be creative!  Share it with friends, teachers, parents, talk to your hair stylist, to people at the grocery store, to fellow students, business associates and to all those who cross your path! Remember that you are spreading a powerful vibration in so doing! Remember, too, that whatever Act of Kindness you choose with the Alphabet Angels™ Campaign, it is wonderful in itself, in that it is a reflection of your personal goodness! I believe that it expresses your appreciation of the precious nature of life in all of its wonder. Remember that your gesture will contribute to the printing of these books so that we can bring hope and joy and love to the Children of St. Jude’s and to all those who would like to be reminded of our innate Essence Qualities: kindness, goodness, compassion, gratitude, eternal love, truth and Dignity!
Be uplifted and part of a noble cause to create a unified world in which mutual love and respect prevail!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Spread your Kindness!

</h2>
<p>Como todos ustedes saben “La Piel del Desierto” empezó como un proyecto con una clara idea política que implica editar, de manera absolutamente independiente y autogestiva, la crónica literaria con el mismo nombre; adherirse a la defensa del desierto sagrado de Wirikuta; y dedicar la mitad de lo ganado de la venta del tiraje de 1,000 ejemplares a la recuperación de la inversión por parte del equipo de “La Piel del Desierto”, y la otra mitad al cuidado de los centros ceremoniales wixaritari. Nuestra intención era publicar el primer tiraje de mil ejemplares de la crónica en octubre. Sin embargo, aunque hasta la fecha no se han podido recaudar los fondos necesarios para la impresión del libro (alrededor de 110,000 pesos mexicanos u 8,400 USD) , el proyecto ha avanzado de manera más que notable.</p>
<p>En alrededor de 4 meses se han conseguido los fondos para cubrir la impresión de nuestros pósters, postales y playeras, la totalidad de los costos de diseño y de traducción al inglés, y aproximadamente la mitad de los fondos necesarios para subsanar la impresión de los 1,000 ejemplares del libro. Todo ello gracias a la participación de alrededor de 100 personas. </p>
<p>Nuestras finanzas son abiertas para los coeditores y colaboradores. Al convertirte en coeditor recibes un enlace que te permite revisar los ingresos pagados, los pendientes verificados, y los egresos correspondientes. <br/></p>
<p>Por otra parte, aunque el trabajo ha sido arduo, “La Piel del Desierto” ha logrado darse a conocer exitosamente en diversos medios como las redes sociales, el radio y en entrevistas con diversos medios:<br/><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/entrevistaenelabcradio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/entrevistaenelabcradio</a><br/><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/lapieldeldesiertoen1079%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/lapieldeldesiertoen1079 </a><br/><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/compartiendo5julio2013edit%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/compartiendo5julio2013edit </a><br/><a href=""http://cuartoscuro.com.mx/2013/08/lapieldeldesierto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> http://cuartoscuro.com.mx/2013/08/lapieldeldesierto/</a></p>

<p>Pláticas y conferencias en la facultad de filosofía y letras y de ciencias en la UNAM en México.</p>
<p>Uno de los avances más importantes es que la galería de arte Huichol ""Arte Yawí"" (<a href=""http://www.arteyawi.com/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.arteyawi.com/ </a>), el café y galería de arte ""Terrascalli"" (<a href=""http://www.terrescalli.com/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.terrescalli.com/ </a>), varios comerciantes de artesanía wixárrika, y alrededor de una decena de persona se han solidarizado para promover y distribuir el material de “La Piel del Desierto"". Recientemente, la “Minnning Watch Canada” se ha ofrecido para difundir el proyecto.</p>
<p>La recepción de nuestras postales, pósters y playeras ha sido tan buena que nuestros artículos, por sí mismos, ya configuran un proyecto autosustentable, que combina la literatura, la fotografía, la política y la edición independiente. Muy pronto tendremos también tazas de “La Piel del Desierto”.</p>
<p>Después de una reestructuración, hemos decidido que ""La Piel del Desierto"" se transforme en un proyecto permanente en el que realizamos comercio de nuestros artículos con el fin de obtener recursos en primera instancia para la publicación impresa del libro (la versión electrónica será como desde el inicio se prometió de acceso abierto), pero de manera permanente para la obtención de fondos para el colectivo y las comunidades wixaritari.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, dado que la impresión del libro puede tardar aún algunos meses, nos sentimos obligados a pedirle a nuestros coeditores paciencia. Por supuesto, todos los coeditores que adquieren paquetes que incluyen sólo posters, playeras o postales reciben de manera inmediata sus artículos. Asimismo, los que compran paquetes con el libro y otros materiales, recibirán a la brevedad todos su artículos con excepción del libro impreso. Los que decidan comprar a precio de preventa el libro les enviaremos próximamente la versión digital de la crónica mientras logramos imprimir el libro.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, pese a nuestros esfuerzos, el principal problema al que nos enfrentamos es la falta de una estructura amplia de difusión, distribución y venta. Es por eso que decidimos realizar la siguiente convocatoria (<a href=""http://bit.ly/1fYGFcu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1fYGFcu</a>) .</p>
<p>Finalmente, los invitamos cordialmente a que nos sigan acompañando en este proyecto de emancipación por el respeto de los lugares sagrados del pueblo wixárika y la creación artística comprometida con los conflictos sociales de nuestra sociedad. Asimismo, los invitamos a que sigan adquiriendo los artículos de “La Piel del Desierto” y, si así lo desean, a atender a la convocatoria arriba sugerida y convertirse en colaboradores especiales de “La Piel del Desierto”.</p>

<h2 id=""english"">** English Version **</h2>
<h2><strong>What is “The Skin of the Desert”?</strong></h2>
<p>""<strong>The Skin of the Desert</strong>"" is the title of a photo-literary chronicle in a bilingual edition (Spanish-English). This chronicle tells the story of what happened during the ""<em>Traditional Report</em>"" conducted by the representatives of the wixárika people (<em>Huichol</em>) in the <em>Cerro Quemado</em>, near the Mexican town of Real de Catorce, on the 6th and 7th of February, 2012.</p>
<p>In this work, by means of rigorous inquiries, artistic convictions and a highly respectful attitude towards the wixárika culture, we combine the possibilities of visual and literary languages to raise awareness on the wixárika people's rich worldview and defend the bio-cultural magnificence of Wirikuta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What happened during the wixárika ""Traditional Report""?</h2>
<p>For the first time representatives of all communities set out on a pilgrimage to <em>Cerro Quemado</em> to consult their deities on the steps to be taken with regard to the exploitation of the sacred area by mining and agro-industrial companies.</p>
<p>Having consulted with their deities, the wixaritari announced the alliance of all communities to fight against and prevent the establishment of any industry that would threaten the bio-cultural heritage of the sacred area of Wirikuta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who is behind “The Skin of the Desert”?</strong></h2>
<p>“<strong>The Skin of the Desert</strong>” is possible because of the work of a group of a group of people scattered across different countries (Belgium, England, Canada and Mexico, among others) working on the project under the name of ""<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"".</p>
<p>The authors of the chronicle are Luis Ramírez Trejo and Christian Palma Montaño. In addition to the authors, many people collaborate on the project. Fabian Espinosa is in charge of the art design for the book and the website, the English translation is done by Laura Vega Meyer, and Tine Defoor and Coyle Lindy work on the promotion of the project.</p>
<p>If you are interested in our professional background, you can se the link “about us” in our page <a href=""http://lapieldeldesierto.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lapieldeldesierto.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project has the consent and support of ""<em>Frente de Defensa de Wirikuta</em>"" (Wirikuta Defense Front) from which the ""<em>Consejo Regional Wixárika</em>"" (Wixárika Regional Council) is part of.</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Skin of the Desert | La Piel del Desierto"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lapieldeldesierto.com/images/lr/CPAL9047.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>What is the political intention of “The Skin of the Desert”</h2>
<p>“<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"", far from hiding under some supposed neutrality, joins in the struggle to put value on the rich cultural heritage of the wixaritari and defend the sacred desert of Wirikuta. That is the reason because, after paying for the publishing costs, 50% of the proceeds obtained during the raising fund campaign and from the total sale of the book and promotional items will be directly donated for the care of the wixaritari ceremonial centres, and for the support of projects managed by the wixárika communities.</p>
<p>We, the ""<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"", in one way or another share the view that the opportunity to change the world rests more on the drive and responsibility of those who take their ideals seriously, rather than on the dreams and goodwill that pile up on the shelves of oblivion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is the publishing policy of “The Skin of the Desert”?</h2>
<p>The chronicle will be openly published with a Creative Commons license. In an effort to spread the work as widely as possible, the chapters of the book will be released periodically during the fundraising campaign. On launch day the last chapter of the book is to be released and that will make ""<strong>The Skin of the Desert</strong>"" fully available in PDF format so that all those interested can access it freely, the only requirement being an internet connection.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What do we need?</h2>
<p>The publication of all the material demands a minimum investment of about €7,500 or $10,000 USD. A much comfortable estimate reaches the €8,700 or $11,300 USD. If we succeed in raising more money, we can improve substantially the quality of the book (e.g. we can make a book with a beautiful hard cover).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What are the specifications for the book and the promo items?</h2>
<p>The book will be published in a square format (25 x 25 cm). It has 140 pages made from couché paper of at least 130 gr. and printed in full color. (The amount of pages may be different depending from the final printing requirements).</p>
<p>Post cards will be printed in couché paper of 300 gr. (9 x 5 cms).</p>
<p>Posters will be printed in sulfatade paper (35 x 45 cm).</p>
<p>You will be able to choose t-shirts among several design in sizes small, medium and large.</p>
<p>During this raising fund campaign, we will publish pictures of all promo ítems.</p>

<h2 id=""espanol"">** Versión en Español **</h2>
<h2>¿Qué es “La Piel del desierto”?</h2>
<p>""<strong>La piel del desierto</strong>"" es el título de un libro con una crónica fotográfico-literaria en edición bilingüe (Español-Inglés) sobre el ""<em>Peritaje Tradicional</em>"" llevado a cabo por los representantes del pueblo wixárika (<em>Huicholes</em>), los días seis y siete de febrero del 2012, en el Cerro Quemado cerca del pueblo mexicano de Real de Catorce.</p>
<p>En este trabajo, mediante una indagación rigurosa, una convicción artística y una actitud llena de respeto hacia la cultura wixárika, compaginamos las posibilidades de los lenguajes visual y literario para difundir la rica cosmovisión del pueblo wixárika y defender la riqueza bio-cultural de Wirikuta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Qué pasó en el “Peritaje Tradicional” de los wixaritari?</h2>
<p>Por primera vez todos los representantes de las comunidades del pueblo wixárika (<em>Huicholes</em>) peregrinaron de manera conjunta al Cerro Quemado para consultar a sus divinidades sobre las medidas a tomar con respecto a la explotación del área por parte de las compañías mineras y agroindustriales.<br/>Después de la consulta con sus deidades, los wixaritari anunciaron la unión de todas las comunidades para luchar contra las mineras y evitar la instalación de cualquier industria que atente en contra del patrimonio bio-cultural del área sagrada de Wirikuta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Quiénes hacen “La Piel del Desierto”?</h2>
<p>“<strong>La Piel del Desierto</strong>” es posible gracias a un grupo de personas, residentes en varios países (Bélgica, Inglaterra, Canadá y México, entre otros) que colaboran bajo la rúbrica del ""<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"".</p>
<p>Los autores de la crónica son Luis Ramírez Trejo (escritor) y Christian Palma Montaño (fotógrafo). Además de los autores, mucha gente colabora en el proyecto. El diseño de arte final del libro y la página web corre a cargo de Fabian Espinosa. La traducción al inglés la lleva a cabo Laura Vega Meyer. Tine Defoor y Lindy Coyle participan en la promoción y difusión del proyecto.</p>

<h2>¿Cuál es la intención política de “La Piel del Desierto?</h2>
<p>""<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"", lejos de esconderse bajo alguna supuesta neutralidad, se suma con este proyecto a la lucha por valorar la herencia cultural de los wixaritari y por defender al desierto sagrado de Wirikuta. Es por ello que,<strong> una vez cubiertos los costos de la edición del material, el 50% de lo recaudado y de la venta total del libro y los artículos de promoción se canalizará de manera directa al cuidado de los centros ceremoniales wixaritari, y al apoyo de proyectos gestionados por las comunidades wixárika.</strong></p>
<p>En el ""<em>Colectivo Carcoma</em>"" compartimos, de una u otra forma, la idea de que la posibilidad de cambiar el mundo se encuentra más en la decisión y la responsabilidad de quienes toman en serio sus ideales, que en los sueños y buenos deseos que se enmohecen en los anaqueles de la desidia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Cuál es la política de publicación de “La Piel del Desierto”?</h2>
<p>El libro se publicará bajo un esquema de contenidos abiertos y una licencia Creative Commons. En un esfuerzo por difundir lo más posible este trabajo, los capítulos del libro serán liberados periódicamente durante la campaña de recaudación de fondos. El día del lanzamiento del libro se liberará el último capítulo y eso hará que “<strong>La Piel del Desierto</strong>” se encuentre disponible íntegramente en formato PDF para que todo aquél que lo desee —y que tenga acceso a Internet— pueda adquirirlo gratuitamente.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Qué necesitamos?</h2>
<p>La publicación de todo el material requiere una cantidad mínima de unos 137.000 pesos mexicanos, 10.340 dólares estadounidenses o 7,800 euros. Un estimado mucho más cómodo y nuestra meta real es de 150.000 pesos mexicanos, 11,300 dólares estadounidenses u 8.700 euros. Si logramos recaudar más dinero podremos mejorar la calidad del libro (la portada puede ser en tapa dura, por ejemplo).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>¿Cómo va a ser el libro y el resto del material?</h2>
<p>El formato del libro es: 25 x 25 cm aproximadamente, 140 páginas (esto puede cambiar dependiendo de los requerimientos finales de impresión), papel tipo couché de al menos 130 grs, impresión a todo color.</p>
<p>Las medidas de las postales serán impresas en papel couché de 300 gramos (9 x 5 cms).</p>
<p>Los posters son en cartulina sulfatada de 12 puntos 35 x 45 cm.</p>
<p>Las playeras podrán ser elegidas en las siguientes medidas (chica, mediana, grande). Habrá varios diseños a elegir.</p>
<p>Durante la campaña publicaremos fotos de muestras de cada uno de los materiales de promoción.</p>

<h2><img alt=""La Piel del Desierto | The Skin of the Desert"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lapieldeldesierto.com/images/lr/7093.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2></div>","Informe de La Piel del Desierto (nov 2013)

Como todos ustedes saben “La Piel del Desierto” empezó como un proyecto con una clara idea política que implica editar, de manera absolutamente independiente y autogestiva, la crónica literaria con el mismo nombre; adherirse a la defensa del desierto sagrado de Wirikuta; y dedicar la mitad de lo ganado de la venta del tiraje de 1,000 ejemplares a la recuperación de la inversión por parte del equipo de “La Piel del Desierto”, y la otra mitad al cuidado de los centros ceremoniales wixaritari. Nuestra intención era publicar el primer tiraje de mil ejemplares de la crónica en octubre. Sin embargo, aunque hasta la fecha no se han podido recaudar los fondos necesarios para la impresión del libro (alrededor de 110,000 pesos mexicanos u 8,400 USD) , el proyecto ha avanzado de manera más que notable.
En alrededor de 4 meses se han conseguido los fondos para cubrir la impresión de nuestros pósters, postales y playeras, la totalidad de los costos de diseño y de traducción al inglés, y aproximadamente la mitad de los fondos necesarios para subsanar la impresión de los 1,000 ejemplares del libro. Todo ello gracias a la participación de alrededor de 100 personas. 
Nuestras finanzas son abiertas para los coeditores y colaboradores. Al convertirte en coeditor recibes un enlace que te permite revisar los ingresos pagados, los pendientes verificados, y los egresos correspondientes. 
Por otra parte, aunque el trabajo ha sido arduo, “La Piel del Desierto” ha logrado darse a conocer exitosamente en diversos medios como las redes sociales, el radio y en entrevistas con diversos medios:https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/entrevistaenelabcradio https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/lapieldeldesiertoen1079  https://soundcloud.com/user860007912/compartiendo5julio2013edit  http://cuartoscuro.com.mx/2013/08/lapieldeldesierto/

Uno de los avances más importantes es que la galería de arte Huichol ""Arte Yawí"" (http://www.arteyawi.com/ ), el café y galería de arte ""Terrascalli"" (http://www.terrescalli.com/ ), varios comerciantes de artesanía wixárrika, y alrededor de una decena de persona se han solidarizado para promover y distribuir el material de “La Piel del Desierto"". Recientemente, la “Minnning Watch Canada” se ha ofrecido para difundir el proyecto.
La recepción de nuestras postales, pósters y playeras ha sido tan buena que nuestros artículos, por sí mismos, ya configuran un proyecto autosustentable, que combina la literatura, la fotografía, la política y la edición independiente. Muy pronto tendremos también tazas de “La Piel del Desierto”.
Después de una reestructuración, hemos decidido que ""La Piel del Desierto"" se transforme en un proyecto permanente en el que realizamos comercio de nuestros artículos con el fin de obtener recursos en primera instancia para la publicación impresa del libro (la versión electrónica será como desde el inicio se prometió de acceso abierto), pero de manera permanente para la obtención de fondos para el colectivo y las comunidades wixaritari.
Sin embargo, dado que la impresión del libro puede tardar aún algunos meses, nos sentimos obligados a pedirle a nuestros coeditores paciencia. Por supuesto, todos los coeditores que adquieren paquetes que incluyen sólo posters, playeras o postales reciben de manera inmediata sus artículos. Asimismo, los que compran paquetes con el libro y otros materiales, recibirán a la brevedad todos su artículos con excepción del libro impreso. Los que decidan comprar a precio de preventa el libro les enviaremos próximamente la versión digital de la crónica mientras logramos imprimir el libro.
Sin embargo, pese a nuestros esfuerzos, el principal problema al que nos enfrentamos es la falta de una estructura amplia de difusión, distribución y venta. Es por eso que decidimos realizar la siguiente convocatoria (http://bit.ly/1fYGFcu) .
Finalmente, los invitamos cordialmente a que nos sigan acompañando en este proyecto de emancipación por el respeto de los lugares sagrados del pueblo wixárika y la creación artística comprometida con los conflictos sociales de nuestra sociedad. Asimismo, los invitamos a que sigan adquiriendo los artículos de “La Piel del Desierto” y, si así lo desean, a atender a la convocatoria arriba sugerida y convertirse en colaboradores especiales de “La Piel del Desierto”.

** English Version **
What is “The Skin of the Desert”?
""The Skin of the Desert"" is the title of a photo-literary chronicle in a bilingual edition (Spanish-English). This chronicle tells the story of what happened during the ""Traditional Report"" conducted by the representatives of the wixárika people (Huichol) in the Cerro Quemado, near the Mexican town of Real de Catorce, on the 6th and 7th of February, 2012.
In this work, by means of rigorous inquiries, artistic convictions and a highly respectful attitude towards the wixárika culture, we combine the possibilities of visual and literary languages to raise awareness on the wixárika people's rich worldview and defend the bio-cultural magnificence of Wirikuta.
 
What happened during the wixárika ""Traditional Report""?
For the first time representatives of all communities set out on a pilgrimage to Cerro Quemado to consult their deities on the steps to be taken with regard to the exploitation of the sacred area by mining and agro-industrial companies.
Having consulted with their deities, the wixaritari announced the alliance of all communities to fight against and prevent the establishment of any industry that would threaten the bio-cultural heritage of the sacred area of Wirikuta.
 
Who is behind “The Skin of the Desert”?
“The Skin of the Desert” is possible because of the work of a group of a group of people scattered across different countries (Belgium, England, Canada and Mexico, among others) working on the project under the name of ""Colectivo Carcoma"".
The authors of the chronicle are Luis Ramírez Trejo and Christian Palma Montaño. In addition to the authors, many people collaborate on the project. Fabian Espinosa is in charge of the art design for the book and the website, the English translation is done by Laura Vega Meyer, and Tine Defoor and Coyle Lindy work on the promotion of the project.
If you are interested in our professional background, you can se the link “about us” in our page lapieldeldesierto.com.
 
The Project has the consent and support of ""Frente de Defensa de Wirikuta"" (Wirikuta Defense Front) from which the ""Consejo Regional Wixárika"" (Wixárika Regional Council) is part of.

What is the political intention of “The Skin of the Desert”
“Colectivo Carcoma"", far from hiding under some supposed neutrality, joins in the struggle to put value on the rich cultural heritage of the wixaritari and defend the sacred desert of Wirikuta. That is the reason because, after paying for the publishing costs, 50% of the proceeds obtained during the raising fund campaign and from the total sale of the book and promotional items will be directly donated for the care of the wixaritari ceremonial centres, and for the support of projects managed by the wixárika communities.
We, the ""Colectivo Carcoma"", in one way or another share the view that the opportunity to change the world rests more on the drive and responsibility of those who take their ideals seriously, rather than on the dreams and goodwill that pile up on the shelves of oblivion.
 
What is the publishing policy of “The Skin of the Desert”?
The chronicle will be openly published with a Creative Commons license. In an effort to spread the work as widely as possible, the chapters of the book will be released periodically during the fundraising campaign. On launch day the last chapter of the book is to be released and that will make ""The Skin of the Desert"" fully available in PDF format so that all those interested can access it freely, the only requirement being an internet connection.
 
What do we need?
The publication of all the material demands a minimum investment of about €7,500 or $10,000 USD. A much comfortable estimate reaches the €8,700 or $11,300 USD. If we succeed in raising more money, we can improve substantially the quality of the book (e.g. we can make a book with a beautiful hard cover).
 
What are the specifications for the book and the promo items?
The book will be published in a square format (25 x 25 cm). It has 140 pages made from couché paper of at least 130 gr. and printed in full color. (The amount of pages may be different depending from the final printing requirements).
Post cards will be printed in couché paper of 300 gr. (9 x 5 cms).
Posters will be printed in sulfatade paper (35 x 45 cm).
You will be able to choose t-shirts among several design in sizes small, medium and large.
During this raising fund campaign, we will publish pictures of all promo ítems.

You may help to make “The Skin of the Desert” come true.

¿Qué es “La Piel del desierto”?
""La piel del desierto"" es el título de un libro con una crónica fotográfico-literaria en edición bilingüe (Español-Inglés) sobre el ""Peritaje Tradicional"" llevado a cabo por los representantes del pueblo wixárika (Huicholes), los días seis y siete de febrero del 2012, en el Cerro Quemado cerca del pueblo mexicano de Real de Catorce.
En este trabajo, mediante una indagación rigurosa, una convicción artística y una actitud llena de respeto hacia la cultura wixárika, compaginamos las posibilidades de los lenguajes visual y literario para difundir la rica cosmovisión del pueblo wixárika y defender la riqueza bio-cultural de Wirikuta.
 
¿Qué pasó en el “Peritaje Tradicional” de los wixaritari?
Por primera vez todos los representantes de las comunidades del pueblo wixárika (Huicholes) peregrinaron de manera conjunta al Cerro Quemado para consultar a sus divinidades sobre las medidas a tomar con respecto a la explotación del área por parte de las compañías mineras y agroindustriales.Después de la consulta con sus deidades, los wixaritari anunciaron la unión de todas las comunidades para luchar contra las mineras y evitar la instalación de cualquier industria que atente en contra del patrimonio bio-cultural del área sagrada de Wirikuta.
 
¿Quiénes hacen “La Piel del Desierto”?
“La Piel del Desierto” es posible gracias a un grupo de personas, residentes en varios países (Bélgica, Inglaterra, Canadá y México, entre otros) que colaboran bajo la rúbrica del ""Colectivo Carcoma"".
Los autores de la crónica son Luis Ramírez Trejo (escritor) y Christian Palma Montaño (fotógrafo). Además de los autores, mucha gente colabora en el proyecto. El diseño de arte final del libro y la página web corre a cargo de Fabian Espinosa. La traducción al inglés la lleva a cabo Laura Vega Meyer. Tine Defoor y Lindy Coyle participan en la promoción y difusión del proyecto.
Si quieres saber más de nuestra trayectoria puedes consultar la sección “quiénes somos” en nuestra página oficial: lapieldeldesierto.com.
 

El proyecto recibe la anuencia y el acompañamiento del Frente en Defensa de Wirikuta del que forma parte el Consejo Regional Wixárika. 


¿Cuál es la intención política de “La Piel del Desierto?
""Colectivo Carcoma"", lejos de esconderse bajo alguna supuesta neutralidad, se suma con este proyecto a la lucha por valorar la herencia cultural de los wixaritari y por defender al desierto sagrado de Wirikuta. Es por ello que, una vez cubiertos los costos de la edición del material, el 50% de lo recaudado y de la venta total del libro y los artículos de promoción se canalizará de manera directa al cuidado de los centros ceremoniales wixaritari, y al apoyo de proyectos gestionados por las comunidades wixárika.
En el ""Colectivo Carcoma"" compartimos, de una u otra forma, la idea de que la posibilidad de cambiar el mundo se encuentra más en la decisión y la responsabilidad de quienes toman en serio sus ideales, que en los sueños y buenos deseos que se enmohecen en los anaqueles de la desidia.
 
¿Cuál es la política de publicación de “La Piel del Desierto”?
El libro se publicará bajo un esquema de contenidos abiertos y una licencia Creative Commons. En un esfuerzo por difundir lo más posible este trabajo, los capítulos del libro serán liberados periódicamente durante la campaña de recaudación de fondos. El día del lanzamiento del libro se liberará el último capítulo y eso hará que “La Piel del Desierto” se encuentre disponible íntegramente en formato PDF para que todo aquél que lo desee —y que tenga acceso a Internet— pueda adquirirlo gratuitamente.
 
¿Qué necesitamos?
La publicación de todo el material requiere una cantidad mínima de unos 137.000 pesos mexicanos, 10.340 dólares estadounidenses o 7,800 euros. Un estimado mucho más cómodo y nuestra meta real es de 150.000 pesos mexicanos, 11,300 dólares estadounidenses u 8.700 euros. Si logramos recaudar más dinero podremos mejorar la calidad del libro (la portada puede ser en tapa dura, por ejemplo).
 
¿Cómo va a ser el libro y el resto del material?
El formato del libro es: 25 x 25 cm aproximadamente, 140 páginas (esto puede cambiar dependiendo de los requerimientos finales de impresión), papel tipo couché de al menos 130 grs, impresión a todo color.
Las medidas de las postales serán impresas en papel couché de 300 gramos (9 x 5 cms).
Los posters son en cartulina sulfatada de 12 puntos 35 x 45 cm.
Las playeras podrán ser elegidas en las siguientes medidas (chica, mediana, grande). Habrá varios diseños a elegir.
Durante la campaña publicaremos fotos de muestras de cada uno de los materiales de promoción.

<h3>What is the Manifesto?<br/>
</h3>
<b>The Worship Manifesto</b> is a book that's been three years in the making.  It's a memoir or my ups and downs of my exploration into worshipping God.  As a long-time Christian and church worshipper, I thought I knew everything there was to know.  But, in the last three years, I've gone through such an incredible transformation in my quest that it was like I accepted the Lord all over again!<br/>This book tackles my journey into worship - not that worship has changed, but my life and perspective of it has.  I pray that this book also changes your heart and life, too, as it brings you on the same adventure into the love and adoration of God through our art, our life...our worship.<br/><br/>This is the Manifesto.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>A complete publishing package and promotion kit from WestBow publishing is $6,000, which is my dream goal for my book.  Any amount close to this, though, would help me a lot.  <i>Meeting this goal </i>would get my book published, cover copyrights, and put my book on retail shelves.  <i>Exceeding my goal </i>would give me the chance to create a local book signing!  So, anything you can give goes a long way for me to fulfill this dream!<br/><br/>I also wanted to offer some great perks for your contribution.<br/><ul>
<li>Any amount: A Facebook shoutout thank you from me</li>
<li>$10 and above: A mention/shout-out on my weekly thank you video<br/>
</li>

The Worship Manifesto is a book that's been three years in the making.  It's a memoir or my ups and downs of my exploration into worshipping God.  As a long-time Christian and church worshipper, I thought I knew everything there was to know.  But, in the last three years, I've gone through such an incredible transformation in my quest that it was like I accepted the Lord all over again!This book tackles my journey into worship - not that worship has changed, but my life and perspective of it has.  I pray that this book also changes your heart and life, too, as it brings you on the same adventure into the love and adoration of God through our art, our life...our worship.This is the Manifesto.

What I Need & What You GetA complete publishing package and promotion kit from WestBow publishing is $6,000, which is my dream goal for my book.  Any amount close to this, though, would help me a lot.  Meeting this goal would get my book published, cover copyrights, and put my book on retail shelves.  Exceeding my goal would give me the chance to create a local book signing!  So, anything you can give goes a long way for me to fulfill this dream!I also wanted to offer some great perks for your contribution.
Any amount: A Facebook shoutout thank you from me
$10 and above: A mention/shout-out on my weekly thank you video

<h3></h3>
<h1>App Builders and the Problems You May Be Facing<br/>
</h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to create an app for
mobile phones and tablets?</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to create your own apps for mobile
phones and tablets, you have probably come across the same issues as others:</p>
<p>The current app builders available are either frustratingly <b>too expensive</b>, <b>they’re technical and confusing</b>. Maybe you found yourself
attempting to tackle boring learning curves, only to give up with only a partially
done app.</p>
<p>Some <b>charge per app</b>,
others <b>put ads in your app</b>. Yet
others limit you to just the itunes or android platforms, but not both, or they
charge you for the ability to publish to both.</p>
<p>Others restrict the number of downloads you can have, and
charge you more to remove some of the restrictions (hefty fees I might add).</p>
<p>Even most of the open source solutions out there are too
technical for most people, or they force it to remain open source to publish
it, allowing others to steal your code and recreate the same app with a
different name. (I see people selling these codes on forums to unsuspecting people.)<br/></p>
<p>And <b>worse</b>, did
you know, that with most of the “relatively easy” builders out there, your apps
will almost ALWAYS be rejected by Apple when you submit to them? </p>
<p>You may not have realized this – it’s because most “easy”
app builders are exclusively html5 <b>web apps</b>
– meaning they <b>require</b> an internet
connection to use the most important main features. Unfortunately, that is a <b>HUGE no-no with Apple</b>, and your apps
won’t get approved.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I had these <b>exact same frustrations</b> as you. And I took a lot of time
researching the options out there. It drove me <b><i>absolutely insane</i></b> to find
out these issues, and how few the solutions really were, and at best, none of
them were really affordable. I finally came up with a solution that mostly worked
for me, and realized, too many people needed it. </p>
<p><b>So I took the expense upon myself to make it much more affordable.</b></p>
<p>In August of 2012, we launched CreateCoolApps.com to help
keep the costs down. This allowed people to create true native apps on almost
all platforms, apps that can run on your device whether you’re connected to the
internet or NOT. </p>
<p>The fact is, many of our members are having great success creating
a wide variety of apps. </p>
<p>And they’re successfully publishing on all platforms – iTunes,
Google Play, Amazon, and HTML5 hybrid apps <i>for
almost all platforms</i> for those who want that option. </p>
<p><b>I put a lot of the
income that came in from the system, BACK into the system</b> for the staff,
for graphics, templates, promotions and other features and tools where
possible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>What This Is About and Why we need your Participation</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Now we’ve reached the point that many entrepreneurs face:
you either take the plunge and take it to the next level, or, you sit and hope
that everything remains the same, and you don’t change anything. As you
probably know, <i>if you don’t change
anything, eventually it will fall off and close up when someone else puts the
effort out to provide the features that you won’t.</i></p>
<p>I refuse to allow that because our members are having great
success, and they love our system. But to do it completely on our own will take
too much time.</p>
<p>You see, our members are asking for the ability to add more
games, to have database type apps, to plug in more ad systems to increase their
incomes or add in custom code. Our members want more templates, and even more
training – more simplified training (i.e., step by step walk thrus for those
who are not programmers)</p>
<p>Plus, another request that is in *Huge* demand right now, is
the ability to create Interactive books and Magazine apps <i>affordably</i>.</p>
<p><b>Here’s the problem:</b></p>
<p>CreateCoolApps is currently using an external service to
power our app builder. And it seriously limits what we can do, change, upgrade,
or add on.</p>
<p>This is because we <b>don’t
have access to the source code</b> to be able to make these improvements or add
ons.  We have to wait for the software
company to add the features… and we’re on their time frames. And to pay to add
on any features is very expensive, even more so if we want to keep the add on
features exclusive to our members.</p>
<p>The blunt fact is, with over 26,679 apps created with
CreateCoolApps as of Sept 25th, we’re quickly outgrowing the system as it
currently is.</p>
<p>We just cannot keep holding off on adding in the new
features and tools our members need.</p>
<p>This is frustrating to us, but more importantly, it’s
frustrating to you, our members, and anyone else who would like to create their
own apps with more features.</p>
<p><b>So here’s what I want
to do:</b></p>
<p>I want to take CreateCoolApps to the next level and <b>expand</b> it – and take <b>complete control</b> over the system.</p>
<p>I want to be able to provide these expanded features for our
members, and we want to <b><u>keep</u></b>
it affordable. </p>
<p>After surveying the CreateCoolApps members and listening to
their requests, I’ve come up with 2 strategies to accomplish this.</p>
<p><b>Introducing:
CreateCoolApps Pro.</b></p>
<p>Phase 1 of CCA Pro, is our own custom app builder, to
provide a new and easy way for our members to create <b>Magazine apps and Interactive Books</b>. I already hired a programmer
to do this several weeks ago, and its <b>already</b>
in production. This phase will be done in approximately 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ve already tested some of the initial parts of it.
I’ll be able to post some screenshots as soon as we have them, right now it’s
still in the code stage and from a viewing standpoint (user interface), there
isn’t much to see yet.</p>
<p><b><i>** NEW **</i></b>Just in the time that I was creating this part…. I
was having discussions with our lead developer on the custom builder, and we’ve
got some enhancements already being programmed in! We’re able to expand this to
an additional separate info/business app builder as well… but byond that…<br/></p>
<p>This phase will allow everyone,
from the “not tech user” to the programming “geek” (or at least someone who
LOVES to add in their own code!) will be able to!</p>
<p>This will also allow people to incorporate the builders into their own sites where they wish to! (Still, true native apps)<br/></p>
<p><b>We are striving to make some parts of it open source, to allow
programmers the ability to seriously expand on some of the features and create
their own plugins, so that we can create a full community at all levels. (And
yes, this will in time include games eventually).</b></p>
<p>Phase 2 of this, is buying out the source code for our main
app builder and getting it moved to our OWN servers so that we have 100% full
control –</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To make the app builder and members areas <b>easier to work with</b> for YOU</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>And Add more features for YOU and our other
members as soon as humanly possible</p>
<p>And with your support, to make these systems <b>the most user-friendly and scaleable</b>,
for the beginner app creator to the advanced person who wants to expand
further.</p>
<p>Of course this not only includes adding new features, it
also includes in time a complete overhaul and major improvement from the admin
and members side as well, which will speed up all support issues, account
activations, and even more importantly, the speed and control of app approvals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>What Is Your Money Going toward?<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>So this is where you
come in. </b>I’m looking for people who have an idea, or a passion for apps –
who want us to continue to keep the costs affordable, who want us to be able to
quickly add new features when you want them.</p>
<p>In turn for your help for us to accomplish this, I’ve set up
a series of rewards, so that you can participate for as little as $5 – and
benefit hugely.</p>
<p>We need to raise $383,000 to cover the team for SIX months.</p>
<p><b>Our 6 month expense
projections for staff and equipment are $382,544.94.</b></p>
<p><b>Our “ultimate” ideal preferred
stretch goal would be to cover for 1 year, is $624,845.86.</b></p>
<p>(While I am in Canada, I’m stating the funds as US because
we’re almost at par – with the fluctuations, this ensures that we don’t lose if
our dollar goes higher again).</p>
<p><b>The money that we
raise through this campaign will go to help us cover the cost of hiring
in-house <i>qualified <u>experienced</u></i>
programming staff and the technology required such as servers and software
licenses. </b></p>
<p>This was emphasized as a requirement by the company we’re
buying the software source code rights from. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Hire the required 2 highly QUALIFIED programmers
on staff full time to be constantly enhancing the system, adding features,
making it much more user friendly, and do custom work as requested</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Hire the required Network Administrator on staff
full time to be able to monitor the servers, work on the members areas, and
ensure all systems are running properly and upgraded as needed</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Hire full time support staff to be able to add
on phone support (in addition to our current web-only support) and training
sessions</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Hire a Social Media expert to help promote YOUR
apps, to assist in marketing training, to also hold workshops to assist in
teaching you how to promote your apps, etc.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Purchase the required equipment such as
computers for the staff, 2 more dedicated servers (we need 3, we already have
1), phone systems, etc.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Office space for the staff to work</p>
<p>Be assured this is NOT going to pay my salary. I work
online, I do sales of my own products and services already and have a modest
income from that (as mentioned, I do put the majority of my income back into the
business). This Indiegogo campaign is exclusively to allow us to expand the
system far beyond what we can currently do.</p>
<p><i><b>Why are we wanting to bring them in for a full year?</b></i> Because we need that to rebuild, improve upon the
current system and source code to build it out to what we want (and our members
are asking for)…</p>
<p>Having the programmers on staff full time, would allow us to
have control so that when members ask for features, we can say, “<b>yes we can</b>!” rather than, “<i>I’ll have to check</i>”.</p>
<p>And, in time we “may” be able to merge the two systems into
one large, integrated system.</p>
<p>We want to introduce <b>a new visual editor</b> to be able to
easily create the apps for those who have no knowledge of programming.</p>
<p>We want to introduce <b>a new form section to allow members to plug
in their own sdk’s (file) so that they can add in their preferred ad program,</b>
rather than the 2 that are currently the only options.</p>
<p>We want to add on<b> database capabilities</b>, as well as a
<b>graphics/icon designer</b> for those who DON’T have a MAC. (Currently almost all
out there are built for a Mac, not for PC users).</p>
<p>And in our custom builder, we want to add in <b>magazine apps</b>
that are SIMPLER to create, yet work on ALL platforms… and we want to enhance
the capabilities <b>and provide a portion that is open source, to encourage more
technical developers…</b> to encourage a marketplace for developers to offer their
own add ons free or for a small fee. </p>
<p><b>Here is the
timelines:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/99187/files/20130927063620-timeline.jpg?1380288980"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can find all the great perks on the side – from a thank
you, to your own white label system. (By white label, we mean <i><b>you could even
have your own members</b></i>, running from your site!)</p>
<p>So thank you again, and I hope you’ll participate and help
us reach our goal, so we can serve YOU better!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Other ways you can help</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, <b>we <i>can</i> do this with your participation.</b>
But whether you can participate financially or not, you can still help us
spread the word!</p>
<p>Please share this and mention to as many people as you can
(without spamming of course!)</p>
<p>Thanks to Indiegogo, we’re able to offer a contest! Yes, the
more you share, the more you could win! Prizes will range from CreateCoolApps
T-Shirts, to upgraded levels, to lifetime accounts, to secret features not yet
listed before anyone else gets them! Indiegogo has full tracking, so share away
and please, help us reach these goals!</p>
<h2>Questions and Notes:</h2>
<i><b>What happens if we don't get all the funding?</b></i> <br/><br/>Well we *can* work with a minimum of $50,000 if we had to - this will cover the costs of the custom builders, and allow us to buy the source code of the current main app system. However, it will not cover the cost of servers or staff. If for any reason we don't achieve our goals, we'll do everything we can to get the source code, and I'll simply continue to do promotions where necessary to finish getting the funds so we can do what we need to, or, we'll have to consider seeking traditional funding (which we prefer not to, as we don't really want to give away so much of our business that then becomes too expensive for members - that defeats our entire purpose of keeping it affordable)<br/><br/>In short, ANY funding received will go towards developing the system as much as we possibly can.<br/><br/>YES we CAN Still deliver on almost all of the perks within the time frames, for example the private label and white labels will be able to be provided as long as we reach a bare minimum of $50,000. We will simply have to keep paying the service company for their support/programmers, but we would then have the ability to do the private and white label editions of the current app builder.<br/><br/>If we only get a portion of that, we will still be able to proceed with the custom app builder, because frankly, we've already given the programmer a starting deposit, and will be able to complete it regardless.<br/><br/><h3><b>What staff do we currently have?</b></h3>Myself, Amber Jalink - as mentioned I've been working online full time since 1997, so I'm very experienced in marketing and product creation. (My first newsletter, started in 1997, was a marketing and business opportunity newsletter!) I've launched several successful websites, including one of the first ""pay per click"" search engines, and in fact, we created sidebar ads in our search engine BEFORE Google had them!<br/><br/>Debbie - Debbie is our accounts administrator - she handles all approvals of apps, and account payments and issues. (Debbie is also Canadian, and will be working in-office at the completion of this campaign. At this time, Debbie prefers to keep herself private from online, therefore we will not be revealing her full name.)<br/><br/>Tim Franklin is our resident ""IOS expert"" - While Tim works for us part time, he handles all support related to the apple platforms for our main app builder, as well as android assistance. Tim also creates most of our member training videos.<br/><br/>Jonathan Hamon is our ""ELAB2"" expert, he also works part time for us, and handles all support issues related to that side of things. (The ELAB2 side will NOT be touched with this campaign, it is a completely separate builder and we have no plans to purchase or utilize the source code of it). It is however, a system many of our members like for local businesses. Jonathan also handles some support for the main app builder as well.<br/><br/>JC is our lead developer for our custom app builder. (He requested at this time that his name remains unlisted for confidentiality sake of the project side he's working on). He has many years of experience programming, and has already been working on the custom builder for a few weeks now.<br/><br/>Obviously we cannot list our planned staff, as we need to hire them still ;)<br/><br/><i><b>What are the notes on the perks so that we understand everything?</b></i><br/><br/>First - because of the extensiveness of what we're providing, but are restricted in the amount of space, I'll be attaching a detailed document of the perks (or it will be posted in the updates), so that the higher levels don't look like they're getting ""less"". Obviously many of the levels build on each other, with some variations.<br/><br/>Second - here's what you want to know:<br/><br/><p><b>In general: </b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>all levels will
get access to the new CCAPro forum to get info on the release phases, and will
be listed according to your level. Higher levels will get private access to
additional areas.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Where “support
and maintenance fees” are stated, this will depend upon the level of usage
(bandwidth where applicable for builds) and support required, and that is
exclusively pertinent only to those who have a private label or white label
edition. We plan that these will be *under* $100/mo, depending on the level.
(Maximum $100. It will be less for those who choose say a private label vs. a
white label). These rates are exclusive to those who choose one of these levels
during the indiegogo campaign. If at a later time we re-open the ability to buy
a private label or white label edition, prices will be higher, as this is
special pricing for this campaign.</p>
<p><b>Notes on the magazine app builder:</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Yes it will work
on ipad/iphone, android AND kindle.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>“Personal”
membership means you can create magazines for yourself – NOT for anyone else.
They can however, be free OR paid, they can include in-app purchases, and they
can include advertising.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Access to the
magazine app builder is only where specified. Not every level gets it, so
please be sure if you want it, to choose the right level.</p>
<p><b>Notes on the new custom app builder:</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>It will be as our
other main app builder – it will create info or business style apps, whichever
you prefer. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>It will include
unlimited push notifications at no additional costs. (Remember to follow the
guidelines of the app stores though and never irritate your users by posting
too many!)</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>All apps are
always unbranded. We never put our links or even company name in your apps.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We never put ads
in your apps.</p>
<p><b>Notes on the current main app builder that we want to
buy the source code to:</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We are not
intending to compete with them, we have our own plans, and approach that is not
the same. (We can’t explain in more detail though at this time without giving
proprietary info away).</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>In time, we hope
to merge/combine this with our custom app builder for a different
strategy/approach/service offering.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Private labels will not be able to have their own
members to resell</b>. The purpose of a
“private label” is so that it’s branded to your name, your company (your
website), so that you can provide a private log in area for your local business
clients so that they can make adjustments (that you allow) to their apps, or to
send their own push notices.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>White labels will be able to have their own members</b>. You canNOT however, sell white label editions to
your members, however, you will be able to use our referral system that we will
create so that you are credited for it. *Note* that while you can have your own
members, you can NOT give away access for free. </p>
<p><b>Notes on the 2014 event for those applicable:</b></p>
<p><b>This will be a ""meet us in person"" and app
training event </b>that will take place
in either Niagara Falls or Toronto. (Yes, the Canadian side!)<b> (Travel/accommodations/meals not included) <br/></b></p>Estimated timing will probably be
around either spring (Late April-May) or early fall (Sept-Oct), but that might
change depending on availability of the location. (Trying to take into
consideration both our schedules and the cost of travel for everyone, which
would be lower at that time for most people).<br/><br/><p><b>Other notes:</b></p>
<b></b><b>Please note </b>that all private label and white label accounts are
for 1 year access, and will require a minimal monthly maintenance fee starting
around 60 days *after* delivery of the perk. (This ensures to provide enough
time to get you into earning mode).
<p>The monthly
maintenance/support fees are simply required because for example, if you have
many members (or sales), and updates are happening often, this puts a load on
the build servers. </p>
<p>The small monthly fee assists
in covering any bandwidth costs we may incur, as well as any additional
bug/support requests.</p>
<p>Support requests DO NOT
include building custom apps for you or your clients, or any exclusive
features. However – as we add new features, they would roll out to you as well.
(And you can request features of course!)</p>
<p>** None of the levels include
the ELAB2 builder as that’s proprietary software we have no control over **</p>
<p>When delivery date covers 2-3
months, expect that the perks will be delivered over a period of that time.
i.e., some aspects may be on the late end of that, like the white label side,
but others will be available earlier.</p>

A little over a year ago, I had these exact same frustrations as you. And I took a lot of time
researching the options out there. It drove me absolutely insane to find
out these issues, and how few the solutions really were, and at best, none of
them were really affordable. I finally came up with a solution that mostly worked
for me, and realized, too many people needed it. 
So I took the expense upon myself to make it much more affordable.
In August of 2012, we launched CreateCoolApps.com to help
keep the costs down. This allowed people to create true native apps on almost
all platforms, apps that can run on your device whether you’re connected to the
internet or NOT. 
The fact is, many of our members are having great success creating
a wide variety of apps. 
And they’re successfully publishing on all platforms – iTunes,
Google Play, Amazon, and HTML5 hybrid apps for
almost all platforms for those who want that option. 
I put a lot of the
income that came in from the system, BACK into the system for the staff,
for graphics, templates, promotions and other features and tools where
possible.


What This Is About and Why we need your Participation

Now we’ve reached the point that many entrepreneurs face:
you either take the plunge and take it to the next level, or, you sit and hope
that everything remains the same, and you don’t change anything. As you
probably know, if you don’t change
anything, eventually it will fall off and close up when someone else puts the
effort out to provide the features that you won’t.
I refuse to allow that because our members are having great
success, and they love our system. But to do it completely on our own will take
too much time.
You see, our members are asking for the ability to add more
games, to have database type apps, to plug in more ad systems to increase their
incomes or add in custom code. Our members want more templates, and even more
training – more simplified training (i.e., step by step walk thrus for those
who are not programmers)
Plus, another request that is in *Huge* demand right now, is
the ability to create Interactive books and Magazine apps affordably.
Here’s the problem:
CreateCoolApps is currently using an external service to
power our app builder. And it seriously limits what we can do, change, upgrade,
or add on.
This is because we don’t
have access to the source code to be able to make these improvements or add
ons.  We have to wait for the software
company to add the features… and we’re on their time frames. And to pay to add
on any features is very expensive, even more so if we want to keep the add on
features exclusive to our members.
The blunt fact is, with over 26,679 apps created with
CreateCoolApps as of Sept 25th, we’re quickly outgrowing the system as it
currently is.
We just cannot keep holding off on adding in the new
features and tools our members need.
This is frustrating to us, but more importantly, it’s
frustrating to you, our members, and anyone else who would like to create their
own apps with more features.
So here’s what I want
to do:
I want to take CreateCoolApps to the next level and expand it – and take complete control over the system.
I want to be able to provide these expanded features for our
members, and we want to keep
it affordable. 
After surveying the CreateCoolApps members and listening to
their requests, I’ve come up with 2 strategies to accomplish this.
Introducing:
CreateCoolApps Pro.
Phase 1 of CCA Pro, is our own custom app builder, to
provide a new and easy way for our members to create Magazine apps and Interactive Books. I already hired a programmer
to do this several weeks ago, and its already
in production. This phase will be done in approximately 6-8 weeks.
In fact, I’ve already tested some of the initial parts of it.
I’ll be able to post some screenshots as soon as we have them, right now it’s
still in the code stage and from a viewing standpoint (user interface), there
isn’t much to see yet.
** NEW **Just in the time that I was creating this part…. I
was having discussions with our lead developer on the custom builder, and we’ve
got some enhancements already being programmed in! We’re able to expand this to
an additional separate info/business app builder as well… but byond that…
This phase will allow everyone,
from the “not tech user” to the programming “geek” (or at least someone who
LOVES to add in their own code!) will be able to!
This will also allow people to incorporate the builders into their own sites where they wish to! (Still, true native apps)
We are striving to make some parts of it open source, to allow
programmers the ability to seriously expand on some of the features and create
their own plugins, so that we can create a full community at all levels. (And
yes, this will in time include games eventually).
Phase 2 of this, is buying out the source code for our main
app builder and getting it moved to our OWN servers so that we have 100% full
control –
· 
To make the app builder and members areas easier to work with for YOU
· 
And Add more features for YOU and our other
members as soon as humanly possible
And with your support, to make these systems the most user-friendly and scaleable,
for the beginner app creator to the advanced person who wants to expand
further.
Of course this not only includes adding new features, it
also includes in time a complete overhaul and major improvement from the admin
and members side as well, which will speed up all support issues, account
activations, and even more importantly, the speed and control of app approvals.


What Is Your Money Going toward?


So this is where you
come in. I’m looking for people who have an idea, or a passion for apps –
who want us to continue to keep the costs affordable, who want us to be able to
quickly add new features when you want them.
In turn for your help for us to accomplish this, I’ve set up
a series of rewards, so that you can participate for as little as $5 – and
benefit hugely.
We need to raise $383,000 to cover the team for SIX months.
Our 6 month expense
projections for staff and equipment are $382,544.94.
Our “ultimate” ideal preferred
stretch goal would be to cover for 1 year, is $624,845.86.
(While I am in Canada, I’m stating the funds as US because
we’re almost at par – with the fluctuations, this ensures that we don’t lose if
our dollar goes higher again).
The money that we
raise through this campaign will go to help us cover the cost of hiring
in-house qualified experienced
programming staff and the technology required such as servers and software
licenses. 
This was emphasized as a requirement by the company we’re
buying the software source code rights from. 
- 
Hire the required 2 highly QUALIFIED programmers
on staff full time to be constantly enhancing the system, adding features,
making it much more user friendly, and do custom work as requested
- 
Hire the required Network Administrator on staff
full time to be able to monitor the servers, work on the members areas, and
ensure all systems are running properly and upgraded as needed
- 
Hire full time support staff to be able to add
on phone support (in addition to our current web-only support) and training
sessions
- 
Hire a Social Media expert to help promote YOUR
apps, to assist in marketing training, to also hold workshops to assist in
teaching you how to promote your apps, etc.
- 
Purchase the required equipment such as
computers for the staff, 2 more dedicated servers (we need 3, we already have
1), phone systems, etc.
- 
Office space for the staff to work
Be assured this is NOT going to pay my salary. I work
online, I do sales of my own products and services already and have a modest
income from that (as mentioned, I do put the majority of my income back into the
business). This Indiegogo campaign is exclusively to allow us to expand the
system far beyond what we can currently do.
Why are we wanting to bring them in for a full year? Because we need that to rebuild, improve upon the
current system and source code to build it out to what we want (and our members
are asking for)…
Having the programmers on staff full time, would allow us to
have control so that when members ask for features, we can say, “yes we can!” rather than, “I’ll have to check”.
And, in time we “may” be able to merge the two systems into
one large, integrated system.
We want to introduce a new visual editor to be able to
easily create the apps for those who have no knowledge of programming.
We want to introduce a new form section to allow members to plug
in their own sdk’s (file) so that they can add in their preferred ad program,
rather than the 2 that are currently the only options.
We want to add on database capabilities, as well as a
graphics/icon designer for those who DON’T have a MAC. (Currently almost all
out there are built for a Mac, not for PC users).
And in our custom builder, we want to add in magazine apps
that are SIMPLER to create, yet work on ALL platforms… and we want to enhance
the capabilities and provide a portion that is open source, to encourage more
technical developers… to encourage a marketplace for developers to offer their
own add ons free or for a small fee. 
Here is the
timelines:


You can find all the great perks on the side – from a thank
you, to your own white label system. (By white label, we mean you could even
have your own members, running from your site!)
So thank you again, and I hope you’ll participate and help
us reach our goal, so we can serve YOU better!




Other ways you can help

Yes, we can do this with your participation.
But whether you can participate financially or not, you can still help us
spread the word!
Please share this and mention to as many people as you can
(without spamming of course!)
Thanks to Indiegogo, we’re able to offer a contest! Yes, the
more you share, the more you could win! Prizes will range from CreateCoolApps
T-Shirts, to upgraded levels, to lifetime accounts, to secret features not yet
listed before anyone else gets them! Indiegogo has full tracking, so share away
and please, help us reach these goals!
Questions and Notes:
What happens if we don't get all the funding? Well we *can* work with a minimum of $50,000 if we had to - this will cover the costs of the custom builders, and allow us to buy the source code of the current main app system. However, it will not cover the cost of servers or staff. If for any reason we don't achieve our goals, we'll do everything we can to get the source code, and I'll simply continue to do promotions where necessary to finish getting the funds so we can do what we need to, or, we'll have to consider seeking traditional funding (which we prefer not to, as we don't really want to give away so much of our business that then becomes too expensive for members - that defeats our entire purpose of keeping it affordable)In short, ANY funding received will go towards developing the system as much as we possibly can.YES we CAN Still deliver on almost all of the perks within the time frames, for example the private label and white labels will be able to be provided as long as we reach a bare minimum of $50,000. We will simply have to keep paying the service company for their support/programmers, but we would then have the ability to do the private and white label editions of the current app builder.If we only get a portion of that, we will still be able to proceed with the custom app builder, because frankly, we've already given the programmer a starting deposit, and will be able to complete it regardless.What staff do we currently have?Myself, Amber Jalink - as mentioned I've been working online full time since 1997, so I'm very experienced in marketing and product creation. (My first newsletter, started in 1997, was a marketing and business opportunity newsletter!) I've launched several successful websites, including one of the first ""pay per click"" search engines, and in fact, we created sidebar ads in our search engine BEFORE Google had them!Debbie - Debbie is our accounts administrator - she handles all approvals of apps, and account payments and issues. (Debbie is also Canadian, and will be working in-office at the completion of this campaign. At this time, Debbie prefers to keep herself private from online, therefore we will not be revealing her full name.)Tim Franklin is our resident ""IOS expert"" - While Tim works for us part time, he handles all support related to the apple platforms for our main app builder, as well as android assistance. Tim also creates most of our member training videos.Jonathan Hamon is our ""ELAB2"" expert, he also works part time for us, and handles all support issues related to that side of things. (The ELAB2 side will NOT be touched with this campaign, it is a completely separate builder and we have no plans to purchase or utilize the source code of it). It is however, a system many of our members like for local businesses. Jonathan also handles some support for the main app builder as well.JC is our lead developer for our custom app builder. (He requested at this time that his name remains unlisted for confidentiality sake of the project side he's working on). He has many years of experience programming, and has already been working on the custom builder for a few weeks now.Obviously we cannot list our planned staff, as we need to hire them still ;)What are the notes on the perks so that we understand everything?First - because of the extensiveness of what we're providing, but are restricted in the amount of space, I'll be attaching a detailed document of the perks (or it will be posted in the updates), so that the higher levels don't look like they're getting ""less"". Obviously many of the levels build on each other, with some variations.Second - here's what you want to know:In general: 
· 
all levels will
get access to the new CCAPro forum to get info on the release phases, and will
be listed according to your level. Higher levels will get private access to
additional areas.
· 
Where “support
and maintenance fees” are stated, this will depend upon the level of usage
(bandwidth where applicable for builds) and support required, and that is
exclusively pertinent only to those who have a private label or white label
edition. We plan that these will be *under* $100/mo, depending on the level.
(Maximum $100. It will be less for those who choose say a private label vs. a
white label). These rates are exclusive to those who choose one of these levels
during the indiegogo campaign. If at a later time we re-open the ability to buy
a private label or white label edition, prices will be higher, as this is
special pricing for this campaign.
Notes on the magazine app builder:
· 
Yes it will work
on ipad/iphone, android AND kindle.
· 
“Personal”
membership means you can create magazines for yourself – NOT for anyone else.
They can however, be free OR paid, they can include in-app purchases, and they
can include advertising.
· 
Access to the
magazine app builder is only where specified. Not every level gets it, so
please be sure if you want it, to choose the right level.
Notes on the new custom app builder:
· 
It will be as our
other main app builder – it will create info or business style apps, whichever
you prefer. 
· 
It will include
unlimited push notifications at no additional costs. (Remember to follow the
guidelines of the app stores though and never irritate your users by posting
too many!)
· 
All apps are
always unbranded. We never put our links or even company name in your apps.
· 
We never put ads
in your apps.
Notes on the current main app builder that we want to
buy the source code to:
· 
We are not
intending to compete with them, we have our own plans, and approach that is not
the same. (We can’t explain in more detail though at this time without giving
proprietary info away).
· 
In time, we hope
to merge/combine this with our custom app builder for a different
strategy/approach/service offering.
· 
Private labels will not be able to have their own
members to resell. The purpose of a
“private label” is so that it’s branded to your name, your company (your
website), so that you can provide a private log in area for your local business
clients so that they can make adjustments (that you allow) to their apps, or to
send their own push notices.
· 
White labels will be able to have their own members. You canNOT however, sell white label editions to
your members, however, you will be able to use our referral system that we will
create so that you are credited for it. *Note* that while you can have your own
members, you can NOT give away access for free. 
Notes on the 2014 event for those applicable:
This will be a ""meet us in person"" and app
training event that will take place
in either Niagara Falls or Toronto. (Yes, the Canadian side!) (Travel/accommodations/meals not included) Estimated timing will probably be
around either spring (Late April-May) or early fall (Sept-Oct), but that might
change depending on availability of the location. (Trying to take into
consideration both our schedules and the cost of travel for everyone, which
would be lower at that time for most people).Other notes:
Please note that all private label and white label accounts are
for 1 year access, and will require a minimal monthly maintenance fee starting
around 60 days *after* delivery of the perk. (This ensures to provide enough
time to get you into earning mode).
The monthly
maintenance/support fees are simply required because for example, if you have
many members (or sales), and updates are happening often, this puts a load on
the build servers. 
The small monthly fee assists
in covering any bandwidth costs we may incur, as well as any additional
bug/support requests.
Support requests DO NOT
include building custom apps for you or your clients, or any exclusive
features. However – as we add new features, they would roll out to you as well.
(And you can request features of course!)
** None of the levels include
the ELAB2 builder as that’s proprietary software we have no control over **
When delivery date covers 2-3
months, expect that the perks will be delivered over a period of that time.
i.e., some aspects may be on the late end of that, like the white label side,
but others will be available earlier.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<strong>AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK </strong><strong>AND WHY YOU SHOULD PLEDGE</strong>
</h2>
<h3><strong>Great Toys. Bad Karma</strong></h3>
<p>We have entered a new era called The Participation Age, and the hallmark of the Participation Age is “sharing”. The marching orders of the traditional office are, “Show up early, leave late, shut up, sit down, don’t make waves, live invisibly,” and worst of all, “go out quietly”.  Employees are told when to show up, what time recess and lunch are, and exactly what they should do while they are there. Pretty much the same way we would treat a five year old.</p>
<p>The Participation Age workers won’t put up with being treated like children, locked down daily for nine hours in the office day care center and told exactly what to do. The Participation Age demands we allow people to share in the creative process of building the company together, and in the rewards that come from doing so.</p>
<p>There is no turning back. The Industrial Age is behind us and the Participation Age is fully upon us. People today want to Make Meaning, not just money.  To get there, we have to recognize and confront the seven core business diseases of the Industrial Age that were developed for the Factory System. Those management practices will not serve us in the Participation Age. The cure has become the disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Employee – One of the Business Diseases of the Industrial Age</strong></h3>
<p>The modern concept of an employee is just one of those diseases.  We expect people to be adults when they live across the street, or at the grocery store, driving a car, or eating at a restaurant. But when it comes to work, we herd them into the office day care center like children, tell them exactly when to show up and go home, when recess begins, how long lunch can be, and exactly what they should do all day long. We tell them not to question authority, be blindly loyal to those in charge, and live passively as others direct their lives; pretty much what we would want a preschooler to do. Employees are just children in adult bodies.</p>
<p>But companies who embrace the Participation Age are replacing employees with Stakeholders, who are self-managed adults, who don’t need a day care supervisor. Stakeholders are measured not by where they work, or even when they work, but by what they accomplish. They don’t need promotions, titles, vacation time or other archaic Industrial Age controlling mechanisms. Stakeholders work more effectively, get more time off, and build an integrated work/home life where they can Make Meaning, not just money. </p>
<p>Our company rejects the business diseases of the Industrial Age. And as a result we have grown by 50% to 100% every year in the last four years. In our groundbreaking book, Why Employees Are Always a Bad Idea, we expose all 15 of these business diseases, and we share stories of a growing wave of old and new companies, from 20 Stakeholders to 10,000, who are embracing the Participation Age with us.</p>
<p>If you are a Stakeholder looking to Make Meaning, you will want to read this book to help you find the companies that are looking for you and that can provide the perfect culture fit. If you are the owner of a small company, a manager in any company, or the CEO of a big one, you will want to read this book to find out how you should do business in the Participation Age, and how you can attract the best Stakeholders for your company.</p>
<p>Join us in bringing this book to life and in carrying the message of the Participation Age Stakeholder to the business world? Stand with us, and the growing wave of companies building the future of business, where both the company and the Stakeholders can Make Meaning while also making money. </p>
<p>Don’t wait. Pledge now. Thank you for partnering with us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve built seven businesses in five different industries, but now I focus all my energy on helping others figure out how to build a business that makes money while they are on vacation. We’ve helped business owners on four continents get off the treadmill and my new book, <em>How Employees Are Always a Bad Idea</em>, will help them even more.</p>
<p>My much better half, Diane, runs the operations side of our business. Our three grown kids are scattered around the U.S. and all own their own businesses – I guess it’s in the DNA.</p>
<p>I regularly do keynotes and workshops – dozens every year. It keeps me sharp and helps me learn what is actually going on in the trenches of business.  Our customers are scattered around the U.S. and the world. Writing what I’m learning is a passion, so you’ll occasionally see my work in rags like the Harvard Business Journal, Entrepreneur Magazine, NYTimes.com, and various online mediums. As well, it was my great honor to be cited by Dr. Stephen Covey in his last book, <em>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Alternative,</em> before he sadly passed away. The world misses him.</p>
<p>I’ve played a lot of soccer (football) and low-handicap golf in my life, but my passion now is biking – the pedal kind. It’s great exercise, takes no thinking, let’s me see the world, and allows me to compete or smell the roses, depending on the ride.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What You Are Funding With Your Pledge?</strong></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you’re funding your own copies of my new book, <em>Why Employees Are Always a Bad Idea,</em> in your favorite format, for around the same cost as if you ordered it from Amazon or our own website. Shipping is included and you’ll get it as much as two months ahead of the market, and the satisfaction of having helped us get it out there fast. At various levels, you’re also funding your own clock, bookmarks, one2ones, workshops, and even keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Second, with your pre-orders of the book and other materials, you’ll be pre-funding the costs of putting this book on the street. So not only will your pledge get great benefits to you fast, it will pre-fund structural editing by experts, copy editing and line editing by a whole different set of experts, cover design, book layout, website design and programming, printing of the first few thousand books, and initial marketing to people who can open the gates to thousands of readers. And if we manage to surpass our goal, we plan to use the extra funds to begin work on a book ordering website with practical tools that aids in building a Participation Age company and learning how to be a stakeholder. As well, we plan to use the extra funds to make the website interactive in order to connect Participation Age companies with stakeholders and create an audio verision of the book. It costs a lot of money to put a book out, and we’re thrilled that you would want your copy early enough to help us out.</p>

The Participation Age demands we allow people to share in the creative process of building the company together, and in the rewards that come from doing so.
There is no turning back. The Industrial Age is behind us and the Participation Age is fully upon us. People today want to Make Meaning, not just money.  To get there, we have to recognize and confront the seven core business diseases of the Industrial Age that were developed for the Factory System. Those management practices will not serve us in the Participation Age. The cure has become the disease.
Employee – One of the Business Diseases of the Industrial Age
The modern concept of an employee is just one of those diseases.  We expect people to be adults when they live across the street, or at the grocery store, driving a car, or eating at a restaurant. But when it comes to work, we herd them into the office day care center like children, tell them exactly when to show up and go home, when recess begins, how long lunch can be, and exactly what they should do all day long. We tell them not to question authority, be blindly loyal to those in charge, and live passively as others direct their lives; pretty much what we would want a preschooler to do. Employees are just children in adult bodies.
But companies who embrace the Participation Age are replacing employees with Stakeholders, who are self-managed adults, who don’t need a day care supervisor. Stakeholders are measured not by where they work, or even when they work, but by what they accomplish. They don’t need promotions, titles, vacation time or other archaic Industrial Age controlling mechanisms. Stakeholders work more effectively, get more time off, and build an integrated work/home life where they can Make Meaning, not just money. 
Our company rejects the business diseases of the Industrial Age. And as a result we have grown by 50% to 100% every year in the last four years. In our groundbreaking book, Why Employees Are Always a Bad Idea, we expose all 15 of these business diseases, and we share stories of a growing wave of old and new companies, from 20 Stakeholders to 10,000, who are embracing the Participation Age with us.
If you are a Stakeholder looking to Make Meaning, you will want to read this book to help you find the companies that are looking for you and that can provide the perfect culture fit. If you are the owner of a small company, a manager in any company, or the CEO of a big one, you will want to read this book to find out how you should do business in the Participation Age, and how you can attract the best Stakeholders for your company.
Join us in bringing this book to life and in carrying the message of the Participation Age Stakeholder to the business world? Stand with us, and the growing wave of companies building the future of business, where both the company and the Stakeholders can Make Meaning while also making money. 
Don’t wait. Pledge now. Thank you for partnering with us.
 
Who Am I?
I’ve built seven businesses in five different industries, but now I focus all my energy on helping others figure out how to build a business that makes money while they are on vacation. We’ve helped business owners on four continents get off the treadmill and my new book, How Employees Are Always a Bad Idea, will help them even more.
My much better half, Diane, runs the operations side of our business. Our three grown kids are scattered around the U.S. and all own their own businesses – I guess it’s in the DNA.
I regularly do keynotes and workshops – dozens every year. It keeps me sharp and helps me learn what is actually going on in the trenches of business.  Our customers are scattered around the U.S. and the world. Writing what I’m learning is a passion, so you’ll occasionally see my work in rags like the Harvard Business Journal, Entrepreneur Magazine, NYTimes.com, and various online mediums. As well, it was my great honor to be cited by Dr. Stephen Covey in his last book, The 3rd Alternative, before he sadly passed away. The world misses him.
I’ve played a lot of soccer (football) and low-handicap golf in my life, but my passion now is biking – the pedal kind. It’s great exercise, takes no thinking, let’s me see the world, and allows me to compete or smell the roses, depending on the ride.
 
 
What You Are Funding With Your Pledge?
First and foremost, you’re funding your own copies of my new book, Why Employees Are Always a Bad Idea, in your favorite format, for around the same cost as if you ordered it from Amazon or our own website. Shipping is included and you’ll get it as much as two months ahead of the market, and the satisfaction of having helped us get it out there fast. At various levels, you’re also funding your own clock, bookmarks, one2ones, workshops, and even keynote speaker.
Second, with your pre-orders of the book and other materials, you’ll be pre-funding the costs of putting this book on the street. So not only will your pledge get great benefits to you fast, it will pre-fund structural editing by experts, copy editing and line editing by a whole different set of experts, cover design, book layout, website design and programming, printing of the first few thousand books, and initial marketing to people who can open the gates to thousands of readers. And if we manage to surpass our goal, we plan to use the extra funds to begin work on a book ordering website with practical tools that aids in building a Participation Age company and learning how to be a stakeholder. As well, we plan to use the extra funds to make the website interactive in order to connect Participation Age companies with stakeholders and create an audio verision of the book. It costs a lot of money to put a book out, and we’re thrilled that you would want your copy early enough to help us out.",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>La ""Asociación Lucha de Clases"" está orgullosa de presentar una obra que tardó 80 años en ser producida. La obra maestra inacabada de Trotsky, “Stalin”. Traducida directamente de la edición inglesa publicada por <i>Wellred Books</i> en julio de 2016.</strong><br/><br/>El 20 de agosto de 1940 la vida de Trotsky fue brutalmente apagada cuando un agente estalinista hundió un piolet sobre su cabeza. Entre las obras que dejó sin terminar se encontraba la segunda parte de su biografía sobre Stalin. <br/><br/>El Stalin de Trotsky es una obra única en la literatura marxista en la que intenta explicar algunos de los acontecimientos más decisivos del siglo XX, no sólo en términos de las transformaciones económicas y sociales que forjaron la época, sino de la psicología individual de uno de los protagonistas de un gran drama histórico. Es un estudio fascinante del modo en que  el carácter peculiar de un individuo, sus trazos y psicología individuales, interactúa con los grandes acontecimientos.  <br/><br/>¿Cómo pudo ser que Stalin, que comenzó su vida política como un revolucionario bolchevique, terminara como un tirano y un monstruo? ¿Estaba esto predeterminado por factores genéticos o por las vivencias de su infancia? Extrayendo una masa de material reunido cuidadosamente de sus archivos personales y de otras fuentes, Trotsky proporciona la respuesta a estas preguntas.<br/><br/>En la actual edición hemos reunido todo el material que estaba disponible en los archivos de Trotsky en inglés junto a material suplementario traducido del ruso. Es la versión más completa del libro que se haya publicado nunca. En el centenario de la Revolución de Octubre, creemos que Stalin, de Trotsky, es más relevante e inspirador que nunca.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496948691/or4h1gnc6gnnqgadam3w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>LA HISTORIA DE LA BIOGRAFÍA INACABADA DE STALIN, DE LEÓN TROTSKY</strong><br/>Por Rob Sewell<br/><br/>El libro ""Stalin"", de León Trotsky, fue encargado por la editorial Harper Brothers de Nueva York en febrero de 1938 y se publicó por primera vez en inglés en 1946. “Stalin” fue la última obra importante de Trotsky. Sin embargo, su vida se vio truncada por un asesino estalinista el 20 de agosto de 1940. El libro nunca fue terminado.<br/><br/>Mientras Trotsky trabajaba en el libro, el manuscrito estaba siendo traducido al inglés por Charles Malamud. Tras su asesinato, los manuscritos inacabados fueron entregados a Malamud, no sólo para la traducción, sino en realidad para editar el trabajo para su publicación. <br/><br/>Cualquiera que fuera el talento de Malamud, esta era una tarea política para la cual era completamente inadecuado. Cuando el libro se publicó finalmente, la nueva versión ""corregida"" contenía grandes trozos de material insertados por el editor, que eran claramente una violación del pensamiento político de Trotsky. Pese a las protestas indignadas de la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova, el material ofensivo fue mantenido por los editores.<br/><br/>La razón principal para la reedición de esta edición recientemente ampliada del Stalin de Trotsky es poner fin a esta violación e insertar el material que fue excluido por el editor. Este proyecto de volver a publicar el Stalin original de Trotsky en esta forma actualizada ha llevado más de una década para su edición. El volumen elimina las inserciones políticas de Malamud, que ascendieron a más de diez mil palabras, y restaura el manuscrito original a partir del material inédito de los archivos de Trotsky depositados en la Universidad de Harvard. </p>

Nota: Stalin no está incluido. Cortesía de David King<br/><br/>Esta nueva edición es la más completa que haya sido publicada nunca en ningún idioma, incluyendo el inglés o el ruso, y ha aumentado el tamaño en comparación con el original en más de un treinta por ciento. Representa el trabajo más extenso jamás realizado para ""reconstruir"" el libro, y comprende casi cien mil más palabras más que la edición original de 1946. Malamud explicó que él había dejado tal cual estaban los primeros siete capítulos, ""a excepción de unas pocas eliminaciones de material repetitivo"". <br/><br/>Nos hemos tomado la libertad de restaurar este material lo mejor que hemos podido. En lugar de seguir la disposición de Malamud, hemos elegido nuestro propio criterio, siguiendo la cronología de los acontecimientos. La edición de este material para asegurar su máxima continuidad fue llevada a cabo por Alan Woods, que también tradujo el grueso del material en ruso. <br/><br/><strong>Los archivos de Trotsky </strong><br/>En el año 2003, mientras estaba en un viaje político por los Estados Unidos, visité Boston y aproveché para visitar los archivos de Trotsky en la universidad cercana. Trotsky había acordado que el material fuera enviado a Harvard para su custodia. ""Los archivos se van [a Estados Unidos] esta mañana en el tren"", escribió Trotsky el 17 de julio de 1940, poco más de un mes antes de su asesinato. (Suplemento de los Escritos de 1934-1940, p.863) <br/><br/>Me sorprendió la gran cantidad de material contenido en el archivo. Me llamó la atención el material sobre el último libro de Trotsky –Stalin. Para mi sorpresa, descubrí que había nueve grandes cajas de manuscritos en el archivo, los manuscritos Harper (piezas H1 - H28), que contienen todos los materiales preparatorios para el libro de Stalin. Estos contenían todos los archivos originales, los borradores, las pruebas de galería, recortes de prensa y notas manuscritas y mecanografiadas, así como un número de cajas que contienen todas las traducciones al inglés de Charles Malamud de los originales rusos de Trotsky.</p>

<p><strong>                                                 El archivo contiene <br/>                                           unos 20.000 documentos, <br/>                                        incluyendo unas 4.000 cartas.</strong><br/><br/>Lo primero que llama la atención acerca de la colección del Stalin son las diferentes capas, acumuladas como capas geológicas, que finalmente se utilizaron para producir la primera mitad del libro, es decir, la que llega hasta 1917. Estos primeros borradores contenían textos manuscritos y mecanografiados, y los segundos borradores que estaban completamente mecanografiados, traducidos y luego devueltos a Trotsky para su posterior corrección, edición y pulido. Trotsky sin duda tomaba a mucho orgullo ""pulir"" sus escritos, así como buscar la manera de mejorar las traducciones en inglés, para que el significado pudiera ser lo más preciso posible. <br/><br/>Mi primera visita a Harvard identificó simplemente lo que había allí. En visitas posteriores, pedí ver todo el archivo del Stalin, que me fue entregado en la sala de lectura en un gran carrito. Los archivos que contienen los materiales se encuentran en grandes cajas de archivo y numerados en carpetas separadas (bsmRuss 13.3) H1 - H28. Estos también contienen todos los recortes de periódicos y diversos materiales que fueron traducidos al inglés, pero no utilizados en la edición final del libro, incluyendo los borradores originales, conservados en las carpetas H14 - H19.  <br/><br/><strong>Charles Malamud</strong><br/>La primera parte del Stalin se ocupa de manera magistral del papel del individuo en la historia, trazando la evolución de Stalin desde que era un muchacho joven en el Seminario hasta que se convirtió en un revolucionario profesional en los años previos a la Revolución de 1917. Sin embargo, la segunda parte incompleta, que, incluso en la edición mutilada publicada, contiene material extremadamente interesante, se vio empañada por las adiciones introducidas por Charles Malamud. Esto no era simplemente un material de puente para salvar algunas lagunas en los escritos, como él lo justificó, sino que fue compuesto de trozos enteros de texto en ciertos capítulos, que contradicen claramente la línea política del libro. <br/><br/>Cuando la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova y el abogado de Trotsky, Albert Goldman, vieron el texto, se opusieron vehementemente a la publicación del libro en esta forma vulgarizada. Esteban Volkov, nieto de Trotsky, también intentó sin éxito impedir la re-publicación del libro a finales de 1960. <br/><br/>¿Cómo pudo un hombre como Malamud terminar la edición del Stalin de Trotsky? El conocimiento de Charles Malamud del ruso era ciertamente útil y su talento fue puesto a buen uso en la traducción de algunos de los artículos de Trotsky. Trotsky, como veremos, nunca estuvo muy impresionado por este joven ""simpatizante"" ni por sus habilidades. Sin embargo, Trotsky estaba muy necesitado de ayuda y tenía que trabajar con el material que estaba a su disposición. </p>

El 26 de abril Trotsky escribió a Sara Weber donde le informaba que estaba ""trabajando ahora en el libro de Stalin"". Sin embargo él había encontrado un problema que quería que ella resolviera. ""En cada página me enfrento a la investigación de datos geográficos, históricos, cronológicos, biográficos, etc."", así que le pidió, ""¿no sería posible encontrar una enciclopedia de la época pre-revolucionaria [rusa] en Nueva York? ... La cuestión es muy importante para mí porque de lo contrario mi trabajo se entorpecería constantemente"". <br/><br/>Al cabo de unos meses Malamud recibió el manuscrito ruso del primer capítulo: ""La familia y la escuela"". Las cosas parecían proceder bastante rápidamente. El segundo capítulo fue enviado por correo a Malamud el 16 de agosto y el tercer capítulo el 12 de septiembre. Pero el trabajo no pudo proseguir tan bien debido a varias interrupciones. Antes del final del año, Harpers le había negado a Trotsky anticipos financieros sobre la base de que era lento en la entrega de las porciones del manuscrito. <br/><br/>Había otros problemas con el libro. Sin pedir permiso a Trotsky, Malamud había mostrado el manuscrito a terceras partes, a saber, Max Shachtman y James Burnham que estaban encabezando una minoría en el SWP norteamericano [el grupo trotskista de EEUU, NdT] que se oponía al análisis de Trotsky del carácter de la URSS. Cuando Trotsky tuvo conocimiento de esto se puso furioso, tomando el incidente como un abuso de confianza. Trotsky se quejó a Joseph Hansen: <br/><br/>""Entonces, en contra de todas mis advertencias, él [Malamud] se permitió una indiscreción condenable con mi manuscrito. Protesté. Su deber elemental debería haber sido disculparse por su error y todo habría estado de nuevo en orden. También me parece que los camaradas Burnham y Shachtman cometieron un error al entrar en una discusión con él acerca de la calidad del manuscrito sin preguntarle a él si tenía o no mi autorización para darles el manuscrito. Lo mejor hubiera sido que los camaradas Burnham y Shachtman, por iniciativa propia, hubieran explicado que, junto con Malamud, fueron algo indiscretos y que era lo mejor reconocerlo como tal y dejar las cosas así"". <br/><br/>En esta carta, Trotsky concluyó sin rodeos: ""Malamud parece tener al menos tres cualidades: que no sabe ruso; que no sabe inglés; y que es tremendamente pretencioso. Dudo que él sea el mejor de los traductores... ""(Suplemento de los Escritos 1934-1940, P.830, el énfasis es mío - RS) En estas pocas palabras Trotsky revela una apreciación perspicaz de la pretensión de Malamud, que fue ampliamente demostrada por los acontecimientos posteriores. Sin embargo, no hubo más remedio que seguir utilizando sus servicios. <br/><br/>                         <strong>El trabajo más exhaustivo acometido <br/>                                  para “reconstruir” el libro, <br/>                             con la incorporación de más de <br/>                         cien mil palabras más que la edición<br/>                                              original de 1946.</strong><br/><br/>La indignación de Trotsky con esta indiscreción reflejaba su profunda preocupación por la seguridad y el temor de que el manuscrito del Stalin pudiera caer en las manos equivocadas. Este era un peligro muy real en ese momento. Trotsky estaba comprometido en una lucha a vida o muerte contra los crímenes del estalinismo. Stalin estaba obsesionado con Trotsky y estaba determinado a silenciarlo. Por lo tanto, ordenó a sus agentes de la policía secreta - la GPU - que penetraran en el movimiento trotskista y llevaran a cabo el máximo de sabotaje. <br/><br/>Los agentes estalinistas ya habían logrado prender fuego a su casa en Prinkipo (durante su exilio en Turquía) donde algunos de sus papeles y documentos fueron destruidos. ""La GPU va a hacer todo lo posible para poner sus manos en mis archivos"", escribió Trotsky el 10 de octubre de 1936. (Escritos, 1935-6, p. 440). Un mes más tarde, sus archivos encomendados al Instituto Holandés de Historia Social fueron saqueados en París y ciertos documentos robados. ""Con el fin de dejarme impotente frente a la difamación, la GPU está tratando de poner sus manos en mis archivos, ya sea con el robo, el allanamiento de morada, o el asesinato"", declaró Trotsky. (Ibid, p.462) <br/><br/>Mark Zborowski, un agente estalinista, se había infiltrado en el movimiento en Francia y se había colado en el círculo de confianza de León Sedov. Los rusoparlantes eran escasos y el movimiento tenía una necesidad desesperante de ayuda. Con el tiempo, llegó a ayudar en la edición del Boletín de la Oposición en París. Zborowski, cuyo nombre de partido era ""Etienne"", pronto tuvo acceso a la caja de seguridad que contenía la correspondencia entre Sedov y Trotsky. Haciendo uso de su posición, pasaba regularmente información sobre Trotsky a la inteligencia soviética, que después se la pasaba a Stalin personalmente. Fue Zborowski quien se aseguraba de que las copias de los escritos de Trotsky fueran colocados sobre el escritorio de Stalin antes incluso de que se publicaran. Stalin leía cada número del Boletín de la Oposición, prestando especial atención a los artículos sobre él mismo. <br/><br/>Trotsky temía que a través del robo u otros medios, los agentes de Stalin trataran de robar o destruir los borradores. Por lo tanto, se tomaron todas las precauciones para mantenerlos a salvo. Estos temores estaban bien fundados. Cuando Stalin fue informado sobre el nuevo trabajo de Trotsky, se puso furioso y estuvo dispuesto a llegar a cualquier extremo para evitar su publicación. <br/><br/>A lo largo de 1939, Trotsky siguió adelante con el Stalin, pero se encontró con más interrupciones, sin olvidar la necesidad de salir de la casa de Diego Rivera en mayo, tras la ruptura de Rivera con el trotskismo, y luego la batalla legal por la custodia de su nieto, Sieva (Esteban Volkov). Sieva iba a dejar Europa y tomar posesión de su nuevo hogar con Trotsky y Natalia en la Ciudad de México el 6 de agosto de 1939. <br/><br/><strong>El asesinato de Trotsky </strong><br/>En abril de 1940, en el momento del primer intento de asesinato de su vida, la mitad del libro ya había sido terminado (hasta 1917) y el resto del libro estaba en diversas fases de ejecución. El libro estaba ahora en espera, con casi todo el trabajo dedicado a atender las disposiciones legales necesarias para la investigación del ataque, así como a los tribunales mexicanos. Trotsky también tuvo que responder a una descarga continua de mentiras y calumnias de los periódicos estalinistas de México y del extranjero, ya que intensificaron sus ataques verbales. <br/><br/>En el momento del asesinato de Trotsky el 20 de agosto, el libro sólo había sido completado a la mitad, con una gran cantidad de material restante en forma de borrador en diferentes estados de preparación. Se las arregló para comprobar la traducción en inglés de los primeros seis capítulos, pero no había tenido la oportunidad de comprobar el séptimo. <br/><br/>Una serie de mitos se han circulado sobre el libro del Stalin, principalmente por el propio Charles Malamud. Malamud inventó la historia de que en el ataque de agosto algunos de los manuscritos del Stalin estaban salpicados de sangre y otros totalmente destruidos. Se repite esto en su prólogo al libro del Stalin: ""Algunos de los manuscritos de la parte inacabada estaban en el estudio de Trotsky, ensartados en enormes y largas tiras con muchas hojas pegadas de extremo a extremo. En el momento del ataque asesino, y en la lucha con el asesino, partes del manuscrito no quedaron sólo salpicadas de sangre, sino totalmente destruidas"". </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496766779/r7w4ktdqq2ti9xllanyb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Fotografía de la Policía del estudio de Trotsky tras su asesinato<br/><br/>No hay evidencia alguna en los archivos de Trotsky en Harvard que apoyen esta afirmación. Habiendo examinado todas las páginas del material original del Stalin, incluyendo las largas tiras pegadas de extremo a extremo, puedo decir con seguridad que no hay evidencia de manchas de sangre ni de ninguna otra cosa que apoye este cuento de hadas. Ningún daño en absoluto puede ser visto. La fotografía de la policía del estudio de Trotsky tras el asesinato revela algunos periódicos esparcidos por el suelo después de la lucha, pero no hay ninguna señal de ""largas tiras de pruebas de galeras salpicadas de sangre"". Es evidente que Charles Malamud inventó esta historia para dramatizar todo el asunto e impulsar así su propio papel en ""rescatar"" el manuscrito de Trotsky. Este no es el único ejemplo de comportamiento inescrupuloso de su parte. <br/><br/>Tras la muerte de Trotsky, los editores norteamericanos, que eran dueños de los derechos del libro, colocaron a Malamud de responsable, no sólo de la traducción, sino de la ""edición"" final del libro. Para ellos, esto era simplemente un cálculo comercial para salvar el libro después de la muerte del autor. Los puntos de vista de Trotsky no entraban en sus cálculos. <br/><br/><strong>Las distorsiones de Malamud </strong><br/>Tan pronto como Malamud hubo tenido acceso a los manuscritos inacabados de Trotsky, continuó con su traducción. Parece que el método utilizado por Malamud fue traducir verbalmente páginas de texto en ruso a una mecanógrafa en idioma inglés. Esto se puede ver a partir de las numerosas faltas de ortografía de los nombres rusos en los borradores escritos a máquina. Malamud se acercó entonces a estas primeras versiones para pulir la traducción. <br/><br/>A partir de este punto, Malamud, ahora traductor y editor del Stalin de Trotsky, decidiría lo que entraría y lo que se quedaría fuera del libro. También era libre de añadir sus propios comentarios como material de relleno. ""La política editorial en lo que se refiere a la parte sin terminar del manuscrito fue publicar el texto de Trotsky en su totalidad, excepto el material repetitivo y totalmente ajeno al tema"", afirma Malamud en su nota de editor. ""Bajo estas circunstancias, eran inevitables extensas interpolaciones del editor"". Además, ocho páginas del texto se componen de ""partes de las notas del autor [pero] resumidas por el editor"".<br/><br/>                           <strong>Un 30% de incremento en el tamaño <br/>                          comparado con la versión original</strong><br/><br/>Malamud utilizó esta posición como editor para introducir sus propios comentarios políticos en partes del libro, utilizando extensas interpolaciones entre paréntesis. Estas adiciones no autorizadas sirven para distorsionar y tergiversar el punto de vista político de Trotsky e iban contra todo el espíritu político del libro. Consideraban el estalinismo como inevitable y consecuencia del bolchevismo –una visión que estaba en contradicción directa con la posición mantenida por Trotsky, que está claramente expresada en su biografía de Stalin. <br/><br/>Para ilustrar la magnitud de estas ""interpolaciones"", es suficiente con mirar el Capítulo Once original: ""De la Oscuridad al Triunvirato"". De las aproximadamente 1.200 líneas de este capítulo, el sesenta y dos por ciento son de Malamud, y el treinta y ocho por ciento son de Trotsky. No hay ni una sola palabra de Trotsky hasta después de siete páginas y media de Malamud. Todo esto se hizo pasar en la nota del editor simplemente como ""comentario"" esencial ¡por motivos de ""fluidez y claridad""! <br/><br/>Esta intromisión política condujo a intercambios amargos entre Malamud y Natalia Sedova. Después de mostrar las pruebas finales del libro, Natalia y el abogado de Trotsky, Albert Goldman, se opusieron enérgicamente a los contenidos. Hay una sección entera de cartas en el archivo de Trotsky que contiene las objeciones planteadas por Natalia y Albert Goldman. Su indignación se revela en sus comentarios condenatorios, escritos en las páginas de prueba: ""Falso, totalmente falso ... lo escrito y terminado exclusivamente por Trotsky es lo que se debe utilizar. No es real la copia 'editada'"". ""¡Inaceptable Revisión de la historia!"" ""Inaceptable"", ""Falsa revisión de los acontecimientos históricos."" Etc. <br/><br/>La viuda de Trotsky se opuso a la ""inaudita violencia cometida por el traductor sobre los derechos de autor"". Ella continuó insistiendo en que ""todo lo escrito por la pluma del señor Malamud debe ser borrado del libro."" ""Como concesión”, escribieron: ""podríamos estar de acuerdo en añadirlos al propio texto de LD –siempre y cuando los originales sean revisados en primer lugar por nosotros."" A continuación, pasaron a tachar páginas de comentarios de Malamud. Pero todo fue en vano, los comentarios no autorizados fueron mantenidos en la versión publicada. [Harvard, carpetas BM3 Russ 13.3 - H12 (1de2)]. <br/><br/>Natalia recurrió a acciones legales para impedir la publicación, pero el caso se perdió. Cuando el libro finalmente vio la luz del día, Malamud cínicamente anunció que la publicación se llevaba a cabo ¡""sin censura, ya sea de trotskistas o de estalinistas""! La publicación del Stalin fue planeada originalmente para 1941. Pero mientras que el libro estaba en proceso de ser impreso y distribuido a los mayoristas, el gobierno de Estados Unidos intervino para detener la publicación. Después de la invasión de la Unión Soviética por Hitler, Roosevelt no quería molestar a su nuevo aliado –Iosif Stalin. <br/><br/>""Este [el Stalin de Trotsky] fue impreso por su editor, Harper and Brothers, pero retirado por ellos antes de la venta al público a finales de 1941"", escribe Frank C. Hanighen, escritor de artículos para el Progressive de La Follette en el número del 1º de mayo de 1944. ""Los editores dieron como razón para la retirada 'una preocupación por los efectos adversos en el trabajo de las relaciones internacionales', dice la señora Lombard ..."" <br/><br/>La señora Helen Lombard, una periodista del Washington Evening Star, expuso la forma en que se decidió la supresión del libro. <br/><br/>""A uno de los miembros del Congreso se le pidió que no dejara que el libro saliera de sus manos, ni permitiera que fuera examinado por ninguna otra persona ... funcionarios del Departamento de Estado han hecho sugerencias informales de que cualquier cita del libro sería perjudicial para las relaciones soviético-estadounidenses ... "" explicó Frank Hanighen. (Tomado del Socialist Appeal británico, agosto de 1944). <br/><br/>Sólo en 1946, después de que Gran Bretaña y Estados Unidos hubieran caído en desgracia con Stalin, pudo finalmente aparecer el libro. Como era de esperar, la publicación del Stalin provocó la indignación de los estalinistas. Habían celebrado la supresión del libro, y esperaban que esto fuera permanente. Pero los tiempos habían cambiado y la indignación de los estalinistas no conocía límites. <br/><br/>                      <strong>Esta edición suprime los añadidos políticos <br/>                                  de Malamud, que suponían <br/>                                     más de 10.000 palabras</strong><br/><br/>Cinco años después de que hubiera sido retirado para evitar el bochorno de Stalin, fue visto ahora como un palo útil con el que golpearle. Y las inserciones de Malamud proporcionaron los ""ajustes"" necesarios para convertir la obra de Trotsky en un arma en la lucha no sólo contra el estalinismo, sino también contra el bolchevismo. Por su parte, Harpers estaba dispuesto a hacer dinero con su publicación tardía. Todo el episodio está caracterizado por el cinismo más descarado de todas las partes: los editores, Malamud y el gobierno de Estados Unidos conspiraron para el uso y abuso de este libro para sus propios fines. La única voz que fue silenciada fue la del autor, León Trotsky.<br/><br/><strong>Las omisiones de Malamud </strong><br/>Cuando el ""Stalin"" se publicó finalmente, una gran cantidad del material había sido dejado fuera del libro, a pesar de estar traducido por Malamud, que juzgó que este material era ""superfluo"". <br/><br/>Por consiguiente, había claramente una gran cantidad de trabajo por hacer para restaurar en la medida de lo posible el original, aunque sin terminar, del texto de Trotsky. La primera tarea era eliminar las interpolaciones políticas de Malamud. En el archivo, nos fuimos de nuevo al texto con el fin de identificar las deficiencias y omisiones. Afortunadamente, la mayor parte del material que faltaba estaba numerado y podía ser agrupado, con un considerable trabajo de investigación, con el texto original en un grado u otro. <br/><br/>En una visita al archivo en 2005, compramos copias del material que faltaba en forma de microfilms. Con la ayuda de Philip Wallace de la Colección de Trotsky de la Universidad de Glasgow Caledonian, hicimos fotocopias de las películas. A continuación, estas copias se tipearon meticulosamente, incluyendo todos los cambios, comentarios y supresiones. <br/><br/>Este esmerado trabajo llevó una cantidad considerable de tiempo. Una vez logrado, pudimos luego reconstruir minuciosamente el trabajo original, pese a ser todavía una obra inacabada, y encajarlas en las partes que faltaban en el libro. Los pequeños huecos que echamos en falta inicialmente fueron restaurados gracias a la ayuda de Steve Iverson de Boston, quien hizo visitas a los archivos en nuestro nombre.<br/><br/>Desde el momento en que empezamos a conseguir el material necesario hasta el momento en que estábamos listos para publicar la nueva edición han transcurrido más de diez años. Nos hemos beneficiado de un equipo de personas dedicadas que han sacrificado una gran parte de su tiempo y esfuerzo para asegurar el éxito de este importante proyecto, aunque ninguno de ellas pudo trabajar en esta tarea a tiempo completo. La primera tarea consistió en copiar el material faltante de una manera que se pudiera transferir a un ordenador, ya que el original estaba en un estado demasiado pobre como para ser escaneado. Esta tarea onerosa tomó cerca de dos años, y fue llevada a cabo por Hazel Brookshaw, quien hizo un enorme esfuerzo sin ayuda para descifrar y tipear todas las fotocopias en archivos de texto utilizables. <br/><br/>La tarea más complicada y que requirió mucho tiempo fue encontrar los lugares más apropiados para insertar el nuevo material. En realidad, esto implicó reelaborar completamente el texto, trabajo que procedió de forma dolorosamente lenta. Esta fue la tarea de Alan Woods, quien, utilizando su criterio político y conocimiento del ruso, logró completar este trabajo importante, pero muy complicado y difícil, en un período de unos tres años. La tarea se complicó aún más por el descubrimiento de nuevos materiales, tanto en inglés como en ruso. Otro material, que no encajaba, tuvo que ser colocado en el lugar y el contexto político más apropiado. <br/><br/>También nos gustaría dar las gracias a Philip Wallace del Archivo de la Tradición Trotskista de Glasgow Caledonian por su ayuda en la copia del microfilm. Hay que agradecer a Hazel Brookshaw por el tipeo de las fotocopias y más tarde la corrección del texto completo. También agradecemos a Ana Muñoz sus esfuerzos en tipear las correcciones y pruebas de lectura. Además, deseamos agradecer a Julian Sharpe, Sion Reynolds, Phil Sharpe y Guy Howie por la corrección de las pruebas. Debemos mencionar especialmente a John Roberts, por su valiosa contribución en la corrección de pruebas adicionales, las notas al pie, sugerencias y supervisión. También nos gustaría dar las gracias a Thomas Ford y a los otros bibliotecarios de la Biblioteca Houghton, de la Universidad de Harvard, por su ayuda y asistencia. Gracias finalmente a Timur Dautov por su ayuda en las traducciones del ruso. <br/><br/>Con la publicación de este libro, hemos cumplido finalmente con los deseos de la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova, de borrar todo rastro de Malamud del texto. La crítica de Trotsky sobre Stalin y el estalinismo permanece con todo derecho como una obra clásica del marxismo. Esperamos fervientemente que nuestra decisión de publicar esta importante obra de Trotsky, purgada de las distorsiones anteriores, servirá para restaurar la última obra de Trotsky en el lugar de honor que se merece en la literatura política del siglo XX.<br/><br/> <br/><strong>Accede al prólogo de esta obra, de Alan Woods: </strong></p>

</div></div>","La ""Asociación Lucha de Clases"" está orgullosa de presentar una obra que tardó 80 años en ser producida. La obra maestra inacabada de Trotsky, “Stalin”. Traducida directamente de la edición inglesa publicada por Wellred Books en julio de 2016.El 20 de agosto de 1940 la vida de Trotsky fue brutalmente apagada cuando un agente estalinista hundió un piolet sobre su cabeza. Entre las obras que dejó sin terminar se encontraba la segunda parte de su biografía sobre Stalin. El Stalin de Trotsky es una obra única en la literatura marxista en la que intenta explicar algunos de los acontecimientos más decisivos del siglo XX, no sólo en términos de las transformaciones económicas y sociales que forjaron la época, sino de la psicología individual de uno de los protagonistas de un gran drama histórico. Es un estudio fascinante del modo en que  el carácter peculiar de un individuo, sus trazos y psicología individuales, interactúa con los grandes acontecimientos.  ¿Cómo pudo ser que Stalin, que comenzó su vida política como un revolucionario bolchevique, terminara como un tirano y un monstruo? ¿Estaba esto predeterminado por factores genéticos o por las vivencias de su infancia? Extrayendo una masa de material reunido cuidadosamente de sus archivos personales y de otras fuentes, Trotsky proporciona la respuesta a estas preguntas.En la actual edición hemos reunido todo el material que estaba disponible en los archivos de Trotsky en inglés junto a material suplementario traducido del ruso. Es la versión más completa del libro que se haya publicado nunca. En el centenario de la Revolución de Octubre, creemos que Stalin, de Trotsky, es más relevante e inspirador que nunca.LA HISTORIA DE LA BIOGRAFÍA INACABADA DE STALIN, DE LEÓN TROTSKYPor Rob SewellEl libro ""Stalin"", de León Trotsky, fue encargado por la editorial Harper Brothers de Nueva York en febrero de 1938 y se publicó por primera vez en inglés en 1946. “Stalin” fue la última obra importante de Trotsky. Sin embargo, su vida se vio truncada por un asesino estalinista el 20 de agosto de 1940. El libro nunca fue terminado.Mientras Trotsky trabajaba en el libro, el manuscrito estaba siendo traducido al inglés por Charles Malamud. Tras su asesinato, los manuscritos inacabados fueron entregados a Malamud, no sólo para la traducción, sino en realidad para editar el trabajo para su publicación. Cualquiera que fuera el talento de Malamud, esta era una tarea política para la cual era completamente inadecuado. Cuando el libro se publicó finalmente, la nueva versión ""corregida"" contenía grandes trozos de material insertados por el editor, que eran claramente una violación del pensamiento político de Trotsky. Pese a las protestas indignadas de la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova, el material ofensivo fue mantenido por los editores.La razón principal para la reedición de esta edición recientemente ampliada del Stalin de Trotsky es poner fin a esta violación e insertar el material que fue excluido por el editor. Este proyecto de volver a publicar el Stalin original de Trotsky en esta forma actualizada ha llevado más de una década para su edición. El volumen elimina las inserciones políticas de Malamud, que ascendieron a más de diez mil palabras, y restaura el manuscrito original a partir del material inédito de los archivos de Trotsky depositados en la Universidad de Harvard. 
Montaje contemporáneo de los líderes bolcheviques de la revolución. Nota: Stalin no está incluido. Cortesía de David KingEsta nueva edición es la más completa que haya sido publicada nunca en ningún idioma, incluyendo el inglés o el ruso, y ha aumentado el tamaño en comparación con el original en más de un treinta por ciento. Representa el trabajo más extenso jamás realizado para ""reconstruir"" el libro, y comprende casi cien mil más palabras más que la edición original de 1946. Malamud explicó que él había dejado tal cual estaban los primeros siete capítulos, ""a excepción de unas pocas eliminaciones de material repetitivo"". Nos hemos tomado la libertad de restaurar este material lo mejor que hemos podido. En lugar de seguir la disposición de Malamud, hemos elegido nuestro propio criterio, siguiendo la cronología de los acontecimientos. La edición de este material para asegurar su máxima continuidad fue llevada a cabo por Alan Woods, que también tradujo el grueso del material en ruso. Los archivos de Trotsky En el año 2003, mientras estaba en un viaje político por los Estados Unidos, visité Boston y aproveché para visitar los archivos de Trotsky en la universidad cercana. Trotsky había acordado que el material fuera enviado a Harvard para su custodia. ""Los archivos se van [a Estados Unidos] esta mañana en el tren"", escribió Trotsky el 17 de julio de 1940, poco más de un mes antes de su asesinato. (Suplemento de los Escritos de 1934-1940, p.863) Me sorprendió la gran cantidad de material contenido en el archivo. Me llamó la atención el material sobre el último libro de Trotsky –Stalin. Para mi sorpresa, descubrí que había nueve grandes cajas de manuscritos en el archivo, los manuscritos Harper (piezas H1 - H28), que contienen todos los materiales preparatorios para el libro de Stalin. Estos contenían todos los archivos originales, los borradores, las pruebas de galería, recortes de prensa y notas manuscritas y mecanografiadas, así como un número de cajas que contienen todas las traducciones al inglés de Charles Malamud de los originales rusos de Trotsky.
Universidad de Harvard                               
                                                 El archivo contiene                                            unos 20.000 documentos,                                         incluyendo unas 4.000 cartas.Lo primero que llama la atención acerca de la colección del Stalin son las diferentes capas, acumuladas como capas geológicas, que finalmente se utilizaron para producir la primera mitad del libro, es decir, la que llega hasta 1917. Estos primeros borradores contenían textos manuscritos y mecanografiados, y los segundos borradores que estaban completamente mecanografiados, traducidos y luego devueltos a Trotsky para su posterior corrección, edición y pulido. Trotsky sin duda tomaba a mucho orgullo ""pulir"" sus escritos, así como buscar la manera de mejorar las traducciones en inglés, para que el significado pudiera ser lo más preciso posible. Mi primera visita a Harvard identificó simplemente lo que había allí. En visitas posteriores, pedí ver todo el archivo del Stalin, que me fue entregado en la sala de lectura en un gran carrito. Los archivos que contienen los materiales se encuentran en grandes cajas de archivo y numerados en carpetas separadas (bsmRuss 13.3) H1 - H28. Estos también contienen todos los recortes de periódicos y diversos materiales que fueron traducidos al inglés, pero no utilizados en la edición final del libro, incluyendo los borradores originales, conservados en las carpetas H14 - H19.  Charles MalamudLa primera parte del Stalin se ocupa de manera magistral del papel del individuo en la historia, trazando la evolución de Stalin desde que era un muchacho joven en el Seminario hasta que se convirtió en un revolucionario profesional en los años previos a la Revolución de 1917. Sin embargo, la segunda parte incompleta, que, incluso en la edición mutilada publicada, contiene material extremadamente interesante, se vio empañada por las adiciones introducidas por Charles Malamud. Esto no era simplemente un material de puente para salvar algunas lagunas en los escritos, como él lo justificó, sino que fue compuesto de trozos enteros de texto en ciertos capítulos, que contradicen claramente la línea política del libro. Cuando la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova y el abogado de Trotsky, Albert Goldman, vieron el texto, se opusieron vehementemente a la publicación del libro en esta forma vulgarizada. Esteban Volkov, nieto de Trotsky, también intentó sin éxito impedir la re-publicación del libro a finales de 1960. ¿Cómo pudo un hombre como Malamud terminar la edición del Stalin de Trotsky? El conocimiento de Charles Malamud del ruso era ciertamente útil y su talento fue puesto a buen uso en la traducción de algunos de los artículos de Trotsky. Trotsky, como veremos, nunca estuvo muy impresionado por este joven ""simpatizante"" ni por sus habilidades. Sin embargo, Trotsky estaba muy necesitado de ayuda y tenía que trabajar con el material que estaba a su disposición. 
El papel de Trotsky en la Revolución Rusa, suprimido de la historiaEl 15 de febrero de 1938 (el día anterior al asesinato de León Sedov, hijo de Trotsky, en París), Trotsky fue abordado por Harper Brothers, los editores norteamericanos, con una oferta de 5.000 dólares, que se pagarían a plazos, para escribir una biografía de Stalin. Trotsky, que estaba profundamente afectado por la trágica pérdida de su hijo, no estaba en absoluto interesado en la oferta de la editorial. La muerte de Sedov fue un golpe devastador para Trotsky y Natalia, otro acto de venganza de Stalin. Por otra parte, Trotsky ya había comenzado a trabajar en otro libro, a saber, una biografía de Lenin, la primera parte de la cual ya había terminado en noviembre de 1934. Presionado por serias dificultades financieras, Trotsky eventualmente superó su renuencia y aceptó la propuesta de Harpers. Charles Malamud, que había traducido algunos de los escritos menores de Trotsky, estaba disponible, y por lo tanto se le encargó la tarea de traducir la obra recién encargada. Claramente encantado ante la perspectiva de una oferta tan tentadora, Malamud escribió en una carta: ""Stalin promete ser un hito en mis esfuerzos de traducción."" Trotsky sin embargo, no estaba totalmente convencido, pero tenía pocas alternativas ante la falta de traductores rusos disponibles. Por otra parte, había recibido la seguridad de que él podría supervisar y refrendar personalmente todas las traducciones antes de su publicación. El trabajo comienza - y los problemas A principios de abril de 1938, el trabajo sobre el Stalin comenzó en serio. El 26 de abril Trotsky escribió a Sara Weber donde le informaba que estaba ""trabajando ahora en el libro de Stalin"". Sin embargo él había encontrado un problema que quería que ella resolviera. ""En cada página me enfrento a la investigación de datos geográficos, históricos, cronológicos, biográficos, etc."", así que le pidió, ""¿no sería posible encontrar una enciclopedia de la época pre-revolucionaria [rusa] en Nueva York? ... La cuestión es muy importante para mí porque de lo contrario mi trabajo se entorpecería constantemente"". Al cabo de unos meses Malamud recibió el manuscrito ruso del primer capítulo: ""La familia y la escuela"". Las cosas parecían proceder bastante rápidamente. El segundo capítulo fue enviado por correo a Malamud el 16 de agosto y el tercer capítulo el 12 de septiembre. Pero el trabajo no pudo proseguir tan bien debido a varias interrupciones. Antes del final del año, Harpers le había negado a Trotsky anticipos financieros sobre la base de que era lento en la entrega de las porciones del manuscrito. Había otros problemas con el libro. Sin pedir permiso a Trotsky, Malamud había mostrado el manuscrito a terceras partes, a saber, Max Shachtman y James Burnham que estaban encabezando una minoría en el SWP norteamericano [el grupo trotskista de EEUU, NdT] que se oponía al análisis de Trotsky del carácter de la URSS. Cuando Trotsky tuvo conocimiento de esto se puso furioso, tomando el incidente como un abuso de confianza. Trotsky se quejó a Joseph Hansen: ""Entonces, en contra de todas mis advertencias, él [Malamud] se permitió una indiscreción condenable con mi manuscrito. Protesté. Su deber elemental debería haber sido disculparse por su error y todo habría estado de nuevo en orden. También me parece que los camaradas Burnham y Shachtman cometieron un error al entrar en una discusión con él acerca de la calidad del manuscrito sin preguntarle a él si tenía o no mi autorización para darles el manuscrito. Lo mejor hubiera sido que los camaradas Burnham y Shachtman, por iniciativa propia, hubieran explicado que, junto con Malamud, fueron algo indiscretos y que era lo mejor reconocerlo como tal y dejar las cosas así"". En esta carta, Trotsky concluyó sin rodeos: ""Malamud parece tener al menos tres cualidades: que no sabe ruso; que no sabe inglés; y que es tremendamente pretencioso. Dudo que él sea el mejor de los traductores... ""(Suplemento de los Escritos 1934-1940, P.830, el énfasis es mío - RS) En estas pocas palabras Trotsky revela una apreciación perspicaz de la pretensión de Malamud, que fue ampliamente demostrada por los acontecimientos posteriores. Sin embargo, no hubo más remedio que seguir utilizando sus servicios.                          El trabajo más exhaustivo acometido                                   para “reconstruir” el libro,                              con la incorporación de más de                          cien mil palabras más que la edición                                              original de 1946.La indignación de Trotsky con esta indiscreción reflejaba su profunda preocupación por la seguridad y el temor de que el manuscrito del Stalin pudiera caer en las manos equivocadas. Este era un peligro muy real en ese momento. Trotsky estaba comprometido en una lucha a vida o muerte contra los crímenes del estalinismo. Stalin estaba obsesionado con Trotsky y estaba determinado a silenciarlo. Por lo tanto, ordenó a sus agentes de la policía secreta - la GPU - que penetraran en el movimiento trotskista y llevaran a cabo el máximo de sabotaje. Los agentes estalinistas ya habían logrado prender fuego a su casa en Prinkipo (durante su exilio en Turquía) donde algunos de sus papeles y documentos fueron destruidos. ""La GPU va a hacer todo lo posible para poner sus manos en mis archivos"", escribió Trotsky el 10 de octubre de 1936. (Escritos, 1935-6, p. 440). Un mes más tarde, sus archivos encomendados al Instituto Holandés de Historia Social fueron saqueados en París y ciertos documentos robados. ""Con el fin de dejarme impotente frente a la difamación, la GPU está tratando de poner sus manos en mis archivos, ya sea con el robo, el allanamiento de morada, o el asesinato"", declaró Trotsky. (Ibid, p.462) Mark Zborowski, un agente estalinista, se había infiltrado en el movimiento en Francia y se había colado en el círculo de confianza de León Sedov. Los rusoparlantes eran escasos y el movimiento tenía una necesidad desesperante de ayuda. Con el tiempo, llegó a ayudar en la edición del Boletín de la Oposición en París. Zborowski, cuyo nombre de partido era ""Etienne"", pronto tuvo acceso a la caja de seguridad que contenía la correspondencia entre Sedov y Trotsky. Haciendo uso de su posición, pasaba regularmente información sobre Trotsky a la inteligencia soviética, que después se la pasaba a Stalin personalmente. Fue Zborowski quien se aseguraba de que las copias de los escritos de Trotsky fueran colocados sobre el escritorio de Stalin antes incluso de que se publicaran. Stalin leía cada número del Boletín de la Oposición, prestando especial atención a los artículos sobre él mismo. Trotsky temía que a través del robo u otros medios, los agentes de Stalin trataran de robar o destruir los borradores. Por lo tanto, se tomaron todas las precauciones para mantenerlos a salvo. Estos temores estaban bien fundados. Cuando Stalin fue informado sobre el nuevo trabajo de Trotsky, se puso furioso y estuvo dispuesto a llegar a cualquier extremo para evitar su publicación. A lo largo de 1939, Trotsky siguió adelante con el Stalin, pero se encontró con más interrupciones, sin olvidar la necesidad de salir de la casa de Diego Rivera en mayo, tras la ruptura de Rivera con el trotskismo, y luego la batalla legal por la custodia de su nieto, Sieva (Esteban Volkov). Sieva iba a dejar Europa y tomar posesión de su nuevo hogar con Trotsky y Natalia en la Ciudad de México el 6 de agosto de 1939. El asesinato de Trotsky En abril de 1940, en el momento del primer intento de asesinato de su vida, la mitad del libro ya había sido terminado (hasta 1917) y el resto del libro estaba en diversas fases de ejecución. El libro estaba ahora en espera, con casi todo el trabajo dedicado a atender las disposiciones legales necesarias para la investigación del ataque, así como a los tribunales mexicanos. Trotsky también tuvo que responder a una descarga continua de mentiras y calumnias de los periódicos estalinistas de México y del extranjero, ya que intensificaron sus ataques verbales. En el momento del asesinato de Trotsky el 20 de agosto, el libro sólo había sido completado a la mitad, con una gran cantidad de material restante en forma de borrador en diferentes estados de preparación. Se las arregló para comprobar la traducción en inglés de los primeros seis capítulos, pero no había tenido la oportunidad de comprobar el séptimo. Una serie de mitos se han circulado sobre el libro del Stalin, principalmente por el propio Charles Malamud. Malamud inventó la historia de que en el ataque de agosto algunos de los manuscritos del Stalin estaban salpicados de sangre y otros totalmente destruidos. Se repite esto en su prólogo al libro del Stalin: ""Algunos de los manuscritos de la parte inacabada estaban en el estudio de Trotsky, ensartados en enormes y largas tiras con muchas hojas pegadas de extremo a extremo. En el momento del ataque asesino, y en la lucha con el asesino, partes del manuscrito no quedaron sólo salpicadas de sangre, sino totalmente destruidas"". 
Fotografía de la Policía del estudio de Trotsky tras su asesinatoNo hay evidencia alguna en los archivos de Trotsky en Harvard que apoyen esta afirmación. Habiendo examinado todas las páginas del material original del Stalin, incluyendo las largas tiras pegadas de extremo a extremo, puedo decir con seguridad que no hay evidencia de manchas de sangre ni de ninguna otra cosa que apoye este cuento de hadas. Ningún daño en absoluto puede ser visto. La fotografía de la policía del estudio de Trotsky tras el asesinato revela algunos periódicos esparcidos por el suelo después de la lucha, pero no hay ninguna señal de ""largas tiras de pruebas de galeras salpicadas de sangre"". Es evidente que Charles Malamud inventó esta historia para dramatizar todo el asunto e impulsar así su propio papel en ""rescatar"" el manuscrito de Trotsky. Este no es el único ejemplo de comportamiento inescrupuloso de su parte. Tras la muerte de Trotsky, los editores norteamericanos, que eran dueños de los derechos del libro, colocaron a Malamud de responsable, no sólo de la traducción, sino de la ""edición"" final del libro. Para ellos, esto era simplemente un cálculo comercial para salvar el libro después de la muerte del autor. Los puntos de vista de Trotsky no entraban en sus cálculos. Las distorsiones de Malamud Tan pronto como Malamud hubo tenido acceso a los manuscritos inacabados de Trotsky, continuó con su traducción. Parece que el método utilizado por Malamud fue traducir verbalmente páginas de texto en ruso a una mecanógrafa en idioma inglés. Esto se puede ver a partir de las numerosas faltas de ortografía de los nombres rusos en los borradores escritos a máquina. Malamud se acercó entonces a estas primeras versiones para pulir la traducción. A partir de este punto, Malamud, ahora traductor y editor del Stalin de Trotsky, decidiría lo que entraría y lo que se quedaría fuera del libro. También era libre de añadir sus propios comentarios como material de relleno. ""La política editorial en lo que se refiere a la parte sin terminar del manuscrito fue publicar el texto de Trotsky en su totalidad, excepto el material repetitivo y totalmente ajeno al tema"", afirma Malamud en su nota de editor. ""Bajo estas circunstancias, eran inevitables extensas interpolaciones del editor"". Además, ocho páginas del texto se componen de ""partes de las notas del autor [pero] resumidas por el editor"".                           Un 30% de incremento en el tamaño                           comparado con la versión originalMalamud utilizó esta posición como editor para introducir sus propios comentarios políticos en partes del libro, utilizando extensas interpolaciones entre paréntesis. Estas adiciones no autorizadas sirven para distorsionar y tergiversar el punto de vista político de Trotsky e iban contra todo el espíritu político del libro. Consideraban el estalinismo como inevitable y consecuencia del bolchevismo –una visión que estaba en contradicción directa con la posición mantenida por Trotsky, que está claramente expresada en su biografía de Stalin. Para ilustrar la magnitud de estas ""interpolaciones"", es suficiente con mirar el Capítulo Once original: ""De la Oscuridad al Triunvirato"". De las aproximadamente 1.200 líneas de este capítulo, el sesenta y dos por ciento son de Malamud, y el treinta y ocho por ciento son de Trotsky. No hay ni una sola palabra de Trotsky hasta después de siete páginas y media de Malamud. Todo esto se hizo pasar en la nota del editor simplemente como ""comentario"" esencial ¡por motivos de ""fluidez y claridad""! Esta intromisión política condujo a intercambios amargos entre Malamud y Natalia Sedova. Después de mostrar las pruebas finales del libro, Natalia y el abogado de Trotsky, Albert Goldman, se opusieron enérgicamente a los contenidos. Hay una sección entera de cartas en el archivo de Trotsky que contiene las objeciones planteadas por Natalia y Albert Goldman. Su indignación se revela en sus comentarios condenatorios, escritos en las páginas de prueba: ""Falso, totalmente falso ... lo escrito y terminado exclusivamente por Trotsky es lo que se debe utilizar. No es real la copia 'editada'"". ""¡Inaceptable Revisión de la historia!"" ""Inaceptable"", ""Falsa revisión de los acontecimientos históricos."" Etc. La viuda de Trotsky se opuso a la ""inaudita violencia cometida por el traductor sobre los derechos de autor"". Ella continuó insistiendo en que ""todo lo escrito por la pluma del señor Malamud debe ser borrado del libro."" ""Como concesión”, escribieron: ""podríamos estar de acuerdo en añadirlos al propio texto de LD –siempre y cuando los originales sean revisados en primer lugar por nosotros."" A continuación, pasaron a tachar páginas de comentarios de Malamud. Pero todo fue en vano, los comentarios no autorizados fueron mantenidos en la versión publicada. [Harvard, carpetas BM3 Russ 13.3 - H12 (1de2)]. Natalia recurrió a acciones legales para impedir la publicación, pero el caso se perdió. Cuando el libro finalmente vio la luz del día, Malamud cínicamente anunció que la publicación se llevaba a cabo ¡""sin censura, ya sea de trotskistas o de estalinistas""! La publicación del Stalin fue planeada originalmente para 1941. Pero mientras que el libro estaba en proceso de ser impreso y distribuido a los mayoristas, el gobierno de Estados Unidos intervino para detener la publicación. Después de la invasión de la Unión Soviética por Hitler, Roosevelt no quería molestar a su nuevo aliado –Iosif Stalin. ""Este [el Stalin de Trotsky] fue impreso por su editor, Harper and Brothers, pero retirado por ellos antes de la venta al público a finales de 1941"", escribe Frank C. Hanighen, escritor de artículos para el Progressive de La Follette en el número del 1º de mayo de 1944. ""Los editores dieron como razón para la retirada 'una preocupación por los efectos adversos en el trabajo de las relaciones internacionales', dice la señora Lombard ..."" La señora Helen Lombard, una periodista del Washington Evening Star, expuso la forma en que se decidió la supresión del libro. ""A uno de los miembros del Congreso se le pidió que no dejara que el libro saliera de sus manos, ni permitiera que fuera examinado por ninguna otra persona ... funcionarios del Departamento de Estado han hecho sugerencias informales de que cualquier cita del libro sería perjudicial para las relaciones soviético-estadounidenses ... "" explicó Frank Hanighen. (Tomado del Socialist Appeal británico, agosto de 1944). Sólo en 1946, después de que Gran Bretaña y Estados Unidos hubieran caído en desgracia con Stalin, pudo finalmente aparecer el libro. Como era de esperar, la publicación del Stalin provocó la indignación de los estalinistas. Habían celebrado la supresión del libro, y esperaban que esto fuera permanente. Pero los tiempos habían cambiado y la indignación de los estalinistas no conocía límites.                       Esta edición suprime los añadidos políticos                                   de Malamud, que suponían                                      más de 10.000 palabrasCinco años después de que hubiera sido retirado para evitar el bochorno de Stalin, fue visto ahora como un palo útil con el que golpearle. Y las inserciones de Malamud proporcionaron los ""ajustes"" necesarios para convertir la obra de Trotsky en un arma en la lucha no sólo contra el estalinismo, sino también contra el bolchevismo. Por su parte, Harpers estaba dispuesto a hacer dinero con su publicación tardía. Todo el episodio está caracterizado por el cinismo más descarado de todas las partes: los editores, Malamud y el gobierno de Estados Unidos conspiraron para el uso y abuso de este libro para sus propios fines. La única voz que fue silenciada fue la del autor, León Trotsky.Las omisiones de Malamud Cuando el ""Stalin"" se publicó finalmente, una gran cantidad del material había sido dejado fuera del libro, a pesar de estar traducido por Malamud, que juzgó que este material era ""superfluo"". Por consiguiente, había claramente una gran cantidad de trabajo por hacer para restaurar en la medida de lo posible el original, aunque sin terminar, del texto de Trotsky. La primera tarea era eliminar las interpolaciones políticas de Malamud. En el archivo, nos fuimos de nuevo al texto con el fin de identificar las deficiencias y omisiones. Afortunadamente, la mayor parte del material que faltaba estaba numerado y podía ser agrupado, con un considerable trabajo de investigación, con el texto original en un grado u otro. En una visita al archivo en 2005, compramos copias del material que faltaba en forma de microfilms. Con la ayuda de Philip Wallace de la Colección de Trotsky de la Universidad de Glasgow Caledonian, hicimos fotocopias de las películas. A continuación, estas copias se tipearon meticulosamente, incluyendo todos los cambios, comentarios y supresiones. Este esmerado trabajo llevó una cantidad considerable de tiempo. Una vez logrado, pudimos luego reconstruir minuciosamente el trabajo original, pese a ser todavía una obra inacabada, y encajarlas en las partes que faltaban en el libro. Los pequeños huecos que echamos en falta inicialmente fueron restaurados gracias a la ayuda de Steve Iverson de Boston, quien hizo visitas a los archivos en nuestro nombre.Desde el momento en que empezamos a conseguir el material necesario hasta el momento en que estábamos listos para publicar la nueva edición han transcurrido más de diez años. Nos hemos beneficiado de un equipo de personas dedicadas que han sacrificado una gran parte de su tiempo y esfuerzo para asegurar el éxito de este importante proyecto, aunque ninguno de ellas pudo trabajar en esta tarea a tiempo completo. La primera tarea consistió en copiar el material faltante de una manera que se pudiera transferir a un ordenador, ya que el original estaba en un estado demasiado pobre como para ser escaneado. Esta tarea onerosa tomó cerca de dos años, y fue llevada a cabo por Hazel Brookshaw, quien hizo un enorme esfuerzo sin ayuda para descifrar y tipear todas las fotocopias en archivos de texto utilizables. La tarea más complicada y que requirió mucho tiempo fue encontrar los lugares más apropiados para insertar el nuevo material. En realidad, esto implicó reelaborar completamente el texto, trabajo que procedió de forma dolorosamente lenta. Esta fue la tarea de Alan Woods, quien, utilizando su criterio político y conocimiento del ruso, logró completar este trabajo importante, pero muy complicado y difícil, en un período de unos tres años. La tarea se complicó aún más por el descubrimiento de nuevos materiales, tanto en inglés como en ruso. Otro material, que no encajaba, tuvo que ser colocado en el lugar y el contexto político más apropiado. También nos gustaría dar las gracias a Philip Wallace del Archivo de la Tradición Trotskista de Glasgow Caledonian por su ayuda en la copia del microfilm. Hay que agradecer a Hazel Brookshaw por el tipeo de las fotocopias y más tarde la corrección del texto completo. También agradecemos a Ana Muñoz sus esfuerzos en tipear las correcciones y pruebas de lectura. Además, deseamos agradecer a Julian Sharpe, Sion Reynolds, Phil Sharpe y Guy Howie por la corrección de las pruebas. Debemos mencionar especialmente a John Roberts, por su valiosa contribución en la corrección de pruebas adicionales, las notas al pie, sugerencias y supervisión. También nos gustaría dar las gracias a Thomas Ford y a los otros bibliotecarios de la Biblioteca Houghton, de la Universidad de Harvard, por su ayuda y asistencia. Gracias finalmente a Timur Dautov por su ayuda en las traducciones del ruso. Con la publicación de este libro, hemos cumplido finalmente con los deseos de la viuda de Trotsky, Natalia Sedova, de borrar todo rastro de Malamud del texto. La crítica de Trotsky sobre Stalin y el estalinismo permanece con todo derecho como una obra clásica del marxismo. Esperamos fervientemente que nuestra decisión de publicar esta importante obra de Trotsky, purgada de las distorsiones anteriores, servirá para restaurar la última obra de Trotsky en el lugar de honor que se merece en la literatura política del siglo XX. Accede al prólogo de esta obra, de Alan Woods:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Welcome, and thank you for reading! L'Allure des Mots is an online magazine that features the best provocative work in poetry, short fiction, fashion and beauty photography, and art. Founded by graphic designer and photographer <a href=""http://www.sambeasleyphotopart2.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sam Beasley</a> and model, photographer, and writer <a href=""http://www.iheartkat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katherine Villari</a>, we wanted to make a platform for other creators who share a love of the beautiful, the provocative, the raw. We have a passion for the arts in all forms–art that stays with you long after you've experienced it–and with your help, we'd love to continue to share the works of talented creators from all over the world through a new venue: the printed page. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fashion and art in the same magazine is nothing new, but poetry and fashion? Why would we mix one of the historically worst performing types of magazine, the literary magazine, with the fashion magazine, one of the best?</p>
<p>We think with our mix of literature, imagery, and clean design, we've been able to open up new avenues for writers to get their work seen that were previously unavailable to them through a different approach to the literary magazine. In addition, our philosophy regarding fashion and fashion photography as beautiful objects and art forms themselves takes a different stance on the standard fashion magazine. Add in interviews of some great artists, and you get a mix that can change the status quo of both literary AND fashion magazines.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, our plans are for any profits that we end up making after we've paid off our expenses is to donate a portion of that to literacy charities. It may take a while until we're actually able to turn a profit, but that's the longterm goal! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Bottom line? We need about $2100 to print 100 copies and to be able to sell in bookstores. </p>
<p>We don't want to take a print-one-and-we're-done approach; we're thinking longterm. This is why we're starting with a very limited run and working our way up. Your donations will mostly be going to the printing of the magazine (about $1750 to print and ship to us). To sell in stores, we need a BIPAD number and UPC, which will cost about $355 ($325 for the BIPAD, and about $30 for the first UPC).</p>
<p>Anything else we get over our goal will go towards two things: the monthly costs of running our website, which adds up to $203.97 per month (some of these costs are paid annually, but we try to save up for when the funds are needed!), plus another $9.99 per month when we set up the online store, and throwing a launched-in-print party to help get the word out.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal? If we fall just short, we'll harass friends and family to make up the difference, or if we don't come close, we'll move forward but with printing fewer copies. We'll also be seeking out advertisers, but we don't want to fill up half the magazine with advertising.</p>
<p>What do you get in return? Take a look at the perks to the right and find something that tickles your fancy! Images and detailed descriptions of some of the perks are below.</p>

<li>Introduce yourself and your background.  Hello, my name is Ken Cherryholmes &amp; I have written a time management-self help motivational book.  The primary target audience is the self help motivational reader, with emphasis on time management &amp; help with study habits/skills, eating/dieting goals, help with exercise motivation, help with daily task/chore/to do lists.  This is my first attempt at writing and publishing a book.  Some of my career work over the years include: nation wide commercial truck driver-CDL Class A License, Journeyman Electrician - Licensed in Texas, previously a self employed contractor-graffiti removal specialist in San Antonio Texas &amp; a lot of manual labor jobs from Kansas to all over Texas.  I attended six universities &amp; colleges before I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree-Majored in Management from Texas State University in San Marcos Texas, my current sport of choice-long distance running (today it is more like long distance walking).  The reason I wrote this book was because it solved a problem.  Since approximately the mid 1980s till now I have bought &amp; read or listened to more self help motivational books-cassettes/CDs/audio books than I can remember.  My book helps to solve/control a specific difficult time management problem.  I could not find this specific problem solved as well as my book does it, in the products that I had read from the self help motivational market.  I still buy &amp; will always buy self help motivational products, however my book solves a very specific problem in motivation, self discipline &amp; time management.  It is a very simple, effective, easy to use, pragmatic &amp; useful tool.  It could be a life changer for a lot of people in the target niche market that it is focused at.  This is why the contributor might want to fund this project - to help get this life changing book into the hands of the reader, that the customer could purchase for the regular cost of a paper or hardback book.  I do not want to mislead by promising  the impossible, however this book could have a very positive impact &amp; be a life changer on the target market readers life.  When I state my book in such positive terms, it is because I think it is a great self help motivational book for its target niche market.  This is the opinion of the author, a lot of readers in the target market may find it invaluable.</li> <li>Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.  This campaign is important to me because if it is even partially or 100% successful at raising the funds, it will allow me to keep more control of the editing-publishing &amp; marketing of my book.  In case I only have this one good marketable book in me, I want to try to get a higher royalty %.  Getting a higher % is possible if I fund more/all of the project myself as opposed to trying to get a publisher to fund all of its publishing &amp; marketing costs.  If I knew that I had a bunch of great marketable books in me then I would probably try to use a traditional publisher since it would be less work for me,  I would simply have to submit the manuscript to a publisher &amp; they would do the rest.    </li> <li>Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Contributors donations/contributions would help me to maintain more control of this dream/goal/project, that I would have way less control of without the funds. Contributors would help fund to get a great book on market shelves.  The book they would be helping has the ability to be a life changer for some individuals-the target niche market.  I do not want to oversell or undersell my book, however for some self help readers after they buy &amp; read my book, I believe they will think that this book is one of the best self help motivational books that they have ever bought &amp; read.  It is simple &amp; easy to use without much effort &amp; with consistent positive results.  My book will help individuals who have too much to do in the day &amp; not enough time to get it done, with helping them find the will power that already exists inside them selves &amp; to make it stronger.  Readers will be surprised with themselves at how some of their life long struggles become easier to manage/control with my book.  Most important, at the risk of sounding like a oversell, when the contributor helps to fund this book project they will be helping to change lives for the better of the readers who buy &amp; read my book.  The contributors donation will help fund a project that will get a life changing book into the readers hands for the price of a paper back or hard back book price.  This book will help the individual who has the worse time management skills &amp; the least amount of time, money &amp; energy to fix the problem.  If you have tried other time management books before with not very good results, this is the book that can show you a new &amp; better way to handle a old problem, &amp; this book may work where other books have failed you.  This book can substantially better the time management skills &amp; decrease the stress of its target niche market readers.  Not a lot of books on the market can improve the readers life after only reading approximately a 100 pages of text (It is currently over 100 pages of text, after editing it will be less than 100).</li> </ul>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.  Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</li>
<li>There are fixed &amp; flexible fundraiser campaigns.  I am doing a flexible fundraiser campaign which means I can keep all of the funds raised even if I do not obtain the full goal amount.  A fixed fundraiser is a all or nothing campaign, which means if I do not get the full goal funds amount then I get to keep zero dollars of the funds.  I will therefore list the dream budget &amp; the cheapest possible budget, there is no harm in listing the dream budget-even if it flops &amp; no money is raised (as long as funds raised are used responsibly &amp; not wastefully &amp; on the expenses listed in this campaign).</li>
<li>Self publishing with no editing can be done for under $1000, I have read some claims of people being able to e-publish for almost free, (however that does not include editing or marketing costs).  My minimum goal is 15000 after tax dollars, however I want to have a higher budget.  I say minimum, however all money donations will help &amp; be appreciated, from one dollar &amp; up. </li>
<li>My preferred higher/better quality &amp; faster goal budget is $42000.00.  My dream budget of $65000 includes $18000 living expenses money for me to take one year off work for this project, (accountant advised estimated tax liability $4282) + 18000 + 42000 = $65000 = dream budget amount.  If the campaign produces more than $65000, I do not want the campaign to go above $95000 &amp; I would want the campaign shut down automatically at the highest amount = $95000 super dream budget.  I know these are unrealistically high amounts, however I list the best case scenario in case the impossible happens.  The extra money above/ beyond the listed expenses to write-publish &amp; market this book, would go to business costs &amp; business start up costs &amp; possible other products research/ production/ marketing, tax accounting counsel &amp; lawyer counsel fees, to create a professional web site to sell products.  I will list the low cost to edit &amp; the high cost to edit, attempting to do a top of the line professional editing/publishing &amp; marketing campaign.  </li>
<li>The main part of the expenses that some may or may not prefer to fund is the biggest cost I had in writing this book.  I listed this cost at the beginning of this campaign as a year off with pay - expense.  If a donor does not want to contribute to this cost then be aware that I may not be able to designate what donation goes to which expense.  I want the donor to be comfortable in donating to this project fundraiser campaign.  The biggest cost I incurred in the writing of this book is I took time off from work since June 2014 till now.  I had just sold my house that was sold due to my divorce, so some of my half of the proceeds of the house sale went to support my self while I wrote this book.  Of course as soon as family members &amp; friends read my campaign &amp; saw that I had been off work since June &amp; that I wanted to be off more months to finish this project faster, they gave me grief for being off work so long.  They also inquired how I had supported my self so long without work, which is why I am including this explanation here.  Had I not taken this time off, my writing would have taken me years to complete on off time &amp; weekends due to other time constraints &amp; commitments I have.  I was afraid I might not ever realistically finish my book in the near future.  I knew I had a great life changing book for the target niche market &amp; possibly for others outside this target market.  I just was not sure how long it would take to go from great life changing book idea to professional marketable product on shelfs &amp; sold on the internet.  Great book is one thing, getting it to profitable product sold in the market place is another.  </li>
<li>The other cost some may question is the amount, critics may say they can get it self published for less then one or several thousand dollars or free with e-books.  My response is, this is  a best case scenario - high professional quality budget.  Yes there are college undergraduate students majoring in writing who might do it cheaper, however I would prefer a budget that could hire experienced professionals as a goal best case scenario budget.  I am also including in this budget, other business expenses &amp; business start up costs &amp; possible other product costs I may add in addition to selling my book, including a professional web page with shopping cart product selling capabilities.  Since this is a flexible funding campaign, I might as well list the best case scenario.  If it flops &amp; gets zero then I flop &amp; get zero, all donations from one dollar up to $95k maximum will be appreciated &amp; helpful. </li>
<li>I researched a bunch of editing/ self publishing prices, however I listed estimates from from low to high.  My goal is to obtain the high amount, however any amount of donation will be better off than where I am now without the funds, which is why I listed the best case scenario of $65000.  I am not trying to create a wasteful or irresponsible budget, this is a dream wish list larger budget that would allow me to do more marketing &amp; more things better &amp; faster with the book &amp; the business.  I could afford to hire professionals that help to produce a better website to sell other possible products: calandar-other books-other products etc.  The benefit with the higher budget would mean I would have more control of the whole editing - publishing - marketing &amp; business process.  Better editing=better book=more sales of books.</li>
<li>I researched 10 to 15 companies on price estimations.  The prices varied, however they were in a general low to high range as some studies indicated.  I am going to quote from a online article titled - The Real Costs of Self-Publishing a Book/Mediashift/PBS written on May 15 2013 by the CEO of Biblio Crunch - ""an award winning author services marketplace that matches authors with quality, award winning professionals to get new books and apps to market.""  The price estimates are based on a 70000 word manuscript for a cost analysis, my book is approximately 56000 words &amp; I am still adding notes to it so it will end up being 58k to 60k words before it is edited.  I have padded the bid, as most realistic bids/estimates do.  </li>
<li>With no editing required you can get 250 books self published for about $1000.00 or less, depending on who you use (Thats assuming, all editing work is done, e-printing is even way cheaper-some claim free).</li>
<li>Developmental Editing Low=$2520 High=$18200</li>
<li>Copy editing Low=$840 High=$7000</li>
<li>Cover design Low=$150 High=$3500</li>
<li>Formatting for print &amp; digital conversion Low=free High=$2500 or more</li>
<li>Getting an ISBN Low=$125 for one ISBN  High=$250 for 10 ISBNs</li>
<li>Getting Reviews Pre-publication, Low=$149 Medium=$396 High=$425</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; PR Low=$100 High=$5000 + minimum extra $5000 PR marketing.  My goal with marketing is to have more $ than required as opposed to not enough or a low quality marketing plan.  Excess/unused funds will go to other business expenses, like filing for a LLC $487 in Texas, creating a professional business webpage with shopping cart abilities to sell my book, other possible books &amp;/or calendars etc, business research tax accounting counsel, business lawyer counsel, copyright filing costs $350.00, additional marketing costs.</li>
<li>Some of my costs to write this manuscript, I took off work from June till today &amp; I want the rest of the year off to focus on finish getting this book to market- one year off work- June to June, $18000.  If a donor does not believe recouping costs to take a year off from job/work to produce this book work is a legitimate or credible expense, then be aware that donations between 42k to 65k would go to me, (42k + 18k = 60k + taxes = 65k).  I am trying to create a legitimate fundraising campaign with a high &amp; not a low budget.  I would prefer a larger PR marketing budget, more than I have listed, to saturate the market.  I state a higher budget not to be wasteful, but as a wish list, a best quality scenario.  My low is higher then this articles low.  My low is about $15000.  It would have taken me years to produce this book had I not taken time off work, therefore I am including one years worth of pay, so I could try to produce this book more realistically faster/sooner &amp; a better quality book. </li>
<li>In any event, I have a great book, it is a legitimate credible endeavor worthy  of the funds to recoup some/all of the costs I have all ready spent.  If the campaign is successful, then I should be able to self publish in hopefully 3 to 8 months from the end date of a successful fundraising campaign (this time frame is a estimate, I will know a more exact time frame after I have the funds &amp; schedule with a editor &amp; self publishing company.  I state a longer time frame in months so as to not over promise on a publishing delivery date, hopefully the publishing date will be sooner - maybe 3-5 months after this fundraiser is over &amp; successful).</li>
<li>The market focused niche that this book is directed at may find that it changes their life as much as or as one of the best self help motivational books that they have ever bought &amp; read.  The more money I have to hire a professional editor the better &amp; faster I can have my manuscript edited.  This editing is critical to take my book from 56k-60k to streamline it down to a more efficient effective marketable writing.  As it is, if I published it without any editing at all- as rough draft unfinished notes, it would still help the reader-since it is my idea that could help change their life for the better, not the editing.  However, good editing sells more books, a lot more readers would buy &amp; read it if it was more streamlined &amp; a more efficient writing.  Some readers might not purchase a book that is not professionally edited.  Some people just do not have the time to study/read the text &amp; dig out &amp; put together great self help ideas that are in the notes though out the text.  It would still appeal to the self help motivational niche market, to those individuals who are always looking to add another tool to their motivational tool box, to their arsenal of self help tools, they might spend the time to go through the text as is.  I can sell more books &amp; possibly even to outside the niche focus market if it is top of the line  professionally edited &amp; marketed &amp; great graphics on the cover of the book.  For the cost of a paperback or hardback book the reader/ customer can better the quality of their life while decreasing the stress in their life.  This opinion is based on my experience with my books ideas.  It is a fantastic book!  If my book helps people like I believe it can &amp; should, &amp; how it has helped me, then the market should reflect this in word of mouth sales, &amp; this books sales should be a very profitable product.</li>
<li>Their Low=from $Zero/free to $3884, my Low $15000, their high $36875, my high $36875 + $5000 = $41875 my high $42000, $42000 + $18000 + taxes  = $65000 = dream budget amount,  My super dream maximum limit is $95000.                                                                                                </li> </ul>

<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.  The following statement could sound like a over sell however it is my opinion.  The difference your contribution could make is it will help put a book on the market place shelves that can help to change lives and to become possibly one of the best self help motivational books sold.  As a contributor you can help make this happen.</li> <li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).  I do not have a fundraising track record.  I am going to put together a novice 1st time campaign &amp; it will generate some or all of the funds or none of the funds.</li> </ul>

</div></div>","Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section: 
Introduce yourself and your background.  Hello, my name is Ken Cherryholmes & I have written a time management-self help motivational book.  The primary target audience is the self help motivational reader, with emphasis on time management & help with study habits/skills, eating/dieting goals, help with exercise motivation, help with daily task/chore/to do lists.  This is my first attempt at writing and publishing a book.  Some of my career work over the years include: nation wide commercial truck driver-CDL Class A License, Journeyman Electrician - Licensed in Texas, previously a self employed contractor-graffiti removal specialist in San Antonio Texas & a lot of manual labor jobs from Kansas to all over Texas.  I attended six universities & colleges before I graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration Degree-Majored in Management from Texas State University in San Marcos Texas, my current sport of choice-long distance running (today it is more like long distance walking).  The reason I wrote this book was because it solved a problem.  Since approximately the mid 1980s till now I have bought & read or listened to more self help motivational books-cassettes/CDs/audio books than I can remember.  My book helps to solve/control a specific difficult time management problem.  I could not find this specific problem solved as well as my book does it, in the products that I had read from the self help motivational market.  I still buy & will always buy self help motivational products, however my book solves a very specific problem in motivation, self discipline & time management.  It is a very simple, effective, easy to use, pragmatic & useful tool.  It could be a life changer for a lot of people in the target niche market that it is focused at.  This is why the contributor might want to fund this project - to help get this life changing book into the hands of the reader, that the customer could purchase for the regular cost of a paper or hardback book.  I do not want to mislead by promising  the impossible, however this book could have a very positive impact & be a life changer on the target market readers life.  When I state my book in such positive terms, it is because I think it is a great self help motivational book for its target niche market.  This is the opinion of the author, a lot of readers in the target market may find it invaluable. Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.  This campaign is important to me because if it is even partially or 100% successful at raising the funds, it will allow me to keep more control of the editing-publishing & marketing of my book.  In case I only have this one good marketable book in me, I want to try to get a higher royalty %.  Getting a higher % is possible if I fund more/all of the project myself as opposed to trying to get a publisher to fund all of its publishing & marketing costs.  If I knew that I had a bunch of great marketable books in me then I would probably try to use a traditional publisher since it would be less work for me,  I would simply have to submit the manuscript to a publisher & they would do the rest.     Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Contributors donations/contributions would help me to maintain more control of this dream/goal/project, that I would have way less control of without the funds. Contributors would help fund to get a great book on market shelves.  The book they would be helping has the ability to be a life changer for some individuals-the target niche market.  I do not want to oversell or undersell my book, however for some self help readers after they buy & read my book, I believe they will think that this book is one of the best self help motivational books that they have ever bought & read.  It is simple & easy to use without much effort & with consistent positive results.  My book will help individuals who have too much to do in the day & not enough time to get it done, with helping them find the will power that already exists inside them selves & to make it stronger.  Readers will be surprised with themselves at how some of their life long struggles become easier to manage/control with my book.  Most important, at the risk of sounding like a oversell, when the contributor helps to fund this book project they will be helping to change lives for the better of the readers who buy & read my book.  The contributors donation will help fund a project that will get a life changing book into the readers hands for the price of a paper back or hard back book price.  This book will help the individual who has the worse time management skills & the least amount of time, money & energy to fix the problem.  If you have tried other time management books before with not very good results, this is the book that can show you a new & better way to handle a old problem, & this book may work where other books have failed you.  This book can substantially better the time management skills & decrease the stress of its target niche market readers.  Not a lot of books on the market can improve the readers life after only reading approximately a 100 pages of text (It is currently over 100 pages of text, after editing it will be less than 100). 
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.  Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.
There are fixed & flexible fundraiser campaigns.  I am doing a flexible fundraiser campaign which means I can keep all of the funds raised even if I do not obtain the full goal amount.  A fixed fundraiser is a all or nothing campaign, which means if I do not get the full goal funds amount then I get to keep zero dollars of the funds.  I will therefore list the dream budget & the cheapest possible budget, there is no harm in listing the dream budget-even if it flops & no money is raised (as long as funds raised are used responsibly & not wastefully & on the expenses listed in this campaign).
Self publishing with no editing can be done for under $1000, I have read some claims of people being able to e-publish for almost free, (however that does not include editing or marketing costs).  My minimum goal is 15000 after tax dollars, however I want to have a higher budget.  I say minimum, however all money donations will help & be appreciated, from one dollar & up. 
My preferred higher/better quality & faster goal budget is $42000.00.  My dream budget of $65000 includes $18000 living expenses money for me to take one year off work for this project, (accountant advised estimated tax liability $4282) + 18000 + 42000 = $65000 = dream budget amount.  If the campaign produces more than $65000, I do not want the campaign to go above $95000 & I would want the campaign shut down automatically at the highest amount = $95000 super dream budget.  I know these are unrealistically high amounts, however I list the best case scenario in case the impossible happens.  The extra money above/ beyond the listed expenses to write-publish & market this book, would go to business costs & business start up costs & possible other products research/ production/ marketing, tax accounting counsel & lawyer counsel fees, to create a professional web site to sell products.  I will list the low cost to edit & the high cost to edit, attempting to do a top of the line professional editing/publishing & marketing campaign.  
The main part of the expenses that some may or may not prefer to fund is the biggest cost I had in writing this book.  I listed this cost at the beginning of this campaign as a year off with pay - expense.  If a donor does not want to contribute to this cost then be aware that I may not be able to designate what donation goes to which expense.  I want the donor to be comfortable in donating to this project fundraiser campaign.  The biggest cost I incurred in the writing of this book is I took time off from work since June 2014 till now.  I had just sold my house that was sold due to my divorce, so some of my half of the proceeds of the house sale went to support my self while I wrote this book.  Of course as soon as family members & friends read my campaign & saw that I had been off work since June & that I wanted to be off more months to finish this project faster, they gave me grief for being off work so long.  They also inquired how I had supported my self so long without work, which is why I am including this explanation here.  Had I not taken this time off, my writing would have taken me years to complete on off time & weekends due to other time constraints & commitments I have.  I was afraid I might not ever realistically finish my book in the near future.  I knew I had a great life changing book for the target niche market & possibly for others outside this target market.  I just was not sure how long it would take to go from great life changing book idea to professional marketable product on shelfs & sold on the internet.  Great book is one thing, getting it to profitable product sold in the market place is another.

I researched 10 to 15 companies on price estimations.  The prices varied, however they were in a general low to high range as some studies indicated.  I am going to quote from a online article titled - The Real Costs of Self-Publishing a Book/Mediashift/PBS written on May 15 2013 by the CEO of Biblio Crunch - ""an award winning author services marketplace that matches authors with quality, award winning professionals to get new books and apps to market.""  The price estimates are based on a 70000 word manuscript for a cost analysis, my book is approximately 56000 words & I am still adding notes to it so it will end up being 58k to 60k words before it is edited.  I have padded the bid, as most realistic bids/estimates do.  
With no editing required you can get 250 books self published for about $1000.00 or less, depending on who you use (Thats assuming, all editing work is done, e-printing is even way cheaper-some claim free).

  The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make: 
Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.  The following statement could sound like a over sell however it is my opinion.  The difference your contribution could make is it will help put a book on the market place shelves that can help to change lives and to become possibly one of the best self help motivational books sold.  As a contributor you can help make this happen. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).  I do not have a fundraising track record.  I am going to put together a novice 1st time campaign & it will generate some or all of the funds or none of the funds. 
  Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency.  Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal. 
Risks-obstacles-challenges I face on the way to achieving my goal.  The primary obstacle & challenge right now is economical.  The funds solve the money problem which gives me more time & better quality control of this project.  This is the first time in my life that I have taken off this much time from work to do a project.  If I go back to full time employment before this book project is done, the book will get much less of my time & it will take much longer for me to produce.  I can produce a much higher quality book a lot faster & I can maintain much more control of the process with these funds.  Describe your plan for solving these challenges.  My plan for solving these challenges is this fundraiser, it is the best quality plan.  My next plan will not produce a final product as fast because I will not be able to hire the best professional editors & I will lose a lot of the control of this project with out the funds.

This campaign will promote the book, letting people know they are not alone as it is a topic not openly being discussed. To feel afraid, alone, violated and abused is kept quiet. The silence needs to be broken. People need to feel they can regain their dignity, that it's not to feel shameful about. To stand up and and be able to stand up and say ""I was abused, I was violated and I survived!"" is completely empowering!

Synopsis:
""A powerful story of discovery and hope"" 
 Lydia Castle is fifteen, naïve and living in Yorkshire, England. She looks at her reflection in the bathroom mirror as she wipes her neck, the warm blood slowly trickling down her trembling legs. She is in shock, trembling, wondering how it had all come to this moment.
  Mike Webberson is a builder with a reputation for being hard and is feared in the small community, but to Lydia he is a kind, caring friend – until now... 
  He is showing his dark and foreboding side.  The abuse and threats are like a dark, shameful and dirty secret for Lydia, trying to cope with it on her own. She is too scared to tell her parents, knowing her father will look for vengeance.
  As Lydia struggles through adversities she is becoming stronger and empowered. Her life turns a full circle, facing her nightmares once again.
  This time Lydia, now older, can finally fight back!

<p>Since 2006 Something Wicked has been the only South African paying market for writers and readers of Horror and Science Fiction. Now we are aiming to be the first annual South African anthology for horror and science fiction. The anthology will be available as an e-book as well as a traditional paperback. This campaign is intended to help fund our first anthology</p>

<h3><img alt=""In The Begining"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.somethingwicked.co.za/images/inbegining.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""In The Begining""/></h3>
<p>Founded in 2006, <strong>Something Wicked</strong> ran for ten issues in print before moving to an online monthly schedule in May of 2011.<br/>We have published science fiction and horror fiction from around the world and have featured several award-winning authors such as <strong>Abi Godsell</strong>, <strong>Ivor W. Hartmann</strong>, <strong>Nick Wood</strong>, <strong>CS Fuqua</strong>, and Arthur C Clarke Award winner <strong>Lauren Beukes</strong>. We also have the distinct honour of being the first publication to have published <strong>Sarah Lotz</strong> (half of <strong>Lily Herne</strong> and <strong>SL Grey</strong>).<br/>We’ve featured interviews with Best Sellers (Stephen King, Alastair Reynolds, John Connolly), alongside Hollywood directors and stars (Danny Trejo, Ed Neumeier, Jolene Blalock).<br/><strong>Something Wicked</strong> is the only paying short genre-fiction market in South Africa with readers from all over the globe.</p>

<li>Around $1000 will go to printing 300 copies of the Limited Edition paperbacks (the white cover above) which will only be on sale in South Africa and offered to campaign supporters.</li>

<li>$950 covers the illustrations (including $300 for two of the covers which have not been paid yet).</li>

</div></div>","“Like a serial-killing zombie clown’s suitcase, the Something Wicked anthology is full of deliciously wicked surprises, packing more stellar stories into its pages than anyone has a right to expect. Guaranteed scares, superb illustrations and stunning production values from the doting godparent of South African shocks - don’t read after midnight, and don’t miss out.”- SL Grey, author of The Mall
 
 
 
 

NEW PERK ADDITION:
$75 perk now includes a copy o EVERY SINGLE* PRINT ISSUE of Something Wicked.*Issues #2 to #10 (issue #1 is out of print).

Since 2006 Something Wicked has been the only South African paying market for writers and readers of Horror and Science Fiction. Now we are aiming to be the first annual South African anthology for horror and science fiction. The anthology will be available as an e-book as well as a traditional paperback. This campaign is intended to help fund our first anthology


Founded in 2006, Something Wicked ran for ten issues in print before moving to an online monthly schedule in May of 2011.We have published science fiction and horror fiction from around the world and have featured several award-winning authors such as Abi Godsell, Ivor W. Hartmann, Nick Wood, CS Fuqua, and Arthur C Clarke Award winner Lauren Beukes. We also have the distinct honour of being the first publication to have published Sarah Lotz (half of Lily Herne and SL Grey).We’ve featured interviews with Best Sellers (Stephen King, Alastair Reynolds, John Connolly), alongside Hollywood directors and stars (Danny Trejo, Ed Neumeier, Jolene Blalock).Something Wicked is the only paying short genre-fiction market in South Africa with readers from all over the globe.

""Something Wicked is South Africa’s best speculative, science fiction and horror magazine. It’s a paying market and mixes up hot local talent (Diane Awerbuck, Sarah Lotz, Sam Wilson, artists Vincent Sammy and Jesca Marisa) with stories from the likes of John Connolly."" - Lauren Beukes, author of Zoo City

 


Something Wicked Volume One, will be our first print anthology and, to the best of my knowledge, the first science fiction and/or horror anthology ever published in South Africa.We are hoping to create South Africa's first, annual genre-fiction anthology. We believe Something Wicked is an important brand to keep alive as it is the only one of it's kind in SA. And it's only through your help that we can do that.
The anthology will feature two covers illustrated by internationally acclaimed South African illustrator Vincent Sammy, and 24 stories of dark fantasy, science fiction and horror by authors from South Africa and all over the world.
The book itself is split into the six original issues, each featuring illustrations of the original cover art by Jesca Marisa, Pierre Smit, Hendrik Gericke and Vincent Sammy.
We've also commissioned illustrations for every single story, lovingly illustrated and donated, free of charge, by Pierre Smit.


""Something Wicked is the leading horror magazine in South Africa... and it is clear that they are able to attract some of the best genre writers in the country."" - Jim Steel, The Fix-Online





$2000 covers the cost of the writers and story licenses.
Around $1000 will go to printing 300 copies of the Limited Edition paperbacks (the white cover above) which will only be on sale in South Africa and offered to campaign supporters.
Almost a third of it covers the author's license fees for the stories.
$950 covers the illustrations (including $300 for two of the covers which have not been paid yet).
Another third of the money raised will go towards back-payment for our story-editor's six months of tireless editing of the 115607 words that make up the anthology.
And whatever is left takes care of postage for the books and rewards, plus the commission that Indie Go Go takes (4% if we reach our goal, 9% if we don't).
If we don't manage to raise all the funds, the book will still be published through Amazon's Create Space POD, but we'll only print as many copies of the Limited Edition as needed to honour the campaign backers.



What you get depends on the level of funding you choose, but at the very least you'll get a twitter shout-out and thank you (and a hug if I know you personally), or cool-sexy postcards, personalised to YOU, (yes, even you in the back there with the weird hair).
We'll list your name in the Acknowledgements section of the anthology.
You can even get your copy signed by Vianne and Joe, and interior illustrator Pierre Smit.
How about exclusive campaign contributor mugs, T-Shirts, or our entire back catalogue of printed or online issues* (with over 100 short stories).
How about one of thirty signed and numbered hardcover copies of Something Wicked Volume One?
You could have your story professionally edited by our brilliant fiction editor, Vianne Venter and...
If you're completely insane and want to chuck money at us, fukkit, we'll give you everything, EVERYTHING, YOU HEAR? Including a song in your honour and one of our very own last remaining copies in the world of Issue 1.

<p><strong>As The City Burns</strong> is a post-apocalyptic horror tabletop roleplaying game inspired by a game me and my friends are playing in right now. The game is set in and around Boston in a world where civilization collapsed 40 years ago under mysterious circumstances. Now people want answers and the game is about characters going out into a dangerous world and getting the answers they want.</p>
<h1>So what makes your game special?</h1>
<p>I think it's a bit different from other games with similar themes in that the focus is less on fighting off zombie hordes or posing heroically over dismembered enemies and more about the emotions and the situations that cause them. The players are every day people surviving and living in a world where humans are supreme rules of everything and they know. Heroism comes at a cost, villainy is easy, and a hint of the supernatural touches on everything just enough to make everyone uneasy.</p>
<p>Another important part of the game is the system and how it supports the themes of the setting. Rather than using something complicated and potentially distracting I am working on a system that is quick, simple, and lets the setting shine through it rather than overpowering it. I really would like this game to be something a group of friends can set up quickly for a few hours of fun and then easily pack up again without a bunch of huge books to lug around.</p>
<h1>You mentioned that the game is modular, what does that mean?</h1>
<p>Rather than packing everything about the setting into one huge book, this first book will be a sort of introduction to the world through the eyes of a small town, their enemies, allies, and goals in this new world. The book will also feature a mission that will take the characters from their small town, through dangers they've avoided for many years, and into Boston the burning city itself. If this first project is successful my intent is to periodically release modules that include more locations, more missions, and more information on the evolving mysteries of the setting. While the players are free to explore and create in the game world as they want, there will definitely be a bit more guidance than in the traditional RPG books and players can add in any of the future modules that interest them or simply create their own adventures.</p>
<h1>So what is my money being used for?</h1>
<p>About half the funding goal will be used for art for the cover and the various landmarks, NPCs, and locations. I really want quality art for this project and I'm dedicating what I feel are necessary funds for that goal.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will be for printing the product upon completion and shipping it out to the contributors as well as getting it sold locally (in brick and mortar stores) and through online sales. If I am able to I will most likely produce an electronic version for those who prefer e-books.</p>
<p>The result of the project should be a soft-cover book about 80-100 pages in length containing the introduction to the setting and system, the first two locations, and a mission for the players.</p>
<h1>What happens if you pass your funding goal?</h1>
<p>In the event that I get more funding than I expect I'll be using the extra money to produce the next module for the game. Those who give more help me surpass that funding goal will receive more rewards in the form of exclusive missions, setting details, and special locations.</p>
<h1>Sounds great, but why should I give you my money over all other great products and projects out there?</h1>
<p>I am a native New Englander, a passionate gamer, and a writer who really would like to showcase where I grew up in a game that combines fun themes, interesting mysteries, along with a focus on the narrative. Taking a risk on a new product can be a bit scary but you can feel good knowing you helped to produce something awesome and unique.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read through this and I hope you'll consider contributing and making this project a reality.</p>

A $100 contribution will get you both of the previously mentioned albums and a pdf emailed to you containing his first two chapbooks ""Quills of Fire"" and ""Metamorphosis"" as well as a new one containing all of the poems that have been published to date.

<p>Deonte is a teacher and youth activist back home in Detroit, Mi. Any experience that he gets on the road he takes back home with him and shares with students, peers, and upcoming artists alike. This opportunity would be more than just a chance for him to compete against some of the best performing poets in the nation/world. Giving him a chance provides an experience that can be used to teach the youth in Detroit, to inspire those coming after him, to help make a change in a city that needs it.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2><b>WHO AM I?</b></h2>
<p>My name is GB Banks. I have Type III
Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as Brittle Bone Disease, like that dude Mr.
Glass in the movie <i>Unbreakable</i>. I
have had this disease since birth, but it does NOT have me. My dreams are big,
and I am striving to become a bestselling author. Unfortunately, I live on a
fixed income, and I am unable to afford the kind of promotion necessary to give
my novel, <i>Revolution Z</i>, a chance at
success. Due to my condition, it is really hard for me to get around, so I
would like to be able to promote myself and my book, and to be able to share
the many stories I have to tell.</p>
<p>Being disabled has made me a student
of life, and as such, the Horror genre gives me a world where I get to explore
all sides of the human condition. I get to live life to the fullest through my
characters, to explore their loves and hates, their hopes and their fears,
while getting deeper insight into my own as well. And zombies bring out all of
these sides of humanity, as well so much more!</p>
<p> <span>  </span></p>
<h2><b>WHAT IS REVOLUTION Z ABOUT?</b></h2>
<p><b>Revolution Z</b>
is about a revolution spearheaded by the resurrected President George
Washington, who leads a full assault on Washington, D.C. in order to take back
the government from what he feels are corrupt leaders. President Washington is
bent on restoring the US to a nation run by the people, for the people. And a
brutal war ensues. </p>
<p><br/>
  </p>
<h2><b>WHAT IS THE FUNDING FOR?</b></h2>
<p>I’m seeking $5000.00 in funding,
which will go towards advertising and other forms of promotion. Also I am in a
wheelchair and have limited use of my hands, so I need assistance with many
things. I would like to be able to hire a nurse to travel with me to
promotional events such as book conventions and cons, where I can get out of
the confines of my home and network with people, while seeing the world I’ve mostly
only explored in my mind. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT YOU?</b></h2>
<p>I have been writing for 17 years now, and I have
written other books and stories that were well received, two stories having
made the quarter- and semi-finals of well-known writing competition. But due to
my limited income and ability to promote myself, I have yet to have the
bestseller that I continue to dream of. Your support will give me the push (no
pun intended) I need to finally achieve that dream.</p><h2><br/></h2><h2>
</h2>
<h2><b>WHAT DO I GET OUT OF THIS?</b></h2>
<p>Some of the available perks for your donation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Acknowledgement
of your support inside the book <i>Revolution
Z</i>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Free
copies of <i>Revolution Z</i> when it’s
released</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Free copies
of all of my other books, present and future, for life</li>
<li>A free copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQ8KRDI/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The GB Banks Collection</a> (see $15 perk for details)<br/><span><span></span></span>
</li>
<li>Getting to name a character in the book</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Having your own short story or novel idea brought to life by me, with your name listed as the author</li>
</ul><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?</b></h2>
<p>Donating money, of course, is not the only way you can help with the launch of <i>Revolution Z</i>. Please feel free to share this campaign with your
friends and associates via Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, telegraph, telephone,
tell-a-friend. Whatever way that you think will help. </p>
<p>I sincerely appreciate all the help I can get.</p>

				Have a question about the Revolution Z project? <a href=""http://crowdfundingforum.com/showthread.php/8946-%28Indiegogo%29-Help-a-Disabled-Author-Start-the-Zombie-Revolution!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discuss Revolution Z at Crowdfundingforum.com! </a></p><p></p>

<a href=""http://www.hypersmash.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hypersmash.com</a></div>","WHO AM I?
My name is GB Banks. I have Type III
Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as Brittle Bone Disease, like that dude Mr.
Glass in the movie Unbreakable. I
have had this disease since birth, but it does NOT have me. My dreams are big,
and I am striving to become a bestselling author. Unfortunately, I live on a
fixed income, and I am unable to afford the kind of promotion necessary to give
my novel, Revolution Z, a chance at
success. Due to my condition, it is really hard for me to get around, so I
would like to be able to promote myself and my book, and to be able to share
the many stories I have to tell.
Being disabled has made me a student
of life, and as such, the Horror genre gives me a world where I get to explore
all sides of the human condition. I get to live life to the fullest through my
characters, to explore their loves and hates, their hopes and their fears,
while getting deeper insight into my own as well. And zombies bring out all of
these sides of humanity, as well so much more!
   
WHAT IS REVOLUTION Z ABOUT?
Revolution Z
is about a revolution spearheaded by the resurrected President George
Washington, who leads a full assault on Washington, D.C. in order to take back
the government from what he feels are corrupt leaders. President Washington is
bent on restoring the US to a nation run by the people, for the people. And a
brutal war ensues. 

  
WHAT IS THE FUNDING FOR?
I’m seeking $5000.00 in funding,
which will go towards advertising and other forms of promotion. Also I am in a
wheelchair and have limited use of my hands, so I need assistance with many
things. I would like to be able to hire a nurse to travel with me to
promotional events such as book conventions and cons, where I can get out of
the confines of my home and network with people, while seeing the world I’ve mostly
only explored in my mind. 

WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT YOU?
I have been writing for 17 years now, and I have
written other books and stories that were well received, two stories having
made the quarter- and semi-finals of well-known writing competition. But due to
my limited income and ability to promote myself, I have yet to have the
bestseller that I continue to dream of. Your support will give me the push (no
pun intended) I need to finally achieve that dream.

WHAT DO I GET OUT OF THIS?
Some of the available perks for your donation include:


Acknowledgement
of your support inside the book Revolution
Z


Free
copies of Revolution Z when it’s
released

Free copies
of all of my other books, present and future, for life
A free copy of The GB Banks Collection (see $15 perk for details)

Getting to name a character in the book

Having your own short story or novel idea brought to life by me, with your name listed as the author

HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?
Donating money, of course, is not the only way you can help with the launch of Revolution Z. Please feel free to share this campaign with your
friends and associates via Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, telegraph, telephone,
tell-a-friend. Whatever way that you think will help. 
I sincerely appreciate all the help I can get.

<h2><strong>BRINGING LOVE BACK</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>What inspires me to be a Life &amp; Relationship Coach is, knowing that the work I’m doing is helping other people grow in their relationships. What started out as simple Q&amp;A segment on Facebook in 2011 with very few supporters, has spiraled into a brand that now inspires over 60,000 people via online social networks to love again. Based on the awesome feedback I’ve received from the people who have subscribed to “AskCheyB” in the past two years, it’s become evident that the people out there want more outlets that allow them to gain helpful relationship insight that adds value to their lives. After listening to the questions and concerns raised by my audience, I’ve written a book that addresses these very issues, and inspire hope for a much happier, healthier, longer-lasting relationship. My book is self-published and unfortunately doesn’t have the support/funding of a major publishing house, but with your donations, my team and I can organize a book tour in a city near you this spring/summer 2013. The purpose of this tour is to connect with you all face to face, and inspire growth in your relationships with my new book. This will be a fun-filled event with great food, drinks, music, live relationship discussions, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m fully devoted to adding value to the lives of others on a daily basis. “AskCheyB” mission is to help people build happier, healthier, longer-lasting relationships.</p>

<p>Our goal is to reach $20,000 to cover our team’s traveling/hotel expenses, books, promotional materials, food &amp; entertainment for the tour.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Nadia has
been moved to solitary confinement the day after she announced a hunger strike
in protest of gulag-style prison conditions. Prison authorities said they moved
her for her own safety – not as a punishment – after she complained of death
threats. However, the move is likely a response to the long letter she wrote
detailing conditions of ""slave-like labour"", with prisoners forced to
work 17 hours a day with almost no days off, and punishments including being
forced to stand in the cold or being forbidden to use the toilet.</p>
<h3>Who is
Pussy Riot?</h3>
<p>Pussy Riot
is an anonymous Russian feminist performance art group formed in October 2011.
Through a series of peaceful public performances they voice how basic rights
are under threat in Russia today, while expressing the values and principles of
gender quality, democracy and freedom of expression that are contained in the
Russian constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the CEDAW
Convention. </p>
<h3>What's up
with the jail time for a harmless public performance?</h3>
<p>Masha and
Nadia are serving 2 years on charges of ""hooliganism"" for their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCasuaAczKY"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>1-minute performance</span></a> on
February 21, 2012 in a priests-only section of Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the
Saviour. The investigator's report claims the performance was an act of
religious hatred. However, the specific intention of the performance was to
draw attention to the special relationship between President Putin and the
leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well a prayer to the Madonna to
drive Putin away. </p>
<h3>This Putin
guy is for real!</h3>
<p>Yes.
Russia isn't exactly like many free expression oriented countries around the world.
People are not as free to express their opinion without fear of punishment.
Government is hardly transparent and focuses on helping the ""few""
while barely focusing on the needs of the ""trivial"" many. In fact,
Pussy Riot is just one of many being targeted for their beliefs. <br/><br/></p>
<p>
President Vladimir Putin <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ioc-backs-off-on-russian-anti-gay-law/2013/09/26/38b39266-269c-11e3-9372-92606241ae9c_story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>signed a law over the summer</span></a>, making it illegal to discuss
“non-traditional” sexual relationships in the presence of minors or to suggest
that they are equal to traditional ones. Putin defends his law by saying it
protects children and does not infringe on the rights of gays. While the IOC
has been lily-livered to uphold the values and essences that the Olympics represent, there have been many protests around the world to boycott the upcoming Olympics
in Russia 2014. </p>
<h3>Yes, but
who cares? </h3>

Nadia has
been moved to solitary confinement the day after she announced a hunger strike
in protest of gulag-style prison conditions. Prison authorities said they moved
her for her own safety – not as a punishment – after she complained of death
threats. However, the move is likely a response to the long letter she wrote
detailing conditions of ""slave-like labour"", with prisoners forced to
work 17 hours a day with almost no days off, and punishments including being
forced to stand in the cold or being forbidden to use the toilet.
Who is
Pussy Riot?
Pussy Riot
is an anonymous Russian feminist performance art group formed in October 2011.
Through a series of peaceful public performances they voice how basic rights
are under threat in Russia today, while expressing the values and principles of
gender quality, democracy and freedom of expression that are contained in the
Russian constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the CEDAW
Convention. 
What's up
with the jail time for a harmless public performance?
Masha and
Nadia are serving 2 years on charges of ""hooliganism"" for their 1-minute performance on
February 21, 2012 in a priests-only section of Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the
Saviour. The investigator's report claims the performance was an act of
religious hatred. However, the specific intention of the performance was to
draw attention to the special relationship between President Putin and the
leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well a prayer to the Madonna to
drive Putin away. 
This Putin
guy is for real!
Yes.
Russia isn't exactly like many free expression oriented countries around the world.
People are not as free to express their opinion without fear of punishment.
Government is hardly transparent and focuses on helping the ""few""
while barely focusing on the needs of the ""trivial"" many. In fact,
Pussy Riot is just one of many being targeted for their beliefs. 

President Vladimir Putin signed a law over the summer, making it illegal to discuss
“non-traditional” sexual relationships in the presence of minors or to suggest
that they are equal to traditional ones. Putin defends his law by saying it
protects children and does not infringe on the rights of gays. While the IOC
has been lily-livered to uphold the values and essences that the Olympics represent, there have been many protests around the world to boycott the upcoming Olympics
in Russia 2014. 
Yes, but
who cares? 
Good
question! The leading investigative television show in the USA, 60 Minutes,
covered the trials and tribulations of Pussy Riot as report by Lesley Stahl. 


In
addition, the following organizations
support the
release of Pussy Riot:



The Voice
Project


Amnesty
International


Austrian
Green Party


European
Women's Lobby


Human
Rights Watch


Index
Censorship


PEN
International


Russia's
Human Rights Council



Okay, but
you want to know which celebrities and music artists care: 



Arcade Fire


Bjork

Cold Play 
Dido
Madonna

Peter
Gabriel


Red Hot
Chili Peppers


Sir Paul
McCartney


Sting

U2

The money
raised won't go to V-Pu will it?


Hell no!
Putin and his elite company already have enough money to last them several life
times. 100% of net proceeds (gross - expenses) will be transferred to The Voice Project to allocate accordingly. 


There are
critical monthly expenses faced by the women and their families including
monitoring and visitation by local attorneys and family members (crucial for
their safety as unmonitored dissidents have died mysteriously in these camps),
warm clothes, food, medicine and care for their two young children, Phillip and
Gera. Please consider the costs of the following:

$2,500 –

The Impact
Your

<h3><strong>Why this Book?</strong></h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Karen Brody, I help men who want a deep and satisfying connection with a woman, master how to turn up a woman’s desire, by leading him through steps and practices that result in a deeply satisfying, passionate relationship. </p>
<p>Having coached thousands of men, I know that men, and the women who love them, physically ache for the information I share --for simple, and yet, profound keys to open the doors to greater passion and love.  </p>
<p><strong>The Issue: <br/><br/>Men struggle with what women want romantically and sexually!</strong> Most men have a perfunctory understanding. They know that a woman likes tenderness, flowers, or to be lovingly touched, but few know the depth and complexity of a feminine heart – and how to feed a woman in a way that blooms her into her most radiant and joyous self. </p>
<p>Open Her: 7 Masculine Ways to Arouse Your Woman’s Love &amp; Desire is based on 7 masculine archetypes a man can embody to engage his woman in a deeper dance of pleasure and love. <strong>A man is inspired to turn up his masculinity and to love being masculine,</strong> and to engage his woman in ways that get immediate and satisfying results. </p>
<p><strong>A man is inspired to celebrate his masculine gifts and share them with his woman in new, sexy ways, in Open Her, </strong>and is also inspired to be more of the man he wants to be. A man might see himself in ""The Artist"" type, but feel challenged by the bold resolve of The Warrior and choose to take on that aspect of masculinity for his own growth.</p>
<p><strong>I know how powerful Open Her is</strong> when the information gets into the hands of the man (or woman) who is ready for it.  I’ve seen the information transform my clients from frustrated and confused, to boldly passionate and loving.  </p>
<p>Finally a man understands that the way into a woman’s heart is not a trick or a compromise, <strong>it’s about engaging what is already inside of him</strong>-- his masculine key – made to unlock what is inside of his woman.</p>
<p><strong>Who Wants/Craves this Book?</strong></p>
<p>What man doesn’t want the keys and secret codes to masterfully unlock his woman’s desire for him? <strong>And what woman doesn’t want to be blown open, on all levels of her being, by a man who is masterful at love?</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this book for a specific demographic of smart, evolved men who cherish women and want extraordinary relationships. These men feel excited and empowered by the information, and finally experience the ease and success they've always wanted in love with a woman. <br/><br/> I have the utmost confidence in the insights, practices and wisdom of Open Her because it’s been tested over 11 years in my practice with men. <strong>In order for men to succeed at inspiring the desire and love they most want from a woman, </strong>Open Her needs to be on the breakfast table with the granola and the Peet’s Coffee!</p>
<p>It’s practically impossible for men to find this kind of information. What’s on the market is either heavily about sex, or too relationship focused to hold the attention of men. <strong>The reason this book works and that men eat it up, is that it celebrates masculinity!</strong> Instead of asking a man to jump through hoops for love, it inspires a man to leverage his masculine gifts, and who he already is, in a positive and empowering way.</p>
<p><strong>A strong secondary audience for Open Her is women</strong> in relationships or relationship “recovery” looking for the answers to, “Why didn’t it work?” Or why am I feeling so unhappy and unfulfilled in love? How can I get my man to love me in the way I most crave and need?</p>
<p>Open Her illuminates and gives shape to a woman’s deepest (sometimes unconscious) yearnings. <strong>It’s like a mouthwatering menu</strong> <strong>of everything a woman has ever hoped a man would express</strong> to her in love – spelled out in 7 enticing masculine archetypes. </p>
<p><strong>Why Me as the Author?</strong></p>
<p>Confession: I didn’t always love men! I was deeply hurt by a man at a very young age. <strong>I’ve walked through every dark corridor you can imagine to find the light,</strong> and have (through will and faith), and come out the other side to love and embrace men as few women can.</p>
<p>I’ve given heart and soul in my work to understanding <strong>what men most need to succeed at love</strong> and to be sexually whole, and I know I’m here on earth to give that gift in any way I can.</p>
<p> I am also former journalist (it was a first career) with eight years of writing experience for newspapers and magazines, and I hold an MA in Counseling Psychology.</p>

<p><strong>What Does Your Donation Go Specifically?</strong></p>
<p>What I need to publish my book is:</p>
<p>*$4900 for publishing services with <em>Love Your Life Publishing</em> that include:</p>

<p>***$1,500 for a New Computer</p>
<p>My 7-year old, Ibook G4, is a real dinosaur and makes it painful and incredibly slow to get anything done. To be on top of my publishing game, and my marketing, I need a fast, up to date computer that doesn’t stall every time it sees a video!</p>
<p>Cost of my perks and to cover Indiegogo fees: $700</p>
<p>$7,200 is my total fundraising goal. </p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t meet your goal? </strong></p>
<p><strong>I am choosing to know that I will make, and even likely exceed my goal, because this book is so direly needed in the world!</strong> And I also have tremendous faith in all of you who will feel the powerful possibility of this information for yourselves and your love lives, and will eagerly want to support the book’s release and success.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to know that I have a Plan B, I will forego the new Mac, and put all of the money into editing, design and publishing. I will follow through on delivering all of my perks by the dates given. You absolutely have my word.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My mission is to inspire men to be truly powerful and to love women deeply and authentically. <strong>I empower men to succeed with women and to love being men.</strong> This is direly needed in the world. Just look at the divorce rates. </p>
<p>Your funds will help make it possible for men who read my book to recover their sense of masculine joy and pride, and to create truly satisfying relationships with women. Your funding will also help women get the love they dearly want and crave. </p>
<p>I believe that OPEN HER: 7 Masculine Ways to Arouse Your Woman’s Love &amp; Desire <strong>will do for men and masculinity what John Gray’s “Men are Mars, Women are From Venus” did for communication between men and women,</strong> and what “The Five Love Languages,” by Gary Chapman, did for expressing what we each need to feel loved. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, financially, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! If you’d pass this campaign onto your friends on Facebook, Twitter and Linked In, and ask them to support the book, I’d be eternally grateful! You never know who you might help by way of a simple “share.”</p>
<p><strong>Why this book will succeed!</strong></p>
<p>1. First, the book is done! It’s not a dream. And, based on early reads by three great editors and many clients and friends, it’s hitting all the right buttons and I’m being urged to get it into the world.</p>
<p><strong>Here is one endorsement</strong> from a New York Times best-selling author:</p>
<p><strong><em>""Open Her is a soulful book that teaches men what women really want romantically and sexually. This is an insightful read for any man who wants to truly understand women, and create a deep, passionate, loving relationship."" ~ Marci Shimoff, #1 NY Times bestselling author of Love for No Reason and Happy for No Reason</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And another from Raphael Cushnir, a regular contributor to ""O Magazine:""<br/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>""All big-hearted men, pay attention! This is a truly remarkable book. Karen Brody has managed to create a landmark guide to loving a woman that also functions as a path to self-realization. After encountering so many great stories, and bracing insights, I can't wait for my second read.""<br/><br/><span class=""il"">Raphael</span> Cushnir, author of The One Thing Holding You Back and Surfing Your Inner Sea</em></strong></p>
<p>2. I believe that you will feel the potential for Open Her in the world and in your love life, and help me make it fly! <br/><br/> I truly look forward to contributing something meaningful and transformative to your love life! </p>

<h2><strong>Conócenos</strong></h2>
<p>Una editorial independiente y un emprendimiento en gestión cultural nos unimos para lograr un objetivo: iniciar un viaje. Les contamos un poco sobre nosotros para que nos conozcan y se animen a apoyar y difundir nuestro trabajo.</p>
<p><strong>Autores Venezolanos</strong> nace en el 2012 como una iniciativa personal, motivada por el amor a la lectura y por el palpable vacío que existía en la difusión del talento venezolano. Desde entonces hemos promovido la labor de escritores, músicos y artistas visuales, a través de la difusión de fragmentos de sus obras en prendas de vestir y accesorios seleccionados, tazas, pulseras y bolsos, así como también creando proyectos y organizando eventos literarios para todo público. Nuestro equipo está conformado por Tibisay Guerra (directora), Miguel Díaz (diseño y logística), y Mirna Freitez, (sitio web).</p>
<p>Ideamos eventos y actividades como el Concurso Nacional de Poesía Joven Rafael Cadenas, el cual organizamos junto a Team Poetero, y ya cuenta con su tercera edición, Yoga y Poesía, el Retablillo de Navidad, de Aquiles Nazoa, que se realiza desde el 2012. Junto a Loreal Venezuela y la marca Kérastase realizamos la iniciativa “Sé tú el poema”, la cual lleva poesía venezolana a 58 salones de belleza de todo el país y estuvimos presentes en la Exposición Sentir Venezuela, en la Ciudad de Miami, USA.</p>
<p>Durante este año se ha formado una alianza con la iniciativa Qué Leer para realizar la <i>Silent Reading Party</i>, que ya cuenta con 7 ediciones; organizamos también, junto a la embajada de España y Cultura Chacao, un homenaje al maestro Rafael Cadenas, para celebrar el Premio Reina Sofía de Poesía Iberoamericana. Por últimos, estamos trabajando en nuevo proyecto musical-visual llamado Sonorámica, junto al artista visual Starsky Brines y la editorial Libros del Fuego.</p>
<p><strong>Libros del Fuego</strong> es una editorial formada en 2013 por Juan Mercerón, Rodnei Casares y Alberto Sáez, que surge de la inquietud de encontrar en el mercado esos libros que sus fundadores querían leer. En estos 5 años de trabajo, hemos publicado 20 títulos, los cuales han obtenido un reconocimiento dentro y fuera de nuestras fronteras, siendo los más destacados el Premio Latinoamericano de Diseño Editorial, en Argentina, los Libros Más Bellos del Mundo, en Alemania, el Applied Arts Awards Desing, en Canadá y la selección en el Hotlist 2017 y 2018 de la Feria del Libro de Frankfurt, entre otros.</p>

<p>En nuestro catálogo hemos tenido la fortuna de contar con autores de amplio reconocimiento como Andrés Neuman, Alberto Salcedo Ramos, Federico García Lorca y Juan Villoro.</p>
<p>Para Libros del Fuego este viaje también significa mostrar los libros que hacemos y el valor que ellos tienen para nosotros, ya que en el 2017 el Ministerio de Cultura de Portugal nos escribió para notificarnos que sería el país homenajeado en la Feria del Libro de Guadalajara, en 2018, razón por la que nos invitaba a ser una de las 30 editoriales que los representara publicando autores de lengua portuguesa, en español, para ser expuestos en su stand durante la feria.

<h2>Us</h2>
<p>An independent editorial and a cultural management project unite to achieve one goal:  a journey. Let us tell you a little bit about ourselves so you can know more about what we do.</p>
<p><strong>Autores Venezolanos</strong> was born in 2012 as a personal initiative, motivated by the love of reading and the palpable emptiness that existed in the diffusion of Venezuelan talent. Since then we have promoted the work of writers, musicians and visual artists, through the spreading of pieces of their works in selected clothes and accessories, cups, bracelets and handbags, as well as creating projects and organizing literary events for all audiences. Our team is formed by Tibisay Guerra (director), Miguel Díaz (design and logistics), and Mirna Freitez, (website).</p>
<p>We develop events as the Concurso Nacional de Poesía Joven Rafael Cadenas, which we organize together with Team Poetero and is already at its third edition. Yoga and poetry, the Christmas Retablillo of Aquiles Nazoa, which takes place since 2012. With Loreal Venezuela and the Kérastase brand  we made the ""Sé tú el poema""(Be the poem) initiative, which brings Venezuelan poetry to 58 beauty salons across the country and we were present at the exhibition Sentir Venezuela(Feel Venezuela) in the city of Miami, USA.</p>
<p>During this year has formed an alliance with the initiative “Qué leer”(What to read) to carry out the Silent Reading Party, which already has 7 editions. It was organized, together with the Embassy of Spain and Culture Chacao, a tribute to the poet Rafael Cadenas, to celebrate the his prize Reina Sofía of Latin American Poetry. We are also working on a new sound project called Sonorámica, along with Visual artist Starsky Brines and editorial Libros del Fuego.</p>
<p><strong>Libros del Fuego</strong> is a publishing house formed in 2013 by Juan Merceron, Rodnei Casares and Alberto Sáez, which emerges from the concern to find in the market those books that its founders wanted to read. In  5 years of work, we have published 20 titles which have gained a acknowledgment within and outside our borders. Some of the most important are:  the Latin American Editorial Design Prize in Argentina; The most beautiful books in the world, in Germany; The Applied Arts Awards desing, in Canada and the selection in the Hotlist 2017, and 2018 of the Frankfurt Book Fair, among others.</p>
<p>Also, we maintain a constant effort to participate in the most important fairs of Latin America, having a great receptivity in those in which we participate. Some of them have been: La Feria del libro de Bogota, La Fiesta del Libro y de la Cultura, La Feria de Editores in Buenos Aires, La Furia del Libro in Santiago.</p>
<p>In our catalogue we have the fortune to have widely recognized authors such as Andrés Neuman, Alberto Salcedo Ramos, Federico García Lorca and Juan Villoro.</p>
<p>For Libros del Fuego this trip also means to show the books we make as well as the value they have for us since 2017 the Ministry of Culture of Portugal contacted us to notify that Portugal would be the country honored at the Guadalajara Book Fair  in 2018. For this reason, they invited us to be one of the 30 publishers to represent them by publishing authors of Portuguese language in Spanish to be exhibited at their stand during the fair. To honor this invitation, we decided to participate by publishing two books by the writer Mario de Sá Carneiro: <strong><i>La consefesión de Lucio </i></strong>and  <strong><i>Inicios de oro</i></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Working together</strong></p>
<p>This alliance began 2 years ago, when we published the first book of the Concurso de Poesía Rafael Cadenas, and since then we have been working and supporting each other in different projects, which brings us to this moment.</p>
<p>Talking about the goals that each one posed for this year and knowing the challenges that involves working for the culture in our country, we proposed a goal with which, without knowing it, both initiatives dreamed for a long time: become part of the Guadalajara Book Fair!, the most important books fair in Latin America. Arming ourselves with courage and without knowing what could happen, we decided to create a proposal to participate in this event.</p>
<p>It filled us with great joy to know that we were invited to talk at a table called <strong>Estamos aquí para decir Venezuela: literatura, edición y gestión cultural (</strong>We are here to say Venezuela: literature, publishing and cultural management).</p>
<p>It is no secret how complex it has become to work for culture and so we want to show how we keep trying and how we can create new options and strategies that adapt to a complex market to be developed at this time.</p>
<p>However, we do not have the resources needed to go to Mexico and although we have the collaboration of the fair in some areas, it is not enough to achieve this goal. That is why we decided to create this campaign and ask for your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<p> In order to make this 12-day trip, our goal is to help us get $6,500 that will be distributed in:</p>
<p>- Meals.</p>

<p>- Accommodation.</p>
<p>- Cost of sending rewards to supporters.</p>

Una editorial independiente y un emprendimiento en gestión cultural nos unimos para lograr un objetivo: iniciar un viaje. Les contamos un poco sobre nosotros para que nos conozcan y se animen a apoyar y difundir nuestro trabajo.
Autores Venezolanos nace en el 2012 como una iniciativa personal, motivada por el amor a la lectura y por el palpable vacío que existía en la difusión del talento venezolano. Desde entonces hemos promovido la labor de escritores, músicos y artistas visuales, a través de la difusión de fragmentos de sus obras en prendas de vestir y accesorios seleccionados, tazas, pulseras y bolsos, así como también creando proyectos y organizando eventos literarios para todo público. Nuestro equipo está conformado por Tibisay Guerra (directora), Miguel Díaz (diseño y logística), y Mirna Freitez, (sitio web).
Ideamos eventos y actividades como el Concurso Nacional de Poesía Joven Rafael Cadenas, el cual organizamos junto a Team Poetero, y ya cuenta con su tercera edición, Yoga y Poesía, el Retablillo de Navidad, de Aquiles Nazoa, que se realiza desde el 2012. Junto a Loreal Venezuela y la marca Kérastase realizamos la iniciativa “Sé tú el poema”, la cual lleva poesía venezolana a 58 salones de belleza de todo el país y estuvimos presentes en la Exposición Sentir Venezuela, en la Ciudad de Miami, USA.
Durante este año se ha formado una alianza con la iniciativa Qué Leer para realizar la Silent Reading Party, que ya cuenta con 7 ediciones; organizamos también, junto a la embajada de España y Cultura Chacao, un homenaje al maestro Rafael Cadenas, para celebrar el Premio Reina Sofía de Poesía Iberoamericana. Por últimos, estamos trabajando en nuevo proyecto musical-visual llamado Sonorámica, junto al artista visual Starsky Brines y la editorial Libros del Fuego.
Libros del Fuego es una editorial formada en 2013 por Juan Mercerón, Rodnei Casares y Alberto Sáez, que surge de la inquietud de encontrar en el mercado esos libros que sus fundadores querían leer. En estos 5 años de trabajo, hemos publicado 20 títulos, los cuales han obtenido un reconocimiento dentro y fuera de nuestras fronteras, siendo los más destacados el Premio Latinoamericano de Diseño Editorial, en Argentina, los Libros Más Bellos del Mundo, en Alemania, el Applied Arts Awards Desing, en Canadá y la selección en el Hotlist 2017 y 2018 de la Feria del Libro de Frankfurt, entre otros.
También, mantenemos un constante esfuerzo por participar en las ferias más importantes de Latinoamérica, teniendo una gran receptividad en la Feria del Libro de Bogotá, la Fiesta del Libro y la Cultura en Medellín, la Feria de Editores en Buenos Aires, la Furia del Libro en Santiago de Chile.
En nuestro catálogo hemos tenido la fortuna de contar con autores de amplio reconocimiento como Andrés Neuman, Alberto Salcedo Ramos, Federico García Lorca y Juan Villoro.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out my IGG for my book! I will try and keep it short and sweet. The book is ready! All I need is pre-sale help to print them up and deliver! The stories are polished...and the artwork is all done and beautiful! The cover art has been done by Erik Wilson, and the three pieces of inside artwork have been done by Martin Trafford.</p>
<p>""Agony &amp; Pleasure"" is a collection of three horror novellas that vary in sub-genre. Each story is unique and different. However they do share a connection... and you can tell from the title ;) I aiming to release the book in late October!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to get to at least $400, and if I somehow get to $500 that will be a big help. The reason why I need to get that much is simply to create more paperback books and also help with the shipping costs!</p>
<p>The Hardcover books are limited and exclusive to this IGG campaign, however at this moment I am typing this (9/20/17) I have eleven copies to make and ship out... so I'm probably going to create an even 15 and those extra four will be the last copies. However if I somehow reach past 15, and get to...lets say 17? I'll make an additional 3.. to keep it even. After that...they will be gone and the paperback edition will be the only release.</p>
<p> - ANYBODY WHO PRE-ORDERS WILL GET A SPECIAL THANKS CREDIT IN THE BOOK. RIGHT IN THE FIRST FEW PAGES :) (only people who pre-buy through indiegogo- either $5 donation to the highest- will be thanked in the book - and it will stay there as this is the official release.)</p>
<p>- ALSO ONE PERSON WILL BE ENTERED INTO A RAFFLE INTO WINNING MY RESEARCH FOR THE THREE NOVELLAS.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Impact is simply helping a young author get his name out there... I'm only nineteen (turning twenty soon) but I have been writing for 7-8 years now and really want to share my stories with people like you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no real risks... I already wrote the stories and the book prints fine. It only takes two weeks after ordering them to have them ready to ship to backers. I am hoping to have the books delivered by Halloween :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you'd like to share this indiegogo with anybody who would be interested, please do!</p>

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with topics on productivity, art in business, procrastination, and innovation.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are trying to figure out what you want to do in life, feel like you haven’t met your full potential, or you just want to learn more about other creative minds.<br/><br/><i>Creative @ Work</i> speaks to students and business people who want to grapple with creating solutions and improving their performance in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Creative @ Work</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Making Your Path is about approaching the professional world from a philosophical lens. I’ve spoken to a variety of path blazers and opportunity creators and discovered what truly drives them, in order to determine how we can apply these same truths on our professional paths.<br/><br/>My name is Jacob Mass and I am the author of Making Your Path. I wrote this book because I’m a young professional entering the workforce, and I wasn’t satisfied with the existing professional content. So much of it is focused purely on success and ambition. I wanted to understand the heart of it, the driving philosophies behind these great professionals.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new ways to think about your career and the way that you approach it, no matter what stage you’re in. I’ve boiled down many of the overarching truths that different professionals have come across and how these truths have impacted their drive for happiness. Ultimately, I want you to gain this wisdom that I’ve documented by speaking to these various professionals and use it as a tool to steer your own path more deliberately, and shape your professional life how you want.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about some of the key forces behind the minds of great makers, including the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob Greenberg, one of the first 11 Microsoft employees, who only stayed for a few years before taking off on his own professional path full of ups and downs.</li>
<li>Ralph Baer, the Father of Video Games, who was originally an electrical engineer at a defense company before he took his own initiative of heading an entirely new project that would become the first video game console.</li>
<li>John Park, a professional maker and content creator whose career has incorporated dozens of different skill sets over multiple decades, with each new opportunity being built from the last one’s experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you value taking a deeper look at how you’re crafting your life, and in particular, your career. You will love this book if you want to better understand yourself and the world around you through the ideals of great makers. You will love this book if you’re someone who enjoys your profession and wants to dive even deeper from a place of meaning.<br/><br/>Making Your Path is a nonfiction book that speaks to current and future makers, innovators, inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, and many more who want to learn to harness the driving philosophies of the professional world.</p>
<h2>The Book - Making Your Path</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 focuses on framing the book and discussing relevant concepts to approaching this book such as reassigning meaning to buzzwords and cliches.<br/><br/>Part 2 serves as the main bulk of the book in which each chapter features an overall driving philosophy and how it has played a role in the lives of different makers. Examples of these driving philosophies are the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness.<br/><br/>Part 3 revisits each driving philosophy and how you can harness them in your own career. It discusses how to move forward in making your path.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover</strong> <strong>design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder)</li>
<li>The<strong> layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion</strong> efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</p>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.</p>
<p>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.

<p><i>A Primer on Reptiles and Amphibians</i> is an innovative educational resource designed to forge a connection between the reader and the creeping critters of the world. Turtles, frogs, lizards, salamanders, snakes, and crocodiles… these animals evoke fear and fascination. This primer dispels myths and unlocks mysteries surrounding these diverse survivors which have mastered virtually every habitat on Earth. Tragically, these animals now face pressures of unprecedented severity, but there is still time to make a difference if more of us work together. <br/><br/>Micha Petty is an international award-winning Master Naturalist and wildlife rehabilitator. This critically acclaimed debut volume is a collection of Micha’s interpretive writings, carefully crafted to make learning easy for everyone. These bulletins display his passion for Conservation Through Education while covering topics such as living harmoniously with wildlife, physiology, natural history, observation, and conservation. Flip to any page to be instantly introduced to new facets of reptiles, amphibians, the perils they face, and how you can join the fight to save them.</p>

<p>I am releasing my work as a <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons</a> project because I want people in less affluent nations and households to have access to this information.</p>

<p>I wish I could give it away for free, but I am doing the next best thing.

</div></div>","THANKS FOR A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN!
The books are in and shipping now! You can purchase your copies here if you would like, or you can shop on our website, (or if you prefer, our site has links to purchase on Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, or Alibris!)
 
 

From the Back Cover: 
A Primer on Reptiles and Amphibians is an innovative educational resource designed to forge a connection between the reader and the creeping critters of the world. Turtles, frogs, lizards, salamanders, snakes, and crocodiles… these animals evoke fear and fascination. This primer dispels myths and unlocks mysteries surrounding these diverse survivors which have mastered virtually every habitat on Earth. Tragically, these animals now face pressures of unprecedented severity, but there is still time to make a difference if more of us work together. Micha Petty is an international award-winning Master Naturalist and wildlife rehabilitator. This critically acclaimed debut volume is a collection of Micha’s interpretive writings, carefully crafted to make learning easy for everyone. These bulletins display his passion for Conservation Through Education while covering topics such as living harmoniously with wildlife, physiology, natural history, observation, and conservation. Flip to any page to be instantly introduced to new facets of reptiles, amphibians, the perils they face, and how you can join the fight to save them.
 


Even though it is still getting some finishing touches, you can download it right now, either by visiting the landing page, by clicking here for the standard resolution PDF, or here for the low-resolution version for slow connections. The Primer is not some run-of-the-mill free PDF. All you need to do is download it and look at it for a few minutes and you will be glad you did!
 

 

I am releasing my work as a Creative Commons project because I want people in less affluent nations and households to have access to this information.
Even so, the people that view the eBook constantly ask me how they can buy a print version. Giving the Primer away makes it a bad fit for traditional publishing routes, and I believe it deserves better than print-on-demand treatment.
Consequently, I have put a great deal of research into printing and bookbinding, and I have a quote to produce a beautiful, Smyth-sewn hardcover full of thick pages and 375 striking full-color illustrations.
I wish I could give it away for free, but I am doing the next best thing. I am donating the publishing rights to my nonprofit reptile rescue and rehabilitation center, and any money these books bring in will always go straight to helping the critters. This is the best win-win I can imagine, but I do need your help.
 

Better yet- download the Primer, look it over, and decide for yourself!
 
 

 
 

 
 



The book many of you have been anxiously waiting almost a year for! Order it now! 
Books of this style typically sell in stores for $40-$50 (and up!). Since this project has never been about making money (though L.E.A.R.N. could sure use it!), I am offering first edition, beautiful hardcopies of A Primer on Reptiles & Amphibians for Only $27!
Each one will come signed by me unless you request otherwise, and the inscription can be personalized, should you wish. 

 
 
If you just want to show your support and pitch in a few bucks- here's a reward for you! 

 
 


If you are not stuck on getting a hard copy, $16 gets you the miniature digital version! This 16 GB flash drive comes preloaded with a high-res (300 DPI) PDF so you can print vivid copies of the bulletins and appreciate all the illustrations in crisp detail. Also included is L.E.A.R.N.'s Watch For Wildlife video, educational graphics, and more!
You could make this your ""critter flash drive"" and store all your nature files on it. Domestic shipping is free! Upon individual request, I will also load it with my comprehensive PowerPoint about reptiles and amphibians for wildlife educators to adapt or draw from. (Final design may vary from image.)

<h3>What Readers Said about Combat Frame XSeed: Coalition Year 40:</h3>
<p><i>While I raved about the original XSeed (CY 1) and its side story (CY 2), it is refreshing to see CY 40 offer new scenarios and new types of action and intrigue, instead of rehashing the successful CY 1. The underlying 60 million year-old mystery begins to be fleshed out in ways that make speculation even wilder.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-Castalia House Blog</p>
<p><i>XSeed is a breath of fresh air in the mecha genre. Every character stands apart, the combat sequences are blisteringly hot, and the tension never ends. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the first page to the final line, and now I can’t wait for the sequel.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-Adam Lane Smith, author of <i>Gideon Ira: Knight of the Blood Cross</i></p>
<p><i>Brian once again knocks it out of the park with the second book in the series, Coalition Year 40. Some secrets are answered, more questions are asked, and everything works just right. The characters are as developed as before, the fights as brutal and awesome as before, and no important thread is dropped from one to another.</i></p>
<p><i>Even as I want to see the ending of the story, I want to see what happened in between. I want to see more more more! Buy it. It's amazing!</i></p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>My awesome backers have <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/combat-frame-xseed-novel/x/19357084?create_edit=true#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">successfully funded</a> two thrilling Combat Frame XSeed novels, and I've delivered on every promise I made. That's <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/combat-frame-xseed-coalition-year-40-novel/x/19357084?create_edit=true#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">two campaigns</a> funded &amp; completely fulfilled!</p>
<p>But I'm not resting on my laurels. The plan is to make the third time the biggest and most exciting campaign of all!</p>
<p>But I can't do it alone.</p>
<p>As an independent author, I'm not beholden to a big city editor dictating this month's Very Important Message™. I answer only to my readers, and I give you what you want: fun!</p>
<p>This freedom comes with a cost. I don't have editorial, art, or marketing departments shouldering some of the workload. Nor do I get an advance to keep the lights on while I write.</p>
<p>That's where you come in!</p>
<p>When you back this project, not only will you help me offset book production and marketing costs, you'll get the book before anyone else. And there's a wide selection of other sweet perks to choose from!</p>
<p>Haven't read the first two XSeed books? Not a problem! Each and every perk tier automatically includes all three Combat Frame XSeed eBooks!</p>
<p>Now that you've got no excuse, jump right in, back the project, claim your awesome perks, and help save science fiction!</p>
<p>Back <i>Combat Frame XSeed: CY 40 Second Coming</i> now! Help spread the word to fellow sci-fi readers. Indiegogo has share tools to make boosting the signal easy.</p>

XSeed is a breath of fresh air in the mecha genre. Every character stands apart, the combat sequences are blisteringly hot, and the tension never ends. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the first page to the final line, and now I can’t wait for the sequel.
-Adam Lane Smith, author of Gideon Ira: Knight of the Blood Cross
Brian once again knocks it out of the park with the second book in the series, Coalition Year 40. Some secrets are answered, more questions are asked, and everything works just right. The characters are as developed as before, the fights as brutal and awesome as before, and no important thread is dropped from one to another.
Even as I want to see the ending of the story, I want to see what happened in between. I want to see more more more! Buy it. It's amazing!
-Benjamin from Superversive SF
 

The Plan
My awesome backers have successfully funded two thrilling Combat Frame XSeed novels, and I've delivered on every promise I made. That's two campaigns funded & completely fulfilled!
But I'm not resting on my laurels. The plan is to make the third time the biggest and most exciting campaign of all!
But I can't do it alone.
As an independent author, I'm not beholden to a big city editor dictating this month's Very Important Message™. I answer only to my readers, and I give you what you want: fun!
This freedom comes with a cost. I don't have editorial, art, or marketing departments shouldering some of the workload. Nor do I get an advance to keep the lights on while I write.
That's where you come in!
When you back this project, not only will you help me offset book production and marketing costs, you'll get the book before anyone else. And there's a wide selection of other sweet perks to choose from!
Haven't read the first two XSeed books? Not a problem! Each and every perk tier automatically includes all three Combat Frame XSeed eBooks!
Now that you've got no excuse, jump right in, back the project, claim your awesome perks, and help save science fiction!
Back Combat Frame XSeed: CY 40 Second Coming now! Help spread the word to fellow sci-fi readers. Indiegogo has share tools to make boosting the signal easy.
Thanks for your support!

<p>I am Carolyn Hoagland. I’m a  author,
blogger, wife and mother. I have been a mime and storyteller professionally in
the past. I am a blogger and am working on several books but none so dear to my
heart as this particular one.</p>
<p>Years ago with my daughter was very young I wrote a poem as
a Christmas Card. The poem is called “The Angel’s Gift.” The poem was so well
received that I decided to write others to go along with it. “The Angel’s Gift
was used as the focal point for a hospitals fund drive the year it was written.
It was also printed in our churches Christmas handout. This poem is the first
in the book.</p>
<p>I made the decision to write a collection of 25 poems that
told the story of the birth of Christ from the viewpoints of different people
who are mentioned in Biblical accounts or those we can assume may have been
there. I wrote these poems as a way to share the Christmas story with my then 2
year old daughter. I wanted a way to bring the story alive for her. I wanted to
start a family tradition of spending time together each day during the holidays remembering the
real reason for the season.</p>
<p>I wanted to give each Biblical and fictional character their
own “voice” to tell their story. I wanted to put information out that made
adults rethink how they look at the Christmas story without “changing” the fundamental
and important parts of the story. I wanted adults to remember the joyous
feelings they had during the holidays as a child. I wanted to put some fanciful
stories in that would catch a child’s imagination and bring it all alive and
make it relatable to them. As Dr J Vernon Mcgee use to say when preaching, “You’ve
got to put the cookies on the bottom shelf for the children to get to. Otherwise
they will not pay attention and will wonder off!”</p>
<p>As time went on I shared my stories with family and friends.
They found it a wonderful way to get their families slow down for 10-15 minutes
a day during the busy holiday season to focus on each other and the
Reason-for-the-Season, Jesus.</p>
<p>The book has been available as an ebook for several years.
As an ebook it is hard to promote. People say they would rather have this type of book as
a print book to hold in their hands and give as a gift. It is my goal to have
this book published as a Print on Demand book available on major bookseller sites, like
Amazon and Barns &amp; Nobel by Christmas 2014.</p>
<p><b>Goal</b></p>

2014. I have estimated I need $2,500 to both publish, promote and have copies to sell.</p>

<h3><b>PURPOSE FOR WRITING THIS BOOK</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are many international books published on
pitcher plants, however, almost all of them are written by western writers and
about growing pitcher plants in non-tropical climates. The technique of growing
pitcher plants in tropical countries, such as South East Asia, are different
and have not been well explored. This is what I aim to change.</p>
<p>I plan to launch my book during the upcoming Singapore
Garden Festival taking place this year between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> August
2014. This bi-annual international plant festival is the perfect opportunity
for me to introduce my book to plants enthusiasts across the globe.</p>
<p>Because of this
deadline I am asking for the goodwill of sponsors to help me further facilitate
my research and complete my book in time for the Singapore Garden Festival.</p>
<b>
</b><p>My intention to write a
book really stems from the fact that there really wasn’t much information on
the care and maintenance of Carnivorous plants in the tropics when I first
started growing plants. I had such a hard time sourcing for the right
information.  In fact, much of the knowledge I needed was found only after
a lot of trial-and-error.  </p>
<p>Although on-line
forums/websites had pieces of information here and there, it wasn’t enough.
 It was also inconvenient and time consuming to browse through so many
forum pages and still not find what I was looking for.  I went to our
public libraries and even to bookshops but there really wasn’t any book
published that had the care information on the cultivation methods of pitcher
plants in my region.</p>
<p>I did come across some
books published on the growth and cultivation of carnivorous plants. However,
the books did not specialise in a specific genus and were not specific enough.
 </p>
<p>Since I had already
amassed a wealth of knowledge on growing pitcher plants through many hours of
research and trials, I decided to write a book to help beginners so they would
have a centralised reference point on growing tropical pitcher plants. </p>
<p>I hope in time, to see
many young people starting to grow tropical pitcher plants and to grow these
amazing carnivorous plants to their full potential! </p>

</div><p></p><p>This book features the stories <span>LGBTQ (lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and queer) people and
marriage equality advocates to help spread a much-needed global understanding
of LGBTQ people and bring about a “tipping point” to hasten the progress of
more countries adopting marriage equality. Readers of all types will gain a deeper
understanding of the diversity and shared humanity of LGBTQ people and gain
skills to become more effective advocates of LGBTQ people -- which can be
easily applied to other misunderstood minority groups. </span></p>
<p>In every country, LGBTQ people are a minority group with
the same challenge: to win enough understanding and support from non-LGBTQ
people to accept who we are to live more freely and to secure basic legal
protections such as the freedom to marry the person we love. Unfortunately, misunderstandings
are common because of a lack of access to reliable information about who we LGBTQ
people are and why we might want to marry. Yet despite this, since 2000, LGBT
advocates and our allies around the world have found ways to connect with a
critical mass of people, allowing them to “get us” enough to honor and respect
our freedom to marry in a growing number (~20) of countries. </p>
<p>Told through an engaging and experiential
travelogue style, this book is about my own journey of discovery
around the world about what works in reaching people's hearts - including
stories, conversations, and the messages we convey about LGBTQ people in
campaigns. Readers can feel like they are “with me” as I travel from country to
country interviewing people -- including marriage equality advocates, regular
same-gender loving people, and straight people who have had a change of heart
or are still struggling with understanding who we are and why we want to marry.
It will also include my own personal and political stories in over 11 years of
efforts to win support for marriage in the United States. </p><p><b>Countries</b></p><p>These countries represent a diversity of geographies, ethnicities and religions. I have already collected over 200 stories from the following countries:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">On their way to marriage equality: Australia, Northern Ireland, Germany, Japan</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Recently won the legal freedom to marry: Ireland, United States, Finland</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">First or most advanced in their geographic region: Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay, South Africa, Taiwan</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p>Going to each country has proved to be important in building relationships, developing trust and rapport, and understanding the all-important context in which people live.</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This book is important now (in and after 2015) because there are about 20 countries which now allow same-sex couples to marry -- enough to leverage key lessons. In most countries in the world, we have a long way to go to win these freedoms, and even in places with marriage equality, we still suffer from a lack of understanding among our neighbors, friends and loved ones. We need ways to sustain and solidify cultural support through shared stories and common journeys.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>Though the book is not a campaign strategy book, it will include effective practices that can be leveraged in this important, global human rights movement.</p>Readers of all types will be able to “travel with me on this global journey,” enjoying the travels, cultures, and people I meet along the way. They will invariably see themselves reflected in many of the stories, just as I have related to them and offer “flashbacks” to parts of my own experience as a gay woman and as a marriage equality advocate in the United States.<br/><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">2) Who is Tracy Hollister and why is she qualified to write this book?</span><br/></p><p>I am a long-time marriage equality advocate with a passion for helping people better understand us LGBTQ people - who we are and why we want to marry. I have witnessed significant and tragic misunderstandings of us over the years, which is typical in a world in which there are few authorities who provide reliable and easily accessible information about LGBTQ people.</p><p>My commitment to this issue is strong. After 9 years of blogging, speaking and organizing interfaith projects to raise awareness and support for marriage equality, I resigned from my well-paying, full-time job to volunteer full-time to coordinate 33 phone banks and oppose my state’s (North Carolina) anti-marriage equality amendment in 2012. I then moved to New York City to work for Marriage Equality USA, working on five state marriage campaigns and then educational and story-telling programs. I know what makes a good story and how to inspire people to share their stories.</p><p>I have a solid understanding of what research confirms: the more people get to know LGBTQ people, the more they understand us and support our equal treatment in society. One of the most effective ways to bridge the gap in understanding - and appeal to people’s hearts - is to share stories. Stories are the shortest distance between two people.</p><p>Throughout my 11 years as an advocate and 18 years as an openly gay woman, I have many stories to tell of my own!  In the form of flashbacks triggered from others’ stories, I will share these experiences - adding an additional personal dimension to the book.  Some of my most interesting stories come from my “close encounters” with religious conservatives, including attending their panel discussions as well as direct interactions with them through confrontations -- and then later transformation conversations, co-authoring articles, and co-hosting living room conversations.

Note: Goal Focus on Direct Book-Related Expenses Indiegogo does not let you change the goal mid-campaign, but I decided to focus on raising funds for the direct book-related writing, production and promotion expenses. Any additional funds - including those raised following the Indiegogo campaign - will cover travel expenses incurred while doing interviews in 12+ countries for the book.  See #4 for details. 
1. What is this book about? 
This book features the stories LGBTQ (lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and queer) people and
marriage equality advocates to help spread a much-needed global understanding
of LGBTQ people and bring about a “tipping point” to hasten the progress of
more countries adopting marriage equality. Readers of all types will gain a deeper
understanding of the diversity and shared humanity of LGBTQ people and gain
skills to become more effective advocates of LGBTQ people -- which can be
easily applied to other misunderstood minority groups. 
In every country, LGBTQ people are a minority group with
the same challenge: to win enough understanding and support from non-LGBTQ
people to accept who we are to live more freely and to secure basic legal
protections such as the freedom to marry the person we love. Unfortunately, misunderstandings
are common because of a lack of access to reliable information about who we LGBTQ
people are and why we might want to marry. Yet despite this, since 2000, LGBT
advocates and our allies around the world have found ways to connect with a
critical mass of people, allowing them to “get us” enough to honor and respect
our freedom to marry in a growing number (~20) of countries. 
Told through an engaging and experiential
travelogue style, this book is about my own journey of discovery
around the world about what works in reaching people's hearts - including
stories, conversations, and the messages we convey about LGBTQ people in
campaigns. Readers can feel like they are “with me” as I travel from country to
country interviewing people -- including marriage equality advocates, regular
same-gender loving people, and straight people who have had a change of heart
or are still struggling with understanding who we are and why we want to marry.
It will also include my own personal and political stories in over 11 years of
efforts to win support for marriage in the United States. CountriesThese countries represent a diversity of geographies, ethnicities and religions. I have already collected over 200 stories from the following countries:

On their way to marriage equality: Australia, Northern Ireland, Germany, Japan


Recently won the legal freedom to marry: Ireland, United States, Finland


First or most advanced in their geographic region: Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay, South Africa, Taiwan

Going to each country has proved to be important in building relationships, developing trust and rapport, and understanding the all-important context in which people live.This book is important now (in and after 2015) because there are about 20 countries which now allow same-sex couples to marry -- enough to leverage key lessons. In most countries in the world, we have a long way to go to win these freedoms, and even in places with marriage equality, we still suffer from a lack of understanding among our neighbors, friends and loved ones. We need ways to sustain and solidify cultural support through shared stories and common journeys.Though the book is not a campaign strategy book, it will include effective practices that can be leveraged in this important, global human rights movement.Readers of all types will be able to “travel with me on this global journey,” enjoying the travels, cultures, and people I meet along the way. They will invariably see themselves reflected in many of the stories, just as I have related to them and offer “flashbacks” to parts of my own experience as a gay woman and as a marriage equality advocate in the United States.2) Who is Tracy Hollister and why is she qualified to write this book?I am a long-time marriage equality advocate with a passion for helping people better understand us LGBTQ people - who we are and why we want to marry. I have witnessed significant and tragic misunderstandings of us over the years, which is typical in a world in which there are few authorities who provide reliable and easily accessible information about LGBTQ people.My commitment to this issue is strong. After 9 years of blogging, speaking and organizing interfaith projects to raise awareness and support for marriage equality, I resigned from my well-paying, full-time job to volunteer full-time to coordinate 33 phone banks and oppose my state’s (North Carolina) anti-marriage equality amendment in 2012. I then moved to New York City to work for Marriage Equality USA, working on five state marriage campaigns and then educational and story-telling programs. I know what makes a good story and how to inspire people to share their stories.I have a solid understanding of what research confirms: the more people get to know LGBTQ people, the more they understand us and support our equal treatment in society. One of the most effective ways to bridge the gap in understanding - and appeal to people’s hearts - is to share stories. Stories are the shortest distance between two people.Throughout my 11 years as an advocate and 18 years as an openly gay woman, I have many stories to tell of my own!  In the form of flashbacks triggered from others’ stories, I will share these experiences - adding an additional personal dimension to the book.  Some of my most interesting stories come from my “close encounters” with religious conservatives, including attending their panel discussions as well as direct interactions with them through confrontations -- and then later transformation conversations, co-authoring articles, and co-hosting living room conversations. As an example, you can read about Mormons and LGBTQ people bonding in Utah living room in the following article: www.tinyurl.com/huffpo-dialoguePlease check out and like my author page:  facebook.com/HeartWonJourneysI got the chance to tell why and how I got involved in marriage equality between  2004 to 2014  in this podcast: http://tinyurl.com/tracy-advocacy-historyPart of my journey in North Carolina is also included in the documentary on the humanity of people from both sides of  the debate: ""One: A Story of Love and Equality.""

<p>A book to be published by The New Press in 2016</p>
<p><i>(en español abajo -  et maintenant en francais!)</i></p> <p>Imagine Yankee Stadium packed to the gills.  Now imagine up to five times that many people stolen at birth and sold into adoption, their birth certificates altered to hide the crime. If victims associations are right that's what happened in Spain. And so far the evidence seems to confirm it:  tens of thousands of newborns snatched from their birth parents over a period spanning more than half a century. </p>
<p>The numbers are astounding. What makes the story all the more incredible is that the century we're talking about is the twentieth. </p>
<p>The culprits? Doctors, nurses, nuns, priests, and hospital administrators. The motive? Ideology at first, then cold cash. </p>
<p>It began during Spain's Civil War in the 1930s, when the fascist victors and the Catholic Church deemed leftists mothers unfit for parenthood. The modus operandi at the time was to forcibly take their babies away. Women who protested got jail time or they got shot. </p>
<p>By the 1950s, the ""red scare"" was over, but the baby-stealing continued.  Because perpetrators realized there was money to be made at it if you were clever enough. The thieves, the authority figures running maternity wards, learned to target young, vulnerable women, telling them their newborn babies had died. Distraught mothers were told to go home, rest and make more babies. Those who protested were threatened with a stay in the mental ward. Sometimes the grieving women were shown a fetus kept on ice to quell suspicions. </p>
<p>This went on into the 1990s, more than a decade after Spain had transitioned from dictatorship to democracy. </p>
<p>Today, with the fearsome shadow of Franco all but gone and with the advent of DNA testing, victims are coming forward by the thousands. They're demanding that the government investigate. But Spain, it seems, doesn't want to look too closely. The government's argument: the statute of limitations has expired. Presently more than 3,000 cases are before the courts, many backed by overwhelming evidence of wrong doing, but they're being shot down or shelved, one after the other. </p>
<p>Because there's a deeper fear at play for much of Spanish society. Spain's democracy rests on a ""pact of forgetting,"" an unwritten agreement accepted at Franco's death that crimes under his rule would not be investigated.  No digging up of mass graves, no prosecutions, no truth and reconciliation committees. And no poking into the theft of babies. Spain's transition was peaceful. But the cost has been high.</p>
<p>Activists, lawyers, and victims believe international pressure is the last hope to spur Spanish officials to action. I believe they're right. To date the ""foreign"" press has covered the issue (myself included, for PRI's The World), but no one has written a thoroughly investigated, compelling book on the matter in English, brought out by a publisher with a strong reputation and the marketing power to attract the appropriate attention. </p>
<p>I have the publisher lined up and on board: The New Press, an established and well-respected independent publisher in New York. But I still need help in <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">bringing this story to light, in getting the wheels of justice spinning.  By justice I mean separated children and their parents having the chance to reconnect and the thieves and their accomplices being brought to trial</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is shaping up to be the largest baby-trafficking scandal of contemporary times. As I investigate and write I'll keep you up to date with detailed posts, including photos and interview excerpts at <a href=""http://www.medium.com@ghadden"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://medium.com/@ghadden</a>. If this book helps uncover the truth, you can be proud to have been a part of that. </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Ask</h3> <p>We are seeking $24,000 dollars. This is for the nuts-and-bolts financing of the travel-related expenses as I investigate for this book.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>I need to take around thirty to thirty five trips around Spain (including to the Canary Islands and the North African enclaves). On these trips I'll be doing all the legwork prior to writing: interviewing people in person, digging through archives, following up on and uncovering new leads, persuading those people less-than-willing to talk, corroborating versions of events, and more. To wit, all the stuff you can't do over the phone or online.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective a typical three-day trip from Barcelona, where I live, to Madrid, costs about $700 including train or airfare, hotel (low cost), meals (street food) and local transportation costs. Trips farther afield will cost more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The New Press has offered modest seed money, and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I do have assignments in radio and TV to keep me and my family afloat. But I'm a freelancer; all the time I put into this book is time during which I will not be earning a penny elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Thanks</span><br/></p>
<p>Since this is a book project, the most heartfelt thanks I can offer you is a dedicated and signed copy of the work prior to publication.  Anyone who chips in $50 or more gets one in the mail. I'll even hug it first.</p>
<p>For those who give $100 or more, I will donate 10% of that contribution to a fund I am creating to help offset the costly DNA tests necessary to join a growing database of searchers. This test can run anywhere from $120 to $600 dollars - a lot of money in crisis-hit Spain these days. Many people don't sign up to search for this very reason.</p>
<p>If we reach our financing goal, 50 cents of every additional dollar pledged will go to the same fund. In this way your contribution directly helps real people uncover their stolen pasts, and you'll be helping a country face up to its past as well. </p>

</i><p><b>À LA RECHERCHE DES ENFANTS VOLÉS D'ESPAGNE</b></p>
<p><b>Trois générations de disparus, et les parents qui les ont perdus en quête de retrouvailles et de réponses. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>L’HISTOIRE</b></p>
<p>Imaginez le Stade de France plein à craquer (85 000 personnes). Imaginez maintenant jusqu’à trois fois plus de personnes, toutes volées à leur naissance et vendues à l’adoption, leurs actes de naissance falsifiés pour dissimuler le crime. Si l'on donne raison aux associations de victimes, voilà ce qui se sera déroulé en Espagne pendant plus de cinquante ans. Jusqu’à présent, les preuves paraissent accablantes : Des dizaines de milliers de bébés enlevés à leurs parents biologiques au cours d'un demi-siècle.</p>
<p>Les chiffres sont renversants. Mais ce qui rend l'histoire encore plus incroyable, c'est qu'elle a eu lieu au vingtième siècle. </p>
<p>Les coupables? Médecins, infirmières, religieuses, prêtres et fonctionnaires du système de santé. La raison? Dans un premier temps, l'idéologie. Puis, très vite, l'argent. </p>
<p>L'affaire commence pendant la guerre civile espagnole dans les années trente: Le fascisme alors victorieux et l'église catholique jugent les mères républicaines indignes du droit de parenté. Le mode opératoire est dès lors de leur retirer leurs nouveaux nés de force. Les femmes qui se plaignent sont emprisonnées ou tuées. </p>
<p>Dans les années 50, le «Red Scare» pourtant révolu, le vol de bébés continue, tant il était lucratif. Les coupables, les figures d'autorité qui géraient les maternités, s'en prennent aux femmes jeunes et vulnérables, leur annonçant que leurs nouveau-nés ont trouvé la mort. Les mères en détresse sont renvoyées chez elle, on leur suggère de prendre du repos et de retenter l’acte de procréation. Celles qui protestent sont menacées d’enfermement en asile. Si elles insistent trop, la vue d'un fœtus congelé étouffe rapidement leurs méfiances. </p>
<p>Ceci continua jusque dans les années 90, plus d'une décennie après que l'Espagne démocratique soit sortie des mains de la dictature. </p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, l'ombre redoutable de Franco a bien disparue, et l'avènement des tests ADN permet de faire entendre des dizaines de milliers de victimes. Celles-ci exigent que le gouvernement enquête. Mais force est de constater que l'Espagne refuse de regarder cette affaire de trop près. Pour le Gouvernement, trop d'années ont passé, les crimes ont expiré. À l'heure actuelle, il y a plus de trois mille cas dans les tribunaux, la plupart présentant des preuves accablantes.Tous sont classés sans suite, ou restent en attente indéfiniment.</p>
<p>Car il existe en Espagne un mal profond pour une grande partie de la société. La démocratie espagnole est en effet basée sur le ""pacte du silence"", un accord tacite, passé à la mort de Franco, s'assurant que les crimes de la dictature ne seraient pas étudiés. Aucune fosse commune ne fut creusée, aucun jugement n'eut lieu, aucun comité de vérité et de réconciliation ne fut crée. Aucune allusion à la question des enfants volés ne fut permise. La transition démocratique fut pacifique et sans violence. Mais à quel prix ?</p>
<p>Militants, avocats et victimes estiment que l'attention internationale est le dernier espoir pour que les autorités espagnoles prennent des mesures et enquêtent. Je le pense aussi. Jusqu'à présent, la presse «étrangère» a couvert la question (moi-même inclus pour The World, Public Radio International), mais personne n'a écrit un livre convaincant doté d'une profonde investigation journalistique, en anglais, et publié par une maison d'édition digne de confiance ayant la capacité de promouvoir convenablement ce pan de l’histoire. </p>
<p>Cette maison d’édition est prête et n’attend plus que moi : The New Press, une maison indépendante établie et respectée à New York, supporte le projet. Mais j'ai encore besoin d'aide pour publier mon récit et espérer mettre la Justice en marche, afin de réunir les victimes et de juger leurs agresseurs. </p>
<p>Cette affaire s'annonce comme le plus gros trafic d'enfants de notre siècle. Au fil de mes recherches et de mon travail d’écriture, je vous tiendrai informés avec des annonces et des écrits détaillés, y compris des photos et des extraits d'interviews à l’adresse suivante : <a href=""http://www.medium.com/@ghadden"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.medium.com/@ghadden</a>. Si ce livre venait à permettre de révéler la vérité, nous pourrons tous être fiers d'y avoir participé.</p>
<p><b>LA DEMANDE</b></p>
<p>Nous recherchons actuellement 24 000 $ (18750 Euros environ), montant nécessaire pour couvrir les frais de déplacement lors de mes recherches pour le livre. </p>
<p>Je vais devoir faire 30 à 35 voyages en Espagne, y compris dans les îles Canaries, Ceuta et Melilla. Au cours de ces deplacements, je ferai tout le travail qui précède l'écriture du livre lui-même: interviewer les principaux acteurs, dépouiller les archives, rechercher et poursuivre de nouvelles pistes, convaincre les gens qui émettent des réserves a témoigner, corroborer les événements et les témoignages, et plus encore. En bref, tout ce qu'un journaliste ne peut pas faire par téléphone ou internet. </p>
<p>À titre d'exemple, un déplacement à Madrid depuis Barcelone (ou je réside), s'élève généralement autour de $700 (550 euros). Ceci comprend le transport en train ou avion, le logement dans un hotel low-cost, les repas ainsi que les frais de transports une fois sur place (bus, train régionaux...).</p>
<p>The New Press a offert un capital initial modeste, je travaille par ailleurs ponctuellement à la radio et à la télévision pour faire vivre ma famille. Étant indépendant, à mon compte, le temps que j'investirai dans ce livre sera du temps que je ne pourrai pas consacrer à mes autres activités génératrices de revenus.</p>
<p><b>LES REMERCIEMENTS</b></p>
<p>S'agissant d'un projet littéraire, les remerciements les plus sincères que je puisse offrir sont des exemplaires du livre lui-même, dédicacés et signés, avant publication. Tout ceux qui peuvent donner 50 $ (40 euros) ou plus en recevront donc un exemplaire par la poste. </p>
<p>Dans le cas des personnes donnant 100 $ (80 euros) ou plus, 10% des contributions iront à un fond que je suis en train de créer pour aider les victimes à payer des tests ADN coûteux et nécessaires pour rejoindre une base de données de personnes à la recherche de leur liens de parenté. Les tests peuvent coûter jusqu'à 600 $ (450 euros), ce qui représente une somme d'argent  certaine dans la conjoncture de crise économique actuelle en Espagne. Beaucoup de gens ne le font pas en raison du prix. </p>
<p>Si nous atteignons l'objectif de 24 000 $, la moitié de chaque dollar en plus sera également reversée au fonds créé. De cette façon, votre contribution aidera directement les personnes en recherche de leur passé volé. Et vous aiderez un pays tout entier à faire face à son Histoire. </p>
<p><b>LE DÉFI </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Il y a un défi dans ce projet, défi que j'affronte souvent dans mon travail : faire parler les responsables -  qu’ils soient médecins, infirmiers à la retraite, religieuses repenties, ou fonctionnaires. Mais c'est mon travail. Cela fait 20 ans que je suis journaliste, j'ai passé la majeure partie de ces années à la radio publique aux États-Unis. Je suis parfaitement bilingue, ayant vécu et travaillé en Espagne et en Amérique Latine au cours des 15 dernières années. Cette histoire sortira, avec ou sans le consentement des coupables.</p>
<p>Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement, je vous serais vraiment reconnaissant de partager cette campagne à travers vos réseaux sociaux et personnels. Nous avons besoin de toute l'aide disponible.</p>
<p>Un grand merci d'avance !</p>

</div></div>","The Theft of Saint Raymond's Babies
A book to be published by The New Press in 2016
(en español abajo -  et maintenant en francais!) Imagine Yankee Stadium packed to the gills.  Now imagine up to five times that many people stolen at birth and sold into adoption, their birth certificates altered to hide the crime. If victims associations are right that's what happened in Spain. And so far the evidence seems to confirm it:  tens of thousands of newborns snatched from their birth parents over a period spanning more than half a century. 
The numbers are astounding. What makes the story all the more incredible is that the century we're talking about is the twentieth. 
The culprits? Doctors, nurses, nuns, priests, and hospital administrators. The motive? Ideology at first, then cold cash. 
It began during Spain's Civil War in the 1930s, when the fascist victors and the Catholic Church deemed leftists mothers unfit for parenthood. The modus operandi at the time was to forcibly take their babies away. Women who protested got jail time or they got shot. 
By the 1950s, the ""red scare"" was over, but the baby-stealing continued.  Because perpetrators realized there was money to be made at it if you were clever enough. The thieves, the authority figures running maternity wards, learned to target young, vulnerable women, telling them their newborn babies had died. Distraught mothers were told to go home, rest and make more babies. Those who protested were threatened with a stay in the mental ward. Sometimes the grieving women were shown a fetus kept on ice to quell suspicions. 
This went on into the 1990s, more than a decade after Spain had transitioned from dictatorship to democracy. 
Today, with the fearsome shadow of Franco all but gone and with the advent of DNA testing, victims are coming forward by the thousands. They're demanding that the government investigate. But Spain, it seems, doesn't want to look too closely. The government's argument: the statute of limitations has expired. Presently more than 3,000 cases are before the courts, many backed by overwhelming evidence of wrong doing, but they're being shot down or shelved, one after the other. 
Because there's a deeper fear at play for much of Spanish society. Spain's democracy rests on a ""pact of forgetting,"" an unwritten agreement accepted at Franco's death that crimes under his rule would not be investigated.  No digging up of mass graves, no prosecutions, no truth and reconciliation committees. And no poking into the theft of babies. Spain's transition was peaceful. But the cost has been high.
Activists, lawyers, and victims believe international pressure is the last hope to spur Spanish officials to action. I believe they're right. To date the ""foreign"" press has covered the issue (myself included, for PRI's The World), but no one has written a thoroughly investigated, compelling book on the matter in English, brought out by a publisher with a strong reputation and the marketing power to attract the appropriate attention. 
I have the publisher lined up and on board: The New Press, an established and well-respected independent publisher in New York. But I still need help in bringing this story to light, in getting the wheels of justice spinning.  By justice I mean separated children and their parents having the chance to reconnect and the thieves and their accomplices being brought to trial. 
This is shaping up to be the largest baby-trafficking scandal of contemporary times. As I investigate and write I'll keep you up to date with detailed posts, including photos and interview excerpts at https://medium.com/@ghadden. If this book helps uncover the truth, you can be proud to have been a part of that.    The Ask We are seeking $24,000 dollars. This is for the nuts-and-bolts financing of the travel-related expenses as I investigate for this book.  

I need to take around thirty to thirty five trips around Spain (including to the Canary Islands and the North African enclaves). On these trips I'll be doing all the legwork prior to writing: interviewing people in person, digging through archives, following up on and uncovering new leads, persuading those people less-than-willing to talk, corroborating versions of events, and more. To wit, all the stuff you can't do over the phone or online.
To put things in perspective a typical three-day trip from Barcelona, where I live, to Madrid, costs about $700 including train or airfare, hotel (low cost), meals (street food) and local transportation costs. Trips farther afield will cost more.

The New Press has offered modest seed money, and I do have assignments in radio and TV to keep me and my family afloat. But I'm a freelancer; all the time I put into this book is time during which I will not be earning a penny elsewhere. 
The Thanks
Since this is a book project, the most heartfelt thanks I can offer you is a dedicated and signed copy of the work prior to publication.  Anyone who chips in $50 or more gets one in the mail. I'll even hug it first.
For those who give $100 or more, I will donate 10% of that contribution to a fund I am creating to help offset the costly DNA tests necessary to join a growing database of searchers. This test can run anywhere from $120 to $600 dollars - a lot of money in crisis-hit Spain these days. Many people don't sign up to search for this very reason.
If we reach our financing goal, 50 cents of every additional dollar pledged will go to the same fund. In this way your contribution directly helps real people uncover their stolen pasts, and you'll be helping a country face up to its past as well. 

The Challenge

  
There is one obvious challenge here, and it's one I face a lot in my work: getting those responsible to talk - in this case whether it be a doctor, a former nurse, a repentant sister from a religious order, a clerk, or a courier.  But that's my job. I've been a reporter for 20 years, mostly in Public Radio (NPR, PRI). I'm fluent in Spanish, having lived and reported in Spain and in Latin America for the last 15 years. I can play softball or hardball with my subjects. Rest assured that this story will come out with or without the perpetrators' help.

If you're not in a position to contribute financially, I'd be very grateful if you could pass this campaign on through your social media connections.  A million thanks in advance!La Historia
Imagina el estadio de los Yankees completamente lleno (50,000 personas).
Ahora imagina hasta cinco veces mas personas, todas robadas al nacer y vendidas
en adopción, sus actas de nacimientos falsificadas para cubrir el crimen. Si
las asociaciones de víctimas tienen razón esto es lo que pasó en España. Y
hasta ahora las pruebas parecen confirmarlo: decenas de miles de recién nacidos
arrebatados de sus padres biológicos a lo largo de mas de medio siglo.
Las cifras asombran. Lo que hace la historia
aún mas increible es que el siglo en cuestión es el siglo veinte.
Los culpables? Médicos, enfermeras, monjas,
curas y funcionarios del sistema sanitario. El motivo? Al comienzo, ideologia.
Luego, dinero.

À LA RECHERCHE DES ENFANTS VOLÉS D'ESPAGNE
Trois générations de disparus, et les parents qui les ont perdus en quête de retrouvailles et de réponses. 


L’HISTOIRE
Imaginez le Stade de France plein à craquer (85 000 personnes). Imaginez maintenant jusqu’à trois fois plus de personnes, toutes volées à leur naissance et vendues à l’adoption, leurs actes de naissance falsifiés pour dissimuler le crime. Si l'on donne raison aux associations de victimes, voilà ce qui se sera déroulé en Espagne pendant plus de cinquante ans. Jusqu’à présent, les preuves paraissent accablantes : Des dizaines de milliers de bébés enlevés à leurs parents biologiques au cours d'un demi-siècle.
Les chiffres sont renversants. Mais ce qui rend l'histoire encore plus incroyable, c'est qu'elle a eu lieu au vingtième siècle. 
Les coupables? Médecins, infirmières, religieuses, prêtres et fonctionnaires du système de santé. La raison? Dans un premier temps, l'idéologie. Puis, très vite, l'argent. 
L'affaire commence pendant la guerre civile espagnole dans les années trente: Le fascisme alors victorieux et l'église catholique jugent les mères républicaines indignes du droit de parenté. Le mode opératoire est dès lors de leur retirer leurs nouveaux nés de force. Les femmes qui se plaignent sont emprisonnées ou tuées. 
Dans les années 50, le «Red Scare» pourtant révolu, le vol de bébés continue, tant il était lucratif. Les coupables, les figures d'autorité qui géraient les maternités, s'en prennent aux femmes jeunes et vulnérables, leur annonçant que leurs nouveau-nés ont trouvé la mort. Les mères en détresse sont renvoyées chez elle, on leur suggère de prendre du repos et de retenter l’acte de procréation. Celles qui protestent sont menacées d’enfermement en asile. Si elles insistent trop, la vue d'un fœtus congelé étouffe rapidement leurs méfiances. 
Ceci continua jusque dans les années 90, plus d'une décennie après que l'Espagne démocratique soit sortie des mains de la dictature. 
Aujourd'hui, l'ombre redoutable de Franco a bien disparue, et l'avènement des tests ADN permet de faire entendre des dizaines de milliers de victimes. Celles-ci exigent que le gouvernement enquête. Mais force est de constater que l'Espagne refuse de regarder cette affaire de trop près. Pour le Gouvernement, trop d'années ont passé, les crimes ont expiré. À l'heure actuelle, il y a plus de trois mille cas dans les tribunaux, la plupart présentant des preuves accablantes.Tous sont classés sans suite, ou restent en attente indéfiniment.
Car il existe en Espagne un mal profond pour une grande partie de la société. La démocratie espagnole est en effet basée sur le ""pacte du silence"", un accord tacite, passé à la mort de Franco, s'assurant que les crimes de la dictature ne seraient pas étudiés. Aucune fosse commune ne fut creusée, aucun jugement n'eut lieu, aucun comité de vérité et de réconciliation ne fut crée. Aucune allusion à la question des enfants volés ne fut permise. La transition démocratique fut pacifique et sans violence. Mais à quel prix ?
Militants, avocats et victimes estiment que l'attention internationale est le dernier espoir pour que les autorités espagnoles prennent des mesures et enquêtent. Je le pense aussi. Jusqu'à présent, la presse «étrangère» a couvert la question (moi-même inclus pour The World, Public Radio International), mais personne n'a écrit un livre convaincant doté d'une profonde investigation journalistique, en anglais, et publié par une maison d'édition digne de confiance ayant la capacité de promouvoir convenablement ce pan de l’histoire. 
Cette maison d’édition est prête et n’attend plus que moi : The New Press, une maison indépendante établie et respectée à New York, supporte le projet. Mais j'ai encore besoin d'aide pour publier mon récit et espérer mettre la Justice en marche, afin de réunir les victimes et de juger leurs agresseurs. 
Cette affaire s'annonce comme le plus gros trafic d'enfants de notre siècle. Au fil de mes recherches et de mon travail d’écriture, je vous tiendrai informés avec des annonces et des écrits détaillés, y compris des photos et des extraits d'interviews à l’adresse suivante : www.medium.com/@ghadden. Si ce livre venait à permettre de révéler la vérité, nous pourrons tous être fiers d'y avoir participé.
LA DEMANDE
Nous recherchons actuellement 24 000 $ (18750 Euros environ), montant nécessaire pour couvrir les frais de déplacement lors de mes recherches pour le livre. 
Je vais devoir faire 30 à 35 voyages en Espagne, y compris dans les îles Canaries, Ceuta et Melilla. Au cours de ces deplacements, je ferai tout le travail qui précède l'écriture du livre lui-même: interviewer les principaux acteurs, dépouiller les archives, rechercher et poursuivre de nouvelles pistes, convaincre les gens qui émettent des réserves a témoigner, corroborer les événements et les témoignages, et plus encore. En bref, tout ce qu'un journaliste ne peut pas faire par téléphone ou internet. 
À titre d'exemple, un déplacement à Madrid depuis Barcelone (ou je réside), s'élève généralement autour de $700 (550 euros). Ceci comprend le transport en train ou avion, le logement dans un hotel low-cost, les repas ainsi que les frais de transports une fois sur place (bus, train régionaux...).
The New Press a offert un capital initial modeste, je travaille par ailleurs ponctuellement à la radio et à la télévision pour faire vivre ma famille. Étant indépendant, à mon compte, le temps que j'investirai dans ce livre sera du temps que je ne pourrai pas consacrer à mes autres activités génératrices de revenus.
LES REMERCIEMENTS
S'agissant d'un projet littéraire, les remerciements les plus sincères que je puisse offrir sont des exemplaires du livre lui-même, dédicacés et signés, avant publication. Tout ceux qui peuvent donner 50 $ (40 euros) ou plus en recevront donc un exemplaire par la poste. 
Dans le cas des personnes donnant 100 $ (80 euros) ou plus, 10% des contributions iront à un fond que je suis en train de créer pour aider les victimes à payer des tests ADN coûteux et nécessaires pour rejoindre une base de données de personnes à la recherche de leur liens de parenté. Les tests peuvent coûter jusqu'à 600 $ (450 euros), ce qui représente une somme d'argent  certaine dans la conjoncture de crise économique actuelle en Espagne. Beaucoup de gens ne le font pas en raison du prix. 
Si nous atteignons l'objectif de 24 000 $, la moitié de chaque dollar en plus sera également reversée au fonds créé. De cette façon, votre contribution aidera directement les personnes en recherche de leur passé volé. Et vous aiderez un pays tout entier à faire face à son Histoire. 
LE DÉFI 


Il y a un défi dans ce projet, défi que j'affronte souvent dans mon travail : faire parler les responsables -  qu’ils soient médecins, infirmiers à la retraite, religieuses repenties, ou fonctionnaires. Mais c'est mon travail. Cela fait 20 ans que je suis journaliste, j'ai passé la majeure partie de ces années à la radio publique aux États-Unis. Je suis parfaitement bilingue, ayant vécu et travaillé en Espagne et en Amérique Latine au cours des 15 dernières années. Cette histoire sortira, avec ou sans le consentement des coupables.
Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement, je vous serais vraiment reconnaissant de partager cette campagne à travers vos réseaux sociaux et personnels. Nous avons besoin de toute l'aide disponible.
Un grand merci d'avance !",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
The Impact</h3>
<p>
Many of the chapters in this book were
road tested with real people. Their response to Rhenda’s sharing
prompted her to write more and share more. Like the person on the
beach throwing stranded starfish into the ocean Rhenda can only
personally touch the lives of a few. Publishing this book and
distributing it to a wide audience will help many seniors be up when
their world is down. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone knows a senior, cares for a
senior, is a senior, or will be a senior and therefore can benefit
from reading this book. The seniors who have participated in Rhenda’s
discussion groups describe the value for them and state their
appreciation for their opportunity to experience a fulfilling
exchange of thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>
One discussion group participant stated,
“My beautiful mother and I learned many inspiring lessons from
Rhenda’s readings. She gave us hope in the future after losing my
dad, and mom moving to an independent facility. Mom knows she is not
alone and looks forward to each day thanks to Rhenda’s love and
support. I am confident that her new book will be inspiring to young
and old and look forward to it being published.”</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
<p>
Publishing a book requires the time to
write it and edit it but requires less effort to take the writings
and create a printed book. Hooray for printing on demand. But a book
can only be valuable when read and acted upon. Before a book can be
read a person must become aware of it and have reason to pick it up
and spend time with it. Our biggest challenges involves getting the
book into the possession of the many who will benefit from reading
it. Rhenda’s experience as a nurse encouraging patients with
depression and anxiety coupled with her success using the contents of
the book to lead discussion groups demonstrate her ability and the
power of the book to touch and change lives.</p>
<p>
We will use the book as a text and
guideline while conducting discussion groups at retirement
residences, senior centers, or anywhere we can gather a group of
seniors to talk about the challenges of being old and how to meet
these challenges with hope. The discussion groups will make people
aware of “Voices From My Heart” and give many the opportunity own
their own copy.</p>
<h3>
Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>
More important than financial
contribution we need help getting the word out that this book exists.
This is easy. Tell your friends and family about it. Ask your friends
and family to tell their friends and family about the book. Like us
on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter, Youtube, and Google+.  Register to
receive our blogs and eventually our magazine. We are not looking for
secret agents. We need <b>LOUD</b>
and boisterous agents. If you know them, tell them.</p>
<p>Indiegogo
has social sharing tools available. Use them. As we generate a large
interest in our publishing project, Indiegogo will be able to
increase their publicizing of our campaign. We will need their extra
push to take this to the largest possible success.

Risks & Challenges

Publishing a book requires the time to
write it and edit it but requires less effort to take the writings
and create a printed book. Hooray for printing on demand. But a book
can only be valuable when read and acted upon. Before a book can be
read a person must become aware of it and have reason to pick it up
and spend time with it. Our biggest challenges involves getting the
book into the possession of the many who will benefit from reading
it. Rhenda’s experience as a nurse encouraging patients with
depression and anxiety coupled with her success using the contents of
the book to lead discussion groups demonstrate her ability and the
power of the book to touch and change lives.

guideline while conducting discussion groups at retirement
residences, senior centers, or anywhere we can gather a group of
seniors to talk about the challenges of being old and how to meet
these challenges with hope. The discussion groups will make people
aware of “Voices From My Heart” and give many the opportunity own
their own copy.

Other Ways You Can Help

More important than financial
contribution we need help getting the word out that this book exists.
This is easy. Tell your friends and family about it. Ask your friends
and family to tell their friends and family about the book. Like us
on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter, Youtube, and Google+.  Register to
receive our blogs and eventually our magazine. We are not looking for
secret agents. We need LOUD
and boisterous agents. If you know them, tell them.
Indiegogo
has social sharing tools available. Use them. As we generate a large
interest in our publishing project, Indiegogo will be able to
increase their publicizing of our campaign. We will need their extra
push to take this to the largest possible success.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Campaign In Brief</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am an independent author, blogger, and historian as well as a lifelong Space Opera fan- Western and Eastern alike who is tired of the lack of quality Space Opera coming out of Hollywood, disappointed with recent Japanese releases, and decided to do something about it.</li>
<li>This campaign is to help me hire the professional help I require to finish the first book in a nine book series, and doing so guarantees that this book will be published. It will be for sale at Amazon for Kindle and then made available in paperback via Print On Demand- but you'll get it before it goes on sale.</li>
<li>While this campaign is for the first book specifically, every additional book in the series can also be guaranteed to be published if there is sufficient support for this campaign now, as I can then focus on getting them out as fast as I can manage- and backers get them first.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I need to hire an editor, get the cover done, and get the final manuscript formatted for publication. Your backing makes this happen. You get the ebook in MOBI or EPUB, and print versions will be sent ASAP.</li>
<li><strong>For every $1K past the goal, you guarantee that the next book will be published because I will be able to get the help required to make it happen (up to $9K). Starting at $10K I can talk additional merchandise, art books, a RPG sourcebook, and hardcover options.</strong></li>
<li>If the initial goal is not met, YOU LOSE NOTHING! Funds otherwise are used for the help aforementioned (editors, artists) and improving my tools so I can get more done faster.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>No one's ever attempted a Space Opera like this. Real Robots, Super Robots, Knights with Laser Swords, Space Battleships fighting fleet actions by the thousands, heroes you can believe in, heroines that inspire you, villains most vile, a galactic civilization that isn't an empire or a republic- but instead a galaxy of kingdoms guided by a single Church, and the monsters that would undo it just to spite their creator. You have to play Super Robot Wars to get anything close to it.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reading and watching a lot of the material going into this is nice, but the scholarly training I underwent in graduate school--where I broke down the critical events of world history by looking at who did what to whom, where, when, how, and why--is the key to making this a viable thing. The rest is up to my prowess as a storyteller, something else I learned to do in my university days.</li>
<li>This is something that can't be told; you have to see it. There will be excerpts posted over the campaign's duration; read those and see for yourself if you think I've got what it takes to pull this off.</li>

<h3> Thanks so much:)</h3>
<p>I'm going to give thanks in advance because I really believe in this story.  My name is Kate Thompson and I have a background in theatre, acting, directing, song writing and as a performing artist, but I am also a mother of thirteen children.  I never intended to adopt nine children, but, they came two, by two, literally.  We have three sets of twins who have kept me very busy.  Then, we are asked to get in the middle of a broken adoption of a young man, who we knew had very large issues.</p>
<p> Cutting this story short, he ended up back in his native country, illegally, and was sent back to starvation, and primitive conditions that were extremely hard for a young person who had been raised in the United States for the last four or five years of his life.</p>
<p>He didn't speak his native language, and was not educated in climbing co-conut trees, or catching fish with his bare hands to survive.  Then, add a dose of maleria, some bugs cut out of his feet with sharpened bamboo, not once but three times, and Friday was sure he was not equipped to survive the interior of Liberia.</p>
<p>Over the last sixteen years I have seen many cases of child abuse, and neglect.  We have fostered over 50 children, and I am an avid advocate of what I call the ""Lost"" children.  This story needs to be told and I hope and pray you will help me publish this story to raise awareness on this painful subject.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have done the research and to get this book total design, which includes art work for covers, editing, layout and marketing it's gonna be about $4,500.  Then there are reviews for the book, which I found out cost a few bucks or so.  Just kidding, more than a few bucks!  Then there is the cost of setting up E-books and downloads for Kindle, Nook and IPad.  And on top of that, I need hard copies to be able sell when hopefully (you!) will engage me to speak, and give a concert at the venue of your choice.  House concerts are fun guys!!  I will also be giving away downloads of my CD ""Broken Hearts And Broken Wings""</p>

My name is Matthew Gallant and I'm pro-worker. I'm also, on a basic level, angered by the lack of integrity displayed by the lawmakers in Wisconsin, trying to bust unions under the guise of budgetary needs, but then when push comes to shove getting it passed as a non-budgetary measure.


The Impact
I'm sure you can imagine the impact of 20,000 vuvuzelas outside Wisconsin's capital. That is why you are here.

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The Comité de Madres (Co-Madres, Committee of Mothers) is a human rights organization formed in the mid-1970’s. Co-Madres was founded to aid the victims and families of disappearances, murders, and political imprisonment from 1977 through the 1990s. Their testimonies can teach us about the real cost of war and the strength of the human spirit in the face of gross disregard for the basic human rights of life and liberty.</p>

<p>After meeting members of Co-Madres briefly as part of a language and culture exchange, we felt called to respond to their suggestion that though their history remained unwritten, “perhaps one day one of you will come back and help us write it.” We have visited with them three times and gathered over 20 hours of recorded interviews. We intend to make three trips this year to work on looking for a publisher and revising the content of the book with input from members of Co-Madres.</p>

<p>El Salvador, like many Central and South American countries, experiences an extreme dichotomy between the rich and the very poor.

The mid- to late-1970’s saw an increase of disappearances, assassinations, and the taking and torturing of political prisoners. For example, pre-teens traveling to their catechism class were at risk of capture and assassination for the mere offense of carrying the New Testament. Bodies were found in ditches, left as a warning to the other residents of a village lest they consider organizing a union in a local factory. Political prisoners were housed separately from other prisoners and had more limited access to food, water, medical attention. They were often denied a trial, visitation, or any supplies to be brought to them.</p>
<p>Civil war broke out in earnest in 1980, following the assassination of the widely loved Archbishop Oscar Romero, who spoke out in favor of the poor and against political violence.

Members of the Commission spent two years gathering facts about the human rights abuses during the war.  Just one week after the signing of the accords, a general amnesty was passed which covers all crimes related to the civil war.

<p>=============================<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is this project about?</b></p>
<p>This project is about documenting the life story of Su Beng, which I believe is an allegory of the struggle of Taiwan.  Su Beng is a nonagenarian Taiwan independence activist, former undercover Chinese Communist agent, would be assassin of Chiang Kai-shek, historian and author of the book, TAIWAN’S 400 YEARS OF HISTORY. This encyclopedic, 2000 page plus book, which took about 18 years to write, is the one of the first most comprehensive books on this topic. It has and still continues to influence generations of Taiwanese activists.</p>
<p>When I first heard all these tales of Su Beng, I was intrigued. I wondered what would motivate a man like this and I decided that I wanted to meet him. What began as a simple idea to tell a story based on the life of Su Beng, has grown into a project to document his life. Soon I came to understand that for him everything stems from the desire to make a difference in the world and to work for the greater good. His life’s work has been about the fight for social justice for the people of Taiwan through education, awareness and activism. Now nearly 95, Su Beng still maintains a very busy speaking schedule. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I’ve been working on this project since 2004</b> </p>
<p>From the beginning I was fortunate to have the advice and foresight of others who recommended that I audio and video record my interviews with Su Beng. Over time my video footage expanded as I realized the power of film to tell a story. When I left Taiwan in 2007 and returned to New York, I faced a few obstacles, namely: </p>
<p>1) the task of translating our interviews (from the mix of Taiwanese, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese that Su Beng speaks) into English </p>
<p>2) figuring out what do to with the hours and hours of video footage that I’d recorded and collected </p>
<p>3) understanding how the publishing industry works</p>
<p><b>I dealt with these three items by: </b></p>
<p>1) personally doing the translation of interviews myself with the help of several native Taiwanese speakers</p>
<p>2) toying with the thought of learning video editing, but concluding that this is not where my strengths and talents lie, so I have just continued to video record Su Beng on mini-DV format (now much of this footage still needs to be digitized) </p>
<p>3) attending writing conferences and enrolling in a class on how to write a book proposal for a work of nonfiction. I’ve also begun researching and compiling a list of agents to query about my book proposal</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I’ve had a lot of stops and starts along the way, but now I am committed to pushing this through to the finish line.</b></p>
<p>My main focus is to finish writing the biography of Su Beng. Everything else collected is secondary and will support the biography. I started off writing the biography in first person from Su Beng’s point of view, but I now believe that writing it in third person will make his story more accessible to a broader audience. This means that a great deal more research is going to have to be done in order to provide readers with greater historical facts and context, and different points of view. </p>
<p><b>In order to move the biography to completion, I have decided that I must create the opportunity and make the time to do this in Taiwan. </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why do I need to raise $15,000?</b></p>
<p>Everything that I have done thus far since 2004 has not required a major outlay of cash because I have used my personal resources. The main expense that I will have now is the cost of my airfare from New York to Taipei, and three months of living expenses. The next major expense is the cost of digitizing video footage recorded on mini-DV tapes. As one of the incentives of this campaign, Robin Adams will be working with me to create a short documentary film about Su Beng. Going forward, I’d like to stop recording on mini-DVD tapes, which will eliminate the cost and additional step of digitizing footage.

<p><b>What if I raise OVER $15,000?</b></p>
<p>I realize that three months is a pretty aggressive timeline since the biography is about 30 chapters long. Working on one chapter a week would work out to 30 weeks or seven and a half months. If I am able to raise up to $20,000 I could stay in Taipei for up to six months. Any additional funds raised beyond the initial goal also means that I will have more funds to pay for the cost of digitizing mini-DV video footage, i.e. the more funds, the more hours I will be able to digitize. I'll also need to purchase storage/back up space for the video footage and a new audio digital recorder. If enough additional funds are raised, I’d like to make the ebook of the newly revised English version of <i>Taiwan’s 400 Year History</i> available in print. </p>

MAKING HISTORY happen! 

Funding for MAKING HISTORY: The Story of Su Beng ended at $16,730, which is over 111% of the funding goal! I am so thrilled and amazed that funding actually went well past $16,000. 
With the extra funding a new computer will be purchased for Su Beng as a Lunar New Year gift from ALL of the contributors to the MAKING HISTORY campaign

I've noticed this need in the past when we've done some calls via Skype. I remember that his computer was old and we had a few technical issues during our Skype calls. With improved picture and sound quality it will be much easier for him to do Skype calls!

=============================

What is this project about?
This project is about documenting the life story of Su Beng, which I believe is an allegory of the struggle of Taiwan.  Su Beng is a nonagenarian Taiwan independence activist, former undercover Chinese Communist agent, would be assassin of Chiang Kai-shek, historian and author of the book, TAIWAN’S 400 YEARS OF HISTORY. This encyclopedic, 2000 page plus book, which took about 18 years to write, is the one of the first most comprehensive books on this topic. It has and still continues to influence generations of Taiwanese activists.
When I first heard all these tales of Su Beng, I was intrigued. I wondered what would motivate a man like this and I decided that I wanted to meet him. What began as a simple idea to tell a story based on the life of Su Beng, has grown into a project to document his life. Soon I came to understand that for him everything stems from the desire to make a difference in the world and to work for the greater good. His life’s work has been about the fight for social justice for the people of Taiwan through education, awareness and activism. Now nearly 95, Su Beng still maintains a very busy speaking schedule. 
*Chinese subtitles are available for the pitch video above. Press play and then






I’ve been working on this project since 2004 
From the beginning I was fortunate to have the advice and foresight of others who recommended that I audio and video record my interviews with Su Beng. Over time my video footage expanded as I realized the power of film to tell a story. When I left Taiwan in 2007 and returned to New York, I faced a few obstacles, namely: 
1) the task of translating our interviews (from the mix of Taiwanese, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese that Su Beng speaks) into English 
2) figuring out what do to with the hours and hours of video footage that I’d recorded and collected 
3) understanding how the publishing industry works
I dealt with these three items by: 
1) personally doing the translation of interviews myself with the help of several native Taiwanese speakers
2) toying with the thought of learning video editing, but concluding that this is not where my strengths and talents lie, so I have just continued to video record Su Beng on mini-DV format (now much of this footage still needs to be digitized) 
3) attending writing conferences and enrolling in a class on how to write a book proposal for a work of nonfiction. I’ve also begun researching and compiling a list of agents to query about my book proposal

I’ve had a lot of stops and starts along the way, but now I am committed to pushing this through to the finish line.
My main focus is to finish writing the biography of Su Beng. Everything else collected is secondary and will support the biography. I started off writing the biography in first person from Su Beng’s point of view, but I now believe that writing it in third person will make his story more accessible to a broader audience. This means that a great deal more research is going to have to be done in order to provide readers with greater historical facts and context, and different points of view. 
In order to move the biography to completion, I have decided that I must create the opportunity and make the time to do this in Taiwan. 

Why do I need to raise $15,000?
Everything that I have done thus far since 2004 has not required a major outlay of cash because I have used my personal resources. The main expense that I will have now is the cost of my airfare from New York to Taipei, and three months of living expenses. The next major expense is the cost of digitizing video footage recorded on mini-DV tapes. As one of the incentives of this campaign, Robin Adams will be working with me to create a short documentary film about Su Beng. Going forward, I’d like to stop recording on mini-DVD tapes, which will eliminate the cost and additional step of digitizing footage. So I also will need to purchase a new digital video camera. 


And finally, I'll have to cover the costs of fulfilling the crowdfunding campaign perks. This includes the actual cost of purchasing certain items and packaging and shipping them. Here are just a few of them:

<p><b>What’s so special about this novel?</b></p>
<p>This historical
fiction novel will help you understand why his legend has persevered. Cheryl
Strayed may have covered 1,100 miles, but she was only in the wilderness 3
months, Christopher McCandles didn't survive 100 days in the wild. Everett
Ruess traveled deep into the southwest, covering thousands of miles through
canyons and deserts, and he did it for four years.</p>
<p>I
would describe him as a cross between Walt Whitman and a young Indiana Jones.
Eighty years after he vanished his disappearance remains one of the biggest
mysteries of the southwest. All we have of Everett today is a collection of his
letters called <i>A Vagabond for Beauty</i>,
and some of his artwork, yet these fragments have inspired a huge cult
following. </p>
<p>When
I first read about Ruess I identified with him right away. I know what it’s
like to be a starving artist and to feel this busy world doesn’t allow time for
the worship of beauty. I’ve also been an adrenaline junky most of my life and
crawled through jungles and ruins wherever I went. I’ve been to many of the
places he visited, and climbed through the brush until I was covered with
scratches and exhausted, and the memory of it fills me with joy.</p>
<p>There
are at least a dozen books written about Everett Ruess, but almost all are
historical and try to prove what happened to him. I’m much more concerned with
how he lived, not how he died, that’s why I prefer historical fiction. I used
his letters as a compass and created scenes around them, then tried to pull out
his poetic, descriptive language and color things in. I feel I’ve captured his
experience. His nephew, Brian Ruess, wrote the introduction to the novel. In
it, he said, “In this work of fiction… I saw Everett for the first time, as he
might actually have been.”</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p><b>Why I’m seeking help</b></p>
<p>The money I'm requesting will be used to get the novel out there: press releases, contest entry fees, and publications like Review Direct. I began this campaign trying to raise $4,598, but my new goal is $2,000. That will cover the bare bones budget needed to get it in front of enough people to make a difference.</p><p>I've paid off my editor and the artist who did the cover, but can't seem to scrounge up enough for promotion. I've got a wife and three daughters and you all know how tough it is to get by these days. Thank you for any assistance you can give, be it financial, or promotional. Share this page, tell others about the book, and remember it when you walk through nature.</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1136475/files/20150107090047-PW_-_6_x_9_cover.jpg?1420650047"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Excerpts</b></p>

<p>(from Chapter Twenty-five)</p>
<p>In the distance Everett could barely make out
a fire burning at the base of a lonely butte and he headed for it. They had
been traveling for about five hours, crossing another plain under a waning moon
that slowly arced across the sky. </p>
<p>While they were
walking along, the fire had winked on and off, making him wonder at times if
he’d imagined it.</p>
<p>He slowed down when
he got closer. </p>
<p>A family of Navajos
stared at him wide-eyed from the fire. </p>
<p>The burros stepped
nervously behind him as Everett waved hello. An old woman, a middle-aged man he
assumed was her son, a younger women holding an infant, and a young buck in his
early teens, all stared back at him.</p>
<p>The old woman
painfully stood and walked to him. She seemed frail.</p>
<p>She welcomed him in
Diné. “<i>Yá'át'ééh ałní'íní</i>.” Good evening.</p>
<p>Everett slid off his
burro and stiffly walked to the fire.</p>
<p>He replied, “<i>Yá'át'ééh</i>.” Hello.</p>
<p>She motioned for him
to sit, and then went about preparing food for him. The younger woman moved to
help, but the grandmother indicated for her to stay put with a flick of her
wrist.</p>
<p>Everett felt a bit
uncomfortable watching her. It seemed like a lot of exertion for someone so
old, and she kept mumbling something in Diné that he couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>She served him black
coffee and burnt fry bread, but he was starving and he told her through
gestures how much he enjoyed it.</p>
<p>“<i>Ahéhee'</i>”
Thank you, he said.</p>
<p>Her son, a man with a
short, stocky body, appeared to be in his forties. He poured himself a cup of
coffee, and his round face held a placid expression as he watched Everett.</p>
<p>After he had eaten
the grandmother crouched beside Everett and said, “You help me on my journey.”</p>
<p>Everett smiled at
her, surprised that she knew any English. A lock of thin white hair blew across
her face as she stared at him.</p>
<p>She motioned for him
to lay down by the fire, and he nodded.</p>
<p> “<i>I<span>łhosh</span></i>.” Sleep, she said.</p>
<p>He nodded. He
retrieved his bedroll and set it down by the fire. Then he returned to the
burros, took off the saddle and kyacks, and rubbed them down before hobbling
them for the evening.</p>
<p>The family watched
everything he did, unblinkingly.</p>
<p>Everett returned to
the fire and lay down on his Navajo blanket. The older man leaned forward and
examined it, and then nodded and sat back. </p>
<p>When he closed his
eyes the old woman began to chant an ancient song.</p>
<p>He wanted to listen
to the age-old chant, but he was exhausted, and within minutes he was asleep.</p>
<p>When he woke in the
morning he was alone.</p>

<br/></div>","What’s so special about this novel?
This historical
fiction novel will help you understand why his legend has persevered. Cheryl
Strayed may have covered 1,100 miles, but she was only in the wilderness 3
months, Christopher McCandles didn't survive 100 days in the wild. Everett
Ruess traveled deep into the southwest, covering thousands of miles through
canyons and deserts, and he did it for four years.
I
would describe him as a cross between Walt Whitman and a young Indiana Jones.
Eighty years after he vanished his disappearance remains one of the biggest
mysteries of the southwest. All we have of Everett today is a collection of his
letters called A Vagabond for Beauty,
and some of his artwork, yet these fragments have inspired a huge cult
following. 
When
I first read about Ruess I identified with him right away. I know what it’s
like to be a starving artist and to feel this busy world doesn’t allow time for
the worship of beauty. I’ve also been an adrenaline junky most of my life and
crawled through jungles and ruins wherever I went. I’ve been to many of the
places he visited, and climbed through the brush until I was covered with
scratches and exhausted, and the memory of it fills me with joy.
There
are at least a dozen books written about Everett Ruess, but almost all are
historical and try to prove what happened to him. I’m much more concerned with
how he lived, not how he died, that’s why I prefer historical fiction. I used
his letters as a compass and created scenes around them, then tried to pull out
his poetic, descriptive language and color things in. I feel I’ve captured his
experience. His nephew, Brian Ruess, wrote the introduction to the novel. In
it, he said, “In this work of fiction… I saw Everett for the first time, as he
might actually have been.”
   
Why I’m seeking help
The money I'm requesting will be used to get the novel out there: press releases, contest entry fees, and publications like Review Direct. I began this campaign trying to raise $4,598, but my new goal is $2,000. That will cover the bare bones budget needed to get it in front of enough people to make a difference.I've paid off my editor and the artist who did the cover, but can't seem to scrounge up enough for promotion. I've got a wife and three daughters and you all know how tough it is to get by these days. Thank you for any assistance you can give, be it financial, or promotional. Share this page, tell others about the book, and remember it when you walk through nature.Excerpts
(from Chapter
One)
Everett sat in the shadow of a large spire of rock, painting the distant buttes as they glowed in the late afternoon sun. He shivered when he moved to dab his paintbrush, and paused when he realized the tip had frozen.A coyote cried out in the distance.He moved closer to the cold, sheer rock wall and wrapped himself in a thin blanket. I’ve got to get better blankets, he thought. He’d spent a few days getting to know the area, but it all seemed barren and inhospitable.Several hours later he woke in the night and looked up at the sky, glittering powerfully above him.The night was clear and perfectly still.He sat up and snapped his fingers and listened to the echo cracking off the rocks behind him.A shooting star slid across the sky.…
(from Chapter Twenty-five)
In the distance Everett could barely make out
a fire burning at the base of a lonely butte and he headed for it. They had
been traveling for about five hours, crossing another plain under a waning moon
that slowly arced across the sky. 
While they were
walking along, the fire had winked on and off, making him wonder at times if
he’d imagined it.
He slowed down when
he got closer. 
A family of Navajos
stared at him wide-eyed from the fire. 
The burros stepped
nervously behind him as Everett waved hello. An old woman, a middle-aged man he
assumed was her son, a younger women holding an infant, and a young buck in his
early teens, all stared back at him.
The old woman
painfully stood and walked to him. She seemed frail.
She welcomed him in
Diné. “Yá'át'ééh ałní'íní.” Good evening.
Everett slid off his
burro and stiffly walked to the fire.
He replied, “Yá'át'ééh.” Hello.
She motioned for him
to sit, and then went about preparing food for him. The younger woman moved to
help, but the grandmother indicated for her to stay put with a flick of her
wrist.
Everett felt a bit
uncomfortable watching her. It seemed like a lot of exertion for someone so
old, and she kept mumbling something in Diné that he couldn’t understand.
She served him black
coffee and burnt fry bread, but he was starving and he told her through
gestures how much he enjoyed it.
“Ahéhee'”
Thank you, he said.
Her son, a man with a
short, stocky body, appeared to be in his forties. He poured himself a cup of
coffee, and his round face held a placid expression as he watched Everett.
After he had eaten
the grandmother crouched beside Everett and said, “You help me on my journey.”
Everett smiled at
her, surprised that she knew any English. A lock of thin white hair blew across
her face as she stared at him.
She motioned for him
to lay down by the fire, and he nodded.
 “Iłhosh.” Sleep, she said.
He nodded. He
retrieved his bedroll and set it down by the fire. Then he returned to the
burros, took off the saddle and kyacks, and rubbed them down before hobbling
them for the evening.
The family watched
everything he did, unblinkingly.
Everett returned to
the fire and lay down on his Navajo blanket. The older man leaned forward and
examined it, and then nodded and sat back. 
When he closed his
eyes the old woman began to chant an ancient song.
He wanted to listen
to the age-old chant, but he was exhausted, and within minutes he was asleep.
When he woke in the
morning he was alone.

War has existed in one form or another since the dawn of human civilization, and before then, Elder terrors battled it out across this planet and this known universe in ways unimaginable. </p><p>It has always been a losing battle for our side since time began. Incidents like the Innsmouth raid, chronicled by H.P. Lovecraft, mere blips of victory against an insurmountable foe. Still we fight, against these incredible odds, in an unending nightmare, we fight, and why? For victory, for land, for a political ideal? No, mankind fights for survival. </p><p>Our authors, John Shirley, Mark Rainey, Wilum Pugmire, William Meikle, Tim Curran, Jeffrey Thomas and many others have gathered here to share war stories from the eternal struggle against the darkness. This book chronicles these desperate battles from across the ages, including Roman Britain, The American Civil War, World War Two, The Vietnam Conflict, and even into the far future.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/410803/files/20140304143413-front-600px.jpg?1393972453"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/496089/files/20140409102815-world-war-cthulhu-addons-header.jpg?1397064495"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Special add-ons are now available through the World War Cthulhu campaign! <b>Funders who have already pledged can add these to their reward packages</b>. <br/><br/></p><p>To purchase an add-on, simply click on the ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button at the top of the page.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and please subscribe to our free newsletter on DarkRegions.com for updates about the book.The world is at war against things that slink and gibber in the darkness, and titans that stride from world to world, sewing madness and death. War has existed in one form or another since the dawn of human civilization, and before then, Elder terrors battled it out across this planet and this known universe in ways unimaginable. It has always been a losing battle for our side since time began. Incidents like the Innsmouth raid, chronicled by H.P. Lovecraft, mere blips of victory against an insurmountable foe. Still we fight, against these incredible odds, in an unending nightmare, we fight, and why? For victory, for land, for a political ideal? No, mankind fights for survival. Our authors, John Shirley, Mark Rainey, Wilum Pugmire, William Meikle, Tim Curran, Jeffrey Thomas and many others have gathered here to share war stories from the eternal struggle against the darkness. This book chronicles these desperate battles from across the ages, including Roman Britain, The American Civil War, World War Two, The Vietnam Conflict, and even into the far future.Special add-ons are now available through the World War Cthulhu campaign!

A deal with a tentacled devil is required to save humanity, but will we really be saved?The Game Changers by Stephen Mark RaineyThe Vietnam War, a journey through a jungle of madness and death. What are brave men to do when their very own superiors have given their loyalty to things that should not breathe the same as us?White Feather by T.E.

 the War of Independence, a Privateer captain fights for his jaded soul’s redemption, or perhaps, destruction.To Hold Ye White Husk by W.H.

The Bullet and the Flesh by David Conyers & David Kernot
A modern day tale of horrors perpetrated by man against man. The use of 
child soldiers in Zimbabwe are not the worst things to be encountered as

Unbound 3) are forced to fight for justice and balance.Broadsword by William MeikleTwo soldiers mountaineer across mountain ranges during WWII, in an attempt to deal with a threat against the allies and the hated German’s.

We are as playthings to the gods in this tale, and again, Troy is to meet an unimaginable fate.The Sinking City by Konstantine ParadiasWarring factions use an unwitting man as their puppet in this tale, detailing a sinister journey to R’lyeh.

Para ello, luchará contra vientos y mareas, usando armas que rayan, a veces, entre lo más inverosímil y absurdo, entre lo más ingenuo y perverso, entre lo más real e irreal, con el único objetivo de llegar a un saneado y justo final.¿Quiénes?Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.Hoy te presentamos a Sergio Marín.Caído en las garras de la vida en Barcelona, residió con su familia en Sant Sadurní D’anoia. Pronto, regresarían a La Rioja donde, desde su más tierna infancia, comenzaría a nutrirse con poemas y canciones de Bob Dylan, Javier Krahe o Paco Ibáñez. Tras pasar por la Banda Municipal de Ezcaray tocando la trompeta, en la adolescencia consiguió una guitarra y comenzó a escribir canciones para luego tocarlas en grupos de amigos a modo de diversión, dando también pequeños conciertos de manera aficionada.Obrero en la industria del metal, a los veintiocho años canalizó sus inquietudes literarias escribiendo la novela corta Si la Luna no estuviera. Acto seguido se puso manos a la obra con Los poemas de Nicanor, habiéndose dado cuenta de que necesitaba escribir… y de que seguirá escribiendo.¿Por qué?Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:«Disfrutándose en cada paso, asciende los escalones de la vivienda planchándose la chaqueta con la mano que tiene libre.

</div></div>","GO TO RADICALANIMAL.NET FOR LATEST RESEARCHWHAT IS 'RADICAL ANIMAL'?(read my Guardian lead opinion piece launching project). RADICAL ANIMAL is a ""book-net"" - a full-length book-text combined with a social network - which explores how play and innovation can help us address the most urgent environmental challenges of our time. My name is Pat Kane, I'm a Glasgow-and-London-based writer, musician, activist and consultant. In 2004 I brought out a book called The Play Ethic, which celebrated the power and potential of play to transform both individuals and societies. But I realised about a year ago that the book had a serious omission. There was almost no consideration of climate change - and particularly how a low-carbon future challenged the creative, interactive lifestyles it described and prescribed.RADICAL ANIMAL began as an attempt to rectify that omission. I've been talking widely and reading deeply in the areas of neuroscience, evolutionary theory, networks, eco-economics, sustainability and many other areas, trying to answer some basic questions: 

How much does hyper-consumerism exploit that playful side of our human nature that loves novelty, pleasure and innovation? And:

Can we reconnect our creative selves to a new kind of lifestyle - one that pursues the active joys of making, sharing, crafting and collaborating?
In terms of getting this message out, I started going down the route I travelled before (long book, sharp agent, big publisher...) But I soon realised I'd have to do things differently, in the era of social media, print-on-demand and the power of community involvement - not to mention the consideration of treading lightly upon the planet's resources.So I've come up with the idea of a ""book-net"" as a way both to get RADICAL ANIMAL written, and involve a community of stakeholders in its creation, development and future. WHAT IMPACT WILL ""RADICAL ANIMAL"" HAVE ON THE WIDER WORLD?
Firstly I want RADICAL ANIMAL to shift some of the basic discussions that we're having about our response to climate change. I think that green activism is great at showing how our developed-world lifestyles will have to radically change as climate change begins to worsen (as it will now inevitably do). But they haven't done a great job in breaking through the complacency of all those currently locked into high-consumption living. Asking people to wear a hair-shirt won't do it - but showing how much hedonism and lasting satisfaction lies on the other side of the work-to-earn-to-consume civilisation might do. 
I think that talking about play is key in this: it's both an instantly familiar aspect of our own experience, but one that we also share with other natural creatures. Making a strong case for the enabling conditions of play - the combination of support and risk, of caring and freedom it involves - will bring us new insights into how we reshape our societies and economies, so we can support the kind of low-impact joy and conviviality that playful activities bring to our lives.

Secondly, I want RADICAL ANIMAL to be a network that gathers together best practice in creative, innovative and playful responses to the challenges of sustainability. I've built the basic site on the Ning platform because I want to support whatever active community springs up around the ideas in the book, and takes them forward into their own lives, organisations and localities. And thirdly - and most conventionally - I'd like RADICAL ANIMAL to be a really good book! But not one produced and consumed in the usual ways... I intend to use print-on-demand services like Lulu and Blurb to get the book out to people, if they want it in a traditional format. But I want to embrace the new e-book platforms like Amazon Kindle and iBooks, as well as other means of digital distribution. And if you feel interested enough to get involved at this early stage of the process, I want to try out a different, closer relationship between writer and reader.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Silicon Valley Stories: True stories about startup life  </i></p>
<p>My name is Adam Beguelin. I am a serial entrepreneur who has worked at and founded multiple successful Silicon Valley startups. Along the way I’ve managed to collect quite a few stories that, when I tell my friends and colleagues, I often hear: “You should write a book!” Silicon Valley Stories is that book:  a collection of  crazy, instructional, and hopefully entertaining stories from my time in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what really happens inside Silicon Valley startups, and it will instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for doing startups. Ultimately, this book can be used as a tool to help you navigate the startup world, or perhaps just reflect on the nature of work.</p>
<p>I've worked at seven Silicon Valley tech startups and co-founded four. I've had two exits, one IPO and one acquisition. That's almost a 30% hit rate, so not bad by Silicon Valley standards where conventional wisdom tells us that 9 out of 10 startups fail. People think that joining a startup is a surefire way to get rich. The odds are against you, but it does happen.</p>
<p>In this book you'll learn about what it's like to work at or found a tech startup and how that experience can change your life.  You'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s it like to take risks and see them pay off</li>
<li>What it’s like to have a failed or zombie startup</li>
<li>What people do if they win the startup lottery</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you're interested in the startup world or wonder what happens to those who are part of it.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Stories is a non-fiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs and potential founders who are looking at starting a company or are just curious about the world of work and leisure in Silicon Valley.</p>
<h3>The Book - Silicon Valley Stories</h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 Parts.</p>
<p><strong><i>Part 1: Pre Silicon Valley</i></strong> covers my life as a computer geek in the 80s as I navigated the upper echelons of the academic technology world. You’ll see how a certain willingness to take risks and keep an open mind lead me back and forth across the USA and even to Europe. In fact a chance meeting in Lisbon changed my life and landed me a job at Carnegie Mellon University.<br/><br/><strong><i>Part 2: Inktomi Days</i></strong> is about my time working at Inktomi, a Wall Street darling of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s. You’ll see what it’s like to interview at a startup and get an inside glimpse of what happens when a company goes through an IPO. What it’s like to ride a rocket ship startup as it takes off and then when it craters.<br/><br/><strong><i>Part 3: Truveo Days</i></strong> covers my second successful startup. Truveo was a perfect storm of tech, talent, and timing. You’ll see how things work when the planets align and a startup can execute in sync with what’s happening in the tech world and the market. You’ll also see an example of what happens to a promising young technology company after it’s absorbed into a large corporation.<br/><br/><strong><i>Part 4: Post Economic Life</i></strong> is about what happens when you no longer have to work for a living. I tried my hand at a few more startups, none of which made any money, but I learned some valuable lessons along the way. You’ll meet Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who can’t stop working and keep turning the startup crank. You’ll see how others were able to alter their focus and enjoy a more leisurely lifestyle, even though true success in retirement doesn't mean actually retiring.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Spring</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Dr. Beguelin is a Puerto Rico-based entrepreneur and investor. He began his career as a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University in 1992. In 1996, he joined Inktomi, an early pioneer in search and internet software, as Senior Scientist. Inktomi went public in 1998 and was later acquired by Yahoo in 2003. In 2004 Dr. Beguelin co-founded Truveo, where he was CTO. Truveo was one of the first a video search engines when video was just becoming prevalent on the internet. AOL acquired Truveo in 2006. Following the acquisition, he joined AOL as a Vice President of AOL Video. Since 2007, Dr. Beguelin has been a serial entrepreneur and angel investor.<br/><br/>Dr. Beguelin holds a Bachelors in Science from Emory University where he graduated summa cum laude. He received his Doctorate in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a founder of CMU Silicon Valley and holds 10 patents.<br/><br/>I’ve always been somewhat baffled by the purpose of life. I started off on the standard college path and rode that series of academic escalators all the way to a faculty position, without really thinking too much about it. I got off one escalator and hopped on another. When I made the jump to Silicon Valley it was a natural next step, joining a startup that was a university spin out. Once I was embedded in Silicon Valley I was witness to the life-changing impact startups can have on their employees. The startup game is super interesting, but so is what happens to the people who are involved. When they hit it big, how do they handle that? When they don’t, what happens to them next?<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Adam at <a href=""mailto:svstories@beguelin.com?subject=Silicon%20Valley%20Stories%20Book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SVStories@beguelin.com</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/beguelin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/beguelin</a>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nina Raman and I am the author of Everything You Wanted. I wrote this book because I wanted to share a story about growing up with a battle of perfection, but with a dark twist.<br/><br/>My hope is that in reading this book, you will discover that your desires are not wrong. They might turn out to be everything you wanted, or they might turn your life completely upside down. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to discover yourself and learn how your decisions have a massive effect on your life. I want this book to be a way for you to escape a world of your own and live through a group of teens who enter a whole new world of fear, mystery, and the unknown. </p>
<p>Wren Clements has spent her whole life trying to be perfect. As her high school career is about to come to an end, she realizes that what she wants more than her amazing grades, her numerous extracurriculars, and even more than her spot at UPenn, is to live like a normal teenager for one crazy, lawless night. She embarks on an evening filled with things she would never do... including a murder? Could this star student be the perfect suspect, or could this be the perfect crime?</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love relatable and diverse characters, juicy love stories, and a perfectly gruesome crime. Everything You Wanted speaks to teenagers and adults who want to grapple with perfection and desire vs. regret in a new way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that Everything You Wanted inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any regrets in life?</li>
<li>Are you willing to risk everything to fulfill a desire?</li>
<li>Are you happy with yourself, or want something someone else has?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing what truly matters to you, the battle of perfection, and personal growth will change us all for the better. </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About the Author</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nina Raman is a junior Management Information Systems major at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. Although her major is technical and she spends most of her time running clubs and meeting new people, she always makes time for her true love: writing. </span></h3>
<p><br/>Her dream since she was in 3rd grade was to always be an author. She’s been obsessed with storytelling for as long as she can remember, so it’s no question why she decided to write a book.

My name is Nina Raman and I am the author of Everything You Wanted. I wrote this book because I wanted to share a story about growing up with a battle of perfection, but with a dark twist.My hope is that in reading this book, you will discover that your desires are not wrong. They might turn out to be everything you wanted, or they might turn your life completely upside down. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to discover yourself and learn how your decisions have a massive effect on your life. I want this book to be a way for you to escape a world of your own and live through a group of teens who enter a whole new world of fear, mystery, and the unknown. 
Wren Clements has spent her whole life trying to be perfect. As her high school career is about to come to an end, she realizes that what she wants more than her amazing grades, her numerous extracurriculars, and even more than her spot at UPenn, is to live like a normal teenager for one crazy, lawless night. She embarks on an evening filled with things she would never do... including a murder? Could this star student be the perfect suspect, or could this be the perfect crime?
You will love this book if you love relatable and diverse characters, juicy love stories, and a perfectly gruesome crime. Everything You Wanted speaks to teenagers and adults who want to grapple with perfection and desire vs. regret in a new way.
Ultimately, I hope that Everything You Wanted inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

Do you have any regrets in life?
Are you willing to risk everything to fulfill a desire?
Are you happy with yourself, or want something someone else has?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing what truly matters to you, the battle of perfection, and personal growth will change us all for the better. 
What We Need & What You Get

This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this spring.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.
You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!


About the Author
Nina Raman is a junior Management Information Systems major at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. Although her major is technical and she spends most of her time running clubs and meeting new people, she always makes time for her true love: writing. 
Her dream since she was in 3rd grade was to always be an author. She’s been obsessed with storytelling for as long as she can remember, so it’s no question why she decided to write a book. Nina’s goal has always been to help people feel something like a connection, even if they don’t have one in real life. Characters are our friends, family, teachers, enemies, and lovers. She hopes that you will feel connected to a character or two, learn from their mistakes, and even make a few of your own. She wants you to not just read her story, but live in it.When Nina doesn’t have her nose in a book or is vigorously typing out the lines of her novel on her laptop, she loves meeting new people, exploring new places, trying new food, and hanging out with friends. And if she’s ever late (which she almost always is,) she most likely stopped to pet a dog. For more information, you can connect with Nina Raman at ninaraman00@gmail.com and at Instagram: @ninaramanwrites TikTok: @nina_raman Twitter: @nina_noodles1 LinkedIn: Nina Raman .

<h3>Que?</h3>
<p><strong>A distancia do espectador</strong> é unha primeira aproximación á narrativa. Como tal, sendo consciente dos tropezos habituais, e comprensibles, do principiante; estes asúmense na personalidade do protagonista, envolvéndoo nun xogo que remite a escenas familiares en compaña de personaxes que poden encaixar en certos arquetipos. Formando así a sensación do protagonista de caída no tópico, na parodia na que en ocasións semella verse.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nin intre intrascendentem, Mat, un rapaz aínda nese medio do camiño entre a adolescencia e o adulto ao que lle custa chegar e o desconcerta, decide deixarse de aprazamentos e atreverse a marchar da casa e do pobo que o viu medrar sen sorpresa. Á procura de algo que o motive, que o esperte do monótono. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ao longo da novela coñeceremos os personaxes e os lugares cos que se atopa o protagonista. O Lagon, un bar oculto e esquecido, onde son habituais Roman, o mariñeiro afastado do mar, e o pintor Erwan Joubert. Tamén ela estará alí. Na libraría Moustache encontrará as voces dos libros que agardan ser rescatados. Todos eles, cada un a seu xeito, marcarán a Mat e influirán no relato. Sempre a través das súas impresións, teremos unha idea dos seus pensamentos e da súa mirada. Por momentos fantasiosa e idealizadora, ás veces escéptica e desencantada.</p>
<h3>Quen?</h3>
<p><strong>Do Peirao</strong> é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionais pero de incuestionable calidade, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.</p>
<p>Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.</p>
<p>Hoxe presentámosvos a <strong>Javier Pereiro</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nado en 1990 en Lalín, logo de criarse en Agolada volve á súa vila natal, onde reside actualmente. Nos libros encontrou un lugar onde espertaban o interese e a paixón. Co paso das lecturas, cando xurdiu a necesidade de crear e expresarse, levárono á escrita como medio máis axeitado e que máis o motivaba. Dende o 2018 leva a libraría Vagalume de Lalín. Busca a voz na poesía e na narrativa co fin de encontrar algo que contar. Faino polo baixo, gardando no caixón que agora entreabre con A distancia do espectador.</p>
<h3>Por que?</h3>
<p>Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«A agulla foi descendendo, non tardaría en chegar á reserva e comezaba a sentirme canso. Quixen emular aos fuxitivos. Cando o fulgor duns faros asomaba polo retrovisor, erseguíndome, apertaba o volante e pisaba a fondo ata perdelos de vista e deixalos atrás, desaparecendo nunha curva. Se me alcanzaban, a persecución tornábase nunha carreira na que a seguinte sinal determinaba o vencedor cando un dos dous chegase a ela en cabeza. Perdín algunha, e era eu quen se quedaba vendo ir ao campión, afastándose na recta despexada e esvaecéndose diante dos meus ollos. Aqueles que conseguían adiantarme, sen entender e algo irados, pasaban a meu carón e miraban preguntando a que demo xogaba. Nunha desas albisquei o letreiro que indicaba a próxima saída e a estación de servizo.<br/>          Deteríame alí, era a metade do camiño e todo ía segundo o previsto. Eran finais de setembro, amencera sobre as oito e o sol ascendía e prometía o pulso dun verán que se resistía a marchar».</p>
<h3>Como?</h3>
<p>Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.</li>
<li>Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: A opción BACK IT é únicamente para realizar doazóns á edición, polo que non haberá comunicacións posteriores na procura de datos de envío... calquera das opcións válidas de reserva esixe cumplimentar formulario para poder servir o pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Ademais...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tempos difíciles, tamén nós os sufrimos, e é posible que non esteas en disposición de apoiarnos co teu mecenado nestes momentos... pero agardamos que se isto te chegou á alma, mesmo se talvez coñeces en persoa ao autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-orella... ) para que academos a nosa meta e <strong>Javier Pereiro</strong> vexa publicada a súa obra.</p>
<p>Grazas polo voso tempo.</p>

Á procura de algo que o motive, que o esperte do monótono. 
Ao longo da novela coñeceremos os personaxes e os lugares cos que se atopa o protagonista. O Lagon, un bar oculto e esquecido, onde son habituais Roman, o mariñeiro afastado do mar, e o pintor Erwan Joubert. Tamén ela estará alí. Na libraría Moustache encontrará as voces dos libros que agardan ser rescatados. Todos eles, cada un a seu xeito, marcarán a Mat e influirán no relato. Sempre a través das súas impresións, teremos unha idea dos seus pensamentos e da súa mirada. Por momentos fantasiosa e idealizadora, ás veces escéptica e desencantada.
Quen?
Do Peirao é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionais pero de incuestionable calidade, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.
Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.
Hoxe presentámosvos a Javier Pereiro.
Nado en 1990 en Lalín, logo de criarse en Agolada volve á súa vila natal, onde reside actualmente. Nos libros encontrou un lugar onde espertaban o interese e a paixón. Co paso das lecturas, cando xurdiu a necesidade de crear e expresarse, levárono á escrita como medio máis axeitado e que máis o motivaba. Dende o 2018 leva a libraría Vagalume de Lalín. Busca a voz na poesía e na narrativa co fin de encontrar algo que contar. Faino polo baixo, gardando no caixón que agora entreabre con A distancia do espectador.
Por que?
Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:
«A agulla foi descendendo, non tardaría en chegar á reserva e comezaba a sentirme canso. Quixen emular aos fuxitivos. Cando o fulgor duns faros asomaba polo retrovisor, erseguíndome, apertaba o volante e pisaba a fondo ata perdelos de vista e deixalos atrás, desaparecendo nunha curva. Se me alcanzaban, a persecución tornábase nunha carreira na que a seguinte sinal determinaba o vencedor cando un dos dous chegase a ela en cabeza. Perdín algunha, e era eu quen se quedaba vendo ir ao campión, afastándose na recta despexada e esvaecéndose diante dos meus ollos. Aqueles que conseguían adiantarme, sen entender e algo irados, pasaban a meu carón e miraban preguntando a que demo xogaba. Nunha desas albisquei o letreiro que indicaba a próxima saída e a estación de servizo.          Deteríame alí, era a metade do camiño e todo ía segundo o previsto. Eran finais de setembro, amencera sobre as oito e o sol ascendía e prometía o pulso dun verán que se resistía a marchar».
Como?
Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 880€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.

Tendo acceso ás galeradas de edición.
Recibindo un exemplar semanas antes da saída ao mercado da obra.
Aínda que, tamén poderías ver o teu nome nos agradecementos achegando un pouco máis.

Aviso para navegantes: A opción BACK IT é únicamente para realizar doazóns á edición, polo que non haberá comunicacións posteriores na procura de datos de envío... calquera das opcións válidas de reserva esixe cumplimentar formulario para poder servir o pedido.
Ademais...
Sabemos que son tempos difíciles, tamén nós os sufrimos, e é posible que non esteas en disposición de apoiarnos co teu mecenado nestes momentos... pero agardamos que se isto te chegou á alma, mesmo se talvez coñeces en persoa ao autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-orella... ) para que academos a nosa meta e Javier Pereiro vexa publicada a súa obra.
Grazas polo voso tempo.

<h3>Summary Of my Project:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kate Hurley. I am a blogger, writer, musician, and worship leader.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds for my upcoming book called <strong>Getting Naked Later: A Guide For the Fully Clothed.</strong> This is a humorous and touching book about my journey as a thirty something Christian single. It is in written in the style of Donald Miller and Lauren Winner- part memoir, part advice. You can read some of my writing ahead of time on my blog;<strong> thesexycelibate.com.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>20% of the profits from this book </strong>after it is published will go to two organizations that I love, AIDchild.org, an orphanage that takes care of orphans with AIDS in Uganda, and iempathize.org, an organization that fights sex trafficking. It will also support me as I work with innercity kids and homeless.</p>
<p><strong>I will not be able to publish this book without your help!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need and Incentives</h3>
<p>I need<strong> $5555</strong> dollars to make this project happen.

I wanted to be generous on my incentives because I appreciate your partnership so much. </p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>Dear Potential investor,</h3>
<p>I started writing as a teenager, over the past 20 years I worked on a wide range of stories - ranging from children's books to romance, to action books.</p>
<p>When i started writing, it was more a hobby, the thought of publishing impossible - at the time the digital age/web as we know it was non-existent.</p>
<p>My passion for writing went beyond scribbling on pages, since the age of 11 I had wanted to rescue animals in need (while living in the Caribbean I saw animal abused first hand and we rescued 18 stray dogs and 23 cats).  In my 20's while living on the northern shores of the Outer Banks, NC amongst the wild horses, I knew my true calling, to try and adopt those we could.  My husband and I adopted six wild horses.  These horses were removed for population control purposes.  It broke my heart that they would have to leave but more so that they were being torn from their herds and their home.  In addition to writing on other subjects, I started writing about my experience with adopting the horses, the challenges and sacrifices we had to make, the extensive research it took to make sure they ate similar to their natural habit (while keeping their immune system in optimum shape) and the search and journey we began to try and find a new home where they could live out their lives free.  I battled local politicians and even ran for office to try and save their lands and put a stop to them being torn from their homes but it wasn't enough.</p>
<p>One of my children's books is about a mischievous boy who teaches adults a few lessons in life.  The setting takes place in a castle with magic and wonderful adventures.  Another children's book is based on crabs - an animated book of sorts based on their beach adventures and encounters with humans and sea adventures with sea life, these teens get into trouble and help each other out- it has a lot of humor for adults and children.  I could see both being movies.  I shared quite a bit with friends and family, even reading some and they have pushed me to finish.</p>
<p>Financially my husband and I have used every bit of money to find a small bit of land for the horses, we built them a a small barn and installed fencing.  We live in a mobile home that is in disrepair.  Work has become more scarce for me - I do freelance/consulting work as a technical writer.  I have my truck for sale but doubtful I will get a buyer.  We are behind in bills and I have been worried here.  I realized I need to finish my books, it's the one chance I have that could make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>You can read more about the horses and see a few pictures on this news article:<a href=""http://www.thevanguard.ca/Living/2010-12-16/article-2048008/Mustangs-settling-into-new-home/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thevanguard.ca/Living/2010-12-16/article-2048008/Mustangs-settling-into-new-home/1</a> Please keep in mind we moved from that location to a property with a little less than 10 acres.</p>
<p>Funding for my book writing will allow me to finish several.  The first two I want to focus on are the children's books.  I would need to hire someone to create some of the animated scenes.  Publishing children's books is costly but I hope to approach Disney and other production companies when the books are published - for potential purchase or shared royalties.</p>
<p>I will provide signed copies of my books to those who help with funding.</p>
<p>I am worried about sharing too much of my books here because the ideas could be stolen - until I get them copyright protected.  I would be happy to share more with anyone seeking to invest a larger sum and could discuss sharing a royalty percentage.</p>
<p>I was reminded by a friend on just how the writer of the Harry Potter series got started - she found a publishing company that believed in her when most other companies turned her away.  My friend knows and I know that some of the stories I have been writing are big - they will eventually turn into movies, the story lines, the humor and the lessons learned are all eloquently pieced together to keep the reader on the edge of their seats - laughing, learning and being entertained.</p>
<p>After I get the first two children's books published, I have another book about a Naval Academy graduate who struggles to handle a long distance relationship - it's filled with suspense, trials and errors, romance, brotherhood and life on the go.</p>
<p>When I complete the book on my experience with the wild horses titled ""The last 11 miles and 1173 to go"" it will be more of a documentary/biography with photo images and a whirlwind of a story that will take the readers on our journey from having to move out west, to back east, to the north.  We covered thousands of miles, worked in freezing rains to fix fencing and build them shelter, we sacrificed the home we built, and our savings.</p>
<p><br/>Please give me a chance to prove I can do this, to know that your contribution will make a huge difference by allowing me to publish which in turn will continue to help care for the wild horses under our wing.</p>
<p>Thank you, please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further.</p>
<p><br/>Sincerely,</p>

<div></div>
<p>In 2011, after having completed treatment for breast cancer I began running creative writing workshops at Mt. Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in NYC.   During  treatment I put my writing practice aside to deal with the rigors  of surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation. Once the cancer was in remission,  I resumed my writing practice, and soon after I was thrilled to be notified that  my novel, <u>Stalina,</u>
was a pick from the Amazon Debut Novel Award Contest and was published by Mariner Books. </p>

While Susan was in hospice she asked if I would continue her work.  I humbly agreed, and when Susan sadly passed away,  I have continued the workshops as well as a journaling workshop at Mt.

writings of 20 participants.  The writing from the  workshops is honest, heartfelt and moving.  The stories, memoirs and poems are  wildly imaginative,  funny and sometimes even a bit risqué.  Fierce, funny, and artful. I will also take this opportunity through the anthology to memorialize those writers we have lost.  In addition to Susan Ribner, there are several others whose spirited  commitment to the workshops is evident in their writing.   It will be an honor to publish this work as well as that of the people who come every week to write and share in this growing community of writers.
 By supporting the Write Treatment Anthology 2016 at any level you are also insuring the continuation of the workshops. The published anthology will be distributed throughout Mt. SInai's Cancer Centers for free, and will be sold as an eBook in support of the workshops.   
 I will close with words from Dennis Paoli of the Heidi Paoli Fund, whose wife the  fund honors. 
""The benefits of writing--therapeutic for the patient and survivor, transformative for the medical culture and larger community--are obvious and well-documented, but equally as important, writing records the moral courage of all those who struggle with cancer, and in the shadow of loss, creates something lasting."" 
Thank you for considering this request.
All the best,

<h3>What is Pants on Fire?</h3>
<p>Four years ago on Valentine's Day my life turned upside down when I found out that the man I was planning to marry was a completely different person...down to the fake accent he used. (Yes, really.) To find out more about that, check out the video posted on this campaign or my blog <a href=""http://www.pantsonfiretour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pantsonfiretour.com</a>.</p>
<p>Four years later, I am sitting in New Zealand, at the very start of this journey in which I am following the path of this story around the world. Pants on Fire is the name of the blog I am keeping along the way &amp; the working title of the book I am writing. </p>
<p>Only half of this story has happened. You are watching details of the rest of the story unfold on the blog, and supporting the writing process of the book manuscript. </p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Jennifer Casale. I have an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Arizona. I am an optimist. I am a poet. I am an entrepreneur and an environmentalist. I am a hard worker &amp; for the next seven and a half months, writing this story is my job. </p>
<h3>What will you be using this money for? </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have been working two and three full time jobs for most of the past year. I have purchased the plane tickets, visas and immunizations. It was important to me to get this far before asking for any help. I knew the odds of me being able to pull this off were not great. But here I am. Day 3 into this journey. I woke up in a tent on a sheep farm in New Zealand this morning. One backpack filled with everything I will need for almost 8 months. I have already written more in the past two days than I have in the past three years. Now I just need to buy time. I need to be able to get a cup of coffee and sit and write all day. I need to buy bus and train tickets in each city. I need to sleep in safe hostels. This is a low budget project. </p>
<p>Best and Worst Case Scenarios:</p>
<p>If I don't meet the goal, I will still figure out some way to survive. I will work odd jobs. I will find a way. I am determined to write this book and send this story out into the world. </p>
<p>If I meet the goal, I will be able to focus on my job....and I will happy cry. A lot. </p>
<p>If I exceed the goal, I will first pass out, and then upon waking, make sure any money I don't absolutely need goes towards doing things along the way to make people smile....and those stories will end up on the blog and some of them will surely end up in the book....and you will have been responsible for making all of that happen. I believe we each have a tremendous power to influence and change each other's lives with the smallest gestures. It could be buying toys for an orphanage, paying for a child's schooling, buying groceries for someone, buying medicine, returning a small kindness to someone who showed me kindness without ever expecting a thing in return...whatever is needed, and whatever will make someone smile and feel hope. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe it is my job to tell this story and write this book. Even though the details of what happened and why I am here are unique and strange, I believe there is a universal message of love, hope, survival and truth that can be understood and felt by everyone. </p>
<p>If Harper Collins emailed me tomorrow and offered me a book deal, that would be great, but the chances of that happening are about as good as me winning the Tennessee Jackpot all the way from the other side of the world. It is so difficult for new musicians and writers to get deals. In a way, that is sad, but the most determined artists still find a way to produce their work. I love sites like Indie Gogo that allow art to be nurtured and supported by individuals who believe in the project during the creation stage. I believe there is something so much more authentic about that beginning. </p>

Have you ever wondered how your favorite players made it to the big leagues? Are you interested in the prospects that will some day be the core of the Blue Jays teams? Do you love a story of going against the odds and achieving a dream?</p>
<p>I have loved following the Jays since I was a kid. I loved the sport, the players, the stats, the drama, the race for the playoffs. I have been writing books and articles for business, sports and music newspapers and magazines for over twenty years and always set my sights on writing a book about how a player makes it to the big leagues. </p>
<p>The typical ball player coming out of high school or college joins a pool of hundreds of players trying to make it to the top, with many more being drafted year after year behind them. They battle it out through years in the minor league system and only the best of the best get the call that they are headed to the show. This is their story.</p>
<p>I have followed the Vancouver Canadians, the Blue Jays' Short-Season A affiliate, and first stop for many new draft picks, through the 2014 season. I will then follow these 30+ players for the next few years as they tackle each level of the minors and work their way up to the big club. Most will never make it as far as AAA, but some will, and eventually crack the Jays line-up like recent Jays and former Canadians players Marcus Stroman and Aaron Sanchez did.</p>
<p>The book follows every aspect of the players lives - wins, struggles and progress. It goes behind the scenes at the ballpark, into each minor league club and their cities and fans. I also speak to scouts, coaches, executives, former Jays players and other key figures who select the players and guide them to greatness.</p>
<p>You will get a rare look at baseball's minor league system and it will have you rooting for your favorite prospects. It will be a must-read for all Jays fans!  </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is the funding for?</h3> <p>Your help will allow me to travel to each minor league city (Lansing, Dunedin, New Hampshire, Buffalo) as well as trips to Spring Training and the Dominican facilities where many of the players were discovered that are being followed in the book.</p>
<p>Perks are copies of the book, signed copies and thank yous...without your great support this amazing project could not happen, so thank you all in advance for being a part of this incredible journey!</p>

Granted, I enjoyed her immensely, but ... write about her? Not only was I not an expert knitter, I did not even consider myself a writer!</p>
<p>Yet the notion persisted, and a few months later, when I asked permission to write about her, she agreed. Now I was in deep water! I started taking notes, imagining a collection of notes and colorful quotes (“Etch this on your eyelids: never, ever, ever, ever knot your yarn!”) Maybe I could Xerox some copies and give them to my classmates. Perhaps I could sell a few at a local knitting store.</p>
<p>All that changed when Ann passed away nine months into our class. Shortly after, my father passed away, and a year later, my mother. As I explored the possible reasons for that inner voice – “I want to write about Ann” – I started to see the mysterious ways our lives intertwined. I began to perceive the gems of wisdom hidden beneath the surface of Ann’s gruff exterior and I recognized Ann’s presence in my life as a gift of healing from trauma I had experienced as a child, trauma I had carried deep within me my whole adult life. Ann authorized me to speak on her behalf. In doing so, for the first time in my life, I felt free to speak on my own behalf as well. </p>
<p>Ann had a rare gift to touch people’s lives. In “Follow the Yarn” my personal story of healing shares the pages with Ann’s copious and sensible knitting tips, and with the wit and wisdom in her approach to teaching and creating knit wear. Throughout, Follow the Yarn is a tribute to Ann Sokolowski, a New York original, and a quietly extraordinary individual.</p>
<p>And that's where you come in - as many knitters know, starting a project is tons of fun – it’s the finishing up – oh those pesky seams – that can be a chore.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p>My name is Amy J. Wilson and I am the author of Empathy for Change. I wrote this book because I could see that, as a society, we were on a race to the bottom and chasing a constant state of productivity, profits, ego, and objects over people. I had been running on that hamster wheel myself, burnt out after working nights and weekends on creating social change that I felt so passionate about but didn’t take the time to refill my coffers. When I paused to take a sabbatical in the middle of my career in late 2018, I reflected on my own experience and talked to many other people trying to heal the world. This book is an exploration of empathy as my biggest strength, what led me to burnout, and how we as a society can get out of our way and create a better world with more empathy.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover ways that you can interrupt our conditioned ways of thinking and step into empathy and connectedness. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empathy and change in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you turn what you learned into action with a framework that I’ve devised after more than a decade of building cultures of innovation and change into where you live, work, and play.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about empathy and 21st century change:</p>
<ul>
<li>The different kinds of empathy — and why just saying you’re empathetic won’t cut it. Neuroscience has proven that we can learn new skills and unlearn old ones, and that includes working on our empathy muscle.</li>
<li>A journey to find connection, community, and ultimately true belonging within yourself. Learn about the differences between being an empath, being highly sensitive, and applying empathy.</li>
<li>How people and organizations around the country are applying empathy to deep-seated cultural challenges like systemic racism, capitalism, and poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are uneasy with the way our current structures are set up and are motivated to make change — both from within you and beyond. Empathy for Change Makers is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who want to enact change within their existing institutions and communities and people who are looking at inserting empathy and positive transformation for the first time.</p>
<h3>The Book - Empathy for Change</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part One </strong>contains the introduction + additional chapters. I’ll define what we mean by empathy, the latest science that shapes it, and what I mean when I say “21st century change.” It will also explore the traits of an empathetic changemaker, how to become more empathetic yourself, and how to extend that to the communities in which you live, work, and play. As I’ve found, it takes being in community to both understand yourself more and also to learn how to build the empathy muscle we need to thrive.<br/><br/><strong>Part Two</strong> contains chapters four through seven. In this part, I’ll transform the kinds of empathy into principles and a logical framework that anyone can use to create a culture of empathy into their lives and work. I’ll also explore the fields of change management and design and see how these fields are evolving to meet the needs of the 21st century. It’s in this section where the rubber hits the road — that you’ll explore how to put purpose and people first — and how that will turn into better programs, products, and cultures that work for everyone. Here is where you’ll learn to build a movement around culture change, not a mandate.<br/><br/><strong>Part Three</strong> contains chapters eight through ten. It’s in these chapters where we get to put our framework into action to make real change happen. I’ll explore how some companies and organizations are inserting empathy into their work and how it’s turning past models of profits and ego into people first, which pays off in the long term. I’ll include incredible tips from some of the best storytellers in the world to use the art of story to connect and share empathy. Finally, I’ll explore what we see as the new normal. I’ll give some insights into the world that has been thrust upon us with the coronavirus pandemic and how this is new, fertile ground for the empathetic future we all deserve and crave.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Amy J. Wilson is an Technology Policy Fellow at the Aspen Institute Tech Policy Hub, a West Coast policy incubator training a new generation of tech policy entrepreneurs. As a tech expert, she’s learning how to apply policy and create outside-the-box solutions to society’s problems. She’s worked on technology challenges around social issues like homelessness and systemic racism in Oakland, California, and will be launching her newest project, People Powered Policy, in Summer 2020.<br/><br/>She has served as a White House Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF), an entrepreneur-in-residence, for three years serving across two Administrations. While a PIF, she co-created with hundreds of public servants a shared language for innovation and change in the 21st century government: a six-point Innovation Playbook and 15-section Innovation Toolkit housed on Innovation.gov. Alongside that work, she launched The Better Government Movement that empowered 5,000 people across Federal, state, and local government to build their creative capacity and apply these skills to scale across governments everywhere. Before becoming a PIF, she was the pioneered the creation of Booz Allen Hamilton’s Innovation Blueprint and Ecosystem: products, tools, and events empowering employees to identify problems, generate ideas, and manage the innovation process. She has prototyped, piloted, tested, assessed, and scaled dozens of social change projects in her tenure.<br/><br/>Amy has been leading with empathy her whole life, but she had to take a test to help her realize her biggest strength was empathy. As a “highly-functioning” empath and highly sensitive person, Amy has had success across many sectors, but often at the expense of her mental health.

</div></div>","Story of My Book
My name is Amy J. Wilson and I am the author of Empathy for Change. I wrote this book because I could see that, as a society, we were on a race to the bottom and chasing a constant state of productivity, profits, ego, and objects over people. I had been running on that hamster wheel myself, burnt out after working nights and weekends on creating social change that I felt so passionate about but didn’t take the time to refill my coffers. When I paused to take a sabbatical in the middle of my career in late 2018, I reflected on my own experience and talked to many other people trying to heal the world. This book is an exploration of empathy as my biggest strength, what led me to burnout, and how we as a society can get out of our way and create a better world with more empathy.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover ways that you can interrupt our conditioned ways of thinking and step into empathy and connectedness. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for empathy and change in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you turn what you learned into action with a framework that I’ve devised after more than a decade of building cultures of innovation and change into where you live, work, and play.In this book, you'll learn about empathy and 21st century change:

The different kinds of empathy — and why just saying you’re empathetic won’t cut it. Neuroscience has proven that we can learn new skills and unlearn old ones, and that includes working on our empathy muscle.
A journey to find connection, community, and ultimately true belonging within yourself. Learn about the differences between being an empath, being highly sensitive, and applying empathy.
How people and organizations around the country are applying empathy to deep-seated cultural challenges like systemic racism, capitalism, and poverty.

You will love this book if you are uneasy with the way our current structures are set up and are motivated to make change — both from within you and beyond. Empathy for Change Makers is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who want to enact change within their existing institutions and communities and people who are looking at inserting empathy and positive transformation for the first time.
The Book - Empathy for Change
The book is written in three parts:Part One contains the introduction + additional chapters. I’ll define what we mean by empathy, the latest science that shapes it, and what I mean when I say “21st century change.” It will also explore the traits of an empathetic changemaker, how to become more empathetic yourself, and how to extend that to the communities in which you live, work, and play. As I’ve found, it takes being in community to both understand yourself more and also to learn how to build the empathy muscle we need to thrive.Part Two contains chapters four through seven. In this part, I’ll transform the kinds of empathy into principles and a logical framework that anyone can use to create a culture of empathy into their lives and work. I’ll also explore the fields of change management and design and see how these fields are evolving to meet the needs of the 21st century. It’s in this section where the rubber hits the road — that you’ll explore how to put purpose and people first — and how that will turn into better programs, products, and cultures that work for everyone. Here is where you’ll learn to build a movement around culture change, not a mandate.Part Three contains chapters eight through ten. It’s in these chapters where we get to put our framework into action to make real change happen. I’ll explore how some companies and organizations are inserting empathy into their work and how it’s turning past models of profits and ego into people first, which pays off in the long term. I’ll include incredible tips from some of the best storytellers in the world to use the art of story to connect and share empathy. Finally, I’ll explore what we see as the new normal. I’ll give some insights into the world that has been thrust upon us with the coronavirus pandemic and how this is new, fertile ground for the empathetic future we all deserve and crave.

As a tech expert, she’s learning how to apply policy and create outside-the-box solutions to society’s problems.

Alongside that work, she launched The Better Government Movement that empowered 5,000 people across Federal, state, and local government to build their creative capacity and apply these skills to scale across governments everywhere. Before becoming a PIF, she was the pioneered the creation of Booz Allen Hamilton’s Innovation Blueprint and Ecosystem: products, tools, and events empowering employees to identify problems, generate ideas, and manage the innovation process. She has prototyped, piloted, tested, assessed, and scaled dozens of social change projects in her tenure.Amy has been leading with empathy her whole life, but she had to take a test to help her realize her biggest strength was empathy. As a “highly-functioning” empath and highly sensitive person, Amy has had success across many sectors, but often at the expense of her mental health. After meeting her match while working at the highest levels of corporate consulting and the federal government, she was struggling with suicidal thoughts and deep burnout but knew there was a better way forward.In December 2018, she took a sabbatical to slow down her life and think about what’s next. It’s during this time of slowing things down that she reflected and rediscovered her strength and passion for empathy. In Empathy for Change Makers, she’s pairing her passion and knowledge for of 21st century change with her innate strength of empathy to create a new blueprint that will help us lead movements towards larger cultural change.For more information, you can connect with Amy at Amy.Jessica.Wilson@gmail.com and on LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/AmyJWilson], on Instagram and Twitter @RealAmyJWilson.

<p>Our elected officials <i>heed</i> in office who they <i>need</i> on the campaign trail, and the reality is that the conventional playbook for winning office involves relying on either the most passionate and extreme fringes of our society or moneyed interests seeking political influence.

<p>Today’s rapidly changing media environment presents the potential to cultivate a less expensive and more constructive conversation between candidates and voters, as opposed to an arms race of attack ads that manipulate and demoralize the American public.

Through a rigorous process with leading campaign experts, we have identified 14 Political Game Changers who we believe can help make our politics work for all of us. Please join us in supporting these projects so they can test their potentially transformative ideas in the 2016 election season.

Why this matters

Our elected officials heed in office who they need on the campaign trail, and the reality is that the conventional playbook for winning office involves relying on either the most passionate and extreme fringes of our society or moneyed interests seeking political influence. So whether we’re making decisions about how we manage our economy, protect our environment, or ensure our security, the full force of our federal government can be held hostage by hysteria or bought by the highest bidder.
But our nation is undergoing tectonic economic, demographic, and technological shifts.
The way our campaigns are run and won will change. The question is how?
The Representation Collaboratory
Over the last year, we have engaged more than 50 leading campaign experts from across the political spectrum to inform our analysis of how our campaigns are likely to evolve, based on those tectonic shifts.

Through a competitive open call, we selected 14 projects that we think could help change how the campaign game is played, so that our elected officials need and ultimately heed a broader diversity of the public. We want your support so we can test these potentially transformative innovations in this year’s election season.
The Political Game Changers
Below are the winning projects, organized into three different areas relevant to the future of campaigning. To support a specific project directly, either click on the “support this project” button beneath it or select the corresponding perk to the right. If you’d prefer to support the entire portfolio, select the Good Citizen or Collaboratory Membership perks. All funds will be received by our partner organization, Rock the Vote, and dispursed directly to the teams or to the entire Pluribus Project portfolio.  
Leveraging People Power
How can campaigns activate broad, diverse networks of people to achieve campaign objectives with greater reliance on human resources and less reliance on financial resources?


A how-to manual for running a successful People Powered Campaign: The People’s Democracy Playbook from Take Back Our Republic





The former Republican campaign strategist who took down the House Majority Leader while being outspent 20:1 joins forces with the mastermind from several left-wing campaigns to develop an open source guide for running a $250,000 competitive congressional campaign.
 







Getting more volunteers into the game:Stronger U.S. Education Fund





An experienced Obama campaign operative combines the “snowflake model” for volunteer recruitment and empowerment with cutting edge research to prove that enlisting volunteers may not make consultants money, but it can scale and change the dynamics of a race.
 







Lowering barriers & increasing impact for volunteers: Movement





An active military serviceman organized an ad hoc network of coders to build an app for making campaign field operations much more efficient and effective; it was adopted by the Sanders campaign and has been wildly successful. Now they want to make it open-source and available to anyone.
 







Labor organizing for the networked age: OUR Walmart





Innovations in technology have changed the way that workers can connect and take action. OUR Walmart presents a model for ensuring the employees at Walmart (the largest employer of African Americans, Latinos and women in the United States) can leverage the power of their numbers through a peer-to-peer platform.
 







The Power of a Pledge: Defend Our Future & UMass Amherst





Behavioral science research shows that committing to do something significantly increases the chances that you will follow through. A research team from UMass Amherst and Defend our Future is conducting ground breaking field experiments on how to translate a “pledge” into political power.
 







Winning the (Future) Media War
Today’s rapidly changing media environment presents the potential to cultivate a less expensive and more constructive conversation between candidates and voters, as opposed to an arms race of attack ads that manipulate and demoralize the American public. The following projects look to turn that potential into a reality.

Building the courage to speak according to principled convictions and foster genuine discourse: Emily Ekins from Cato Institute





The conventional thinking is that speaking from principled convictions is no way to get elected. But new research suggests that people are open to being persuaded if they believe the speaker genuinely shares some of their values. Emily Ekins is assessing the effectiveness of this strategy for promoting more inclusive, evidence-based political discourse.
 







Ensuring that any size campaign can leverage new media & communications technologies effectively: Telegraph from Lincoln





Campaigns that can’t afford highly paid digital consultants are unable to take advantage of the latest media and tech tools for communicating with and engaging constituents. Telegraph is a new platform that ensures that any campaign or civic cause can have access to valuable tech expertise and innovative digital strategies.
 







Undermining the influence of ads and elevating the conversation: Block the Bias from Students for Liberty





Campaigns cost so much money primarily because of the expense of advertising. What if ads didn’t reach the people campaigns are paying to reach? SFL, the largest network of libertarian student organizations in the world, is encouraging young people to install ad-blocking software and promote more constructive online forums for discussion.
 







A new 21st century public square: The UnConvention from the 92nd Street Y, Mic, and PRI





Young people don’t want to just be passive recipients of political content anymore; they want to be part of a conversation. The 92nd Street Y is partnering with Mic and Public Radio International to host the UnConvention, a multi-media, multi-platform conversation of, by, and for millennials about what matters to them this election season.
 







Engaging Interested Bystanders
We can’t have a government responsive to broad public interests if the people who are active politically are not reflective of the full diversity of the electorate – including the many Americans who care about what is happening in their communities and country but feel too powerless or uninformed to participate. How can we get those whom Kate Krontiris and her colleagues on the Google Civic Innovation Team call Interested Bystanders off the sidelines and into the game?

Empowering election officials and civil society to increase voter turnout: Center for Technology and Civic Life





There are well established methods for increasing voter turnout. But those methods are typically deployed by campaigns, which tend to focus on the demographics likely to support their candidates. CTCL is giving government employees and civic leaders the tools and know-how they need to ensure that those who vote are more representative of the public at large.
 







Increasing turnout in determinative primaries:  Echelon Insights





Most congressional seats are considered safe for one of the parties, so the primary is the determinative election. Yet primary turnout is often paltry and dominated by ideologically extreme constituents. Leading Republican campaign strategists at Echelon are exploring how to ensure that the people who determine the representative of a district are more representative of that district.
 







Breaking down the language barrier for new Americans to participate politically: VoterVOX from 18 Million Rising





Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest growing demographic group in America, but too many of them are isolated from our democracy because they don’t have the language skills to participate. VoterVOX breaks through that barrier by connecting skilled volunteers with people in the field when they are most needed.
 







Activating the Unlisted: William Isaac, Michigan State University





As campaigns increasingly rely on voter databases, there is a growing class of “missing” voters that candidates and elected officials often ignore. A talented graduate student is exploring how to get those unlisted on the list, so we have a more inclusive and representative electoral process.
 







Better Candidate Pipelines: Will Cubbison & John Sides, George Washington University





Over 60% of elected officials are white men, and most are far wealthier than the average American. Part of the problem is in the “pipeline”: Too few women, minorities, and working class Americans run for office. A promising graduate student and former campaigner is working with a noted political scientist to ensure that candidates and elected officials reflect the full diversity of our public.

2026
The kind of transformation we are envisioning will not happen overnight. We have set our sights on 2026 – the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence – as an appropriate timeline for our efforts to help restore the integrity of America’s system of elected representation. But change takes time, so we need to start now, and we need your help.
The beauty of our political process is that if just a few people win by using the People Powered Playbook, then others will take note, inspiring more candidates across the country to adopt these tactics and campaigns.
That’s what our system of government is supposed to be. And if we all chip in and do our part, that’s what it can be. Please join us.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>This project has been over 3 years in the making. It started in June 2015, with an email to Zip Zap. It took Dr Zizz five months to write the text. Then, in between his schoolwork and circus practice, Ayanda Nombelwu, our child illustrator, drew for over a year!</p>
<p>Now we need <strong>just $5,400</strong> (about R77,000) to bring I CAN FLY to print. That's not a lot!</p>
<p>(As this is a South African project, we give an approximate Rand value too:)</p>

<li>$400 (R5,000) pays Ayanda Nowbelwu an advance on the work he's done and enables him to buy a Wacom tablet so he can add digital colour to his own drawings!</li>
<li>$1,400 (R20,000) pays the cartoonist (Chip Snaddon) who has been working all year to add colour to the line-drawings delivered by Ayanda Nombelwu. Chip initially offered to work for free, but no one should go unrewarded for their kindness.</li>
<li>$900 (R13,000) pays Paul Morkel of Pedestrian Films who, at short notice, filmed and edited the heartfelt promo movie you see at the top of this campaign, spreading word of our work.</li>

<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will at least be able to print some books. But let's be positive!

Our eleventh edition is available online and in print! We would like to raise money for next year by selling this beautiful book.
Can you help?
 
We want to distribute the incredible, diverse and remarkable writing our students produce by selling the book. Then, we want to use the money to fund next year's edition. 
If you buy a copy, you will be ensuring that Route 57 continues to be published in print. 90% of the money raised from this campaign will go directly towards the design and print for the 2016 edition. The remainder will go to indiegogo and into banking charges.

<p><b><u>Bamboo Whispers</u></b><b> is an unprecedented collection of indigenous metrical poetry, or ambahan, from the Philippines. </b></p>
<p>The Mangyan are an indigenous people's group that have lived on the island of Mindoro for centuries. Their verse is a cultural gem that has been kept hidden since antiquity, conjuring their identities, struggles, and hopes through evocative, visceral metaphors. Much like Japanese haiku or the Malaysian pantoum, ambahan is written in native pre-colonial script and heptasyllabic verse.</p>
<p>Inscribed with a knife on bamboo stalks, ambahan is not only unique for its structure and medium, but also for its provenance, with no individual authorship -- this art form being a communal offering to the world.</p>
<p><u>Bamboo Whispers</u> curates the one hundred of their  most representative ambahans, in two scripts and in four languages: in the original Hanunuo Mangyan, and translated into Filipino, Spanish, and English by poets.</p>
<p>With these diverse languages, and archival and fine art photography that provide a window to the Mangyan soul and way of life, the book aims not only to introduce the beauty and legacy of ambahans and Mangyan culture to the modern world, but also to invest in the preservation and sustained practice of this rarefied and vanishing craft. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">     </span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The publication and proceeds of this book will fund the Mangyan Heritage Center's programs to teach the next generation of Mangyans to embrace their unique culture, literature, and script -- only one of three remaining in the Philippines today from over a dozen documented by a Spanish priest in the 1600s.</p>

<p>I wish I was the only international investigator of Putin's Russia to have been harassed, but there are many more targets like me. Therefore I will systematically collect and map data on the pro-Russian intimidation of civilians - internationally.

</div><div><i><b><br/></b></i></div><div><b>PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS PRESENTATION IN FINNISH LANGUAGE, CONTACT ME!</b></div></div>","Hello! My name is Jessikka and I'm an award-winning investigative journalist from Finland. I specialize in investigating Russia, extremism and information warfare. Immediately after I started covering pro-Russian online propaganda, I became a target of an extensive, international disinformation campaign.This is me covering the Russian Troll Factory in St. Petersburg in February 2015. The Troll Factory produces pro-Kremlin social media propaganda  24/7.
You might have read my story in the New York Times or other news outlets.  You might even have seen some of the fabricated stories about me which are used to discredit my work and frame me as unreliable, like this professionally produced song which claims the Kremlin trolls only exist in my imagination. It's performed in Finnish by a wig-wearing actress playing me at my work place, Finnish Broadcasting Company.
Despite the attacks, I continued my investigations - thanks to supporters! Now I need your backing for a brand new investigative book on the information warfare waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime.
Focus of my Book - the Kremlin's Cross-Border Influence 
I wish I was the only international investigator of Putin's Russia to have been harassed, but there are many more targets like me. Therefore I will systematically collect and map data on the pro-Russian intimidation of civilians - internationally. The outcome will be published in my book Vladimir Putin's Troll Empire - an investigation into the Kremlin-affiliated influencing techniques of trolling, hacking, stalking and harassing people - even outside Russia's borders.
In my book I will disclose new details about the pro-Kremlin intimidation campaigns targeted at Western citizens who investigate, publish and comment on issues which Putin's regime would prefer to keep hidden.
In Russia, independent journalists, citizen activists and opposition figures often face harassment, threats and physical violence, and in the most tragic cases have been murdered. But the critics of Russia's political leadership are systematically being harassed in other countries, too.
I have interviewed and will interview individuals, who have been hacked, threatened and/or trolled by pro-Kremlin operators after voicing out their views or knowledge on Russia. My interviewees are active members of their communities: journalists, researchers, social media activists, authors, dissidents, analysts and other civilians living in Europe and even the USA.
The targets of pro-Russian intimidation often face serious consequences - Meet some of my interviewees:


A public critic of the Kremlin who was falsely denounced by Russia as a criminal, and flagged to Interpol


A journalist who was smeared online, trolled and hacked by Russian hackers


A private tweeter who had his workplace information stalked and published in a story by the Russian state-owned ""news agency"" Sputnik


A journalist who was physically followed by the Russian security service FSB


A researcher who was targeted by a cyber espionage group linked to Russian military intelligence






I have chosen to interview people, who continue their work and activities, despite the harassment. These individuals' stories need to be told because they are a true inspiration to others. By distributing factual information, they protect the freedom of speech and democratic decision-making as well as promote basic human rights and strong civil societies in their own countries, but internationally, too. 
This Book is Important - Russian Information Operations are Advancing 
This book needs to be written, because the Russian information war is reaching and influencing ordinary people, their attitudes and actions as well as political decision-making not just inside Russia, but around Europe and further afield too. The Russian spy, troll, bot and hacker apparatus is trying to poison the public debate as far away as in the United States, by meddling in the presidential election.

In my book I will provide insight of the Russian textbooks concerning information-psychological warfare as well as Russia's security services' methods of oppression. I will also map the most active internationally operating agents of influence connected to the Kremlin and/or the security services of Russian Federation.

Russian information-psychological operations and cyber capabilities are constantly improved. Without sophisticated analysis it is impossible for the free, Western democracies to counter the infowar that they face. It is crucial to expose the ongoing hybrid warfare, and my ambition is that the book will provide a set of the most effective solutions on countering modern information aggression.
Even though I've already come across more instances thank I'd like of Russia-related intimidation targeted at civilians, I am eager to receive further tips. Please contact me and share your experiences and knowledge about pro-Russian smearing or hacking campaigns. If you want to share info publicly, please use the my book's hashtag #StopKremlinTrolls on social media.
(KINDLY NOTE:  If you happen to work in the Putin's regime and want to become a whistleblower - I would love to hear from you).
How are the Crowdfunded Finances used?
My project has started very promisingly, but I need your support to take it forward! It has the backing of various prominent experts as well as members of the public! This crowdfunding will pay for:



Fact-finding research travel


Translations and transcription of interviews and troll materials


Analytical software and necessary hard- and software to improve my own data security.


A blogging platform to publish the most interesting pieces of the book and other fascinating information warfare related material


A professional to take photographs of my interviewees, the main characters of the book, and other help which I might need.


The more we manage to exceed my funding target, the more cool elements I will be able to include in my book!

<p align=""center""><em>Aeon Byte is one of the most exciting and far-seeing programs in the world of Webcasting.</em><br/> Richard Smoley, author of <em>Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism</em> and <em>Inner Christianity</em></p>
<p>For over seven years, <a href=""http://www.aeonbytegnosticradio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio</a> has been the leading voice in bringing the mysteries of ancient Gnosticism and other alternative traditions to a modern meaning. Best-selling authors, world-renowned scholars, Hollywood filmmakers, and counterculture mystics have been given a clear forum to spread dangerous truths that have helped countless individuals attain spiritual and mental freedom. But the other dangerous truth is that the Gnostic message is more relevant than ever with the rise of invisible police states, quicksand realities caused by medusa media, and conspiracy theories coming alive.</p>
<p>It’s time to make even more of an impact. <strong><em>It’s time for Aeon Byte 2.0</em></strong></p>
<p>With the demands and opportunities of a changing landscape in media and technology, Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio <strong>needs to adapt in order to reach farther and even survive.</strong> This will include the highly-anticipated follow-up to <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Voices-Gnosticism-Interviews-Chilton-Scholars/dp/1906834121"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Voices of Gnosticism</a></em>, a full transformation into a multi-media entity, and a venturing into other exciting areas of the internet. It will result into a complete and interactive experience for you. <strong>Let us continue together to teach the world to write their own gospel and live their own myth. </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em>""Aeon Byte is an invaluable resource for those interested in the history and continuing relevance of Gnosticism. With its wide range of scholars, independent voices, poets, thinkers and modern heretics, it is, for my money, one of the very best Gnostic sites on the internet, and a much-needed meeting place for like-minded souls in a world dominated by the forces the Gnostics personified as our old friend, Ialdabaoth and his archons."" </em><br/> Sean Martin, author of <em>The Gnostics: The First Christian Heretics</em>, <em>The Cathars</em>, and <em>The Knights Templar</em></p>
<p><strong>What will happen once Aeon Byte 2.0 is launched, in essence creating an even bigger heretical family:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The anticipated follow-up to Voices of Gnosticism</strong>. The book has been both a commercial and critical success. Two years later, it’s time to release the follow-up, bringing in print more of the greatest scholars and mystics of our era, increasing the depth of the Gnostic sensibility. The book will include many of my own writings on crystalizing Gnosticism for a contemporary audience. It will expand the message of the first book, but it can also be a standalone work. The projected release date would be September, 2013.</li>
<li>
<strong>Free resources.</strong> This will include future ebooks and transcripts of episodes beyond the books. And also a plethora of audio and video.<em> </em><strong>The Gnostic Wisdom will be available in many more platforms, reaching a larger audience.</strong><em> This will assist in our continual growth! </em>This would begin to be available before the end of 2013.</li>
<li>
<strong>A revamped, streamlined website, blog, and audio/video/article resource center.</strong> Beyond making it all an easier and richer experience, visitors will be much more involved. This will include a subscription area, potential forum, and various resources where you will know the process of each show, from beginning to end, and give me your two shekels of wisdom whenever you desire. This would certainly be executed by October, 2013.</li>
<li>
<strong>An expansion into video and an expansion into other topical arenas, without losing the Gnostic thrust.</strong> The truth is that I get approached by factions beyond the borders of religion and occultism. Even Occupy Wall Street has contacted me to interview its leadership. With more resources, I will be able to expand into parallel subjects. And all this means newer and more varied guests to enrich your experience. There will also be mini-documentaries in the future. This would certainly begin before October, 2013.</li>
</ul><p><em>“It was a pleasure talking with Miguel and collaborating with him on matters of gnosis. What good fortune that we have this sort of opportunity to chat about things Gnostic on the radio! Sophia and her aeonic friends should be delighted.” </em><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Marvin Meyer, author </span><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus</em><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">, </span><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Gospels of Mary</em><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">, </span><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">Judas: The Definitive Collection of Gospels and Legends About the Infamous Apostle of Jesus</em><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">, as well as editor of </span><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Nag Hammadi Scriptures</em><span style=""font-size: 10px;""><br/></span></p>
<p align=""center""><em>""What a rare treat to hear side-by-side all of these voices musing about secrets of the Gnostics.""</em> <br/> April D. DeConick, author of <em>Recovering the Original Gospel of Thomas</em> and <em>The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says</em></p>
<p><strong>What I need and what for to make this all a reality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The follow-up to Voices of Gnosticism</strong>. Purchasing ISBN numbers and other licenses, basic printing fees, obtaining editing assistance, and graphic design will cost $1000.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment.</strong> I’ve been running with the same loyal machines for over four years (and much of the basic software from 2006, from the early days of podcasting). But there is a new generation of Adobe Audition and Illustrator programs, among others, that will reign production with the times ($2500). These programs will go along one Titan computer and other equipment that won’t have electric tape keeping them together ($1500). Video software and gear will migrate part of the show into video interviews and mini-documentaries ($1200). Cost for all revamped technology and software will easily be a total $5200 (and that’s cutting some corners).</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising and promotion.</strong> For years, Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio has grown into an audience of thousands through word of mouth alone, but it can reach farther and for deeper for those who have ears to hear. As mentioned, this will include a new horizon of guests as well. An average Google Adword campaign is around $200, just to make a dent. Placing careful advertising campaigns will not dilute the program but enhance it. Cost for basic marketing. $1600.</li>
<li>
<strong>New website and look. </strong>It’s time to overhaul all the sites. The reality is that search engines have punished the show because of fragmented content and bulkiness, a side effect of many years of growth. This also tends to confuse many visitors. By having a restructured look, creating a subscription service, building a forum, and fine tuning awkward areas, the experience will be vastly more enjoyable and interactive for you. This will include an approachable blog and resource center on Gnosticism and other heresies. Cost for subscription area and new store, as well as hiring a programmer and designer will be $4000.</li>
<li>
<strong>Expansion.</strong> By expanding a budget, adding some extra equipment, and outsourcing production work, we can melt the Gnostic ethos with other counterculture movements. Beyond what I mentioned above, I have also been approached by various activist filmmakers who wish to create new messages from the ancient heresies. Cost will be $3000.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exras.</strong> This reboot and overhauling will require more legal fees and training, finally making this venture a lean and effective business. There are blinds spots I need to close to get to the next level. Cost will be $3000. And course there are the taxes and fees that running this campaign demand. </li>
</ul><p><strong><em>In essence, this will make a more polished, professional, and pluralistic venture. Gnosis should be available to all, so please support this venture into helping more find their own Gnosis. Become and be involved in a growing heretical family and alternative media vehicle. </em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><em>""Miguel Conner's Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio has opened up the study of Gnosticism in two ways. It provides a detailed appreciation of varied perspectives for those who are at the beginning of their interest. But it also and unusually steps outside of doctrinaire claims --fashionable among Fundamentalists and neo-Gnostics alike -- in order to get at the Gnostics as they were, not as many people today would like them to be.""</em><br/> Bruce Chilton, best-selling author of <em>The Way of Jesus</em>, <em>Abraham’s Curse</em> &amp; <em>Rabbi Paul</em></p>
<p><strong>What If I Don't Reach These Goals</strong></p>
<p>The future direction of the show will be in question, but all books and subscription services will go through.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll shut-up now.</p></div>","Welcome to Aeon Byte 2.0
Aeon Byte is one of the most exciting and far-seeing programs in the world of Webcasting. Richard Smoley, author of Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism and Inner Christianity
For over seven years, Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio has been the leading voice in bringing the mysteries of ancient Gnosticism and other alternative traditions to a modern meaning. Best-selling authors, world-renowned scholars, Hollywood filmmakers, and counterculture mystics have been given a clear forum to spread dangerous truths that have helped countless individuals attain spiritual and mental freedom. But the other dangerous truth is that the Gnostic message is more relevant than ever with the rise of invisible police states, quicksand realities caused by medusa media, and conspiracy theories coming alive.
It’s time to make even more of an impact. It’s time for Aeon Byte 2.0
With the demands and opportunities of a changing landscape in media and technology, Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio needs to adapt in order to reach farther and even survive. This will include the highly-anticipated follow-up to Voices of Gnosticism, a full transformation into a multi-media entity, and a venturing into other exciting areas of the internet. It will result into a complete and interactive experience for you. Let us continue together to teach the world to write their own gospel and live their own myth. 
""Aeon Byte is an invaluable resource for those interested in the history and continuing relevance of Gnosticism. With its wide range of scholars, independent voices, poets, thinkers and modern heretics, it is, for my money, one of the very best Gnostic sites on the internet, and a much-needed meeting place for like-minded souls in a world dominated by the forces the Gnostics personified as our old friend, Ialdabaoth and his archons.""  Sean Martin, author of The Gnostics: The First Christian Heretics, The Cathars, and The Knights Templar
What will happen once Aeon Byte 2.0 is launched, in essence creating an even bigger heretical family: 


The anticipated follow-up to Voices of Gnosticism. The book has been both a commercial and critical success. Two years later, it’s time to release the follow-up, bringing in print more of the greatest scholars and mystics of our era, increasing the depth of the Gnostic sensibility. The book will include many of my own writings on crystalizing Gnosticism for a contemporary audience. It will expand the message of the first book, but it can also be a standalone work. The projected release date would be September, 2013.

Free resources. This will include future ebooks and transcripts of episodes beyond the books. And also a plethora of audio and video. The Gnostic Wisdom will be available in many more platforms, reaching a larger audience. This will assist in our continual growth! This would begin to be available before the end of 2013.

A revamped, streamlined website, blog, and audio/video/article resource center. Beyond making it all an easier and richer experience, visitors will be much more involved. This will include a subscription area, potential forum, and various resources where you will know the process of each show, from beginning to end, and give me your two shekels of wisdom whenever you desire. This would certainly be executed by October, 2013.

An expansion into video and an expansion into other topical arenas, without losing the Gnostic thrust. The truth is that I get approached by factions beyond the borders of religion and occultism. Even Occupy Wall Street has contacted me to interview its leadership. With more resources, I will be able to expand into parallel subjects. And all this means newer and more varied guests to enrich your experience. There will also be mini-documentaries in the future. This would certainly begin before October, 2013.
“It was a pleasure talking with Miguel and collaborating with him on matters of gnosis. What good fortune that we have this sort of opportunity to chat about things Gnostic on the radio! Sophia and her aeonic friends should be delighted.” Marvin Meyer, author The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus, The Gospels of Mary, Judas: The Definitive Collection of Gospels and Legends About the Infamous Apostle of Jesus, as well as editor of The Nag Hammadi Scriptures
""What a rare treat to hear side-by-side all of these voices musing about secrets of the Gnostics.""  April D. DeConick, author of Recovering the Original Gospel of Thomas and The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says
What I need and what for to make this all a reality:


The follow-up to Voices of Gnosticism. Purchasing ISBN numbers and other licenses, basic printing fees, obtaining editing assistance, and graphic design will cost $1000.

Equipment. I’ve been running with the same loyal machines for over four years (and much of the basic software from 2006, from the early days of podcasting). But there is a new generation of Adobe Audition and Illustrator programs, among others, that will reign production with the times ($2500). These programs will go along one Titan computer and other equipment that won’t have electric tape keeping them together ($1500). Video software and gear will migrate part of the show into video interviews and mini-documentaries ($1200). Cost for all revamped technology and software will easily be a total $5200 (and that’s cutting some corners).

Advertising and promotion. For years, Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio has grown into an audience of thousands through word of mouth alone, but it can reach farther and for deeper for those who have ears to hear. As mentioned, this will include a new horizon of guests as well. An average Google Adword campaign is around $200, just to make a dent. Placing careful advertising campaigns will not dilute the program but enhance it. Cost for basic marketing. $1600.

New website and look. It’s time to overhaul all the sites. The reality is that search engines have punished the show because of fragmented content and bulkiness, a side effect of many years of growth. This also tends to confuse many visitors. By having a restructured look, creating a subscription service, building a forum, and fine tuning awkward areas, the experience will be vastly more enjoyable and interactive for you. This will include an approachable blog and resource center on Gnosticism and other heresies. Cost for subscription area and new store, as well as hiring a programmer and designer will be $4000.

Expansion. By expanding a budget, adding some extra equipment, and outsourcing production work, we can melt the Gnostic ethos with other counterculture movements. Beyond what I mentioned above, I have also been approached by various activist filmmakers who wish to create new messages from the ancient heresies. Cost will be $3000.

Exras. This reboot and overhauling will require more legal fees and training, finally making this venture a lean and effective business. There are blinds spots I need to close to get to the next level. Cost will be $3000. And course there are the taxes and fees that running this campaign demand. 
In essence, this will make a more polished, professional, and pluralistic venture. Gnosis should be available to all, so please support this venture into helping more find their own Gnosis. Become and be involved in a growing heretical family and alternative media vehicle. 
""Miguel Conner's Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio has opened up the study of Gnosticism in two ways. It provides a detailed appreciation of varied perspectives for those who are at the beginning of their interest. But it also and unusually steps outside of doctrinaire claims --fashionable among Fundamentalists and neo-Gnostics alike -- in order to get at the Gnostics as they were, not as many people today would like them to be."" Bruce Chilton, best-selling author of The Way of Jesus, Abraham’s Curse & Rabbi Paul
What If I Don't Reach These Goals
The future direction of the show will be in question, but all books and subscription services will go through.

<h3>¿Quién es Ricardo Codorníu y Stárico?</h3>
<p>Ricardo Codorníu y Stárico (Cartagena, 1846 - Murcia, 1923) Fue un ingeniero de montes espa- ñol de los siglos XIX y XX. Entre sus trabajos más destacados se puede mencionar la reforestación completa de Sierra Espuña , labor que comenzó en 1889, así como la restauración de la pinada de Guardamar del Segura, trabajo que se realizó como método para contener el imparable avance de las dunas que amenazaban el pueblo. Por su dedicación al medio ambiente y su defensa de los bosques fue bautizado como el ""Apóstol del árbol"". Su pensamiento puede enmarcarse dentro del movimiento regeneracionista que se extendió en la España de finales del siglo XIX. Fue también un destacado esperantista, fundando en 1902 la Sociedad Española de Esperanto. Fue además el abuelo materno de otro importante ingeniero, Juan de la Cierva, inventor del autogiro.</p>

<h3>Más info sobre el proyecto ""12 árboles""...</h3>
<p>Desde nuestros comienzos como asociación nos ha resultado sorprendente ver pasar los años y corroborar como este gran personaje de reconocimiento mundial y destacado por llevar a cabo colosales empresas tales como la reforestación de Sierra Espuña o - la no menos importante - contención del avance de las dunas de Guardamar que amenazaban sigilosamente con devorar al pueblo entero... ha sido, es y sigue siendo un gran olvidado para la sociedad, y en concreto para la ciudad que le vio nacer y donde descansan desde 1923 sus restos. A día de hoy, tiene un busto conmemorativo tanto en el Parque del Retiro en Madrid como en la plaza de Santo Domingo en Murcia, ninguno en Cartagena. Este proyecto propone devolverle el sitio que se merece, reeditando un libro de cuentos que escribió hace más de 100 años, dedicando cada uno de sus 12 cuentos a cada uno de sus nietos. Se llama ""12 árboles"". El objeto final sería un libro de tapa dura y acolchada con una primera edición de lujo limitada y numerotada, incorporando las ilustraciones de 13 artistas de distintas técnicas y estilos, así como un prólogo firmado por un importante creativo de la Región y una biografía. Esta reedición será la piedra de toque de un proyecto con varias vías de desarrollo y cuyos beneficios queremos destinar a tareas de reforestación, creación de un bosque a su nombre, así como la creación y colocación de una estátua en su honor en Cartagena, y la reasignación de su nombre a una avenida en Cartagena (a día de hoy sí existe una calle R. Codorníu)<br/> </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>“In Chicago, we saw publications drown in the blink of an eye. We don’t want that to ever happen to Black Chicago’s story. So that means that we have to own our media.” </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong><i>- Morgan Elise Johnson, co-founder of The TRiiBE</i></strong></p>
<p>Chicago has become the buzzword for all things deplorable in Black America. This isn’t a new phenomenon. The stereotype of Black Chicagoans as unruly and murderous dates back to - at least - the 1919 race riots, when Eugene Williams, a Black teenager, drowned at 29th Street beach after being stoned by Whites for crossing the unofficial segregation lines. At the time, reporters portrayed all of the Whites involved as victims and Blacks as “howling Negroes” in need of military control.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>These images of Black Chicago continue today with loaded language such as “top gang thugs” and Trump’s infamous Twitter call to “send in the feds.”</p>
<p>To challenge this dangerous, one-sided narrative, we created The TRiiBE (<a href=""http://www.thetriibe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thetriibe.com</a>) - a mix of magazine-style journalism articles, documentary shorts and art that presents  Black Chicago’s story holistically and accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Our mission at thetriibe.com is to give ownership of Black Chicago’s story back to the people through these five pillars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><a href=""https://thetriibe.com/the-culture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Culture</a></u>: researched news stories covering everything from art and music to education and social policies.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://thetriibe.com/the-people/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>The People</u></a>: opinion pieces and perspectives by Black creatives, politicians and activists as well as other leaders in our community.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://thetriibe.com/the-works/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>The Works</u></a>: a platform for Black writers, visual artists and videographers to display their work.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://thetriibe.com/the-scene-beta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>The Scene (beta)</u></a>: a community board and directory of all things happening in Black Chicago.</li>
<li>
<u>TRiiBE Tuesdays</u>: a panel series engaging our audience to debate and discuss hot-button issues concerning our community.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more than a year, we’ve been reshaping the narrative of Black Chicago through high-quality media. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518360445/blebjgrukaaow1enq8wo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Together, We Are The TRiiBE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>“Chicago is so vast that a lot of times so many of us are sitting in the house thinking and talking about the same things, but there’s never a place where we can all have the same conversation together. The TRiiBE is that hub.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i><strong>- Tiffany Walden, co-founder of The TRiiB</strong></i><i><strong>E</strong></i></p>
<p>With the help of family, close friends and an army of Black creatives who donated their money, time, skills and emotional support, we’ve been able to maintain The TRiiBE at a minimal capacity - publishing one story every week or so and covering events sparingly.</p>
<p>More and more people are reaching out to The TRiiBE with story ideas and pitches, but we don’t have the capacity to cover all of our community's requests.</p>
<p>Our readership is growing and online buzz is generating. More and more young Black people from the Chicago region are pitching ideas to us and attending our events. </p>
<p>Unlike so many news organizations, that have paywalls and limit their free content, we want our journalism to be free and available to the audience we serve, especially Chicago Black millennials and youth. </p>
<p>This work takes time and hard work. With as little as $10, you can help us grow a staff and keep representing Black Chicago and its many dimensions.</p>
<h3>Media That Impacts Black Chicago</h3>
<p>The TRiiBE was co-founded by a West Side native, and works with interns and writers from Black neighborhoods across Chicago. We know the types of stories that get overlooked and we think our platform can help elevate new voices to the mainstream.</p>
<p>We care that the Chicago gospel classic “Jesus Can Work It Out” is featured in a national Google Chromecast commercial, so we <a href=""http://thetriibe.com/2017/11/googles-new-chromebook-ad-just-sampled-a-chicago-choirs-classic-hit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wrote</a> about how that collaboration came about when no other media outlet did.  </p>
<p>We <a href=""https://thetriibe.com/2017/09/why-we-cant-stop-thinking-about-kenneka-jenkins/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">explained</a> why Kenneka Jenkins’s death affected so many Black millennial women when other outlets focused on the social media frenzy.</p>
<p>We <a href=""https://thetriibe.com/feature/another-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spent a year chronicling</a> the healing processes of Black millennials who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence while other outlets sensationalized Chicago’s murder rate.</p>
<p>Balanced representation in media matters.</p>
<p>Please consider contributing to help us keep doing this impactful work.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
“In Chicago, we saw publications drown in the blink of an eye. We don’t want that to ever happen to Black Chicago’s story. So that means that we have to own our media.” 
- Morgan Elise Johnson, co-founder of The TRiiBE
Chicago has become the buzzword for all things deplorable in Black America. This isn’t a new phenomenon. The stereotype of Black Chicagoans as unruly and murderous dates back to - at least - the 1919 race riots, when Eugene Williams, a Black teenager, drowned at 29th Street beach after being stoned by Whites for crossing the unofficial segregation lines. At the time, reporters portrayed all of the Whites involved as victims and Blacks as “howling Negroes” in need of military control.
Sound familiar?
These images of Black Chicago continue today with loaded language such as “top gang thugs” and Trump’s infamous Twitter call to “send in the feds.”
To challenge this dangerous, one-sided narrative, we created The TRiiBE (www.thetriibe.com) - a mix of magazine-style journalism articles, documentary shorts and art that presents  Black Chicago’s story holistically and accurately.
Our mission at thetriibe.com is to give ownership of Black Chicago’s story back to the people through these five pillars:


The Culture: researched news stories covering everything from art and music to education and social policies.

The People: opinion pieces and perspectives by Black creatives, politicians and activists as well as other leaders in our community.

The Works: a platform for Black writers, visual artists and videographers to display their work.

The Scene (beta): a community board and directory of all things happening in Black Chicago.

TRiiBE Tuesdays: a panel series engaging our audience to debate and discuss hot-button issues concerning our community.

For more than a year, we’ve been reshaping the narrative of Black Chicago through high-quality media.

Together, We Are The TRiiBE
“Chicago is so vast that a lot of times so many of us are sitting in the house thinking and talking about the same things, but there’s never a place where we can all have the same conversation together. The TRiiBE is that hub.”
- Tiffany Walden, co-founder of The TRiiBE
With the help of family, close friends and an army of Black creatives who donated their money, time, skills and emotional support, we’ve been able to maintain The TRiiBE at a minimal capacity - publishing one story every week or so and covering events sparingly.
More and more people are reaching out to The TRiiBE with story ideas and pitches, but we don’t have the capacity to cover all of our community's requests.
Our readership is growing and online buzz is generating. More and more young Black people from the Chicago region are pitching ideas to us and attending our events. 
Unlike so many news organizations, that have paywalls and limit their free content, we want our journalism to be free and available to the audience we serve, especially Chicago Black millennials and youth. 
This work takes time and hard work. With as little as $10, you can help us grow a staff and keep representing Black Chicago and its many dimensions.
Media That Impacts Black Chicago
The TRiiBE was co-founded by a West Side native, and works with interns and writers from Black neighborhoods across Chicago. We know the types of stories that get overlooked and we think our platform can help elevate new voices to the mainstream.
We care that the Chicago gospel classic “Jesus Can Work It Out” is featured in a national Google Chromecast commercial, so we wrote about how that collaboration came about when no other media outlet did.  
We explained why Kenneka Jenkins’s death affected so many Black millennial women when other outlets focused on the social media frenzy.
We spent a year chronicling the healing processes of Black millennials who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence while other outlets sensationalized Chicago’s murder rate.
Balanced representation in media matters.
Please consider contributing to help us keep doing this impactful work.
