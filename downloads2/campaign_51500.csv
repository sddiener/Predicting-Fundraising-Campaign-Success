<h3>Calling on all horror freaks around the world!</h3>
<p>We here at the Evil For Dinner family want your help to make a badass horror film. We have a dedicated crew, hungry for the opportunity and a killer cast. Now we just need the final push to make it everything we dream it can be!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575877325/tk3lz2ii4leddexfjyyu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Three years ago, we made a short film, <i>Evil For Dinner</i>. It won an award at a German film festival because those Germans are madmen, and now it's streaming on Troma Now! And we're ready to unleash the feature version. It's going to be a wild, sexy, ultraviolent, Troma-inspired horror ride!</p>
<p><i>Evil For Dinner </i>follows a family of cannibals who eat the evil to extend their lives. The wily patriarch, Howdy, faces a series of crises one fateful day, forcing him to examine his legacy.</p>
<p>His older daughter, December, has grown bitter and vengeful and increasingly doesn't care for the morals he tries to instill in his consumption of human flesh. His younger daughter, April, is itching to fly the coop with a nice boy - way too nice for this family. And his long-lost brother is riding into town to settle a grudge centuries old. The result is a bloodbath like nothing you've seen!</p>
<p>Our crew includes makeup artist Taylor Haggard, who works on the effects in Austin's infamous House of Torment! And we're thrilled with the cast who are going to be here, with two very special names. Howdy will be played by Kerry O'Quinn, known as one of the founders of <i>Fangoria</i> and <i>Starlog </i>magazines. And, in a cameo as the Mayor of Austin, we have the one and only Lloyd Kaufman, director of <i>The Toxic Avenger </i>and <i>Tromeo and Juliet, </i>founder of Troma Entertainment!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>We have just wrapped filming, so the movie is in the can! And on Indiegogo, we can keep everything pledged to us, even if we don't make our goal. </p>
<p>However, while the film is finished, there's still a long way to go! We have months of editing, sound mixing, color grading, and more, to finish the movie. Everything you send us will help us pay for the movie to get across the finish line, so our editor doesn't have to eat passerby to survive. If we raise enough, we'll also have time to shoot pickup shots and possibly even an additional day of shooting to get a few short scenes we didn't have time or money for during production.</p>
<p>For you, besides our eternal gratefulness, we have some <strong>amazing perks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every contribution at <strong>$10</strong> or over gets<strong> your name, in the credits, on the screen</strong>!</li>
<li>We have perks at several levels for DVDs, Blu-Rays, Signed Posters, a Signed Script, all manner of goodies.</li>
<li>But then we really have the good stuff: you can not only appear in the film, you can <strong>get a big death scene, in the film!</strong> This is your chance for the immortality of a bloody on-screen death! (Just so long as you can make your own way to Austin, Texas for filming)</li>
<li>And, if you're generous beyond any normal measure, you can get an <strong>Executive Producer Credit</strong>, Not only do you get everything else, but if you can get down to Austin, we'll set up a <strong>special dinner and screening</strong> of insane, obscure horror movies, with the filmmakers!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Every contribution is heartening! And by heartening, we mean we want to literally rip someone's heart out. Our incredible makeup artist can create some of the most spectacular effects ever put on the screen, but that costs money. And we can make the movie, but we can make a much better movie that includes all the scenes in the story, not just most of them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We already have some of our funding in place! We have investors and are investing in the film ourselves. The film has been shot and the footage is in the can. The risks, however, without this, are that the film's post-production process will take far, far longer, and we won't be able to get it looking or sounding as amazing as we want it to. We'll pour our hearts and souls into it, but scenes will have to be dropped, and we can't do a few of the most spectacular moments. We'll still make the picture, no matter who we have to kill to do it, but we want to do it right. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for anything you can do!</p>

<p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>My name is Farzam Reza, producer and director of The Lives of Millions. I was born and raised in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In Fall of 2016, I moved to the United States to pursue an education in Producing for Cinema-TV at Columbia College Hollywood. Throughout my three years here, I have met many students and faculty who have assisted me in honing in my skills to be prepared to bring my thesis film, The Lives of Millions, to life. </p>
<p><strong>What’s It About? </strong></p>
<p>Set in 2017, Salman has moved to the United States to begin this new journey in his life. Perceiving America as being the land of opportunity and dreams, he is placed in a dorm room with Adam, his racially ignorant roommate who consistently tries to provoke him. As Salman is sent down a spiral, he must find the courage to stand up against his tormentor to secure a space for himself that he can call his home and find safety. </p>
<p>The Lives of Millions revolves around the idea of immigration, political and human division, and understanding. It is a story of compassion, empathy, and change. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need? </strong></p>
<p>The goal for this crowdfunding campaign is $8,700. That is a lot but before we ask you to donate to our project, we need to be transparent for what we’ll be using that money for. </p>
<p><strong>Art Department</strong>: We are artists after all, we want what is seen on the screen to look good. </p>
<p><strong>Crafty and Catering: </strong>Arguably one of the best spots on set is by the crafty table and we don’t want that table to be empty. Crafty is where all the food stays that is available for the cast and crew while filming. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment Rentals: </strong>All magicians need their tools, we need to give our filmmakers theirs. </p>
<p><strong>Locations</strong>: Let’s face it, we need to create the world and we can’t do that without locations. </p>
<p><strong>Permits</strong>: Please permit us to shoot at these different locations. </p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong>: To pay for gas and the cars to transport our cast, crew, and equipment to set. </p>
<p><strong>Costumes:</strong> To create costumes that are appropriate to their own style and personality. </p>
<p>Incentives</p>
<p><strong>$5 — Thank You! </strong></p>
<p><strong>$15 — Digital Poster </strong></p>

<p><strong>$500 — Associate Producer</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>$1000 — Executive Producer </strong></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>The Lives of Millions is a story about an immigrant, a group of people who in recent years have been perceived as the enemy in many societies. With this film, I want to shine a light not only on the perspective of an Iranian immigrant but to restate what America was founded upon. America is a land of opportunities and dreams, where anyone, regardless of race, religion, gender, and ethnicity can come and create a better world for themselves. Salman is one of those millions of people around the world who either are forced out of their homelands or choose to search for a better home. </p>
<p>This story is about embracing our differences and choosing to overlook them in hopes that through unity and acceptance we may build a better world for our future. Empathy is the foundation for which many of our worlds problems can be solved and with this film I want to change the way that we perceive people who are different. Film is an art form that has no borders where people of all backgrounds can watch this and appreciate the differences that we see in people all around us. </p>
<p><strong>Risk and Challenges </strong></p>
<p>As with everything in life, there is a risk to doing anything. We may not be able to find appropriate locations, not be able to raise the ideal amount of money, have to change our plans at any given moment. However, there is one thing that won’t change, our love and dedication to this project. No one has ever made a film that they were not passionate about and this project is no exception. The team who supports me and this concept are the reason why this film will succeed no matter the circumstances. I choose to believe that our talents and our motivation will make this a film that will reach audiences and will make everyone who has invested their resources (both time and money) proud. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways To Help </strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to donate to the campaign, that is okay. By sharing it onto your own social media and tagging our own pages, you can help just as much to the success of this production. Your advice and recommendations are our greatest assets. </p>

It will blend old school cinema of the 1930's German expressionism all the way to modern films inspired by famous auteurs.

Although each of us come from a different background we have the same goal, to make engaging original films.The idea came to Oscar years back and only in 2018 that he decided to develop it. The one line idea, became a 15 page screenplay and with countless revisions it's now in its (almost) final state. With your generous help, it's finally ready to be produced!The story centers around a strong female character, unexpectedly and unwillingly, drawn into a threatening circumstance.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><i>A Bike Ride Home</i> is a slow cinema short film about cycling. It centers on Carrie- a woman who has lost faith in many of the structures she has come to know. She no longer trusts in her government, or believes she will find success within capitalism, and she is conscious that her time here may be lessened by climate change- the warming of the planet making it uninhabitable, someday. Simultaneously, she is grieving the loss of her mother, and reconfiguring how to engage with what is around her when it feels unrecognizable. All of these concerns come to fruition on one of her final days at a Temp job, and we spend the rest of the film with Carrie on her bicycle as she rides home experiencing and interacting with the city.</p>

<p>Slow cinema is a deeply important form of cinema to me. Our time is itemized through our participation in capitalism- it is something to spend, or waste- and through slow cinema, I have found manners to gain back my time, and feel its passing, in a worthwhile manner. It is a genre that gives one space to lose themselves in images, it does not take hold and demand your every thought. I hope that when watching this film, viewers are able to feel the weight of their time, and don't feel that it flew by as they watched. It creates the same sensation I feel sometimes when riding my bicycle. There are no technological distractions, or matters of my life to take away from images of life and city filtering by me as I ride, and I hope that this experience can be translated through the film we make. —Emma</p>

<h3><u><strong>About It's a Life.</strong></u></h3>
<ul><li>
<strong><i>It's a Life</i></strong> is a dramedy about Michelle, who is a struggling actress in LA who suffers from anxiety and a severe case of scopaesthesia. Her father  is also her therapist, this dichotomy creates an amusing, heart warming dynamic between father and daughter.  Michelle ends up refusing to take her meds after a life of being prescribed a fist full of pills. This causes her scopaesthesia and anxiety amp up, thus revealing to her that the feeling of being constantly watched is due to her being in a TV show, or is it she maybe creating this illusion in her head?  With her being the only person who now knows she is in a TV show, she now can be herself, with no restraints. In the end being true to yourself and who you are is all that matters.

Risks & Challenges

With a smaller crew, we face a harder, stricter work schedule. However, the end result remains no different than a full sized crew. 
The full goal of $20,000 will make it so we can expand the crew beyond our main team, to help us properly space out each shoot day, as to not drain the whole crew on a longer, more compact work day. 
Some of our actors are SAG, this is one of the reasons why it is important to gather all of the funds needed, specifically due to the high cost of the New-Media insurance coverage, as well as set cost, cost for background actors, and crew cost. Even down to the cost of festival submission, it all adds up. very quickly.

<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Having
previously made short films about Batman, The Flash and other heroes,
we are now turning our attention to one of our favorite Marvel
characters...CABLE! This amazing character has yet to be showcased in
live action and we think it's about damn time! With still well over a
year until we see him appear in Deadpool 2, we thought we would wet
your appetite with a ten minute short film based on our favorite
cable story line 'The Second Coming'. This will mean some of your favorite
characters will appear, including Hope Summers and X-mens
Nightcrawler in a hugely action packed short.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Second Coming"" was the final part of a trilogy of stories that began with ""Messiah Complex"" and continued in ""Messiah War"". In this story almost the entire Mutant population has been wiped out, with no new mutants being born. Until 'Hope' is born. She is the mutant Messiah and the mutant put in charge of keeping her alive is Cable!<br/></p>

</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
want to make sure that the character of Cable is treated with the respect
he deserves, so we will make the short film as high end as possible. The Second Coming is such a great story, that we feel needs to be told in live action. As
this is a passion project, we have already invested our own funds to get things started,
but we will need a little help from you guys to complete the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
To
do this we will need $3000 to help pay for some essentials. This will
include;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Higher
	costs for a high end 4k camera to make sure the film is captured
	in the best possible quality. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Location
	costs – We plan to shoot at a large derelict mansion, which will
	pose as Xaviers school for the gifted. This kind of location will really give the film an authentic feel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	Props
	– We are working with some excellent props makers to create
	awesome stuff like cables huge guns and his cybernetic arm. These need to look completely accurate and real, to draw you as the audience into Cables world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
	VFX
	– We will be taking on a large amount of the VFX ourselves, but
	there are some things that are out of our remit. (Nightcrawlers tail
	for example) So we have some very cool VFX houses, including the hugely talented <a href=""http://www.megastud.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mega Stud.io</a> willing to help us

have developed a niche in high action, VFX driven content and have
got to work on some amazing projects over the last few years. We also run a successful YouTube channel under the same name and have over 40 million views on our videos. Want
proof?! Check out a short montage of our work below.
  
More
importantly we are huge comic book geeks! We both grew up on comics
of all types and we are still avid readers today.



Having
previously made short films about Batman, The Flash and other heroes,
we are now turning our attention to one of our favorite Marvel
characters...CABLE! This amazing character has yet to be showcased in
live action and we think it's about damn time! With still well over a
year until we see him appear in Deadpool 2, we thought we would wet
your appetite with a ten minute short film based on our favorite
cable story line 'The Second Coming'. This will mean some of your favorite
characters will appear, including Hope Summers and X-mens
Nightcrawler in a hugely action packed short.
Second Coming"" was the final part of a trilogy of stories that began with ""Messiah Complex"" and continued in ""Messiah War"". In this story almost the entire Mutant population has been wiped out, with no new mutants being born. Until 'Hope' is born. She is the mutant Messiah and the mutant put in charge of keeping her alive is Cable!



We
want to make sure that the character of Cable is treated with the respect
he deserves, so we will make the short film as high end as possible. The Second Coming is such a great story, that we feel needs to be told in live action. As
this is a passion project, we have already invested our own funds to get things started,
but we will need a little help from you guys to complete the project.


To
do this we will need $3000 to help pay for some essentials. This will
include;



	Higher
	costs for a high end 4k camera to make sure the film is captured
	in the best possible quality. 
	



	Location
	costs – We plan to shoot at a large derelict mansion, which will
	pose as Xaviers school for the gifted. This kind of location will really give the film an authentic feel.



	Props
	– We are working with some excellent props makers to create
	awesome stuff like cables huge guns and his cybernetic arm. These need to look completely accurate and real, to draw you as the audience into Cables world.


	VFX
	– We will be taking on a large amount of the VFX ourselves, but
	there are some things that are out of our remit. (Nightcrawlers tail
	for example) So we have some very cool VFX houses, including the hugely talented Mega Stud.io willing to help us
	out and deliver Hollywood level visuals. 










As well as co-directing
over twenty short films, including the hugely popular live action 'DagonBall Z: Saiyan Saga', George is also a very successful Stunt Man.
He has worked on some of the biggest productions in the world including 'Star Wars: Force Awakens', 'Rogue one', 'Game of thrones' and recently doubled
Benedict Cumberbatch in Marvels 'Doctor Strange'. So he knows superhero
action and stunts better than anyone.







Along with George,
Harry has directed over twenty films, including 'DBZ Saiyan Saga', 'Batman: The Bloody Valentine' and 'League of Legends: Blind Ambition'.
His content has garnered over 40 million views online and that number
is rising all of the time. Harry is a huge comic book geek and can't
wait to bring Cable into live action.







We think Solvi has the perfect look for the character of Cable and
luckily for us he is a great actor and a massive fan of Marvel
comics. He is possibly the perfect casting.



Often
called Renaissance Man by mass media, Sölvi Fannar is an actor,
model, multi-sport athlete, poet and performance artist. He is also
an agent for actor and strongman Thor / Hafþór Júlíus Björnson
(The Mountain, from Game of Thrones).




Christine is an
excellent actress with a wide range of experience, from short films
to features like 'Maria'. Plus she is a black belt in Taekwondo
, so can kick some serious ass! We feel she really embodies the
character of Hope.






Grant is an extremely
talented martial artist and frankly one of the most insane
kickers/trickers you will ever have the pleasure of watching in
action. We plan to put these skills to good use and take 
NightCrawlers abilities to a whole new level.






Phillip
Ray Tommy is an Independent Film maker, actor and trainee stuntman. A
self confessed film addict, his love for film started at an early age
when he saw Hooper for the first time.

Standing
at over 6ft 2, Phillip is a real tree trunk of a man and he will make
a great Bishop.



We’ve designed the perks to be as cool, fun, and worthwhile as possible to the invested fans. Above all else, we want to make something we know people will be proud to be a part of.

<p><u><strong>Why do you need me?</strong></u></p>
<p>Coven is a film which came from an experience I myself had once on roads very similar to where we are shooting. And so the film you see before you was born. We are looking for £3000 to take this film from script to screen and further beyond in order to make as many people see it as we possibly can. None of the money is going towards our own paychecks as every incredibly talented individual is here purely out of passion (or favours) and with the end goal to make a short film they can all be proud of.</p>
<p>We understand that money is tight these days and as such we are putting money from our pockets into this aswell but we still need that final £3000 to make us all breathe easier knowing we can literally get everything we need.</p>

<p>Ben Sheridan is a Kent born and raised director with several short films already under his belt. While this is the biggest project Ben has undertaken he is no stranger to the film making process and the visual language of the screen. His last short film 'The View'. A story about a young man trying to lead his girlfriend away from a zombie apocalypse was met with high praise from peers and industry professionals. His next short film 'To The Stars' is also about to be entered into numerous festivals and competitions. About to start his degree at the prestigious Ravensbourne Creative Academy Ben wants one last film under his belt as an independent director before going back into education. With no love of finances nor fame Ben simply wants to give an audience something they will enjoy and with Coven he hopes to scare them aswell.</p>

</div></div>","Why do you need me?
Coven is a film which came from an experience I myself had once on roads very similar to where we are shooting. And so the film you see before you was born. We are looking for £3000 to take this film from script to screen and further beyond in order to make as many people see it as we possibly can. None of the money is going towards our own paychecks as every incredibly talented individual is here purely out of passion (or favours) and with the end goal to make a short film they can all be proud of.
We understand that money is tight these days and as such we are putting money from our pockets into this aswell but we still need that final £3000 to make us all breathe easier knowing we can literally get everything we need.

Where is my money going?
When we say every penny we mean every penny of your generous handouts will be going towards production with nothing left over. To break it down into words aswell the expenses are
Production Gear: £1,200
On set (Makeup, costume, a heater) £254
Props: £165
Expenses (fuel,food,drink) £600
Rewards £500
Festival Fees £270
Other Expenses £200

<p>I am an alumnus of Cal State Northridge, where I studied film. I also have about four years of experience in the film and television business. These years have been spent freelancing my way across films and TV like “Ted 2,” “Marry Me,” “Hail, Caesar!,” and most recently, “Transformers: The Last Knight.” I've worked on set as a grip, electrician, production assistant, cinematographer, camera assistant, operator and in the office as well! Using my experience for Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures, New Deal Studios, USC, New York Film Academy and many others, even the independent market.</p>
<p>All of these years of preparation have prepared us for a project of our own.</p>
<h2>What we’re doing:</h2>
<p>At this stage, we are looking for support which will go toward filming the very first episode of Seeking Sasquatch. </p>
<p>The Seeking Sasquatch pilot is the first part of a long-running series about the misadventures of the Bigfoot Investigation Bureau and their increasingly outlandish methods of squatch detection. The BIB consists of Jack Patterson, the team leader, and squatch expert; Christina Meldrum, the data analyst and BIB record keeper; Abner [no last name given], a master tracker with unclear motives; and Stephen Keplar, a Ph.D. candidate in biology forced into the team against his will.</p>
<p>The show is tonally a cross between Finding Bigfoot and The Office.  It focuses mainly on the BIB and their various dysfunctions, set against the backdrop of their increasingly ridiculous squatching exploits.</p>
<h2>How we’re doing it:</h2>
<p>Seeking Sasquatch, though filmed in the less expensive documentary/sitcom style, is no small undertaking. To help us bring creative aspects to life, we are employing the help of some of the best people we've met along the way to Seeking Sasquatch. </p>

<h3>Budget breakdown:</h3>
<p>However, just having the right team isn't quite enough to bring Seeking Sasquatch to life. Here, along with the cost of bringing on a team of experts, you can see how many other factors come into play and are critical for the success of this vision. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474929032/sfdyzq3tvrvj6saagzkm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you'll notice, the figure we are aiming for in our goal is not the figure you see here. This is where our Stretch Goals, which we go into detail about a little later in our story, come in. What we are aiming for is the bare minimum to do this project. We feel it's more important to make our goal than take a bigger hit with fees for not making our goal on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>You may also notice the goal amount is roughly where we want to be for pre-production and production. Post production, exhibition, marketing and so on will, if we don't meet our stretch goals, have to come from additional fundraising and some otherwise unnecessary additional work. </p>
<h2>How you can help:</h2>
<p>As you can see, making a TV pilot is a monetary commitment. Yes, we have a team to make it, but you're the team that can enable us to. </p>
<p>For you kindhearted investors contributing, we’ve got a great range of fun and exciting perks for you to check out. And if you can’t make a donation, you can still contribute by helping raise awareness of Seeking Sasquatch using Indiegogo share tools! These, you can find next to the ""BACK IT"" button at the top right portion of our Indiegogo page.</p>
<p>And be sure to check out our other social media links, where we’ll be posting fun Squatch facts and project updates throughout the campaign.<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/EmpriseLLC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/EmpriseLLC</a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/EmpriseFilms?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/EmpriseFilms?lang=en</a><br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emprisefilms/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/emprisefilms/?hl=en</a> </p>
<h2>Our Stretch Goals:</h2>
<h3>$75,000</h3>
<p>With $75,000 we can rest easy knowing we have the funding to shop this to the right people. This will enable us to take the show you helped create, to the best festivals and network audiences we can find. </p>
<h3>$100,000</h3>
<p>It's important to know that this falls between one-third to half the budget of one episode of Finding Bigfoot. That's right, we're doing it for a fraction of what an episode of similar material costs. The cost of episodes of The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Arrested Development, would be even greater!</p>
<p>With this stretch goal, Emprise Entertainment will have sufficient funding to give us a real shot at making this upcoming year, 2017, the best year yet for growing the company. With this money, we will be tooled to make the most of your investment in Seeking Sasquatch - this would allow us to go farther than we ever could on our own.</p>
<p>Your donations would enable us to hire the best people to market Seeking Sasquatch. Taking our chances of getting this title to air to the next level. And, that's the point, isn't it. To put this show on as many TV's and computers possible and bring a few smiles and some lighthearted entertainment to a country and world in desperate need of it. </p>
<p>Finally, if you've made it this far, we really do thank you for your time and wish you all the best.</p>
<p>From Emprise Entertainment to you - thank you!</p>

I have a wide variety of experience in the entertainment industry.  Starting out in the production team with Disney for live events, I got to learn on the job at arguably the largest entertainment company in the world.  With a focus on lighting and camera, I now have worked on franchises such as Star Wars, Jason Bourne, and the latest Insidious film.  In the television world, my work has ranged from serving as the Lighting Director on shows such as MTV's Fantasy Factory and TOP GEAR, the programmer on house reality shows Twinning and Are You the One, and gaffer on the long-running Storage Hunters series.  As a cinematographer, I have shot numerous short films, music videos, and commercials.

If you're interested, more can be read about our team and their backgrounds through the links provided beneath their individual bios. These will take you to their personal websites, IMDb pages, videos they've worked on and so forth.
Budget breakdown:
However, just having the right team isn't quite enough to bring Seeking Sasquatch to life. Here, along with the cost of bringing on a team of experts, you can see how many other factors come into play and are critical for the success of this vision. 

As you'll notice, the figure we are aiming for in our goal is not the figure you see here. This is where our Stretch Goals, which we go into detail about a little later in our story, come in. What we are aiming for is the bare minimum to do this project. We feel it's more important to make our goal than take a bigger hit with fees for not making our goal on Indiegogo. 
You may also notice the goal amount is roughly where we want to be for pre-production and production. Post production, exhibition, marketing and so on will, if we don't meet our stretch goals, have to come from additional fundraising and some otherwise unnecessary additional work. 
How you can help:
As you can see, making a TV pilot is a monetary commitment. Yes, we have a team to make it, but you're the team that can enable us to. 
For you kindhearted investors contributing, we’ve got a great range of fun and exciting perks for you to check out. And if you can’t make a donation, you can still contribute by helping raise awareness of Seeking Sasquatch using Indiegogo share tools! These, you can find next to the ""BACK IT"" button at the top right portion of our Indiegogo page.
And be sure to check out our other social media links, where we’ll be posting fun Squatch facts and project updates throughout the campaign.https://www.facebook.com/EmpriseLLChttps://twitter.com/EmpriseFilms?lang=enhttps://www.instagram.com/emprisefilms/?hl=en 
Our Stretch Goals:
$75,000
With $75,000 we can rest easy knowing we have the funding to shop this to the right people. This will enable us to take the show you helped create, to the best festivals and network audiences we can find. 
$100,000
It's important to know that this falls between one-third to half the budget of one episode of Finding Bigfoot. That's right, we're doing it for a fraction of what an episode of similar material costs. The cost of episodes of The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Arrested Development, would be even greater!
With this stretch goal, Emprise Entertainment will have sufficient funding to give us a real shot at making this upcoming year, 2017, the best year yet for growing the company. With this money, we will be tooled to make the most of your investment in Seeking Sasquatch - this would allow us to go farther than we ever could on our own.
Your donations would enable us to hire the best people to market Seeking Sasquatch. Taking our chances of getting this title to air to the next level. And, that's the point, isn't it. To put this show on as many TV's and computers possible and bring a few smiles and some lighthearted entertainment to a country and world in desperate need of it. 
Finally, if you've made it this far, we really do thank you for your time and wish you all the best.
From Emprise Entertainment to you - thank you!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Farm tells the story of Tariq, a young Londoner on Tottenham’s notorious ‘Farm’ Estate, facing the challenges of moving on from a difficult past. Tariq is torn between conflicting loyalties to his new girlfriend, Sophie and her aspirations for change, and his oldest friend Kameo. Tariq finds himself implicated in an armed robbery committed by Kameo, and in an effort to make it all go away he trades invented information with police about his erstwhile friend Mo being radicalised, when in fact Mo is at home studying and taking care of his 16 year old sister. It is an act of betrayal that will force him to reevaluate his life, his friendships, and his future.</p>

<p>Abdullah Alhalaki doesn't know who he is. Not really. Born in Yemen in 1994, he thinks,
to a Somalian father and a Yemeni mother during the Somalian civil war, his father was
murdered while his mother was pregnant, and his mother disappeared the day he was
born. Neighbours heard a baby crying, and so began life for Abdullah.<br/></p>
<p>He was brought to Tottenham, London, via Delhi and Manchester, by a paternal aunt and
her husband, who pretended, even to him, that he was one of their own children. He
was treated differently to his two brothers, until Social Services became interested
when Abdullah started showing up to school with signs of physical abuse. Panicking, his
aunt took him back to Yemen, where she left him, taking his passport with her.
</p>
<p>Staying with relatives and with an immature camel as his closest companion, Abdullah
noticed a tearful old woman watching him from a distance, when he
approached her she revealed that she was in fact his maternal grandmother, that his
mother’s whereabouts were unknown, and that who he thought was his mother was his
dead father’s sister.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Abdullah’s older brother-cousin helped him, through the British embassy, to get back to
London, where he was sent to stay with his father’s brother, until, protecting his
pregnant uncle’s wife from his uncle’s rage got him a serious beating, and at 14 he
became homeless, escaping from foster placements and living rough with other homeless
boys. The boys slept in piles for warmth, ‘like puppies’.
</p>
<p>Abdullah earned himself a six months stay in Feltham Young Offenders Institute for his
involvement in the 2011 riots, and in 2013, amidst further petty convictions and gang
trouble, he found his way onto a performing arts Btech, his comedic performance talent
got him noticed and he was invited to take part in a screen acting workshop run by
Shootstraight at Goldsmiths University, becoming part of a company of actors for whom
the short film Farm was written, now in preproduction and scheduled to shoot this
September.
</p>
<p>Abdullah is now juggling motorbike deliveries with a Theatre and Politics course at the
Royal Court Theatre and preparing Shakespeare monologues for his upcoming audition at
RADA.
</p>
<p>Abdullah has a thousand questions about where he has come from, why the truth has
been hidden from him, and above all, where and who is his mother?
</p>
<p>The documentary will see Abdullah follow the clues, and despite the lack of an airport (it
was bombed out of use by the Saudi coalition in 2015), returning to Yemen to find his
mother. He will start by finding his camel... </p>

</div>
</div><div>
<p>We have a really fabulous crew who are ready to start on both projects this September, and are willing to work for a lot less than their daily rates, and with a heartfelt commitment to the projects that money could not buy!</p>
<p>FARM will be shot in a maximum of 4 days and we have worked out that the entire project right through to completion could be done for £12500, if everyone is willing to work at London living wage and bring their own sandwiches! </p>
<p>We aim to finish shooting ABDULLAH by next spring, there are so many variables involved, because we really don't know where the search will take us,  but that is all part of the excitement of this mysterious project. We believe that £12500, and the cameras we already have, will get us well on our way.</p>
<p>These projects have come out of Shootstraight which has up to now been a community project with a huge amount of heart. Our events are always emotional and our loyal friends and supporters love us and have become part of the Shootstraight family. By helping us make these two films you too will become part of the Shootstraight family. We really look forward to sharing our progress with you and seeing you there when we finally come to our red carpet premieres!</p>
<p>The success of FARM on the festival success will represent one complete revolution of the Shootstraight wheel.
The young people involved will have been through the long process that saw them
initially engage with what must have been a very alien and challenging forum where

<p>Everyone – both cast

<p>The story of Gener’s

cover and explore that cultural paradigm shift – in a fictional world!  And there’s major twist to our story – some
people have started to overindulge in the juice. 
But I can’t go into more detail than that.  Because yeah, it’s a spoiler.</p>
<p>This talented
independent cast and crew of struggling artists could use your help.  </p>
<p>We have collected some

some of the best film production craftspeople in the northeast.  Please help them complete their mission of
making a show that will break many boundaries and fill you with exhilaration
and awe.</p>
<p>And check-out my
personal track-record to lead this team – I have completed numerous shorts as well as a feature-length film (1 hr. 40 min,) called American Jubilee.  All have been completely finished and shown at film
festivals.  Many projects don’t get past
the shooting stage – but I get things done. 
I’m a persistent Irish Jew.  </p>
<p>Yeah I just wrote that.  </p>
<p>Please help Gener’s People

What we need

We are an ""ECHO"" of the days when Tuskegee thrived. Connecting the past and present, we added ""boom"" since our platform is a place where conversations explode. ECHOboom is a multi-media platform featuring blogs, news, opinions, videos, community calendar, community business directory, tourism resources, Tuskegee University student innovators, alumni success stories and a university marketplace populated by student and alumni business enterprises. ECHboom is accessible 24/7 on your smart phone, iPad and other computer equipment.ECHOboom is a place that starts conversations, connects people and engages audiences.  ECHOboom invites everyone to  experience the multidimensional complexity that exists within a Black community that is a microcosm of Black America.We ask that you help us reach and even exceed our $120,000 goal…If we receive more…we can do more.Features on the ECHOboom PlatformCHIME-IN : Community ConversationsChime-In provokes conversation through compelling blog posts.BOOM - News & InformationBoom is the news and information section on ECHOboom presenting current or trending topics. This section also conveys Tuskegee University campus life and alumni stories. With our strategic partnership with a student-operated campus radio station, we offer live streaming content.BRAVO - Celebrating Our BestBravo is where we highlight our hometown heroes and  community projects. LIFT - Business Growth and SustainmentLift is our way of helping local businesses grow and prosper.

Tuskegee RisingECHOboom is keeping a close watch on the plans, projects and people involved with transforming Tuskegee into a vibrant community.  We call this ""Tuskegee Rising"" and we created this artwork to symbolize the dawning of a new day.                               We imprinted the image on t-shirts, which you can purchase as a perk to support  our crowdfunding campaign.Remember...""The Renaissance Starts With Us""FoundersECHOboom is a partnership between two kindred spirits – Jazlyn Fuller and Karin Hopkins.Jazlyn graduated from Tuskegee University in 2015.  Even though she lived in New York briefly and worked at a white advertising agency, she felt a calling that was bigger than fat paychecks and job promotions.Originally from Los Angeles, she has observed struggling black communities on the West Coast, East Coast and Deep South. The struggle does not deter her instead it motivates her to fight for change. This is why she returned to Tuskegee, where jobs are limited to a few dollar stores and fast food restaurants. She is a disciple of the Booker T. Washington “Cast down your bucket where you are”  empowerment gospel. Jazlyn interpreted this famous saying to mean use the resources you have to get to the next level.Fate connected Jazlyn to Karin Hopkins, a Tuskegee resident who is a veteran communications professional and seasoned entrepreneur. Like most people today, Karin uses computer technology to access news and and other content.

<p>8) We need to do S.E.O. (search engine optimization) for both sites</p>
<p>9) We need a new PC for studio B to do better broadcasts!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've been operating this station for 9 years with no investment capital except the cash from my friends &amp; I's pockets. I work for the station full time now, so I can't fix financial problems like I use to when I was working. My closet friends are all married or have children so they can't help like they use too. So we are reaching out to you guys to help us continue to impact Baltimore &amp; create awesome content for the fans!!!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For many many years VVCRadio.com was not making enough money to pay any of it's bills. We have been under staffed for our entire existence. After I took a long hard look at how other stations have structured their platforms. We began to adjust to become more effective &amp; financially sound. Within 6 months we've become more stable than ever before! But we aren't out of the woods yet. We are looking at another 6 months to a year before we are fully financially stable. We need to make these changes to increase site activity, search engine visibility &amp; ease of use for the casual user. Our app needs to be fully functional to attract the desired user base. Lastly we want to make sure we are broadcasting the best product on the web with crisp sound &amp; great music!! We can definitely do this!! We are adding new shows every month, working with artists &amp; labels all over the country &amp; are building fresh new aggressive fan base that will help carry us into the future!! </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We are Bryan and Pat, two documentary filmmakers with a passion for storytelling.</p>
<p>We're riding our bikes across the United States to have a bonding experience as brothers and to tell the story of our journey.</p>
<p>We recently started a blog called <a href=""http://www.livehigh.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Live High</a> which is all about following your passion, doing what you love and going on adventures-- this is the theme for our journey and the platform we will use to vlog along the way.</p>
<p>We also both share a passion for inspiring youth and have connected with a 2nd and 4th grade class who will be tracking us on our journey and Skyping with us as we go.</p>
<p>Our plan is to document both our journey, and the stories of the people we meet along the way. We will also be vlogging the behind the scenes of making a film while on the road.</p>
<p>This journey is all about adventure, sharing stories and spreading love and inspiration. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;'>What We Need</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000.</p>
<p>We really want to use this journey as an opportunity to not only make a film, but to give back to our local community. We paired up with the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Marshfield and will be donating half of everything we raise as scholarships for families that cannot afford the fees to the club.</p>
<p>Between film and cycling equipment, we have already spent over $8,000 out of pocket for this trip and will not have any income for the three months we are on the road. The funds we raise will go to offsetting some of these costs as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we are able to raise our goal, we will be able to support at least 12 families to send their kids to the Boys &amp; Girls Club.</p>
<p>This will also help us with the immediate costs of the trip and producing our content.</p>
<p>Our main focus is spreading the message of Live High and inspiring kids and anyone else who follows our journey to follow their hearts.</p>
<p>By contributing, you will be helping us share this message.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is making a film while on the road and doing so on a really small budget. At the very bare minimum, we will be releasing a polished vlog/web series that documents the journey and will also be updating daily on <a href=""http://livehigh.org/snapchat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Snapchat</a>.</p>

<p>Maram Jaberi and Talal Mahmood are not only filmmakers but passionate individuals who care about content and story telling. And what is more realistic than conveying stories that hit close to home? We say: nothing really. </p>
<p>Inspired by one of Hip Hop’s most ingenious and popular songs of the 90s, our latest collaboration aims to rejuvenate that priceless era with a fun and light hearted approach. We aim to shed some light onto Middle Eastern pop culture and its’ ideologies of the West and to shatter the portrayal of media.  Most importantly, we will take a stance on feminism, and more specifically the Arab woman; her bravery, her coolness, her normalcy, her existing freedoms. </p>
<p>Our highly relatable protagonist will drive the story and take us through her day which, no spoilers intended, is a great day. It is through her that we realise that the East and West are only separated by the distance between them.</p>
<p>As filmmakers, Maram and Talal have worked on various projects including a documentary about the first ever Women’s Football League in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Their strong stance on the role of women in the world plays a pivotal role in attracting audiences and creating movements of change in their region. Having worked with such themes, they are familiar with the hurdles they may face; scrutiny from society but also their appraise for making such bold statements. It is by developing subtle and powerful messages in a creative and witty way that they are able to overcome these obstacles. They understand the importance of controversy, because they know that all significant stories are almost always contestable. </p>
<p>We have come to Indiegogo because we value and appreciate the way it helps creatives like us. We understand that it takes an accumulative effort in order to bring a vision to life. The funding that we require for our four minute music video is mainly going into post production and distribution as we have extensive plans to reach out to as many appropriate film festivals and online platforms as possible. Besides financial help, we also require to spread the word: something hilarious, yet so real, is coming!</p>

Our highly relatable protagonist will drive the story and take us through her day which, no spoilers intended, is a great day. It is through her that we realise that the East and West are only separated by the distance between them.
As filmmakers, Maram and Talal have worked on various projects including a documentary about the first ever Women’s Football League in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Their strong stance on the role of women in the world plays a pivotal role in attracting audiences and creating movements of change in their region. Having worked with such themes, they are familiar with the hurdles they may face; scrutiny from society but also their appraise for making such bold statements. It is by developing subtle and powerful messages in a creative and witty way that they are able to overcome these obstacles. They understand the importance of controversy, because they know that all significant stories are almost always contestable. 
We have come to Indiegogo because we value and appreciate the way it helps creatives like us. We understand that it takes an accumulative effort in order to bring a vision to life. The funding that we require for our four minute music video is mainly going into post production and distribution as we have extensive plans to reach out to as many appropriate film festivals and online platforms as possible. Besides financial help, we also require to spread the word: something hilarious, yet so real, is coming!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>A QUESTION OF SURVIVAL: </strong>the Story of Three Bulgarian Jews and the Holocaust </h3><p> </p><p>                                                         <strong>Documentary film by Elka Nikolova</strong></p><p> </p><p>Holocaust stories have been told in dozens of films, both documentaries and features. While several have examined how Denmark rescued most of its Jews, few have touched on the complex story of my native country, Bulgaria. The short version: After enacting harsh anti-Semitic legislation in 1941-1942, in March 1943 the Bulgarian government, an ally to Germany, rounded up and handed over to Nazi Germany 11,343 Jews from Macedonia and Northern Greece, territories it occupied during the war. They all perished at Treblinka. The 48,000 Bulgarian Jews were next. After public outcry from a handful of prominent politicians, and of the Orthodox Church hierarchy, and some citizens in March 1943 the government called off the deportation of the Bulgarian Jews, thus sparing their lives. After the war, many Bulgarian Jews emigrated to Palestine, then en masse to Israel. Some of those who eventually settled in the U.S. have struggled to determine where their experiences fit into the common narrative of the Holocaust. .Are they survivors, even though they weren’t sent to concentration camps?  ""A Question of Survival” explores that controversial question.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581005512/z0v3yyhbi4ya1uv8lafe.jpg"" src=""""/>                                      With Misha, Robert, and Chaim during filming of their meeting </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>WHY AM I MAKING THIS FILM?</strong></p><p>I learned about this part of my country’s history after I arrived in New York City in 1994 and later met a few Bulgarian Jews here. Growing up in Bulgaria during the communist period, I heard very little discussion about it--maybe a paragraph or two in our history textbooks. I found the story fascinating but I was also puzzled as to why so few people in America knew anything about it. When I started discussing it with survivors, historians, public figures, and regular people, I was struck by the confusion of what they knew, and how they actually talked about it.</p><p>I met Misha Avramoff, Robert Bakish, and Chaim Zemach in New York in 2009, and knew that I had to capture their stories while they were still alive. I began shooting interviews with them. They had all lived through the war in Bulgaria as children aged 5-17, and emigrated to America with their families in the 1940s and 50s.  All were affected by their unusual survival, the realization in hindsight of how close they came to death. Each has struggled to make sense of his own story.</p><p>There are many different interpretations of why the Bulgarian Jews escaped extermination by the Nazis. Opinions depend upon political affiliation. It is true that during the war the Bulgarian government treated Jews as second class citizens: they were forced to wear small yellow stars and forbidden to operate their own businesses, their property was expropriated, Jewish men were sent to labor camps, and in May 1943 the Sofia Jews were dispersed in the provinces. And yet the particular political circumstances and sparks of tolerant empathy made it possible for a small segment of the public to pressure the government to first postpone, and later on to cancel the scheduled deportation of Bulgarian Jews to the death camps in 1943. That act of courage - of a small but vocal coalition of Bulgarians - inspired me to tell this story.  </p><p>On the other hand the story remains extremely politicized and controversial.  While the Bulgarian government spared its own country’s Jews, it handed over to Nazi Germany 11,343 Jews from Macedonia and Northern Greece, who all perished. The incongruity left both Jewish and Christian Bulgarians to struggle with conflicting feelings of pride and shame. </p><p>Until 1989 Bulgaria remained closed off behind the Iron Curtain, access to its archives was constrained, and there was no freedom for intellectual debates. Only after the fall of the communist regime was access finally allowed, and competing narratives of the Holocaust emerged. The survival of the 48,000 Bulgarian Jews did not always fit comfortably into the already existing Holocaust narratives. It also posed uneasy questions, such as: What was the role of public resistance in saving the Jewish population? Why didn't similar resistance happen in other countries? How could the Bulgarian people hand off one population of Jews to be slaughtered, while protecting their own? As a result this story remains little known, its tremendous value lost in controversy and confusion. </p><p>My documentary aims to shine light on the relevance of this chapter in history to our current political climate, where minorities are scapegoated for political gain, and where the role of public opinion in protecting them is ever more critical. An important part of this documentary is the larger immigrant story, and the refuge the families of Misha Avfamoff, Robert Bakish, Chaim Zemach, as well as myself, were able to find in America. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>                                                                    ABOUT THE FILM</strong></p><p>My search to make meaning of history is at the center of this film. Though the events of this story happened more than 75 years ago, I can identify with Misha, Robert, and Chaim’s struggle to find a sense of belonging and meaning in their experiences. As an immigrant myself I understand their longing for a sense of home and the hardship that leaving your country behind  brings to a family. The world I grew up in changed forever in 1989, when the fall of the Berlin Wall spread regime change across Eastern Europe. As an immigrant I understand what it means to pick up the pieces and try to rebuild your life in a new place. </p><p>As a filmmaker it made the most sense to me to tell this story using this medium. This film is not a historical documentary: its goal is not to retell in detail the historical events of 1943 or to convey conceptual interpretations.  Rather, I aim to explore the aftermath of the cancelled deportation of Bulgaria’s Jews and the effects that it had on the lives of three men from Bulgaria. Since Misha, Chaim and Robert were children at the time, they saw the world around them as a less threatening place. This enabled Chaim to think about going away as an adventure, or Misha to remember the beautiful suitcases his mother bought, or Robert to recall going skiing when his family was resettled. The adults, of course, sensed the danger, and tried desperately to shield their children from it. This is a film about asking the questions that arise from this confusion and trying to make sense of it. This is also a film that asks: where does the Bulgarian story belong in the overall narrative of the Holocaust? Can we see its value? Why does it make us uncomfortable? </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581005575/xniv4mbyjbwkbk7v2ufo.png"" src=""""/>                                                  Misha visiting Hilda Weitman, a Polish survivor</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHERE IS THE FILMMAKING PROCESS NOW?</strong></p><p>Filming is complete. We are seeking $25,000 to fund the post-production phase. Two-thirds of that will go toward editing, and one-third toward sound and color grading, purchasing archival footage, and music rights. With your generous contribution, we will be able to complete the final editing and bring this film to the finish line. Making a film requires teamwork. We invite you, the viewer, to become part of the making of this important story.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that we are so far removed from the events of 1943, I feel deeply connected to them. My hope is that you will connect to this story in a similar way, and it will speak to you on a personal level. Because no matter how different someone's experiences are, we can find a way to connect to them. We all have known a survivor, an immigrant, or a child that needs our help and understanding. This connection with people can make a difference in moments when they most need it, when their life depends on it. This is what the Bulgarian story teaches us. It was not that no Bulgarians were antisemitic--but there were enough people who saw a neighbor or a friend whose life was being threatened, and took action that made a difference. I invite you to be that person by contributing to this project and helping to bring this story to others. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>Time is the essence--unfortunately Robert Bakish passed away in 2019, and was not able to see the finished film. We’d love to complete the film as soon as possible so Misha and Chaim as well as Robert's family can attend the premiere. It’s important for us to be able to thank them in public for their stories, and their courage to speak openly about their struggles. Without them, this piece of history would be lost forever. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TEAM</strong></p><p><strong>Elka Nikolova, Director/Producer/Editor</strong></p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581006432/y8wfio5shtsdox6spf2u.jpg"" src=""""/>              </p><p>Elka Nikolova was born in Bulgaria and studied psychology at the University of Sofia before she moved to the United States in 1994.

We are seeking $25,000 to fund the post-production phase. Two-thirds of that will go toward editing, and one-third toward sound and color grading, purchasing archival footage, and music rights. With your generous contribution, we will be able to complete the final editing and bring this film to the finish line. Making a film requires teamwork. We invite you, the viewer, to become part of the making of this important story.   WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?Despite the fact that we are so far removed from the events of 1943, I feel deeply connected to them. My hope is that you will connect to this story in a similar way, and it will speak to you on a personal level. Because no matter how different someone's experiences are, we can find a way to connect to them. We all have known a survivor, an immigrant, or a child that needs our help and understanding. This connection with people can make a difference in moments when they most need it, when their life depends on it. This is what the Bulgarian story teaches us. It was not that no Bulgarians were antisemitic--but there were enough people who saw a neighbor or a friend whose life was being threatened, and took action that made a difference. I invite you to be that person by contributing to this project and helping to bring this story to others.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESTime is the essence--unfortunately Robert Bakish passed away in 2019, and was not able to see the finished film. We’d love to complete the film as soon as possible so Misha and Chaim as well as Robert's family can attend the premiere. It’s important for us to be able to thank them in public for their stories, and their courage to speak openly about their struggles. Without them, this piece of history would be lost forever.  TEAMElka Nikolova, Director/Producer/Editor               Elka Nikolova was born in Bulgaria and studied psychology at the University of Sofia before she moved to the United States in 1994.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>CLOWNS IN THE WOODS is an independent horror movie with creepy villains, twisted kills, and a spooky small-town atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the tradition of CANDYMAN and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, this will be a horror movie about the sins of the past, as a younger generation must grapple with the consequences of past injustice.</p>
<p>We have been fans of horror films since a young age, especially independent regional horror films. We want to create a horror movie which is inspired by the 2016 clown sightings, and to incorporate and include people with disabilities in both the story and the production.</p>
<p>Since our co-director Adrian Esposito is on the Autism spectrum, we feel this film is important because it has the potential to break the mold of how people with disabilities are seen.</p>
<p>Our film has a prominent lead role for an actor with a disability. This character, Marcus, is a young man who is bullied in the community and dies when a vicious prank goes wrong. He then comes back from the grave as a killer clown, to enact revenge on those who have wronged him. He enacts his revenge with the help of other killer clowns, who have their own slapstick methods of causing death and destruction.</p>
<p>One of Marcus’s few friends in life was his neighbor Amy, a lesbian college student. As the deaths pile up, Amy is determined to learn the deadly secret behind the recent wave of murders, little realizing that she may be putting herself and her loved ones in danger.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people are prejudiced against low-budget horror movies. We want to change this by including people with disabilities in them. We also want to show that there is value in horror genre storytelling, by diving into the worlds of make-believe and dark fantasy, and by having characters get their just desserts that they would escape from in real life.</p>
<p>We hope that you will help us achieve our goal of making this innovative and timely horror movie a reality.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We have a long history of independent filmmaking.</p>
<p>Co-director <strong>Adrian Esposito</strong>’s credits include producing and writing a narrative film called Bury My Heart With Tonawanda.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>When a struggling sales team receives a mandatory invitation to a company team builder, they expect another boring event full of ice breakers, trust falls, and other mindless corporate exercises.</p>
<p>Their sales manager has other ideas, though: he’s booked them all a hunting retreat to try and instill a killer instinct into his team and make them the most competitive sales members in the region.  </p>
<p>Some employees embrace the spirit of the trip. Others see it as another waste of the company’s resources. None of them are ready for what’s waiting for them in the wilderness: the woods are ground zero for an evolved strain of Chronic Wasting Disease, a sickness afflicting deer that causes their brains and bodies to rot into a zombie state.  This new strain has made the deer aggressive, and capable of transmitting the disease to people.</p>
<p>When the sales staff heads into the woods with a grizzled hunting guide, their corporate retreat quickly turns into a trip from hell as an infected, rotting deer attacks their group, killing the guide and leaving the hapless employees on their own in the middle of the wilderness.  It’s up to the team to learn how to work together long enough to survive, while uncovering the reasons for the attacking deer and the terrifying disease they carry.</p>
<p>As the body count rises and the deer’s attacks become more devastating, old rivalries surface that drive the team apart and have them fighting each other along with the creatures attacking them.  In a thrilling finale the surviving sales members must defeat the zombie deer, their infected co-workers, and their back-stabbing peers to see which species will emerge as the reigning king of the food chain.</p>
<p>ZOMBIE DEER is a horror-comedy that asks the question “What if Jaws were set in the woods, and featured a killer deer instead of a great white shark?”  It’s “The Office” meets “Grizzly” with a little “Night of the Living Dead” thrown in for good measure.     </p>
<p>This film will be a comedic horror film looking to make social commentaries and bring more awareness of the disease Chronic Wasting:</p>
<ul>
<li>The team involved has created multiple low-budget horror films and tv shows.  Gregg Elder (Bludgeoned, Backwoods), Ebonye Delaney (Blue Shift, Black Wing), David Quiroz (The Lonely Ones, 'Promise: The Sgt Lane Chronicles), Matthew Shilts (Nano Ridge), Andrew Krieghoff (Backwoods 2) Samantha Erdmann (Haters Make Me Famous), Matthew Schaub (G Squad), Steven Green (Blood Orgy of the Dammed)</li>
<li>The film will be fun and entertaining and a good way to get people talking about Chronic Wasting. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a chronic, fatal disease of the central nervous system in mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and moose.</li>
<li>Our contributors will be our life blood to create our special effects.  All effects are to be done practically on set. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The film will completed on a 100 acre farm in Wisconsin.  We need to house, travel, and feed our cast and crew (5k).  Our biggest expense is our special effects (15K).  Creating the deer and safe amazing action scenes.  </li>
<li>Our perks let you get involved and help our cause and our art.  The more involved you are the bigger audience we can reach.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal we will try to complete the project with the amount raised.  If we go over our goal, 50% of any money raised above our goal will be donated to Chronic Waisting Research.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>There are many ways to get the word out about diseases like Chronic Wasting.  We feel a vehicle like this film will reach sections of the population that wouldn't normally see the specials, documents, and documentaries on the subject.  In order to compete in the marketplace to be seen, we need make our film</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>Entertaining</li>
<li>Memorable</li>
<li>Safe</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

ZOMBIE DEER is a horror-comedy that asks the question “What if Jaws were set in the woods, and featured a killer deer instead of a great white shark?”  It’s “The Office” meets “Grizzly” with a little “Night of the Living Dead” thrown in for good measure.     
This film will be a comedic horror film looking to make social commentaries and bring more awareness of the disease Chronic Wasting:

The team involved has created multiple low-budget horror films and tv shows.  Gregg Elder (Bludgeoned, Backwoods), Ebonye Delaney (Blue Shift, Black Wing), David Quiroz (The Lonely Ones, 'Promise: The Sgt Lane Chronicles), Matthew Shilts (Nano Ridge), Andrew Krieghoff (Backwoods 2) Samantha Erdmann (Haters Make Me Famous), Matthew Schaub (G Squad), Steven Green (Blood Orgy of the Dammed)
The film will be fun and entertaining and a good way to get people talking about Chronic Wasting. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a chronic, fatal disease of the central nervous system in mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and moose.
Our contributors will be our life blood to create our special effects.  All effects are to be done practically on set. 


Challenges

The film will completed on a 100 acre farm in Wisconsin.  We need to house, travel, and feed our cast and crew (5k).  Our biggest expense is our special effects (15K).  Creating the deer and safe amazing action scenes.  
Our perks let you get involved and help our cause and our art.  The more involved you are the bigger audience we can reach.
If we don't reach our goal we will try to complete the project with the amount raised.  If we go over our goal, 50% of any money raised above our goal will be donated to Chronic Waisting Research.  


There are many ways to get the word out about diseases like Chronic Wasting.  We feel a vehicle like this film will reach sections of the population that wouldn't normally see the specials, documents, and documentaries on the subject.  In order to compete in the marketplace to be seen, we need make our film

</div><h3><b>STEPPIN' / CHICAGO STYLE STEPPIN'</b></h3><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Steppin’ (also known as Chicago-style Stepping) is an urban
dance that originated in Chicago. The dance is defined by its unique style and
culture within the larger world of Swing Dance. Just as anyone at the top of their game can be called a Heavy Hitter,
so, too, are the steppers who are at the top of their game called Heavy
Hitters. They Step when they want to have a good time, but they also compete for recognition in friendly dance battles all the
way to competing in organized contests for cash prizes. T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he steppers challenge and dare each other with unique moves and footwork.  </span>Steppin’ also includes the addictive aura of music
and has its own sub-genre of music known as Steppers Grooves because of the
particular beat and tempo of the songs. <span>I’m also committed to showcasing the Indie artists whose
music has helped fuel the dance by featuring their music in the film.</span> Most of them don't get radio airplay, but are big stars in the Steppers world. Showing real steppers dancing to their genre of music puts them in their element and will contribute to the authenticity of the film. Steppin’ was popular in Chicago and the Midwest,
but after the release of R. Kelly’s 2003 mega-hit “Step in the Name of Love,”
popularity of the dance skyrocketed and swept across the country. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I believe that Steppin’ is a valid aspect of Chicago’s
cultural identity. The </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">world of

Although HEAVY HITTERS is a drama, it is infused with bits of documentary-style film making in order to include actual Steppin' history and show the passion it inspires. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Everyone wants to see their unique expressions and identities recognized and valued as part of the human record, and HEAVY HITTERS is an excellent way to accomplish this for the art of Steppin'. In

Heavy Hitters of the dance whose style, moves, and footwork are legendary. The story is structured to marry the narrative with

<p>HEAVY HITTERS will be produced in stages as we raise sufficient funds to carry out each stage. Steps for each stage are laid out in the actions listed
below. In addition to raising funds, our main fundraising goal is to
keep production entirely in our hands so we can have complete creative control
and keep the original story intact. </p>
<p><b>STAGE ONE - $20,000</b> (Time Frame – 60 days)</p>
<p>When we reach $20,000, we can begin Development and Pre-Production, which
should cover the Above-the-Line costs, including Script, Storyboard, Casting, Scout
Locations, selecting the crew, selecting vendors for equipment, renting gear, tech
scout, a table read, auditions. In addition, we can produce a 5-minute pitch reel to expand
our outreach to a wider audience. </p>
<p><b>STAGE TWO </b></p>
<p>Production – In Stage Two we will begin actual production. By this point we will have completed
the shooting script, the budget, and the schedule to make everything work. All of the
key elements will have been locked down in preparation to start production, and
we can begin shooting the less complicated scenes. Then we'll move on to <span style=""background-color: initial;"">the more difficult or complicated scenes and complete principle photography. This requires additional pre-production, choreography, staging, and costs associated
with a large cast for the big finale. All the money raised will be spent directly toward increased production value,
including costs such as wardrobe, building and designing sets, securing locations,  travel, and craft services for cast and crew, and most importantly, to pay our talent and production crew.</span></p>
<p><b>STAGE THREE</b></p>
<p>Post-Production – In Stage Three we will begin
editing, color correction, special effects, sound design and re-recording, secure music licenses, digital art, photography, and any
other necessary processes in post-production.</p>
<p><b>STAGE FOUR </b></p>
<p>Marketing &amp; Publicity – In Stage Four we will begin the marketing process for the film, including festival costs. We will also continue our grassroots
marketing strategy to supplement the cost of the film’s promotion. </p>

<p></p>
<p>We
wouldn’t ask you to believe in us if we didn’t believe in ourselves. We’ve
already spent almost $9,000 on costs related to HEAVY HITTERS, including  a concept trailer and associated expenses, legal fees, and artwork.</p>
<p>There are risks and challenges in any creative project,
including film making. However, we have put together an experienced team whose
members are so dedicated to the successful completion of this film that our
passion will help us surmount any obstacles presented. We will also pursue additional
supplemental fundraising avenues.</p>
<p>Delays that are out of our control, such as inclement
weather or devastating acts of nature such as an earthquake, tornado, or
hurricane could cause major disruption in production. Problems such as actor or
equipment issues and rescheduling might cause delay, but can be overcome. But,
delay is not defeat, and we will not stop until HEAVY HITTERS is completed and audiences
flocking to see it.  </p>
<p>We started planning this project in 2012 and have invested a
lot of time, energy, sweat and tears to see it through. We don’t want to disappoint ourselves, but more importantly, we don’t want to disappoint our
supporters. </p>

STEPPIN' / CHICAGO STYLE STEPPIN'

Steppin’ (also known as Chicago-style Stepping) is an urban
dance that originated in Chicago. The dance is defined by its unique style and
culture within the larger world of Swing Dance. Just as anyone at the top of their game can be called a Heavy Hitter,
so, too, are the steppers who are at the top of their game called Heavy
Hitters. They Step when they want to have a good time, but they also compete for recognition in friendly dance battles all the
way to competing in organized contests for cash prizes. The steppers challenge and dare each other with unique moves and footwork.  Steppin’ also includes the addictive aura of music
and has its own sub-genre of music known as Steppers Grooves because of the
particular beat and tempo of the songs. I’m also committed to showcasing the Indie artists whose
music has helped fuel the dance by featuring their music in the film. Most of them don't get radio airplay, but are big stars in the Steppers world. Showing real steppers dancing to their genre of music puts them in their element and will contribute to the authenticity of the film. Steppin’ was popular in Chicago and the Midwest,
but after the release of R. Kelly’s 2003 mega-hit “Step in the Name of Love,”
popularity of the dance skyrocketed and swept across the country. I believe that Steppin’ is a valid aspect of Chicago’s
cultural identity. The world of
Steppin’ has its own culture, including music, style of dress, and attitude. This world is real to the steppers, and I respect that world. Bottom line...I want the steppers to be proud of this film. Our desire is for HEAVY HITTERS to be
commercially successful as well as become a cult classic that will endure
throughout the years.

Video of Contest
Steppin' is fun, great exercise, and the contests can be quite competitive. The Steppin' community is a loosely-knit family of people nationwide who enjoy the dance and camaraderie of traveling the country to attend different themed Steppin' conventions. These events have expanded in scope to include workshops in finance, health and diet, history, honoring pioneers of the dance, and more. This is one of my favorite videos of a Steppin' contest and a good example of an energetic performance, creative Steppin' moves, techniques, and footwork.

with a large cast for the big finale. All the money raised will be spent directly toward increased production value,
including costs such as wardrobe, building and designing sets, securing locations,  travel, and craft services for cast and crew, and most importantly, to pay our talent and production crew.
STAGE THREE
Post-Production – In Stage Three we will begin
editing, color correction, special effects, sound design and re-recording, secure music licenses, digital art, photography, and any
other necessary processes in post-production.
STAGE FOUR 
Marketing & Publicity – In Stage Four we will begin the marketing process for the film, including festival costs. We will also continue our grassroots
marketing strategy to supplement the cost of the film’s promotion. 
NOTICE:

~If your perk is an appearance in the film or special screening, you must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to participate. 
~ Some perk dates, times, and locations may be subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances, such as weather, production delays, etc.
                                                          ~~~~~

If you have any
ideas for perks that you’d like to see included, or other ways you can
contribute, please get in touch with us and we’ll see how we can accommodate
you. This is all about collaboration and we’re open to suggestions.
                                                        ~~~~~
In the event we don't reach our stated goal, we will either scale down the scope of the film or put the funds in an escrow account and seek other resources until we have enough money to continue.

RISKS & CHALLENGES

 

We
wouldn’t ask you to believe in us if we didn’t believe in ourselves. We’ve
already spent almost $9,000 on costs related to HEAVY HITTERS, including  a concept trailer and associated expenses, legal fees, and artwork.
There are risks and challenges in any creative project,
including film making. However, we have put together an experienced team whose
members are so dedicated to the successful completion of this film that our
passion will help us surmount any obstacles presented. We will also pursue additional
supplemental fundraising avenues.
Delays that are out of our control, such as inclement
weather or devastating acts of nature such as an earthquake, tornado, or
hurricane could cause major disruption in production. Problems such as actor or
equipment issues and rescheduling might cause delay, but can be overcome. But,
delay is not defeat, and we will not stop until HEAVY HITTERS is completed and audiences
flocking to see it.  
We started planning this project in 2012 and have invested a
lot of time, energy, sweat and tears to see it through. We don’t want to disappoint ourselves, but more importantly, we don’t want to disappoint our
supporters.

<b><u>More about the movie:</u></b><i> All of Me</i> is a feature
length documentary film focused on the lives of people who are
caught in the downward spiral of eating disorders and their struggle to regain
a sense of self-compassion and healing. Eating Disorders, which include Bulimia, Anorexia, Restricted Eating,
and Binge Eating, are one of the most hidden forms of addiction and disease in
our society. The film focuses on body image, a lack
of connection with one’s physical and emotional being, and the need to delve
deep within one’s self to find the systemic reasons that triggered the disease. The film is primarily shot in Vermont, however it will be
distributed across the United States.
<p>Eating disorders are an addiction that we often do not perceive as such because it is the process of depriving oneself of the basic human need
to eat. But anorexia, bulimia and binging are ways to fill a hole in one’s
self—in the same way that drugs fill a hole of depression, anger, anxiety,
despair. Eating disorders stem from a feeling of “I’m not good enough” and,
like drug addiction, not eating somehow makes the person feel that they have a
coping skill; not eating is one way to control a part of
you that feels lost. Binge eating is also a coping skill and body
image issue. And, like drug addiction, the beginning of an eating
disorder can spiral into a full blown crisis where not eating food becomes the
overriding obsessive monster that takes over one’s life. In fact,Eating Disorders are one of the hardest addictions to treat and to cure.
We are inundated with images that promote “thinness” and many people can become
obsessed with their body types to the point of taking unhealthy control of
their eating habits.

with, but will also delve into discovering the internal and systemic reasons
for eating disorders, such as low self esteem, trauma, mental health issues, a lack of self compassion and
sense of isolation that many young girls, boys and women feel.  There is
also a profound lack of connection to one’s physical body that happens with
eating disorders—women detach from their inner physical, soulful self and
fixate on their appearance only. What is this about? How do women and men get to this
place? What trigger pushes them to stop eating? Why does this control of food
become so critical to survive? What are the immediate external issues that are
pushing girls and boys to take control of their lives by controlling their
eating? How does our culture of driven perfection play into all this? How can
we provide prevention and intervention to folks who are susceptible to this
disease? How do we bring those afflicted back into their bodies in a
meditative, inclusive way that grounds them and empowers them, offering a sense
of wholeness rather than division?</p>
<p>The film will also highlight the work of Bree Greenberg-Benjamin who
runs <i>the Vermont Center for Integrative</i>
<i>Therapy</i> in Burlington, VT. Her
treatment center focuses on eating disorders. The film will focus on a number of her patients and the innovative work
that she is doing to treat folks with eating disorders. Bree is an expert in
the field and believes that, in order to heal folks, one must take a holistic
approach to treatment. Bree’s work includes not only talk therapy, but in-depth
work to bring these people back <i>into </i>their bodies through interventions
including meditation, yoga, acupuncture and group therapy.</p>
<p><b><u>Telling your story heals and starts an authentic
conversation:</u></b> We know that telling your story helps heal people. The girls, boys, women

their voices and speak out about this very invisible addiction.  Through

<p>I’m Eric Hamburg.  Along with my partner Rick English, we’re
producing a documentary called “Darryl Jones:  Like A Rolling Stone”.</p>
<p>This is a documentary film inspired by the story of Darryl Jones,
musician extraordinaire and bass player for the Rolling Stones.  He is
cool, calm, unflappable, but rock solid, both as a player and a person, always
watching, listening and learning.  His keen intelligence informs
everything that he does.  He is also a teacher and a mentor to young
musicians.  Interviews for the film have already been conducted with Keith
Richards, Ron Wood, Charlie Watts and others.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Many films have been made
about the Stones, but none from this kind of unique insider’s perspective.
 The film is somewhat comparable to the Oscar winning “Twenty Feet from
Stardom”, with a bit of “Gimme Shelter” as well.  The film is made with
the complete cooperation of Darryl Jones.  It is the story of his musical
career, but will also document the making of Darryl’s first solo album, which
is now in the works. </p>
<p>Rick and I are lifelong
Stones fans, so this project is a labor of love.  I’ve produced films like
NIXON and ANY GIVEN SUNDAY with people like Oliver Stone and Anthony Hopkins.
 Rick has done photography and video work for companies such as Nike,
Apple and others.  Together, we made a documentary called “PREVENTING
GENOCIDE”, featuring world leaders such as Kofi Annan, Bishop Desmond Tutu and
others.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is an exciting new
project for us, and we want to share it with you.  Making a documentary is
not cheap, especially a music documentary.  You need to get music rights,
permissions and clearances, and pay legal fees as well as costs for filming and
editing.  That’s why we’re asking for your help.</p>
<p>We’re launching an
Indiegogo campaign to help raise funds for the film.  Depending on levels
of giving, our perks will include everything from picks and T-Shirts to dinner
with Darryl and opportunites to jam with him or watch him record in the studio.</p>
<p>Whatever you can give will
help us make this film.  If you can’t give now, you can still help by
spreading the word about the film.  Thanks very much for your help!</p>

Since the moment you read this, you're already part of this process, you're already givin life to this baby, to this project.And for that, I thank you, THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking time to read this and to consider be part of this great project. THANK YOU.Film Synopsis      Summer Vibe is the intrepid adventure between two friends who work for the same advertising firm.  Together, they spend a month and a half business trip for a Beach Volleyball tournament in Los Cabos, Mexico where they end up having the time of their lives.George, the party guy, who's always trying to pick up chicks, finds a way to bring his best friend Steve down to Mexico for their adventure.Steve, the workaholic, finds the love of his life: the beautiful and athletic Sarah.Steve finds out that Sarah is a beach volleyball player, and George convinces him to enter the Beach Volleyball tournament in order to win Sarah’s heart.The only problem is Sarah's ex-boyfriend Jack, an egocentric narcissist beach volleyball player.Jack also entered the Tournament with hopes of keeping Sarah while trying to defeat Steve and George.With some knowledge in the indoors volleyball game, they seek the help of a trainer who just so happens to be a narcoleptic ex-professional player named Void.Feel & Look


What We Need & What You GetWe need $150,000 USD for this movie to be made.The money is going to be use for:Casting: We want to have the best cast possible on a budget, we're trying to connect with people that add a unique experience to this project.The project will have a multicultural and international talent, people from the US, Canada and Mexico.Pre Production:The location scout and perfect sceneries for a movie takes time and movie and specially, cost money. Local permits, rent deposit and more.We are also having rehearsals, something any good movie needs, you cannot give your script to an actor and expect everything to be peachy, you need to rehearse and you need to be there with them, all of them and make changes if needed.Set design: Even tho the setting of the movie is going to be in Los Cabos, we do need to create the bleachers for extras to be a part of this experience, if you want to be a part of this experience lets us know and we will be pleased to have you around the shooting dates (Travel expenses NOT INCLUDED)EPK (Electronic Press Kit): Creating an EPK we will inform media outlets about this project, the one that you are allowing to come to life.Marketing:Any movie needs marketing, we have a strategy in mind, YOU, letting you guys be a part of all this is going to be our best marketing campaign and being a part of social networks (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat) We need content creators for this and Influencers to be part of this project, that's going to be our strategy.Production:We're shooting on RED camera and GoPro cameras for the special looks of the film, since it is going to be on the beach and it's going to be a sport comedy movie, there's a lot of action on a beach volleyball game and we want to be able to capture most of the stuff around.The heart of the movie; THE CREW, needs to be paid, needs to be fed and needs to be happy with long hours under the sun, moving around sand with heavy equipment while they're being careful with it.We also need to pay for the location, catering, assistants, drivers and all the people that helps us in the production.That's where we are going to spend most of the money.Post Production:Editing:Having a lot of footage on 4K takes A LOT of storage, We're going to have an assistant editor browsing for the best shots and setting things up for the chief editor to go thru EVERYDAYThe advantage of having a digital workflow is that if we mess up one shot, we can reschedule faster than waiting for film to be developed and sit thru dailies to re schedule months after everyone is home.Color Correction:Every GREAT, AMAZING, SUPERB movie you've seen has Color correction, this is needed for style and composition.Audio Master:ADR (Aditional Dialogue Recording) If we have a seagull screaming MINE, MINE, MINE, MINE while a line of dialogue is being said, we're NOT going to leave it like that, we do need to record it again, that's where ADR comes in.Sound Mixing:When you watch a movie, the steps, closing doors or fingers snapping sounds aren't actually recorded right there, you need to add it later and there's where the sound mix comes in handy.MUSIC RIGHTS:The music plays a really important part of any movie, since it sets up tone, climax and situations nicely and naturally. We do need to secure those rights if we want to have that music in there.And finallyFINAL CUT:No, not the apple software, the Final Cut of the film, the one all of you are going to enjoy, the one that you guys are making a possibility, the one that is going to be sent over digitally or on Blu Ray, We need to create those!In any case we do not reach our goal, the money will be designated for pre-production and we're going to modify our budget to make at least a short film with it and have you guys enjoy what could've been.We're going to make SOMETHING with that money and since you guys placed your trust on us, we're going to make it a short film.The ImpactIndieGoGo suggests I point out my successful track record with projects like this here, unfortunately I don't have one(YET) But with your trust WE can have a successful track record. I have many other projects (TV Commercial and Corporate videos projects) But not a feature film.

UNAS started 2 years ago when I first heard how much money companies like Facebook and YouTube were earning on video advertisement. They are earning billions because advertisers want to reach us with their commercials. I, like many others, was bothered of how often these ads were played. I didn’t visit those websites for advertisement but to stay in touch with friends &amp; family or to watch the latest music videos. This whole industry is so inefficient that making and selling ad blockers is a profitable business now, yet advertisers keep spending billions on those websites… I knew something had to change and I started thinking about what I could do to change all of this. There should be a place where we are willing to see ads in order to keep the other websites ad free, but in order for me as a user to visit any website and watch ads willingly it had to be about more than just keeping Youtube &amp; Facebook ad free. Then in January 2015 I knew what I had to do. The website would be donating to charities!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473147770/iim7hgirm0hcuuvkc3rf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>I quickly searched for a team that could get this idea of the ground and only contacted the brightest people.

We will also be able to stop funding those charities who say they do good but actually are not doing anything worthwhile. In order to keep social control on charities we have built a community section where all of you can discuss certain charities and their projects. This way we can educate each other and make sure we support those charities who are really trying to create a positive impact.

Impact videos are videos of achievements by the charity that leave us with a happy feeling instead of guilt. Videos of an animal being released back into the wild or of a key to a house being given to a family that has lost its home to a natural disaster.

<h3>What It's All About</h3>
<p>As I get older, I want to make a difference in the world around me.  I want to do more than pay for someone's coffee or groceries or donate to a charity. I want to really touch people's lives. So earlier this year, I envisioned this app as a way to do that.  Learning to be kind to myself - kinder than anyone else has ever been to me - continues to touch every aspect of my life, and I want others to experience that, too. My life is pretty good these days, but it wasn't always. I've had my share of depression, heartbreak, stress and anxiety. I've felt completely disempowered and overflowing with despair. Although I don't live with those feelings anymore, I know how to be kind and compassionate with myself when they arise. And that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>When those feelings do arise, we need certain things.  And that's where the app comes in. Here's how it will make a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't shift your self-judging thoughts if you don't know how! And if you don't know how, they can spiral out of control. Access the app for suggestions and practices that will teach you how. Read or stream audio - your choice.</li>
<li>You can't shift your thinking or feelings when you're lost in racing thoughts. But if a message pops up on your phone every few hours, reminding to you to stop and breathe, reconnect to your body, remember a time when you felt safe... this could be all someone needs to shift their perspective.</li>
<li>Practice, practice, practice, every day, until it becomes a new, healthy, happy habit. The app will monitor your progress in developing a new habit.</li>
<li>Sometimes you need a hand, a shoulder, an ear. You need a space to reach out to others who get it. This is community of people expanding their capacity for self-love and simultaneously their compassion for others. They will get it and send support.</li>
</ul>
<p>And when your own capacity for compassion for others is ballooning, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspire others!</li>
<li>Offer support!</li>
<li>Celebrate and share your growth and that of the community.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Real Impact</h3>
<p>When we learn to really hear and see all the aspects of ourselves with kindness, healing can finally begin. Our perspectives shift. Many of our needs start to feel met. And, at the same time, learning to forgive ourselves, rather than judging ourselves, and learning to give ourselves what we need, rather than waiting for others to give it to us, is the basis for true empowerment. </p>
<p>And being kind and compassionate to ourselves amplifies our compassion for others. This is what will make the world a better place! R<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>elationships would be easier if we could soothe ourselves and meet many of our own needs. Following our hearts would be natural if we all felt empowered to live our lives the way we choose. I believe even violence and crime would go down if we felt loved, empowered, enough. </span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to pay for app development and design. This is a place and a time where all of us can step in together and help. Your monetary gifts will make this possible, but so would development or design skills if you are willing to offer them.</p>

programs like ours have to work their way into the network station by 
station). We have a perfect broadcast tie-in with National Poetry Month

Programs like ours are offered for FREE to the PBS network, while we 
must cover costs such as station fees, closed-captioning, marketing, 
etc. (It's been this way for decades with Public Television.) And because 82 mins. is 
an uneven length (programmers think in terms of hours and half-hours) to
 schedule, and our goal is acceptance by the greatest number of

But just like you can't pay your bills with verbal tips, we can finish the film with verbal complements  Hey everyone! We are Amanda & Michael Connolly. Collectively we have worked in the service industry for 20+ years. We build our production company while working in the service industry, so we have a bit of a soft spot for it. We believe that the people that bust their ass do deliver customers great service deserve a little recognition. So we decided to make Sex, Drugs & Hospitality. Sex, Drugs & Hospitalities give you an in depth look at the realities of working in the service industry; front of house, back of house, behind the Bar, behind the scenes and after-hours. From diners and breastaurants, to club, dives and cafes all around the world. Find out why X amount of the population choose this life of servitude and take a look at what goes on after last call.Sex, Drugs & Hospitality is the 1st of its kind. A feature length documentary that tells a story from the industry's point of view. We will show all those things that hit so close to home; from Pet Peeves to perks, to all the realities that come with working in the industry. Moral of the story: we believe everyone should work at least one shift in the industry and the world would be a much nicer place.Production of the film is funded, but now we need to raise the funds to put the final touches on the film. This film needs an awesome sound track: which can get pricy. We are need sounds & color editing, as well as promo material and film festival funds. Throwing in 5 bucks is like buying us a beer & its goes a long way for the film.

To date, my work has been seen by audiences in LA, NYC, Spain, Italy, and Romania.<br/><br/><i>Matriarch </i>marks my first foray in feature filmmaking.

Anyone close to me will know that I was raised by a single mother who was still a teenager when I was born. My mother, while not dealt the most favorable of life circumstances, embodied strength and resilience and became my primary model for handling adversity. Like many individuals, she has struggled with depression and anxiety—along with countless external obstacles—but she has never succumbed to any obstacle, whether it be internal or external.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Hello friends,</i><br/><br/>My names is Earl Wayne Crabtree II, and I am a story teller. Years ago the idea for North Baldwin came to me while delivering mail on a long, narrow, and dusty road called, well...you guessed it, North Baldwin. <br/><br/>Over the next eight years two impactful moments helped for not only the stories structure, but message. When I was a child I experience the horrific September 11th attacks with a mind unable to grasp the scope of what had happened growing up in the midwest. Although it was frightening thinking our country could be attacked at any moment, I at least had the comfort of being from nowhere and far away from those attacks. <br/><br/>One seemingly normal night as an adult man with two films under his belt, owning a film/photography company, and being overly tired from it all I decided to watch a 9/11 documentary.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><p><br/>Be more than just a ""NEVER FORGET,"" post on September 11th this year. Let's raise $20,000 at least for the victims of this horrific crime. The money we raise will be divided evenly and personally given to one Policeman's family, Firefighter's family, Doctor's family, and two tower worker's families. The more money we raise the larger amount of people we can give back to. If we break $20,000 we will give to ten families!!!! </p></div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone makes the 9/11 Never Forget post each year on the dot. Everyone in the world was affected by this day, and it still shows. Think of those that lost that day, lost loved ones. The lingering horror continues and this films goal is to do something this year, give something, even if it's just a dollar. </p>
<p>This project aims to showcase the incredibly heroism of the human spirit in the face of terrible evil. It is a quality that cannot be described effectively with words, and thusly it's beyond admirable. Let's remind the world how connect we are, how much we love each other, and how we really won't, ""Ever Forget."" </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest fear with this project is that those who are able to give ignore this because it's isn't September 11th. We fear pop culture is  the reason for many posts made on this day, and we want to get people to really think on this topic. Even if you can't give, don't just make a post on 9/11. Go back and watch the footage, get reacquainted with the day and feel something. This feeling we hope creates action, whether it's in your own lives, with friends or family, or for a cause you care about. Let's create this healthy action that is inside us all. Let's move away from the pop cultures fads, the monkey see monkey do attitude that social media has created, let's exist and give back.</p>

Hello friends,My names is Earl Wayne Crabtree II, and I am a story teller. Years ago the idea for North Baldwin came to me while delivering mail on a long, narrow, and dusty road called, well...you guessed it, North Baldwin. Over the next eight years two impactful moments helped for not only the stories structure, but message. When I was a child I experience the horrific September 11th attacks with a mind unable to grasp the scope of what had happened growing up in the midwest. Although it was frightening thinking our country could be attacked at any moment, I at least had the comfort of being from nowhere and far away from those attacks. One seemingly normal night as an adult man with two films under his belt, owning a film/photography company, and being overly tired from it all I decided to watch a 9/11 documentary. Without knowing I'd be incredibly moved experiencing the tragic events all over again but this time as an adult man, I found myself wide eyed, and in tears by the end. I knew this meant I had to do something, anything, even if it was a small contribution through my own love of filmmaking. So, I did.I made this movie to remind us all of the tragic events, then uncanny heroism from not just the firefighter, policeman, physiatrists, doctors, but even the common man from the street that feel witness to the event. This movie is to remind us we are all for one and one for all. This films goal is to give, and to give to those who lost, to those who will truly NEVER FOGET, those brave people that live on. Help me make this possible! Help us do something that is truly great and selfless. If you were unable to give because you were a child like me, now is your chance to give. As the great David Letterman said himself, a small town in Montana was going through a two year drought when 9/11 happened. Even though they were broke and hungry, they got together and send NYC money as a group. If that doesn't tell you enough about the human spirit, I can't help you.

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Hello! We are two Palestinian-American women working to fund a short-film to act as a preview for a TV show pitch we have been working on to tell the stories of relatable minority women. We want to create a space where those behind the camera are as diverse as those in front of the camera and highlight the perspectives of characters that have yet to be featured in film and television. In a world of remakes, reboots, and reimagining male media with all female-casts, we hope to create original content about women who have not existed on your screens.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Luckily, we have matched up with a wonderful production company and some great resources in Atlanta, Georgia to fill the crew for this short. This crew will consist almost exclusively of minorities: women, queer folx, and people of color. Thus far in the process, many have backed the idea of this project and are donating their time and equipment to help make this happen. Even with all the support of this idea, we still need $6,000 to really solidify all we need to film in October. As short-film budgets go, this is a relatively small cost. This money will go towards paying musical talent, catering for cast and crew, lighting rentals, location costs, props, wardrobe, insurance, etc.! Any and all donations to this short are greatly appreciated and will go a long way in getting this project off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Important</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up seeing no one that looks like us on TV, we want to give Arab women the space in media they deserve. We want brown girls and women to have characters to look up to and identify with - that are flawed, multi-faceted, knowable, and painfully believable.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In a world full of seemingly endless negativity and vanity, the documentary film TRUELOVE is the perfect antidote. This movie will bring on the hugs and happiness to all that witness a slice of life through the eyes of Callie Truelove, a 16-year-old girl with Williams syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that gives her the superpower of LOVE! Rooted in a deletion of a number of specific genes in the chromosome #7, this disorder can cause devastating physical and cognitive complications, but it also can have some near-miraculous side effects. Callie was created to always find the good in all people, places and things around her. This unburdened outlook on life comes from the heart of this angelic girl who touches the lives of everyone she encounters by either warming their day, making them smile, to changing their lives forever. This film will chronicle Callie’s journey as she spreads the love by meeting other very special people with Williams syndrome, and in the process.. makes some of their dreams come true!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kinetosaur: The Legacy of John Payne is a short documentary about how the creator of kinetic dinosaur sculpturist John Payne who helped pioneer the Asheville River Arts District and launch a robust arts community in Western North Carolina. He created fourteen magnificent, fully interactive, recycled metal dinosaur sculptures with exposed mechanics inspired by actual fossils. In 2003, sculptor and innovator John Payne purchased a wedge-shaped building in a forgotten, industrial area in Asheville, NC. John would go on to open the doors of this building to other artists and entrepreneurs which would eventually become the hub of what is known today as the River Arts District. Handpicking each artist that worked in his building, John would often subsidize the rent through creative projects in order to help struggling artists. His legacy continues to thrive today with over twenty studios and businesses calling the Wedge home. John’s ""Kinetosaurs"" still roam the earth as part of a national traveling exhibition to the delight of audiences young and old. Following a six-month run at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, the exhibit began a six-year tour of sites throughout North America. Through a mix of interviews and archival footage we bring you John’s story from the perspective of those who knew him best.</p>

<h3>From the Director</h3>
<p>John Payne was a key figure in the development of the River Arts District in Asheville, NC. Preserving his story for future generations is a cornerstone of this project. John empowered so many artists and gave them an opportunity to pursue their creative passions by providing them with an affordable place for them to work. I know this about John first hand, as I was one of those artists whom he gave a chance. I first met John in my twenties when I was living in a land squat close to the Wedge building just shortly after he purchased the building. John was so kind and always had inspiring words of wisdom to share. From that moment I began dreaming of finding my creative self. About five years later that dream came true, when I began working with a group of filmmakers in the building.</p>
<p>We are raising finishing funds for our documentary “Kinetosaur: the Legacy of John Payne.”  For more than a year we have been working diligently researching, shooting interviews and other footage, and gathering archival media related to John’s work and the impact he has had on Asheville and the greater region.  That’s why we are asking for your help!</p>
<p>John’s story is an example of how one man can influence an entire culture, and with this documentary we want to inspire another generation of artists to be bold and adventurous in the pursuit of discovery; to create larger-than-life expectations for themselves just as John did.  As a contributor, you will not only help us finish the documentary, but also help us market and distribute it to museums, schools, universities, libraries, and to more conventional avenues such as film festivals, On-Demand platforms (like Amazon Video, iTunes, Google Play, Youtube, etc.) and public broadcast television programs (like PBS’ Reel South and POV).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In total, we are asking for $25,000 in grassroots donations to pay for equipment/personnel to shoot one or two more interviews with key people, hire a sound designer and music composer, hire a professional title designer, and pay for additional marketing and advertising for the premiere in early Spring 2020.</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/megmulhearn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out our composer, Meg Mulhearn's soundcloud page here.</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572578956/cxroqwlitdtwspvun3dc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, we have what’s called an “assembly cut” where the basic structure of the film is outlined, and we are continuing to embellish and finesse the cut into its final form, known as “Picture Lock.”  The film then goes through the Sound Design process where the sound-scape is created. This is done by closely editing and cleaning existing audio, and recreating sounds in a controlled environment known as “Foley.”  Next, a Composer comes on board to arrange original music to compliment the “Picture Lock.” Finally, we finish the film with professional titles, color correction to give the film its final “look,” and formatting to prepare it for a formal release.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our intended goal of $25,000, not to worry.  By scaling back some of these elements, doing what we can ourselves, and limiting the overall vision for the marketing campaign, we can still deliver a short documentary that we and the donors can be proud of.  Reaching our goal however is still the main priority, with proper funding we believe that a larger audience can benefit from John Payne’s unique impact on the art world and American culture.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So far, BackRow Films has been responsible for two successful crowdfunding campaigns raising a total of over $35,000 for narrative projects.  “Ultimate World” a fictional comedy was crowdfunding successfully this summer through Seed&amp;Spark and is set for festival release through BackRow Films in December 2019.  </p>
<p>BackRow Films are a proud collective of filmmakers, musicians, performers, and other artists who first bonded in the back row of our class at film school in North Carolina.  Through our natural leadership and love for original stories, we formed a crew of repeat collaborators committed to creating “alternative” narrative and non-fiction content, and supporting emerging talents who challenge contemporary forms and processes of  the cinematic arts. With a focus on motion-picture development, BackRow Films hopes to bolster independent-minded filmmakers, performers and their projects.</p>
<p>Due to our North Carolina artistic roots ""Kinetosaur: The Legacy of John Payne"" is a singularly important project for us and directly reflects our own values as filmmakers.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Though you can never fully anticipate how successful a film will be our team is dedicated to lovingly telling the story of John Payne.  Aside from the creative responsibility of the story much of the success of today's films are due to enough funds being reserved for social media and marketing.</p>

I first met John in my twenties when I was living in a land squat close to the Wedge building just shortly after he purchased the building. John was so kind and always had inspiring words of wisdom to share. From that moment I began dreaming of finding my creative self. About five years later that dream came true, when I began working with a group of filmmakers in the building.
We are raising finishing funds for our documentary “Kinetosaur: the Legacy of John Payne.”  For more than a year we have been working diligently researching, shooting interviews and other footage, and gathering archival media related to John’s work and the impact he has had on Asheville and the greater region.  That’s why we are asking for your help!
John’s story is an example of how one man can influence an entire culture, and with this documentary we want to inspire another generation of artists to be bold and adventurous in the pursuit of discovery; to create larger-than-life expectations for themselves just as John did.  As a contributor, you will not only help us finish the documentary, but also help us market and distribute it to museums, schools, universities, libraries, and to more conventional avenues such as film festivals, On-Demand platforms (like Amazon Video, iTunes, Google Play, Youtube, etc.) and public broadcast television programs (like PBS’ Reel South and POV).

What We Need & What You Get
In total, we are asking for $25,000 in grassroots donations to pay for equipment/personnel to shoot one or two more interviews with key people, hire a sound designer and music composer, hire a professional title designer, and pay for additional marketing and advertising for the premiere in early Spring 2020.
Check out our composer, Meg Mulhearn's soundcloud page here.

Currently, we have what’s called an “assembly cut” where the basic structure of the film is outlined, and we are continuing to embellish and finesse the cut into its final form, known as “Picture Lock.”  The film then goes through the Sound Design process where the sound-scape is created. This is done by closely editing and cleaning existing audio, and recreating sounds in a controlled environment known as “Foley.”  Next, a Composer comes on board to arrange original music to compliment the “Picture Lock.” Finally, we finish the film with professional titles, color correction to give the film its final “look,” and formatting to prepare it for a formal release.
If we don’t reach our intended goal of $25,000, not to worry.  By scaling back some of these elements, doing what we can ourselves, and limiting the overall vision for the marketing campaign, we can still deliver a short documentary that we and the donors can be proud of.  Reaching our goal however is still the main priority, with proper funding we believe that a larger audience can benefit from John Payne’s unique impact on the art world and American culture.
 


 
The Impact
So far, BackRow Films has been responsible for two successful crowdfunding campaigns raising a total of over $35,000 for narrative projects.  “Ultimate World” a fictional comedy was crowdfunding successfully this summer through Seed&Spark and is set for festival release through BackRow Films in December 2019.  
BackRow Films are a proud collective of filmmakers, musicians, performers, and other artists who first bonded in the back row of our class at film school in North Carolina.  Through our natural leadership and love for original stories, we formed a crew of repeat collaborators committed to creating “alternative” narrative and non-fiction content, and supporting emerging talents who challenge contemporary forms and processes of  the cinematic arts. With a focus on motion-picture development, BackRow Films hopes to bolster independent-minded filmmakers, performers and their projects.
Due to our North Carolina artistic roots ""Kinetosaur: The Legacy of John Payne"" is a singularly important project for us and directly reflects our own values as filmmakers.

Risks & Challenges
Though you can never fully anticipate how successful a film will be our team is dedicated to lovingly telling the story of John Payne.  Aside from the creative responsibility of the story much of the success of today's films are due to enough funds being reserved for social media and marketing.


We understand: times are tough.  If you just cannot make a contribution today, then please simply help us share the word!  Follow, like, subscribe to our social media sites, and tell all your friends about John and our project!  At the very least, please share some cool kinetic-dinosaur photos because who doesn’t like dinos!?",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Sophia's grandma was the best cook she knew, so when her grandma developed dementia and eventually passed away, Sophia realized there was so much she didn't know about her own family. She regretted not being able to save her grandma's recipes and not learning more Mandarin and Taiwanese to better communicate with her own grandparents before they passed. This project serves as one of the ways to connect with and preserve a part of Sophia's ancestry she knows little about.

                                                    Our First Global Partners:Novel is working with a silk supplier in Siem Reap, Cambodia that only works with sustainable, natural dying methods and gives sustainable jobs to women in need.  All of our Fall 2016 Collection will have elements of silk hand-crafted by these incredible artisans.                          Fall 2016 Collection                                     (From Left to Right) Elodie Dress, The Caroline, Tatiana Pant, Zaria Top                                                'Illustrations by Mimi Honeycutt'                                                      'Edited/inked by Jake Kiley'(From Left to Right) The Summer Pant, Isadora Kimono Robe, The Mimi Dress, The Pearl Coat, The Madeline Top The Impact:By contributing to Novel, you are partnering to create a sustainable, high-end fashion line  that will allow people to wear a better story.  You are also helping us:
Create sustainable manufacturing jobs in the U.S. , with the eventual goal of sustainable dignified jobs across the globe. 
Help train individuals at risk of exploitation including survivors, homeless and refugees
Help lift individuals out of poverty
Raise awareness about the injustice of fast fashion and labor trafficking
Risks & ChallengesOn the journey of starting Novel, we have experienced many risks and challenges.  We have done in-depth research on all our fabric materials from farm to factory, the limited amount of ethical choices has taken great work and certainly has not been an easy process.  However, we are committed to partnering with organizations choosing ethical practices, ethical materials of utmost quality from around the world, supporting co-ops, fighting for the rights of farmers, and creating sustainable jobs in the process. Our History: Given our background, we are sure that Novel will succeed.  We have past experience in launching product to fight human trafficking that has proven successful.  UNCHAINED introduced a bracelet in THE LIMITED stores nationwide in 2015 that raised  $32,500 for the UNCHAINED Survivor Scholarship Fund that was awarded to 2 survivors of human trafficking in January of 2016.  Definitions:Ethically Sourced: Ethically sourced means fair and safe labor practices, including outlawing child labor. It also ensures that workers are paid a fair price for their labor. Certified Organic:The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 22,000 people die each year in developing countries as a result of the chemicals sprayed on non-organic cotton.  All of our materials are GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified organic.  Certified Organic means that both the production of the fibre on the farm, and the processing of this fibre into textiles has been checked at every step of the processing supply chain, has met organic standards and is certified by one of the many governing bodies. Organic textiles  fibres are free from herbicides, pesticides or anything genetically modified.  Natural Dyes:Our raw materials for the dyes are taken from nature rather than constructed from dangerous chemicals.  We value the health of our clients by utilizing organic textiles and natural dyes since chemicals used in dyes are absorbed into the skin and can be harmful, specifically to those that suffer from asthma and allergies.Other Ways You Can Help:- Please like and share our Novel Facebook page! - Promote us on social media and contact anyone you think would be interested in contributing financially to our campaign.- Make some noise about Novel! - Please share this campaign with your friends and anyone that would be interested in wearing a better story!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p><i>Snow Fish is a short film exploring themes of manipulation, mind-control and claustrophobia in a codependent relationship.  Laura struggles to care for her partner Joan, who is still grieving the death of an ex lover. While Laura finds herself at her wits' end trying to heal Joan and move forward, Joan withdraws further into her own painful memories.</i></p>

<h3>the Cause:</h3>
<p>This is an <strong>all-women cast and crew</strong> production. One of our main objectives is to inspire young women to pursue a career in film, despite the obstacle of gender inequality in the industry. We are fostering an environment where our crew members, primarily college students and recent graduates with a passion for filmmaking, are able to  obtain the technical skills needed on set. Another objective is to get these filmmakers to connect with one another as they enter the workforce. This project is not only important for film practice and education, but also a wonderful opportunity to build a community of female filmmakers. </p>

<p><strong>Nana Ponceleon</strong> was born in Venezuela, but spent her early years in Baton Rouge, LA. She has lived between Venezuela and the USA ever since. Today, she is based in NYC. She recently graduated from Stella Adler Studio of Acting. Even though her interest in art began in her childhood, it was only recently that acting became her full time career. She has worked in many films in Venezuela including the award winning international film ""The Zero Hour"" (La Hora Cero) recently featured in HBO, as well as plays and films in NYC.</p>

<div><b>LA STORIA</b></div>
<div>
<p>Rocco è un quindicenne originario di Cangelasio (PR), ed è cresciuto in questo pacifico paesino con i genitori, Stefano e Martina, suo fratello, Peter, i suoi due cavalli Apollo e Terra, due cani, Sector e Léo, due gatti, Wellington e George, e la sua gallina. I suoi genitori sono veterinari e ciò può spiegare l'alquanto larga famiglia di animali che hanno adottato.</p>
<p>Nel 2012 i genitori di Rocco decidono di fare <strong>un'esperienza all'estero</strong> e si trasferiscono con la famiglia, animali compresi, a Londra. Nonostante l'intenzione di Stefano e Martina fosse quella di cominciare una nuova e migliore vita in Inghilterra con tutta la famiglia, <strong>Rocco non si adatta al cambiamento così facilmente come sperato</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Scontrarsi con una nuova cultura non è mai facile</strong>, ancora di più se devi imparare una nuova lingua: la scuola è più difficile e sembra impossibile ottenere I risultati che ti aspetti, sei discriminato, mai invitato ad una festa, <strong>nessuno ti chiede di essere parte del gruppo e le persone che dovrebbero essere tuoi amici, ti prendono in giro</strong>. Un’esperienza infelice ed ingiusta. Questo è quello che Rocco vive ogni giorno.</p>
<p><strong>Rocco vuole reagire e trovare il suo modo di essere parte del paese dove sta vivendo</strong>. <i>Chi lo supporterà? Chi coltiverà il suo talento? Ma soprattutto <strong>chi lo ispirerà?</strong></i></p>
<p>Qui inizia il cambiamento per Rocco. Nella <strong>Grey Court School</strong> - la sua nuova scuola - trova un ambiente sensibile al tema del bullismo; si affida alle lezioni private di inglese di Jorge, un insegnante portoghese che conosce la sfida di imparare l'inglese provenendo da un paese mediterraneo; scopre le lotte dentro e fuori dal ring di <strong>Mohammed Alì</strong>, un campione e un modello per combattere razzismo e discriminazione.</p>
<p><strong>Suo padre</strong>, un ex vice campione del mondo, <strong>sa come si diventa campione</strong> e sottopone Rocco ad allenamenti duri di kickboxing; <strong>Martina</strong>, una eccellente veterinaria, si sacrifica con tutto <strong>l'amore di una madre</strong>: lavora su turni notturni per aiutare e supportare Rocco durante il giorno.<strong> E' stata l'amica che Rocco non aveva</strong>.</p>
<p>Grazie a questi modelli positivi, la vita di Rocco si trasforma in una storia di successo. Un allenamento intenso con suo padre porta velocemente <strong>Rocco a diventare Campione del Mondo per l’Inghilterra</strong>: <strong>il paese dal quale era stato discriminato, il paese del quale ora è parte</strong>.

<p><b>PERCHE' QUESTO DOCUMENTARIO</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Mi sono trasferita a <strong>Londra</strong> 3 anni fa e ho passato mesi di estrema solitudine ritrovandosi in una condizione di <strong>isolamento</strong> forzato dovuto in primis alla barriera linguistica, non parlando un buon inglese che le permettesse di comunicare. Per cercare di uscire da questo stato di isolamento ho deciso di entrare in contatto con altri immigrati ed è qui che ho incontrato Rocco per la prima volta. Le <strong>numerose somiglianze con la mia personale storia famigliare mi hanno intrigata e mi hanno avvicinata sempre di più alla vita famigliare di Rocco</strong>. Con il passare del tempo Teresa ha instaurato un rapporto di estrema <strong>fiducia con Rocco e la sua famiglia</strong>, trovando la giusta distanza per fare un film seguendolo nella vita quotidiana, nel suo mondo, in palestra, a casa, nei momenti ordinari di vista e nella sua solitudine sui trasporti pubblici. Lentamente <strong>Rocco si è aperto, parlando dei suoi pensieri, delle sue emozioni e</strong> <strong>condividendo</strong> un importante <strong>tema</strong> intitolato <i>Who inspires you</i>, un testo che il ragazzo ha scritto a scuola.</p>
<p>Attraverso un documentario di osservazione, possibile grazie alla relazione con la famiglia e Rocco, seguirò la sua crescita fino alla fine del 2016.</p>

</div></div>","THE STORYHello everyone! I am Teresa Iaropoli - director and producer  of Rocco - and I want to share with you Rocco’s inspirational story.Rocco is a 15 year old boy from Cangelasio, Italy. He grew up in this small and peaceful town with his parents, Stefano and Martina, his brother, Peter and his horses, dogs and cats. His parents are veterinarians, which might explain the rather large animal family they’ve adopted.In 2012, Rocco’s parents got a new job in London so the whole family moved to the UK. Stefano and Martina wished to build a great life in the UK for their family, but moving to a new country was harder than expected for Rocco.It is a challenge to build a network of friends and a social life when you are faced with a language barrier; school is harder and it seems impossible to get the results you expect from yourself; you are discriminated against , never invited to a party, never asked to be part of “the group”, and the people who should be your friends beat you. A miserable and unfair experience. This is what Rocco experiences every day.Rocco wants to react and “fights” his way to become part of the country he is living in. Who is going to support him? Who is going to nurture his talent? Who is going to inspire him?Grey Court School – his new school – knows how bullying could affect a young boy; Jorge, a Portuguese English teacher, knows the challenge of learning English coming from a Mediterranean country; and Mohammed Ali, knows what it means to fight racism and discrimination.His father, an ex-kickboxing vice world champion, knows how to become a champion,Rocco and his father Stefanoand Martina, an excellent vet, displays the sacrifice that comes with a mother’s love: she works the night shifts in order to help and support Rocco during the day. She was the friend Rocco didn’t have.Martina (mum), Peter (brother) and RoccoA supportive and caring mum and dad, and social awareness of bullying, change Rocco’s life in what is a story of success. Training hard with his dad quickly leads him to become World Junior Kickboxing Champion for England: the country he was rejected by; the country he is now part of.  Rocco becomes a World Champion for GB teamCHAMPIONS ARE NOT MADE IN GYMS  Mohammed Ali said!Watch Rocco becoming a world champion here!

 
Success is not everything for Rocco, and when he begins to feel like an active player in the country in which he lives, his Italian roots call him back. Rocco is an exceptional boy facing ordinary challenges. The same challenges faced by many of the families looking for a new life in London; by many of the kids who just want to be accepted by their friends for who they are. Rocco’s story shows what positive integration can achieve and the role that educational role models can have in our young people growth.Rocco with his friends in UKIn February 2016 Rocco’s destiny could take a whole new direction. He takes part in the qualifying kickboxing trials to be part of the World Kickboxing Championships in Dublin. His dream is to become a World Champion again, this time singing the Italian National anthem. Will he succeed in his challenge?WHY THIS DOC:Teresa the DirectorI moved to London about 3 years ago and for a few months I found herself in a forced isolation, mostly caused by language barrier, as I felt it difficult to communicate in English. Wondering how the Italian-Londoners feel in this big city, I decided to get in touch with new migrants like herself. This is how I met Rocco. I saw herself in him. When I was younger, she had to move from South Italy to the North, trying hard – day by day, to fill the culture gap. I – like Rocco- has been bullied for years, but found my way out in filmmaking.This film is not only about the transition from childhood to adulthood, but about searching for our own place in society, especially when we are torn between two countries and two identities.WATCH THE TRAILER HERE!Many similarities with my personal family history intrigued her and moved myself closer to Rocco’s family life. As time passed, I built up a deep trust with Rocco and his family, finding the right distance to make a film by following him in his daily life, in his world, in the gym, at home, in his moments of ordinary life and his solitude on public transport.Slowly Rocco opened up, talking about his thoughts, his emotions and sharing with her an important essay entitled Who inspires you, a piece of homework for school.Through an observational documentary, made possible thanks to my close and crew's relationship with the family and the boy, I was a witness of Rocco’s growth until 2016. Rocco and Teresa at the Notting Hill Carnival 2014It is now time to complete the documentary and bring it to life!Emanuele (sound recordist), Stefano, Rocco, Martina, Teresa and Giuseppe (DOP) at I am the greatest exhibition at Muhammed Ali at The O2 -London 2016Who are supporting us!http://www.youmanity.today/en/news/rocco-the-bullied-boy-who-became-a-world-champion.html What We Need & What You GetStefano (dad), Giorgio Petrosyan  and Rocco (World Champions), Teresa, Giuseppe (DOP) and Ale (sound recordist) at the gym TEAM LEONE PETROSYAN - Milan 2015We followed and filmed Rocco from 2013 to 2016.

Nonostante l'intenzione di Stefano e Martina fosse quella di cominciare una nuova e migliore vita in Inghilterra con tutta la famiglia, Rocco non si adatta al cambiamento così facilmente come sperato.

Scontrarsi con una nuova cultura non è mai facile, ancora di più se devi imparare una nuova lingua: la scuola è più difficile e sembra impossibile ottenere I risultati che ti aspetti, sei discriminato, mai invitato ad una festa, nessuno ti chiede di essere parte del gruppo e le persone che dovrebbero essere tuoi amici, ti prendono in giro.

E' stata l'amica che Rocco non aveva.
Grazie a questi modelli positivi, la vita di Rocco si trasforma in una storia di successo. Un allenamento intenso con suo padre porta velocemente Rocco a diventare Campione del Mondo per l’Inghilterra: il paese dal quale era stato discriminato, il paese del quale ora è parte. Il successo non è tutto per Rocco, e quando comincia a sentirsi parte “attiva” del paese nel quale vive, le sue radici italiane lo richiamano.

Sino ad ora le riprese sono state possibili grazie al finanziamento di società di produzione francesi e tedesca, grazie al supporto finanziario di Mammut film e all'investimento economico in prima persona da parte di Teresa. 
Ora però il tempo stringe e abbiamo bisogno di recuperare gli investimenti fatti per completare le riprese ed iniziare la fase di montaggio.
 
Abbiamo bisogno di almeno $ 10.000 per:
pagare la troupe (direttore della fotografia e fonico) 
pagare il noleggio delle attrezzature di ripresa;
continuare la ricerca di finanziamenti per montare e completare il documentario. 
In cambio potrete ricevere le nostre incredibili ricompense, come la versione limitata del documentario in DVD, le magliette ""Who inspires you?"", cartoline e poster, i gadget offerti da Leone1947 e i guantoni Leone1947 in versione limitata con le firme di Rocco e  Giorgio Petrosyan.
Supportando il nostro film, ci aiuterete a raccontare il racconto della crescita di Rocco (e a portarlo anche nelle scuole), della sua battaglia contro il bullismo, l'emigrazione e la sua passione di kick-boxer.
 
PERCHE' QUESTO DOCUMENTARIO


Mi sono trasferita a Londra 3 anni fa e ho passato mesi di estrema solitudine ritrovandosi in una condizione di isolamento forzato dovuto in primis alla barriera linguistica, non parlando un buon inglese che le permettesse di comunicare. Per cercare di uscire da questo stato di isolamento ho deciso di entrare in contatto con altri immigrati ed è qui che ho incontrato Rocco per la prima volta. Le numerose somiglianze con la mia personale storia famigliare mi hanno intrigata e mi hanno avvicinata sempre di più alla vita famigliare di Rocco. Con il passare del tempo Teresa ha instaurato un rapporto di estrema fiducia con Rocco e la sua famiglia, trovando la giusta distanza per fare un film seguendolo nella vita quotidiana, nel suo mondo, in palestra, a casa, nei momenti ordinari di vista e nella sua solitudine sui trasporti pubblici. Lentamente Rocco si è aperto, parlando dei suoi pensieri, delle sue emozioni e condividendo un importante tema intitolato Who inspires you, un testo che il ragazzo ha scritto a scuola.
Attraverso un documentario di osservazione, possibile grazie alla relazione con la famiglia e Rocco, seguirò la sua crescita fino alla fine del 2016.

As funding becomes available, we will continue to build out the site. The major areas left to build are:
Mobile Apps: As soon as possible, we want to release native Android and iOS mobile apps for Awaken Prayer. We have heard from many of our users requesting that we expedite this development.
Community Prayer Lists: Every community should have a place where all believers can share prayer requests as well as unite in praying for one another. We will scale to national and global Community Lists for prayer requests that reflect a national or global scope. When you want to explore and expand your prayer horizon, you will be able to use the geographic and topical search tool to find requests within your area or around the world.

If a home burns down in your neighborhood, your community will receive a Prayer Alert for that situation. If a major earthquake strikes, that Prayer Alert goes out globally.

<h3>How it Began</h3>
<div>
<p>On July
20th 1974, Turkish troops entered the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in response to a coup d'état staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists. By August
that same year, the Turkish military had secured 40% of the island. To this
day, the island remains geographically, politically and ethnically segregated—a
reality reinforced by a United Nations buffer zone spanning more than 112
miles. </p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>Our Journey</h3> <p>
</p>
<p><b>Beginning
in May 2016, three people will walk 400 miles in 60 days—circumnavigating the island of Cyprus—to gather narratives,
video footage, and images pertaining to the segregation that has been in effect for over forty years. </b>By
weaving together multiple forms of media, our journey—funded in part by a National
Geographic Young Explorers Grant—will produce a multifaceted representation of
Cypriot identity that will provide a deepened understanding of the cultural and
political dynamics of this divided island.</p>
<p>During our journey
we will stop and chat with local youths on each side of the barrier. Each
person will be given a digital camera for one to two days and asked take
photographs or short videos that exemplify their lives as a Cypriot. By
encouraging participants to take photos and videos themselves, we will give
priority to their own voices and perspectives, rather than speaking on their behalf. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457547085/urqjckuqiaagbkqxqofj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal</h3>
<div>
<p><b>In
stark contrast to the political reality of separation, the aim of this
expedition is to generate a holistic picture of the country’s landscapes,
cultures, and peoples in hopes of facilitating greater understanding and
cohesion in the near future. </b> Beyond the potential benefits to present and future
Cypriots, our journey will create a deeper understanding of this conflict,
unique for its imperturbability and stability, and contribute to dialogues
regarding ethnic and religious divisions in different contexts.</p>
<p><b>We
will upload our media to an interactive web-based map as the expedition
progresses (official website coming soon!).</b> Visitors to our website will experience Cyprus as we do through
images and footage linked to specific spots on the landscape as part of this
interactive map. Interact with us during our trek by leaving a comment on our dispatches from the trail. </p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your help! Funds from a National Geographic Young Explorers Grant have helped us launch the project, but we need your help to see this project to completion! We hope there are enough daring, kindred spirits out there who believe in our mission and are willing to support and take part in our project! Your contributions—no matter the amount—will be much appreciated! The funds you contribute will be used towards the essentials—food, water, and gear!</p>
<p><b>Can’t contribute financially? </b>That’s okay! Help us by getting the word out there! Contribute by sharing this page on social media sites, and encouraging family and friends to support a worthy cause!</p>
<p><b>Are you Cypriot and want to get involved on the ground? </b>Great! We need your help too! We need participants—ideally 18-35 year olds—willing to guide us through their homelands, open their homes, and share their stories! Contact us for more information!</p>

<h3>Türkçesi </h3>
<div>
<h2><span>Kıbrıs’ı Yaya Olarak Dolaşmak: <span>Bir Akdeniz adasındaki kültürel ayrışmayı anlamak için 60 günlük bir yolculuk</span></span></h2>
<div><span><span><br/></span></span></div>
<p></p>
<h3><span>Nasıl Başladı</span></h3>
<p>20 Temmuz 1974 tarihinde, Milliyetçi Rumların aynı ay içerisinde ilan ettiği askeri darbeye cevaben Türk ordusu Kıbrıs’a çıkarma yaptı ve Ağustos ayına kadar adanın %40’ını kontrolü altına aldı. Ada halen, Birleşmiş Milletler denetimindeki 180 kilometrelik Yeşil Hat tarafından coğrafi, siyasi, ve kültürel olarak bölünmüş durumdadır.</p>
<br/><h3>Yolculuğumuz</h3>
<p>2016 Mayıs’ından itibaren, 60 gün boyunca Ada’da yaklaşık 640 km yürüyeceğiz ve 40 seneden uzun süredir devam eden ayrışma ilgili anlatılar, videolar, ve fotoğraflar toplayacağız. National Geographic Genç Kaşifler Hibesi sayesinde gerçekleşecek olan seyahatimiz boyunca topladığımız bu kaynaklar Kıbrıs kimliğinin çok yüzlülüğünü temsil edecek, bu bölünmüş adanın kültürel ve siyasi kimliğini daha derinden anlamamıza yardımcı olacak.</p>
<p>Seyahatimiz boyunca hattın iki tarafındaki gençlerle sohbet edeceğiz. Konuştuğumuz kimselere birer adet kamera vereceğiz ve hayatlarını temsil eden fotoğraflar, kısa videolar çekmelerini rica edeceğiz. Böylelikle yerel halkın adına konuşmak yerine kendi perspektiflerine ve bakış açılarına öncelik vermiş olacağız.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457547085/urqjckuqiaagbkqxqofj.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<div>
<br/><h3>Hedefimiz</h3>
<p>Ada’nın katı siyasal gerçeği olan ayrılığın aksine, gezimizin amacı ülkenin manzaralarını, kültürlerini, ve insanlarını daha bütünsel bir çerçevede toplamak, ve bu sayede yakın gelecekte daha kaynaşmış ve anlayışlı bir Kıbrıs’ın önünü açmaktır. Yolculuğumuz, bugünün ve yarının Kıbrıslıları’na muhtemel faydalarının ötesinde, durağanlıgı ve değişmezliği açısından benzeri olmayan bu çatışmanın daha derinden anlaşılmasına yardımcı olacak, böylelikle farklı koşullarde ortaya çıkan etnik ve dini ayrımlar hakkındaki diyaloğa katkı sağlayacak.</p>
<p>Yolculuğumuz süresince edindiğimiz kaynakları internet üzerinden ulaşabileceğiniz interaktif bir haritaya yükleyeceğiz (resmi sitemiz cok yakinda aciliyor!). Sitemizi ziyaret edenler, haritanın belirli noktalarına iliştireceğimiz fotoğraflar ve metinler sayesinde Kıbrıs’ı bizim gözümüzden görecek, yorumlarını ekleyerek bizlerle etkileşebilecek. </p>

ΠΕΡΠΑΤΏΝΤΑΣ ΤΗΝ ΚΎΠΡΟ — <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ένα ταξίδι 60 ημερών για την κατανόηση του πολιτιστικού
διαχωρισμού σε ένα νησί της Μεσογείου</span>
</h2>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<h3><b>Πως ξεκίνησε</b></h3>
<p>Στις 20 Ιουλίου 1974 τα τουρκικά
στρατεύματα εισέβαλαν στο νησί της Μεσογείου, ,απαντώντας σε πραξικόπημα  που οργανώθηκε από Ελληνοκύπριους εθνικιστές.
Μέχρι τον Αύγουστο του ίδιου έτους, ο τουρκικός στρατός είχε καταλάβει το 40%
του νησιού. Μέχρι αυτήν την ημέρα, το νησί παραμένει γεωγραφικά, πολιτικά και
εθνικα διαχωρισμένο  από μια ουδέτερη ζώνη
όπου  φρουρείται απο τα Ηνωμένα Έθνη  και εκτείνεται σε περισσότερα από 112 μίλια.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Το Ταξιδι μας </b></h3>
<p>Το Μάιος 2016, τρεις άνθρωποι θα περπατήσουν 400 μίλια σε
60 ημέρες και θα κανουν  το γυρο της
νήσου  Κύπροου με  στοχο να να συγκεντρώσουν ιαφηγήσεις, βίντεο
και φωτογραφίες σχετικά με το διαχωρισμό που ειναι σε ισχύ για πάνω από σαράντα
χρόνια. Με την χρήση  πολλαπλών μορφών μέσων
ενημέρωσης, το ταξίδι μας  oπου
χρηματοδοτείται εν μέρει από το NationalGeographicYoungExplorersGrant <span>θα παράγει μια πολύπλευρη
εκπροσώπηση της κυπριακής ταυτότητας που θα παρέχει μια βαθύτερη κατανόηση των
πολιτιστικών και πολιτικών  δυναμικών αυτής
της διαιρεμένης νήσου.</span></p>
<p>Κατά τη διάρκεια του ταξιδιού μας, θα σταματήσουμε και θα
συνομιλήσουμε με τους τοπικούς νέους σε κάθε πλευρά του οδοφράγματος. Κάθε
άτομο θα του δοθεί μια ψηφιακή φωτογραφική μηχανή για μία έως δύο ημέρες και θα
του ζητηθεί η λήψη φωτογραφιών ή σύντομα βίντεο που εξηγούν τη ζωή τους ως
Κύπριος. Με την ενθάρρυνση των συμμετεχόντων να τραβήξουν τις  φωτογραφίες και τα βίντεο οι ίδιοι, θα δώσουμε
προτεραιότητα στις δικές τους φωνές και τις προοπτικές, παρά μιλώντας για
λογαριασμό τους.</p>

<h3><b>Ο ΣΤΟΧΟΣ ΜΑΣ </b></h3>
<p>Σε πλήρη αντίθεση με την πολιτική
πραγματικότητα του διαχωρισμού, ο στόχος αυτής της εκστρατείας είναι να
δημιουργήσει μια ολιστική εικόνα των τοπίων, των πολιτισμών και των λαών της
χώρας . Πέρα από τα πιθανά οφέλη για το παρών και το μέλλον των Κυπρίων, το
ταξίδι μας θα δημιουργήσει μια βαθύτερη κατανόηση αυτού του διαχωρισμού , και θα
συμβάλει στην διαλόγους σχετικά με τις εθνικές και θρησκευτικές διαιρέσεις σε γενικά
πλαίσια .</p>
<p>Όλα τα δεδομένα που συλλέγονται θα  φορτώνονται σε ένα διαδραστικό διαδικτυακό
χάρτη, καθώς  η εκστρατεία προχωρά (η επίσημη
ιστοσελίδα έρχεται σύντομα!). Οι επισκέπτες στην ιστοσελίδα μας, θα βιώσουν
την  Κύπρο, όπως την βιώνουμε εμείς  με εικόνες και πλάνα που συνδέονται με
συγκεκριμένα σημεία στο τοπίο, ως μέρος του αυτό το διαδραστικό χάρτη. Μπορείτε
επίσης να  επικοινωνείτε μαζί μας κατά τη
διάρκεια του οδοιπορικού μας αφήνοντας ένα σχόλιο σχετικά με τις αποστολές μας.</p>

How it Began

On July
20th 1974, Turkish troops entered the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in response to a coup d'état staged by Greek Cypriot nationalists. By August
that same year, the Turkish military had secured 40% of the island. To this
day, the island remains geographically, politically and ethnically segregated—a
reality reinforced by a United Nations buffer zone spanning more than 112
miles. 


Our Journey 

Beginning
in May 2016, three people will walk 400 miles in 60 days—circumnavigating the island of Cyprus—to gather narratives,
video footage, and images pertaining to the segregation that has been in effect for over forty years. By
weaving together multiple forms of media, our journey—funded in part by a National
Geographic Young Explorers Grant—will produce a multifaceted representation of
Cypriot identity that will provide a deepened understanding of the cultural and
political dynamics of this divided island.
During our journey
we will stop and chat with local youths on each side of the barrier. Each
person will be given a digital camera for one to two days and asked take
photographs or short videos that exemplify their lives as a Cypriot. By
encouraging participants to take photos and videos themselves, we will give
priority to their own voices and perspectives, rather than speaking on their behalf. 

   Our Goal

In
stark contrast to the political reality of separation, the aim of this
expedition is to generate a holistic picture of the country’s landscapes,
cultures, and peoples in hopes of facilitating greater understanding and
cohesion in the near future.  Beyond the potential benefits to present and future
Cypriots, our journey will create a deeper understanding of this conflict,
unique for its imperturbability and stability, and contribute to dialogues
regarding ethnic and religious divisions in different contexts.
We
will upload our media to an interactive web-based map as the expedition
progresses (official website coming soon!). Visitors to our website will experience Cyprus as we do through
images and footage linked to specific spots on the landscape as part of this
interactive map. Interact with us during our trek by leaving a comment on our dispatches from the trail. 



How You Can Help
We need your help! Funds from a National Geographic Young Explorers Grant have helped us launch the project, but we need your help to see this project to completion! We hope there are enough daring, kindred spirits out there who believe in our mission and are willing to support and take part in our project! Your contributions—no matter the amount—will be much appreciated! The funds you contribute will be used towards the essentials—food, water, and gear!
Can’t contribute financially? That’s okay! Help us by getting the word out there! Contribute by sharing this page on social media sites, and encouraging family and friends to support a worthy cause!
Are you Cypriot and want to get involved on the ground? Great! We need your help too! We need participants—ideally 18-35 year olds—willing to guide us through their homelands, open their homes, and share their stories! Contact us for more information!

   The Team

is a family affair! That’s right, two siblings, one cousin, and one
brother-from-another-mother are going to spend 1440 consecutive hours together
and survive!



Anna – Team Leader, National Geographic Young Explorer,
& Sister 
Behind every great
group of men, is an even better woman! Anna is the brains behind this
expedition, and the team-wrangler. As an archaeologist, she’s an expert at
managing small teams in rural and outdoor environments, and coordinating
logistics in remote places. 





Charalampos  – Local Guide, Cultural Expert, & Cousin
The Sacagawea to
our Lewis & Clark, Charalampos knows it all! Avid outdoorsman, local
expert, and all around charmer, there’s nothing he can’t handle.



Vasili – Logistics Coordinator, Business Operations, & Brother-From-Another-Mother

in the outdoor adventure industry, Vasili has always been drawn toward the next adventure.  Vasili is an accomplished sailor, fantastic
dancer, and he once caught a fish with his bare hands.  

   

Alexi – Cypriot Political Relations
Expert, Modern-Day McGyver, & Brother 
Alexi is acting as the Mr. Miyagi to this
group of merry explorers.  A political

Türkçesi 

Kıbrıs’ı Yaya Olarak Dolaşmak: Bir Akdeniz adasındaki kültürel ayrışmayı anlamak için 60 günlük bir yolculuk


Nasıl Başladı
20 Temmuz 1974 tarihinde, Milliyetçi Rumların aynı ay içerisinde ilan ettiği askeri darbeye cevaben Türk ordusu Kıbrıs’a çıkarma yaptı ve Ağustos ayına kadar adanın %40’ını kontrolü altına aldı. Ada halen, Birleşmiş Milletler denetimindeki 180 kilometrelik Yeşil Hat tarafından coğrafi, siyasi, ve kültürel olarak bölünmüş durumdadır.
Yolculuğumuz
2016 Mayıs’ından itibaren, 60 gün boyunca Ada’da yaklaşık 640 km yürüyeceğiz ve 40 seneden uzun süredir devam eden ayrışma ilgili anlatılar, videolar, ve fotoğraflar toplayacağız. National Geographic Genç Kaşifler Hibesi sayesinde gerçekleşecek olan seyahatimiz boyunca topladığımız bu kaynaklar Kıbrıs kimliğinin çok yüzlülüğünü temsil edecek, bu bölünmüş adanın kültürel ve siyasi kimliğini daha derinden anlamamıza yardımcı olacak.
Seyahatimiz boyunca hattın iki tarafındaki gençlerle sohbet edeceğiz. Konuştuğumuz kimselere birer adet kamera vereceğiz ve hayatlarını temsil eden fotoğraflar, kısa videolar çekmelerini rica edeceğiz. Böylelikle yerel halkın adına konuşmak yerine kendi perspektiflerine ve bakış açılarına öncelik vermiş olacağız.



Hedefimiz
Ada’nın katı siyasal gerçeği olan ayrılığın aksine, gezimizin amacı ülkenin manzaralarını, kültürlerini, ve insanlarını daha bütünsel bir çerçevede toplamak, ve bu sayede yakın gelecekte daha kaynaşmış ve anlayışlı bir Kıbrıs’ın önünü açmaktır. Yolculuğumuz, bugünün ve yarının Kıbrıslıları’na muhtemel faydalarının ötesinde, durağanlıgı ve değişmezliği açısından benzeri olmayan bu çatışmanın daha derinden anlaşılmasına yardımcı olacak, böylelikle farklı koşullarde ortaya çıkan etnik ve dini ayrımlar hakkındaki diyaloğa katkı sağlayacak.
Yolculuğumuz süresince edindiğimiz kaynakları internet üzerinden ulaşabileceğiniz interaktif bir haritaya yükleyeceğiz (resmi sitemiz cok yakinda aciliyor!). Sitemizi ziyaret edenler, haritanın belirli noktalarına iliştireceğimiz fotoğraflar ve metinler sayesinde Kıbrıs’ı bizim gözümüzden görecek, yorumlarını ekleyerek bizlerle etkileşebilecek. 
Nasıl Yardımcı Olabilirsiniz?
Yardımınıza ihtiyacımız var! National Geographic Genç Kaşifler Hibesi projeyi başlatmamıza yardımcı oldu, fakat projeyi başarıyla tamamlamak için desteğinize muhtacız! Misyonumuza inanan, bize destek olmak isteyen ve projemize katılmak isteyen yeterli sayıda kafadara ulaşacağımızı umuyoruz! Bağışlarınız ihtiyacımız olan malzemeleri (su, erzak vs.) edinmekte kullanılacaktır. Değerli bağışlarınız için şimdiden teşekkür ederiz, her bağış bizim için kıymetlidir.
Maddi destekte bulunamıyorsam? Mesajımızı yaymamıza yardımcı olun! Projemizi sosyal medyada paylaşarak, aile ve arkadaşlarınızı bize destek olmaya teşvik ederek katkıda bulunabilirsiniz.
Kıbrıslıyım, projenizde nasıl görev alabilirim? Bize yardımcı olacak gönüllülere ihtiyacımız var! Tercihen 18-35 yaslarında, yaşadıklari yerlerde bize rehberlik edecek, evlerini açacak, ve hikayelerini paylasacak katılımcılar arıyoruz! Daha fazla bilgi için lütfen bize ulaşın!

Ekibimiz
Bu bir aile yolculuğu! İki kardeş, kuzenleri, ve can kardeşleri beraber 1440 saat geçirecek!
Anna – Ekip Lideri, National Geographic Genç Kaşifi
Her başarılı bir grup erkeğin arkasında çok daha başarılı bir kadın vardır! Anna keşif heyetimizin beyni ve ekibimizin lideri. Bir arkeolog olarak, kırsal alanlarda çalışan küçük ekipleri yönetmekte, ve ulaşılması zor yerlerde lojistik meseleleri koordine etmekte uzmandır.


Charalampos  – Yerel Rehber, Kültürel Uzman, Anna’nın Kuzeni
Charalampos herşeyi bilir! Açık hava tutkunu, yerel uzman, pek cazibeli bir arkadaşımız. Hem de on parmağında on marifet!


Vasili – Lojistik Koordinator, & Anna’nın Can Kardeşi
Açık hava etkinlikleri sektöründe çalışmışlığı olan Vasili, her zaman bir sonraki macernın peşinde olmuştur.  Başarılı bir yelkenci ve harika bir dansçı olmasının yanında bir kere elleriyle balık tuttuğu olmuştur.

Alexi – Kıbrıs Siyasi İlişkiler Uzmanı, Günümüz McGyver’ı, & Anna’nın Ağabeyi
Alexi, neşeli gezginler grubumuzun üstadı.  Siyaset hastası ve seyahat etmeden duramayan bu bilge arkadaşımız, Garbin Kıbrıs’ı Kaliforniya’dan bizlere nasihat edecek. 

Destekçilerimize Sonsuz Teşekkürler!

ΠΕΡΠΑΤΏΝΤΑΣ ΤΗΝ ΚΎΠΡΟ — Ένα ταξίδι 60 ημερών για την κατανόηση του πολιτιστικού
διαχωρισμού σε ένα νησί της Μεσογείου




Πως ξεκίνησε
Στις 20 Ιουλίου 1974 τα τουρκικά
στρατεύματα εισέβαλαν στο νησί της Μεσογείου, ,απαντώντας σε πραξικόπημα  που οργανώθηκε από Ελληνοκύπριους εθνικιστές.
Μέχρι τον Αύγουστο του ίδιου έτους, ο τουρκικός στρατός είχε καταλάβει το 40%
του νησιού. Μέχρι αυτήν την ημέρα, το νησί παραμένει γεωγραφικά, πολιτικά και
εθνικα διαχωρισμένο  από μια ουδέτερη ζώνη
όπου  φρουρείται απο τα Ηνωμένα Έθνη  και εκτείνεται σε περισσότερα από 112 μίλια.

Το Ταξιδι μας 
Το Μάιος 2016, τρεις άνθρωποι θα περπατήσουν 400 μίλια σε
60 ημέρες και θα κανουν  το γυρο της
νήσου  Κύπροου με  στοχο να να συγκεντρώσουν ιαφηγήσεις, βίντεο
και φωτογραφίες σχετικά με το διαχωρισμό που ειναι σε ισχύ για πάνω από σαράντα
χρόνια. Με την χρήση  πολλαπλών μορφών μέσων
ενημέρωσης, το ταξίδι μας  oπου
χρηματοδοτείται εν μέρει από το NationalGeographicYoungExplorersGrant θα παράγει μια πολύπλευρη
εκπροσώπηση της κυπριακής ταυτότητας που θα παρέχει μια βαθύτερη κατανόηση των
πολιτιστικών και πολιτικών  δυναμικών αυτής
της διαιρεμένης νήσου.
Κατά τη διάρκεια του ταξιδιού μας, θα σταματήσουμε και θα
συνομιλήσουμε με τους τοπικούς νέους σε κάθε πλευρά του οδοφράγματος. Κάθε
άτομο θα του δοθεί μια ψηφιακή φωτογραφική μηχανή για μία έως δύο ημέρες και θα
του ζητηθεί η λήψη φωτογραφιών ή σύντομα βίντεο που εξηγούν τη ζωή τους ως
Κύπριος. Με την ενθάρρυνση των συμμετεχόντων να τραβήξουν τις  φωτογραφίες και τα βίντεο οι ίδιοι, θα δώσουμε
προτεραιότητα στις δικές τους φωνές και τις προοπτικές, παρά μιλώντας για
λογαριασμό τους.


Ο ΣΤΟΧΟΣ ΜΑΣ 
Σε πλήρη αντίθεση με την πολιτική
πραγματικότητα του διαχωρισμού, ο στόχος αυτής της εκστρατείας είναι να
δημιουργήσει μια ολιστική εικόνα των τοπίων, των πολιτισμών και των λαών της
χώρας . Πέρα από τα πιθανά οφέλη για το παρών και το μέλλον των Κυπρίων, το
ταξίδι μας θα δημιουργήσει μια βαθύτερη κατανόηση αυτού του διαχωρισμού , και θα
συμβάλει στην διαλόγους σχετικά με τις εθνικές και θρησκευτικές διαιρέσεις σε γενικά
πλαίσια .
Όλα τα δεδομένα που συλλέγονται θα  φορτώνονται σε ένα διαδραστικό διαδικτυακό
χάρτη, καθώς  η εκστρατεία προχωρά (η επίσημη
ιστοσελίδα έρχεται σύντομα!). Οι επισκέπτες στην ιστοσελίδα μας, θα βιώσουν
την  Κύπρο, όπως την βιώνουμε εμείς  με εικόνες και πλάνα που συνδέονται με
συγκεκριμένα σημεία στο τοπίο, ως μέρος του αυτό το διαδραστικό χάρτη. Μπορείτε
επίσης να  επικοινωνείτε μαζί μας κατά τη
διάρκεια του οδοιπορικού μας αφήνοντας ένα σχόλιο σχετικά με τις αποστολές μας.

Πως μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε. 
Χρειαζόμαστε
τη βοήθειά σου! Εισφορές από το National Geographic Young Explorers μας  έχουν βοηθήσει  να ξεκινήσει το έργο, αλλά χρειαζόμαστε τη
βοήθειά σας για την ολοκλήρωση του .Ελπίζουμε υπάρχουν αρκετά τολμηροί όπου
σκέπτονται σαν εμάς , εκεί έξω που πιστεύουν στην αποστολή μας και είναι
πρόθυμοι να μας  υποστηρίξουν και να
λάβουν μέρος στο έργο μας! Αν θέλετε να συνεισφέρεται  –ανεξαρτήτου του ποσού -θα εκτιμηθεί  πολύ! Τα χρήματα που θα μαζευτούν  θα χρησιμοποιηθεί  υλικά  πρώτης ανάγκης όπως  τρόφιμα, νερό, και των εργαλείων που θα
χρησιμοποιηθούν !
Δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρεται οικονομικά ?Είναι εντάξει! Βοηθήστε μας να μαθευτεί το
έργο μας ! Βοηθήστε με την αναδημοσίευση  αυτής  της
σελίδας  σε ιστοσελίδες κοινωνικών μέσων

 Είσαι
από Κύπρο και θες να βοηθήσεις στην αποστολή μας ? Χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σας πάρα πολύ!
Χρειαζόμαστε  συμμετέχοντες, ιδανικά

musical history. Tommy Hall and his 13th Floor Elevators were the first
psychedelic band in history and helped bring in this psychedelic era. Tommy is
considered by many to be the best lyricists of his time. Slip Inside This House
is a documentary about the life of Tommy Hall of The 13th Floor Elevators: his
childhood, his days as a student at the University of Texas in the 60s, his
studies in the philosophies in consciousness and cosmic human experience, the
inspiration behind his art, the forming of The 13th Floor Elevators, and
aspects of The Design (his current work). Tommy is a reclusive figure that has
not allowed anyone to interview him in-dept on film. The project started in
April 2015 when Tommy Hall gave George Ripley both his cooperation and blessing
to the project. It is not likely ever to occur again. Note: A explanation of
the lyrics to ""Slip Inside this House"" was filmed as part of the
documentary. Many have wanted to know the meaning of this opus for ages without
luck in getting them. In this documentary, audience will get a 40 minute
explanation by Tommy where he reads out each verse and explains the meaning. It
will tell his life through vintage and contemporary photographs and numerous
interviews with Tommy, members of The 13th Floor Elevators, and their soundman,
contemporaries and audience members from the sixties as well as Tommy's
former-wife, his stepson, his brother, and his sister.</p>
<p>Currently the project has obtained numerous photographs from various time
periods of Tommy Hall's life. It has also obtained a scan of the Texas
Governor's proclamation in recognition of the The 13th Floor Elevators directly
from the Governor's office. Also of note, Tommy Hall has re-recorded three of
his old songs to be used in the soundtrack, and as well, he is contributing
several new musical compositions for the soundtrack.</p>
<p>The project has interviewed many people closest to Tommy Hall including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tommy Hall: many hours of interviews so far</li>
<li>Clementine Hall: Tommy Hall's former wife</li>
<li>Roland Hall: Tommy Hall's stepson</li>
<li>Carolyn Hall Lawrence: Tommy Hall's sister</li>

<li>Danny Thomas: 13th Floor Elevators drummer</li>
<li>Bill Bentley: friend and supporter</li>
<li>Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top: friend and supporter</li>
<li>Dana Erickson: Wife of Roky Erickson-13th Floor Elevators guitarist/vocalist</li>
<li>Powell St. John: Songwriter (for The 13th Floor Elevators) and performer</li>
<li>George Kinney of The Golden Dawn: close friend and supporter</li>
<li>Christian Bland of The Black Angels: supporter and follower</li>
<li>Freddie Krc: fan, supporter, and head of the Texas Music Union</li>
<li>Jack Orbin: Stone City Attractions, Inc  General Owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other interviews with others close to Tommy are forthcoming. We are
attempting to get rights to use Stacy Sutherland (the 13th Floor Elevator’s
lead guitarist) and Sandy Lockett (The 13th Floor Elevator’s soundman)
interviews with their estates. Gay Jones, Tommy Hall’s significant other of 48
years, is pending.</p>
<p>The 13th Floor Elevators' contemporary influence has been acknowledged by
1960s musicians such as Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Peter Albin of Big Brother and

<h3>Op. Room NO.2 Feature length documentary</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468941535/n0nx50xjxfltobcwfafx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<h3>EXISTENCE AND FINITUDE : close look inside operating room</h3>
<p>To choose the operation room and the forms of life surrounding it for the spatial focus of my documentary entails a delicate task requiring both artistic and technical sensibility. My interest in hospital spaces and discourses began when I start reading French historian and philosopher Michel Foucault. His elaboration on various spaces established around different relations of power, both in its visible and invisible forms, made me perceive the architecture of everyday life from completely different perspective.</p>
<p>Somewhere during this period, I began to attend operations at one hospital in the city of Zagreb under the supervision of a worldwide reputable neurosurgeon. As a hospital photographer I had a chance to witness more closely the mechanic of hospital life: constituted of hundreds and hundreds trained and disciplined gestures and speech acts. In the same time I got very interested in the intimate story of the chief surgeon, whose whole life was intertwined with those of hospital spaces and discourses. The great part of his early experience as a young surgeon came during the war in Croatia in the nineties in which he took a part as a field medic. Part of his success was an unusual emphasis on the doctor-patient relation, not just as a manner of courtesy but considering it an important aspect of patient’s healing process. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468757268/fxtt3tuh9clkngqlxw3y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The movie I decided to make is my contribution to an “archeology” of such spaces, and my final aim is to delineate the discursive formations and forms of subjectivities which are constituted in the operation room (and which are constitutive to it, in the same manner). The task that lies in front of me is difficult insofar as the story I wish to tell is driven out of context, without the beginning or end, focusing on a six months in the life of the neurosurgeon. Still, I don’t want that this movie becomes one more reality-based documentary. </p>
<p>The thing that interested me the most is the type of discourse intertwined around spaces such as the operation room, articulated through a kind of quasi-metaphysical phrases like “between life and death”, “the bare life surgeon holds in his hands” etc. I wish to deconstruct this kind of conceptualizations in a way not to negate the importance of the care for patient’s health, but to try to show that it is possible to articulate a different type of statements beyond emotional (or transcendent) categories.</p>

<p>There is a kind of “banality” present inside the operation room. Banality in a sense that it is not so much about the atmosphere of fear and anxious struggle for bare life, but much more about well-organized routine, rational scientific method and cold precision. Silence, rustle of medical instruments and muffled sounds of medical machines – this is the operation room as it appears in its “banality”, stripped of the quasi-metaphysical language of an uninvolved observer. Furthermore, on the level of the form of language of cinematography it is not about any kind of drama, tragedy, or an attempt to imitate cinéma vérité, but about construction of different semantic field in which one is able to rethink the whole subject matter. I will not claim that with this I reveal something “truer” or “more real” behind the generalized discourse; I simply want to offer another perspective, emphasizing some elements and omitting the others. Reality is not to be revealed, but is constructed through various attempts destined to never fully grasp its totality.</p>

<p>In this film I want to enter those spaces that bear a certain mark of finitude.  Operation room seemes like one of such spaces – a crossroad on which a cinematographer truly becomes aware of its limits, both in a manner of technology and its own conditions of observation. Therefore, my aim is neither to transcend nor to transform the phenomenal limitation of profession but to cope with it in a sort of „existential” manner. Life as a concept, life as an object of cinematic framing, and life as a „real thing“, a lived experience, are three different things which unfolds in a way that one must become aware of the absurdity of ever thinking to grasp it in a non-mediated manner. To use Kantian terms, the noumenal seemed impenetrable, while the phenomenal left me unsatisfied.</p>

<p>In September of 2014 they stopped my heart to open it up and
fix it. My life has never been the same. If anything is going to change your
life I guess dying would be pretty high on the list. </p>
<p>A doctor asked me what I was going to do with my second
chance.  After thinking about it I
asked myself “If I could anything I wanted to do what would I do?”  Well, I’m in film school.  I’m becoming more intimate with
something I have always loved.  A
world I’ve dabbled in for decades. </p>
<p>In the past 6 weeks I have worked on 6 short films including
directing my own. This has been a tremendous learning experience and I had a
great deal of fun being part of all of these projects.  However, due to expense of working on
these and all of the costs associated with filming mine I’m left a little short
in post-production. </p>
<p>Because of location issues and date changes forced on me, I
had to re-permit, make several changes due to location requirements and add
time to the shoot. All of which cost me more money. </p>
<p>The funds raised will go to paying some of the production
costs, completing the project, licensing music and external work with other
professionals. I’m hoping to enter this film into some festivals.</p>
<p>I know times are tough and people are busy. But, if you’re
interested in helping out I’d appreciate it. </p>

In the past 6 weeks I have worked on 6 short films including
directing my own. This has been a tremendous learning experience and I had a
great deal of fun being part of all of these projects.  However, due to expense of working on
these and all of the costs associated with filming mine I’m left a little short
in post-production. 
Because of location issues and date changes forced on me, I
had to re-permit, make several changes due to location requirements and add
time to the shoot. All of which cost me more money. 
The funds raised will go to paying some of the production
costs, completing the project, licensing music and external work with other
professionals. I’m hoping to enter this film into some festivals.
I know times are tough and people are busy. But, if you’re
interested in helping out I’d appreciate it. 
Thank you

I'm excited to share with you our official trailer. Check it out!


Hardboiled  is a satire of the urban American crime drama featuring two tough talking detectives, Harry and Callaham, who happen to be an egg and a slice of ham.  The 20 minute film is shot entirely in stop motion and each character, set piece, and prop has been built by hand right here in DUMBO, Brooklyn.
I’m a stop motion director by trade and together with the help of many talented friends and colleagues I’ve managed to complete 80% of the film with little-to-no funding.  But now it’s time to finish it and finish it the right way.
What remains is the fabrication and shooting of the final climactic scene of the film: the showdown between our hero detectives and the nefarious Juicy LeStraw (a strawberry, naturally).  Help me finish this film by funding this final leg of the production.  In joining me you’ll be supporting independent film and the craft of stop motion animation.  You’ll bring to fruition a filmmaker’s dream that was set in motion almost a decade ago and is now ready to be shared with the world.  And you’ll join a vibrant community of supporters who also have a soft spot for food who can talk.




Detectives Harry and Callaham don’t play by the rules, resulting in suspensions and beatings at the hands of their boss, the explosive Knishoner. Undaunted by departmental politics, the Ham and Egg detectives set off in pursuit of a killer targeting eggs. With a mix of old fashioned police work and help from a bacon pimp, an oyster, and Olive the forensics specialist, Harry and Callaham make a shocking discovery that places the eggicides at the nexus of organized crime, real estate, and the skyline of the city itself.


Here's a little bit about the team behind this film.Peter Sluszka is an Emmy award-winning director with over 18 years of experience in commercial, music video, television and feature film production.  He’s animated or directed over 300,000 frames of stop motion animation- that’s a lot of pictures to take!  He created the animated sequences for Miquel Arteta’s Youth in Revolt, collaborated with Michel Gondry on Bjork's ""Crystalline"" and has directed videos for Bat for Lashes, Moones, Regina Spektor and The Decemberists.

The legendary, Tony Award winner George Irving voices the nefarious Juicy LeStraw and the down-on-his-luck, busking street-dog.  George Irving’s career spans seven decades but in the animation world he is most celebrated for his portrayal of the Heat Miser, in Rankin-Bass’ classic holiday special, The Year Without a Santa Claus.  Cartoon historians will also recognize him as the narrator of Underdog.



Edd Hall voices Harry, the quick witted, quicker tempered detective who’s obsessed with the job.  His deadpan gravel-voiced egg, is but one facet of a long and varied career in film and television.  Most recognized as the long time announcer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Edd can also be seen or heard in comedy sketches for Saturday Night Live and on David Letterman, just to name a few.

Joey Wells voices Callaham, the hyper macho loose-cannon of the department.  Joey is an accomplished comedy writer and performer best known for BET’s Comicview and Kevin Hart: Seriously Funny.  As a member of the Plastic Cup Boyz, Joey performs his stand-up comedy for a global audience and can be frequently seen on tour.





Emmy winner Anne Heche voices Olive, the intellectual forensics researcher and a love interest of Harry’s.  Best known for her feature film work in Donnie Brasco and Six Days Seven Nights opposite Harrison Ford, she is also a natural comic actress, bantering effortlessly with Ed Helms and John C. Reilly in Cedar Rapids.  She brings the same moxie to her characterization of Olive and can also be heard in the recurring animation role of Cherry Cream Soda on Cartoon Network's Adventure Time.



Lola Glaudini voices Pearl, the sassy barmaid clam who serves up drinks and valuable information to Harry and Callaham.  Lola is best known for her portrayal of Elle Greenaway on CBS’s Criminal Minds and as Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrip on HBO’s The Sopranos and can most recently be seen on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..
I am seeking $75,000 to pay for the labor, materials, equipment, and studio space needed to build and shoot the final scene.  Stop motion animation is a very labor intensive process and with your support I can hire additional fabricators and animators to work alongside me to complete the project in a reasonable amount of time.  Having the extra help will also reduce the length of time I will need to rent equipment and studio space, bringing those costs substantially down.  Since every character, prop, and set piece is built and animated by hand the funds will also be used to pay for all the materials including lumber, casting resin, armatures and foam.

I hope that you’ll consider joining me in this project.  Whether you donate $1 or $1000, every single cent will help push this film towards the finish line.  If you aren’t able to give but still want to be involved there are other ways you can help!


First and foremost, tell your friends!  Sharing is caring and in this case the more people we can let know about this project, the better chance we have of being successful.  Use the share links on this page to help spread the word.
If you are in the NYC area, I’m looking for a low- or no-cost space to shoot in.  I’ve accounted for space rental in my budget but any money I don’t have to use towards that can be used to make the film look even better.  If you or anyone you know has access to a large studio space please contact me!",36.0,1,"1 Campaign

development in the province.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Crazy8s
has given opportunities to 91 filmmakers and their teams of producers, writers,
cinematographers, art directors, editors, composers and cast to produce fully
funded, professional short films and present them to an audience of film
professionals (as well as non-professionals) in Vancouver and around the
globe.  It has become the place to discover new talent, provide valuable
on-set training and give opportunities for filmmakers to create work that can
be used to launch their careers in the film industry. </p>
<p>Including crew and
performers, Crazy8s has provided working opportunities for over 2,200 people.</p>

<p>Someday America will be attacked with chemical agents, like those already used by Iraq, Syria and ISIS.
Who will go in under hostile fire to detect and identify the chemicals and clean

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Brandy M. Miller. I am a leader, an advocate, and a connector of people and ideas. I want to become a person known for restoring hope to the hopeless and giving the voiceless back their voices. My core values: faith, hope, and love. I am creative, enthusiastic, passionate, and courageous. I hope others describe me as compassionate, driven, and fearless. </p>
<p> I'm the author of 5 published books and more than a dozen I haven't published yet. I spent the better part of the last four years of my life devoted to writing, and the last three serving the needs of writers. I know exactly how hard it is to get your book finished, polished, and ready for publication. I know how discouraging it can be and how many pitfalls there are on the road to publication. <br/></p>
<p>My big goals: To help 40 Day Writer Reality TV become a reality so that writers can know what it takes to succeed and see that it is possible and so that publishers don't have to fear investing in first time authors because they can be assured that the authors will have what it takes to make it, to help the people of Flint, Michigan reclaim their homes and their voices, and to return to the people the power to make themselves heard. To accomplish my goals I must become committed to making them happen, I must become connected to the people who can help me, and I must become a mentor to those who are not where I am yet.</p>
<p>I want to help writers just like me get the help they need to get their books finished and out there. The 40 Day Writer Reality TV Series would help them, and every aspiring author out there, do that by showing them what's involved and how the book publishing and marketing industry works.<br/></p>
<p>It would blow away the myths and reveal the hard work that goes into taking a book idea and making it a best seller.And America is ready for a show like this.  67% of Americans watch reality TV shows. 81% of Americans believe they have a book in them, and would like to see it published. There is currently no reality TV show that addresses the needs of this audience. The 40 Day Writer Reality TV show would change that.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What It Will Take</h3>
<div>I have budgeted $1,250,000 to fund a single season of this show. </div>
<div>$250,000 Live pitch event (footage to be used in season opener):  covers the cost of hiring a camera crew &amp; production staff, renting a venue, feeding and housing the crew, transportation for the agents &amp; coaches who will review the pitches, insurance, etc.</div>
<div>$100,000 Lodging, meals, and supplies for the writers during the 40 day competition</div>
<div>$250,000 Transportation for guest judges, agents, and coaches to and from the 40 day event sites</div>
<div>$150,000 Celebrity guests, agents, and coaching meals and accommodations</div>
<div>$500,000 Accommodations, meals, and salaries for staff members during the 40 days</div>
<div><b>The Perks</b></div>
<div>Donate $5 - Get an ebook copy of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Write-Time-find-time-write-ebook/dp/B00CLJ0DFA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Write Time: How to find all the time you need to write a book</a>
</div>
<div>Donate $25 - Get an ebook copy plus a printed copy of your choice of How to Write a Fiction Book in 40 Days or How to Write a Non-Fiction Book in 40 Days.</div>
<div>Donate $125 - Get the book plus access to the online video course that will accompany the books </div>
<div>Donate $625 - Get print versions of all three books plus access to both online video courses and an invitation to join once-a-week group coaching sessions</div>
<div>Donate $3,125 - Get an invitation to one of 10 all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) weekend writing workshops, once-a-week group coaching, and once-a-week email check-ups for ongoing support plus the books and online trainings.</div>
<div>Donate $15,625 - Get an invitation to one of 5 all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) 7 day writer's retreat plus once-a-week group coaching, once-a-week email check-ups for ongoing support, books, and online trainings - PLUS - your finished book and your name will be highlighted in one episode of the 40 Day Writer opening season.</div>
<div>Donate $80,000 - Get an invitation to an all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) 40 day writing bootcamp. It's a dry run for the show and will give us the all-important sizzle reel, so there will be judges, there will be agents, there will be coaches there to help, and there will be publishers competing for your manuscript if you make it to the final rounds. However, unlike the actual competition, you'll still be getting help and support to complete your manuscript, polish it, and present it. Yes, there will be ""elimination"" rounds, but all that means is that you won't be appearing on the camera from that point forward. We'll move you to a separate section of the retreat center and you'll work on your manuscript there. Plus, your book and your name will be highlighted in episode one of the season.</div>
<div>- OR - </div>
<div>Candidate Sponsorship. If you don't want the retreat, but you want a relatively cheap way to promote your business, you can back a candidate. Your company name and logo will appear on screen whenever the camera is focused on your candidate. You will also get 30 seconds of on-air time during the episode to explain what made you choose that candidate to sponsor. Plus, you'll get a one-time only ""save my candidate"" ticket that allows you to veto a single elimination round for your candidate.</div>
<div>Donate $250,000 - Episode sponsorship. Your company name and logo (or book title and author name, etc) will appear in the opening credits of the show, plus you will be given 2:30 of air time during that episode to talk about 40 day writer and why you chose to sponsor it. Plus, you'll get a guest judge seat on that episode.</div>
<div>Donate $1,500,000 - Season sponsorship. Your logo and company name (or book title and author name) will be named in the opening credits of the show as the title sponsor.  Your representative will be given 2: 30 of talk time each episode, and every member of the staff and crew plus every candidate will wear a hat with your logo and name. Plus, your company (or you, if you're an author) will get a guest judge seat on every episode.</div>
<p><b>What If We Don't...</b></p>
<p>Raise Enough Funds</p>
<p>It depends on how much of the money is raised. If I can raise half, I can pursue sponsorships and even grants to make up the difference. There are alternate routes we can pursue to make this a reality, and I won't give up on our dream without fighting for it.</p>
<p>Find a Network Willing to Pick It Up</p>
<p>Not to fear. That's what the internet is for. If need be, we will host webisodes of our first season, take the money and the awareness we raise from that, and push forward. It's possible, given the nature of the show's content, that we may very well be able to get it up using public access tv resources.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Watching a show like 40 Day Writer's Reality TV Series can encourage people who may have been thinking about writing to step up, get out there, and get heard. It can also give them important reality checks, letting them know what publishers and editors want to see, and what makes for a successful book.</p>
<p>There's a lot of benefit to be had for everyone involved in this. Viewers get an inside look at an industry that most people view as nothing short of magic, writers get an incredible opportunity to put their work out there and have it viewed by potentially millions of people. Imagine being able to have your book developing a fan base from the first sentence you write until the moment you publish - you'd remove a lot of the work of selling a book before you even began.</p>
<p>Agents are able to sift through submissions to find potential winners for them by searching using a simple hashtag. Coaches get an opportunity to show their stuff and encourage the work of a new crop of writers.</p>
<p>Publishers get the opportunity to bid on risk-free books by new authors who come prepared with author platforms and audiences already following their every move. There are only winners in this competition. </p>
<p>Even the losers go home with exposure for their book ideas, contacts, and connections made in the publishing industry that are invaluable in getting published later.</p>
<p>This has the chance to change everything. And we can make it happen.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Television is always a risky proposition. Networks may offer to pick up a series only to decide to drop it after a pilot doesn't do well or when a few episodes don't go over as planned. It's going to be absolutely critical that if you support it, you blog about it, you tweet about it, you write about it, and you share it everywhere you go both on and offline. </p>
<p>These are the things that will not only help build an audience for it, but sustain that audience and allow it to grow. So once we start this campaign, discuss it, talk about it, express your feelings about it and what you would like to see happen with it. Share it with others. Because if we want this one to happen, it's going to be up to us to make it happen.</p>
<p>I realize that I am a relatively unknown author. That is going to scare some people. I don't have a book published through a major publisher. That's going to scare some people, too.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">And that's all there is to it.</span></p>
</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Brandy M. Miller. I am a leader, an advocate, and a connector of people and ideas. I want to become a person known for restoring hope to the hopeless and giving the voiceless back their voices. My core values: faith, hope, and love. I am creative, enthusiastic, passionate, and courageous. I hope others describe me as compassionate, driven, and fearless. 
 I'm the author of 5 published books and more than a dozen I haven't published yet. I spent the better part of the last four years of my life devoted to writing, and the last three serving the needs of writers. I know exactly how hard it is to get your book finished, polished, and ready for publication. I know how discouraging it can be and how many pitfalls there are on the road to publication. 
My big goals: To help 40 Day Writer Reality TV become a reality so that writers can know what it takes to succeed and see that it is possible and so that publishers don't have to fear investing in first time authors because they can be assured that the authors will have what it takes to make it, to help the people of Flint, Michigan reclaim their homes and their voices, and to return to the people the power to make themselves heard. To accomplish my goals I must become committed to making them happen, I must become connected to the people who can help me, and I must become a mentor to those who are not where I am yet.
I want to help writers just like me get the help they need to get their books finished and out there. The 40 Day Writer Reality TV Series would help them, and every aspiring author out there, do that by showing them what's involved and how the book publishing and marketing industry works.
It would blow away the myths and reveal the hard work that goes into taking a book idea and making it a best seller.And America is ready for a show like this.  67% of Americans watch reality TV shows. 81% of Americans believe they have a book in them, and would like to see it published. There is currently no reality TV show that addresses the needs of this audience. The 40 Day Writer Reality TV show would change that.   What It Will Take
I have budgeted $1,250,000 to fund a single season of this show. 
$250,000 Live pitch event (footage to be used in season opener):  covers the cost of hiring a camera crew & production staff, renting a venue, feeding and housing the crew, transportation for the agents & coaches who will review the pitches, insurance, etc.
$100,000 Lodging, meals, and supplies for the writers during the 40 day competition
$250,000 Transportation for guest judges, agents, and coaches to and from the 40 day event sites
$150,000 Celebrity guests, agents, and coaching meals and accommodations
$500,000 Accommodations, meals, and salaries for staff members during the 40 days
The Perks
Donate $5 - Get an ebook copy of The Write Time: How to find all the time you need to write a book

Donate $25 - Get an ebook copy plus a printed copy of your choice of How to Write a Fiction Book in 40 Days or How to Write a Non-Fiction Book in 40 Days.
Donate $125 - Get the book plus access to the online video course that will accompany the books 
Donate $625 - Get print versions of all three books plus access to both online video courses and an invitation to join once-a-week group coaching sessions
Donate $3,125 - Get an invitation to one of 10 all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) weekend writing workshops, once-a-week group coaching, and once-a-week email check-ups for ongoing support plus the books and online trainings.
Donate $15,625 - Get an invitation to one of 5 all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) 7 day writer's retreat plus once-a-week group coaching, once-a-week email check-ups for ongoing support, books, and online trainings - PLUS - your finished book and your name will be highlighted in one episode of the 40 Day Writer opening season.
Donate $80,000 - Get an invitation to an all-expenses-paid (transportation excluded) 40 day writing bootcamp. It's a dry run for the show and will give us the all-important sizzle reel, so there will be judges, there will be agents, there will be coaches there to help, and there will be publishers competing for your manuscript if you make it to the final rounds. However, unlike the actual competition, you'll still be getting help and support to complete your manuscript, polish it, and present it. Yes, there will be ""elimination"" rounds, but all that means is that you won't be appearing on the camera from that point forward. We'll move you to a separate section of the retreat center and you'll work on your manuscript there. Plus, your book and your name will be highlighted in episode one of the season.
- OR - 
Candidate Sponsorship. If you don't want the retreat, but you want a relatively cheap way to promote your business, you can back a candidate. Your company name and logo will appear on screen whenever the camera is focused on your candidate. You will also get 30 seconds of on-air time during the episode to explain what made you choose that candidate to sponsor. Plus, you'll get a one-time only ""save my candidate"" ticket that allows you to veto a single elimination round for your candidate.
Donate $250,000 - Episode sponsorship. Your company name and logo (or book title and author name, etc) will appear in the opening credits of the show, plus you will be given 2:30 of air time during that episode to talk about 40 day writer and why you chose to sponsor it. Plus, you'll get a guest judge seat on that episode.
Donate $1,500,000 - Season sponsorship. Your logo and company name (or book title and author name) will be named in the opening credits of the show as the title sponsor.  Your representative will be given 2: 30 of talk time each episode, and every member of the staff and crew plus every candidate will wear a hat with your logo and name. Plus, your company (or you, if you're an author) will get a guest judge seat on every episode.
What If We Don't...
Raise Enough Funds
It depends on how much of the money is raised. If I can raise half, I can pursue sponsorships and even grants to make up the difference. There are alternate routes we can pursue to make this a reality, and I won't give up on our dream without fighting for it.
Find a Network Willing to Pick It Up
Not to fear. That's what the internet is for. If need be, we will host webisodes of our first season, take the money and the awareness we raise from that, and push forward. It's possible, given the nature of the show's content, that we may very well be able to get it up using public access tv resources.   The Impact Watching a show like 40 Day Writer's Reality TV Series can encourage people who may have been thinking about writing to step up, get out there, and get heard. It can also give them important reality checks, letting them know what publishers and editors want to see, and what makes for a successful book.
There's a lot of benefit to be had for everyone involved in this. Viewers get an inside look at an industry that most people view as nothing short of magic, writers get an incredible opportunity to put their work out there and have it viewed by potentially millions of people. Imagine being able to have your book developing a fan base from the first sentence you write until the moment you publish - you'd remove a lot of the work of selling a book before you even began.
Agents are able to sift through submissions to find potential winners for them by searching using a simple hashtag. Coaches get an opportunity to show their stuff and encourage the work of a new crop of writers.
Publishers get the opportunity to bid on risk-free books by new authors who come prepared with author platforms and audiences already following their every move. There are only winners in this competition. 
Even the losers go home with exposure for their book ideas, contacts, and connections made in the publishing industry that are invaluable in getting published later.
This has the chance to change everything. And we can make it happen.
    Risks & Challenges  Television is always a risky proposition. Networks may offer to pick up a series only to decide to drop it after a pilot doesn't do well or when a few episodes don't go over as planned. It's going to be absolutely critical that if you support it, you blog about it, you tweet about it, you write about it, and you share it everywhere you go both on and offline. 
These are the things that will not only help build an audience for it, but sustain that audience and allow it to grow. So once we start this campaign, discuss it, talk about it, express your feelings about it and what you would like to see happen with it. Share it with others. Because if we want this one to happen, it's going to be up to us to make it happen.
I realize that I am a relatively unknown author. That is going to scare some people. I don't have a book published through a major publisher. That's going to scare some people, too. However, I have already secured a promise from at least one well-connected vip in the publishing industry (who doesn't want to be named yet) that if we get further along in the project he will throw his support behind it. 
And the more backers and supporters I can get on this, the easier it will be to find others to do the same.
    Other Ways You Can Help Remember, if you can't back it, that's okay. Support it. Tweet about it, blog about it, share it to your favorite social media site. Share the idea in the real world with your co-workers, family, friends, and people at school.

We care about this project for so many reasons, but the main reason why we need your help is because like all indiegogo accounts, we don't have enough funds to build our vision into reality.

Risks & Challenges

  All films come with challenges that filmmakers need to creatively overcome. Our greatest challenge is likely to be shooting scenes in our restaurant location.

<p><span><b>SYNOPSIS </b></span></p>
<p>High antennas on rooftops stretch into the sky, in an old village called Kampung Tapir in Johor Malaysia. Within one of the houses are ANNE and her husband BEN, on their regular visit back home to their little daughter TUNG, who’s raised by Ben’s parents. Anne, who just got promoted and granted a Permanent Residency, tries to suggest bringing Tung to Singapore for good, where the couple works and lives, but fails to do so in front of Ben’s family, who hopes for the opposite. On the bus back to Singapore, Anne finally confronts Ben right before the bus hits an endangered animal – a Malayan Tapir. Anne finds herself trapped in the middle of nowhere, not fitting in both places, drifting away from her loved ones. Just like a wandering Tapir.</p>
<p><b>故事簡介</b></p>馬來西亞柔佛州一座名為四不像新村的村落裡，家家戶戶的屋頂上有著高聳的天線，以捕捉鄰國新加坡的電視訊號。其中一戶人家裡，安（31歲）和阿明（30歲）正在打包行李，結束這每週返鄉、探望居住在公婆家的女兒彤（5歲）的行程。安掙扎著要提出帶女兒到新加坡，與同在那裡工作的夫妻倆定居。但是，面對一心想回鄉團聚的丈夫與公婆，她怎麼也說不出口，自己已升遷、獲得新加坡永久居留證的消息。終於，在返途新加坡的巴士上，安向阿明開了口，但是還來不及有結論，巴士就撞到了一隻在馬來西亞野外瀕臨絕種、卻在新加坡動物園裡生存的動物──馬來饃，也俗稱四不像。安就像這隻倒地不起的動物一樣，迷失在新馬兩地的公路上，與故鄉、家人漸行漸遠，找不到自己的歸屬感。<br/><p></p>

<p>“When I was in film school in
Taiwan, our teachers would encourage us to film in our homeland, because it is
where we were born and bred, and a place we can portray with the purest
emotions. My fellow Johorians and I have been watching Singaporean TV since
childhood, and grown up discussing to work in Singapore. It’s as if we’ve been
staring at the island across the border all our lives, and that feeling is deep
rooted in us.</p>
<p>Soon, I will be filming <i>Kampung Tapir</i> in my homeland, and just
the idea of presenting the unique architectural landscape, the old bus stops,
and the crowd lining up in the borderline- everything screaming Johorian, is
making me emotional. Because this features my homeland carries, don’t exist
elsewhere, and cannot be duplicated.”</p>

<p>「我在臺灣就讀電影的大學時期裡，老師們經常鼓勵學生回到自己的家鄉拍攝。家鄉是我們生長了幾十年的地方，總有些情懷可以用最純真、直接的感受去表達。我周遭的柔佛子民，從小在家收看的是新加坡的電視節目，長大後朋友之間也討論著要去新加坡工作。站在亞洲南端看著對面的島嶼，心情五味雜陳。</p>
<p>透過《四不像新村》，而讓我可以回到家鄉拍攝，我心裡特別激動，想把柔佛人的情感和情懷，透過捕捉當地的獨特建築地貌、人來人往的陳舊巴士站、以及通過關卡的人群等影像聲音，呈現在這部片子裡。因為我家鄉的這些特質，其他地方找不到，也複製不了。」</p>

<p>We
will skip the biology terms! A tapir has a synonym in Chinese, called
“Like-nothing-else”. It has the nose of an elephant, the skin color of a panda,
the weight of a cow, and eyes like human. It exists on its own, either in
biological category, or in real life. It lives alone, unable to fit in any
group, not even with its own species.</p>
<p></p>
<p>把真的馬來貘先介紹比較好。</p>
<p>艱澀的生物學我們就不談了！馬來饃擁有另一個名稱，叫作四不像。牠有著大象的鼻子，貓熊的膚色，牛的體重，人一樣的眼神，獨自存在在自己的生物類別裡、亦獨來獨往地生存著，無法融入任何群體，即使是同類。</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Portrait of Current
Johorians </b><b>當代柔佛子民的描繪</b><br/>
</p>
<p><span>In
our film, the tapir was hit over by a bus because of trying to cross the road
looking for food. It was starving in its original inhabitat, and to survive,
crossing the road was its only option.</span></p>
<p>Anne,
our main character, is just like the tapir herself, travelling across the
border, earning valuable Singaporean dollars for a better future, sacrificing
the chance to take care of their elders, not witnessing her child’s growth, and
alienating herself from her family and her homeland.</p>
<p>Our
director Aw See Wee is from Johor, Malaysia, and studied Filmmaking in Taiwan
for 6 years. When he came back home, he was shocked on how estranged he felt in
his own country, and how much he himself has changed. He also observed how his
fellow young Johorians, also migrant workers in Singapore, felt just like a
Tapir, a “Like-nothing-else”, and confused of their self-identity. That inspired
him to write down the story of Kampung Tapir.</p>
<p></p>
<p>《四不像新村》裡的馬來貘被撞傷了，因為牠想要過馬路至對面尋找食物。牠原本居住的地方糧食越來越少，越過危險的馬路是唯一的生存選擇。</p>
<p>片中的女主角──安，就像馬來饃一樣，為了更好的未來和孩子的前途，她必須和丈夫到新加坡工作賺取更值錢的新幣，卻因此照顧不了老人家、見證不了小孩的成長，和家人、故鄉之間的關系疏遠了。</p>
<p>全世界都在發生著為了更好的生活，而流動去異鄉工作的人。安，其實和許多人有關聯，或者說，其實我們可能都會是安，一個在別人的土地上工作、卻無法融入，在自己家園也漸漸無法適應的人。</p>
<p>來自馬來西亞柔佛州的導演歐詩偉，大學赴臺灣就讀了六年的電影，學成返鄉時，他強烈地感受到家鄉一股最熟悉的陌生，也或許是自己改變了。他也觀察到許多前往新加坡工作的同儕，同樣面臨著一種四不像的灰色困惑，是激發他寫下《四不像新村》故事的靈感。</p>

<p>High
antennas are everywhere on top of the houses in Northern Johor, Malaysia. They
are 15 feet, and indestructible, rain or shine. They are used to receive
signals from Singaporean TV channels, and thus most Johorians watch Singaporean
TV shows, and can even sing the Singapore national anthem.</p>
<p>Soon, in 2017, Singaporean
TV channels will all be digitalized, meaning the high antennas in Johor will no
longer exist. As a filmmakers, what we could do is to preserve this special
scenery on film and keep them alive for future generations.

<p><span></span></p>
<p>在馬來西亞柔佛州北部一帶，高天線到處可見。15尺的高度，風吹雨打也立足不倒。高天線接收的是新加披電視臺的節目，因此多數柔佛人長期收看對岸星國的電視，甚至讓還會唱新加坡國歌。</p>
<p>2017年後，新加坡電視臺即將邁入數位化，意味著柔佛州高天線的建築地貌，將會成為歷史。身為電影工作者，我們可以做的是把現在特有的環境記錄下來，讓他們永存在影像裏，留給後人欣賞與討論。</p>

<p>This is something a
lot of you are curious, excited and worried about. After all, Tapirs are
endangered, existing only in the wild life of Malaysia, Indonesia, and
Thailand. On the premise of not hurting any of them, we wish to collaborate
with Pusat Konservasi Hidupan Liar Sg. Dusu, a reserve center in Malaysia for
Malayan Tapirs, and film them within the area for materials in post-production.
We will also build a fake Tapir model to shoot with for the bus scenes.</p>
<p>這是很多人好奇、興奮和擔憂的問題，畢竟馬來貘是稀有動物，只在馬來西亞，印尼和泰國地區出現。在不傷害馬來貘的前提下，我們希望可以跟Pusat Konservasi Hidupan Liar Sg. Dusun配合，也就是馬來貘保護中心，在保護區實際拍攝馬來饃的畫面作為素材。同時，我們亦會製作一個馬來饃模型，進行片中撞車橋段的拍攝。</p>

SYNOPSIS 
High antennas on rooftops stretch into the sky, in an old village called Kampung Tapir in Johor Malaysia. Within one of the houses are ANNE and her husband BEN, on their regular visit back home to their little daughter TUNG, who’s raised by Ben’s parents. Anne, who just got promoted and granted a Permanent Residency, tries to suggest bringing Tung to Singapore for good, where the couple works and lives, but fails to do so in front of Ben’s family, who hopes for the opposite. On the bus back to Singapore, Anne finally confronts Ben right before the bus hits an endangered animal – a Malayan Tapir. Anne finds herself trapped in the middle of nowhere, not fitting in both places, drifting away from her loved ones. Just like a wandering Tapir.
故事簡介馬來西亞柔佛州一座名為四不像新村的村落裡，家家戶戶的屋頂上有著高聳的天線，以捕捉鄰國新加坡的電視訊號。其中一戶人家裡，安（31歲）和阿明（30歲）正在打包行李，結束這每週返鄉、探望居住在公婆家的女兒彤（5歲）的行程。安掙扎著要提出帶女兒到新加坡，與同在那裡工作的夫妻倆定居。但是，面對一心想回鄉團聚的丈夫與公婆，她怎麼也說不出口，自己已升遷、獲得新加坡永久居留證的消息。終於，在返途新加坡的巴士上，安向阿明開了口，但是還來不及有結論，巴士就撞到了一隻在馬來西亞野外瀕臨絕種、卻在新加坡動物園裡生存的動物──馬來饃，也俗稱四不像。安就像這隻倒地不起的動物一樣，迷失在新馬兩地的公路上，與故鄉、家人漸行漸遠，找不到自己的歸屬感。

ABOUT US  製作團隊



We are a group of friends who are crazy about films
and worked together since film school for years. We are also young Asian
filmmakers who are naïve, but resilient in telling stories of our generation,
our homeland through film.
我們是一群熱愛電影、合作多年的同學與好朋友，試圖說出我們這個世代裡的家國故事，有點天真、卻很堅持的亞洲青年電影創作者。



Writer/ Director 編劇、導演｜Aw See Wee 歐詩偉
──Son of Johor, Malaysia 馬來西亞柔佛之子


       

“When I was in film school in
Taiwan, our teachers would encourage us to film in our homeland, because it is
where we were born and bred, and a place we can portray with the purest
emotions. My fellow Johorians and I have been watching Singaporean TV since
childhood, and grown up discussing to work in Singapore. It’s as if we’ve been
staring at the island across the border all our lives, and that feeling is deep
rooted in us.
Soon, I will be filming Kampung Tapir in my homeland, and just
the idea of presenting the unique architectural landscape, the old bus stops,
and the crowd lining up in the borderline- everything screaming Johorian, is
making me emotional. Because this features my homeland carries, don’t exist
elsewhere, and cannot be duplicated.”


「我在臺灣就讀電影的大學時期裡，老師們經常鼓勵學生回到自己的家鄉拍攝。家鄉是我們生長了幾十年的地方，總有些情懷可以用最純真、直接的感受去表達。我周遭的柔佛子民，從小在家收看的是新加坡的電視節目，長大後朋友之間也討論著要去新加坡工作。站在亞洲南端看著對面的島嶼，心情五味雜陳。
透過《四不像新村》，而讓我可以回到家鄉拍攝，我心裡特別激動，想把柔佛人的情感和情懷，透過捕捉當地的獨特建築地貌、人來人往的陳舊巴士站、以及通過關卡的人群等影像聲音，呈現在這部片子裡。因為我家鄉的這些特質，其他地方找不到，也複製不了。」


WHY IS OUR FILM SPECIAL？影片獨特之處
What is a Malayan Tapir? 什麼是馬來饃？


                        





We
will skip the biology terms! A tapir has a synonym in Chinese, called
“Like-nothing-else”. It has the nose of an elephant, the skin color of a panda,
the weight of a cow, and eyes like human. It exists on its own, either in
biological category, or in real life. It lives alone, unable to fit in any
group, not even with its own species.

把真的馬來貘先介紹比較好。
艱澀的生物學我們就不談了！馬來饃擁有另一個名稱，叫作四不像。牠有著大象的鼻子，貓熊的膚色，牛的體重，人一樣的眼神，獨自存在在自己的生物類別裡、亦獨來獨往地生存著，無法融入任何群體，即使是同類。

Portrait of Current
Johorians 當代柔佛子民的描繪

In
our film, the tapir was hit over by a bus because of trying to cross the road
looking for food. It was starving in its original inhabitat, and to survive,
crossing the road was its only option.
Anne,
our main character, is just like the tapir herself, travelling across the
border, earning valuable Singaporean dollars for a better future, sacrificing
the chance to take care of their elders, not witnessing her child’s growth, and
alienating herself from her family and her homeland.
Our
director Aw See Wee is from Johor, Malaysia, and studied Filmmaking in Taiwan
for 6 years. When he came back home, he was shocked on how estranged he felt in
his own country, and how much he himself has changed. He also observed how his
fellow young Johorians, also migrant workers in Singapore, felt just like a
Tapir, a “Like-nothing-else”, and confused of their self-identity. That inspired
him to write down the story of Kampung Tapir.

《四不像新村》裡的馬來貘被撞傷了，因為牠想要過馬路至對面尋找食物。牠原本居住的地方糧食越來越少，越過危險的馬路是唯一的生存選擇。
片中的女主角──安，就像馬來饃一樣，為了更好的未來和孩子的前途，她必須和丈夫到新加坡工作賺取更值錢的新幣，卻因此照顧不了老人家、見證不了小孩的成長，和家人、故鄉之間的關系疏遠了。
全世界都在發生著為了更好的生活，而流動去異鄉工作的人。安，其實和許多人有關聯，或者說，其實我們可能都會是安，一個在別人的土地上工作、卻無法融入，在自己家園也漸漸無法適應的人。
來自馬來西亞柔佛州的導演歐詩偉，大學赴臺灣就讀了六年的電影，學成返鄉時，他強烈地感受到家鄉一股最熟悉的陌生，也或許是自己改變了。他也觀察到許多前往新加坡工作的同儕，同樣面臨著一種四不像的灰色困惑，是激發他寫下《四不像新村》故事的靈感。

Capture the
Disappearing Landscape 捕捉即將消逝的柔佛景象




High
antennas are everywhere on top of the houses in Northern Johor, Malaysia. They
are 15 feet, and indestructible, rain or shine. They are used to receive
signals from Singaporean TV channels, and thus most Johorians watch Singaporean
TV shows, and can even sing the Singapore national anthem.
Soon, in 2017, Singaporean
TV channels will all be digitalized, meaning the high antennas in Johor will no
longer exist. As a filmmakers, what we could do is to preserve this special
scenery on film and keep them alive for future generations.



在馬來西亞柔佛州北部一帶，高天線到處可見。15尺的高度，風吹雨打也立足不倒。高天線接收的是新加披電視臺的節目，因此多數柔佛人長期收看對岸星國的電視，甚至讓還會唱新加坡國歌。
2017年後，新加坡電視臺即將邁入數位化，意味著柔佛州高天線的建築地貌，將會成為歷史。身為電影工作者，我們可以做的是把現在特有的環境記錄下來，讓他們永存在影像裏，留給後人欣賞與討論。

How to film a tapir? 马来貘怎样拍？





This is something a
lot of you are curious, excited and worried about. After all, Tapirs are
endangered, existing only in the wild life of Malaysia, Indonesia, and
Thailand. On the premise of not hurting any of them, we wish to collaborate
with Pusat Konservasi Hidupan Liar Sg. Dusu, a reserve center in Malaysia for
Malayan Tapirs, and film them within the area for materials in post-production.
We will also build a fake Tapir model to shoot with for the bus scenes.
這是很多人好奇、興奮和擔憂的問題，畢竟馬來貘是稀有動物，只在馬來西亞，印尼和泰國地區出現。在不傷害馬來貘的前提下，我們希望可以跟Pusat Konservasi Hidupan Liar Sg. Dusun配合，也就是馬來貘保護中心，在保護區實際拍攝馬來饃的畫面作為素材。同時，我們亦會製作一個馬來饃模型，進行片中撞車橋段的拍攝。

Making films is never easy, and short films are often not taken seriously as an independent art form of cinema. 
We have strived winning all three stages of the Shortcuts Workshop to fight for the chance to making this film, and will not stop our pursuit to make the best of Kampung Tapir.
We wish to start a new wave of fearless (maybe also shameless) attempts for Malaysian young filmmakers to engage the world in their short film creations, because for us: Cinema is always about making a connection.
想拍片從來不輕鬆，屬於短片獨有的電影美學與語言，更是經常不受重視。
我們奮力地全數過了Shortcuts短片計畫競賽設立的三關，斬了好多將，才贏得這次的拍攝機會。我們把《四不像新村》拍到最好的衝勁和努力，更是永無止盡。
我們希望透過這次的募資計畫，啓動一場馬來西亞年輕電影創作者無畏的（甚至無恥的）嘗試，嘗試將全世界納入我們短片創作的環節裡進行交流。因為對我們而言，電影永遠都是一場觸擊人心的互動。

<p>I've been making films with a charity called Legs4Africa on and off for a couple of years. Legs4Africa collect dis-used prosthetic limbs from the UK and distribute them across Africa.</p>
<p>In a months time I am heading out to The Gambia to start an important project. For this project I will need £1200. The project aims to start an important conversation in The Gambia, tackling the subject of limb-loss and hoping to improve the education of diabetes with which the loss of limbs in The Gambia is strongly linked. </p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">PROJECT PLAN</b><br/></p>
<p>My aim is to create an informative and fun film on the subject of diabetes and how a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of limb-loss. This film will be made by local school children with my guidance and help. Once complete I will then take it on tour to start this imperative conversation.</p>
<p>The Plan in stages:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Spend time with The Gambia's prosthetic doctor (there is only one!)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Learn more about diabetes at the local hospital</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Share my research with the local school</span></li>
<li>Create an educational film with school children on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and the possible consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle.</li>
<li>And finally take this film on tour to other schools in Gambia to start an important dialogue.</li>

</div>","'Just over half the amputees we meet in The Gambia have limb-loss due to type 2 diabetes related problems. The elimination of high sugar diets and an education in nutritional awareness is imperative to the future of reducing limb-loss across The Gambia. ' -  Phil Tunstall, Legs4Africa 
I'm Megan and I am a freelance maker, and I run workshops in ceramics and film in Cornwall.
I've been making films with a charity called Legs4Africa on and off for a couple of years. Legs4Africa collect dis-used prosthetic limbs from the UK and distribute them across Africa.
In a months time I am heading out to The Gambia to start an important project. For this project I will need £1200. The project aims to start an important conversation in The Gambia, tackling the subject of limb-loss and hoping to improve the education of diabetes with which the loss of limbs in The Gambia is strongly linked. 
PROJECT PLAN
My aim is to create an informative and fun film on the subject of diabetes and how a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of limb-loss. This film will be made by local school children with my guidance and help. Once complete I will then take it on tour to start this imperative conversation.
The Plan in stages:


Spend time with The Gambia's prosthetic doctor (there is only one!)
Learn more about diabetes at the local hospital
Share my research with the local school
Create an educational film with school children on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and the possible consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle.
And finally take this film on tour to other schools in Gambia to start an important dialogue.

EDUCATION
Having run film workshops in schools I strongly believe in the benefits of a working environment which allows for; open conversation, creative making, ideas building and a physical and active learning experience.
This style of film making which is a process of both learning and passing learnt information on is a very empowering experience for the children involved.  Its a valuable technique which celebrates the use of knowledge and the understanding that children can teach as well as be taught! 
Film is also a great way for to communicate to a wider audience, as this visual an audible nature has the ability to cross language barriers and capture young imaginations whilst informing.
THE MONEY YOU DONATE...
The money that you give will enable me too:



Make the journey to Gambia with necessary medical supplies for the prosthetics centre.

Buy extra materials and equipment for prop/film making
Travel costs to get to schools, hospitals and visit local amputees
Desperately needed after care research on prosthetics fitted in The Gambia 
Research into the treatment and of amputees in The Gambia within their own communities.

<p>One of the best sub genres of horror out there, in my opinion, is the slasher film. You know, like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Prom Night etc... This is the kind of movie I intend to make, but the genre has been a bit overplayed and it's hard to find a way to make an original slasher film nowadays. I think that I have an idea that will turn the genre on it's head and show people a fresh take. I want to make a film completely from the slasher's point of view.</p>
<p>In The Cameraman, the cameraman will be the killer. The movie will be about a horror movie fan that convinces his friends to make a film about killing them off in a cabin in the woods, but what the friends think are going to be fake death scenes turn into real death scenes.</p>
<p>Most of, if not all of the movie will be told from the first person perspective of the main character/ killer. The film will feel very realistic, as a lot of it will be real and improved.</p>
<p>The suspense will lie in whether the cameraman is actually going to kill his friends or if he is just going to make a movie about it. As the cameraman becomes more and more obsessed with making a good horror movie, it becomes more likely that he will kill his friends off.</p>
<p>So far I have a cast and camera and next to no budget. I would love to make this the best movie it can be, so I need some money for good equipment, a cabin to stay in, and to pay my cast and crew. I feel that with the appropriate funds I could make a movie that has the potential to change the slasher genre and give the world a horror movie it's never seen before! Original horror films are few and far between, but with a little bit of funding I think I can make one!</p>
<p>I did go to college for Media and Film, so I have some background to make this work. I promise that you're not just funding an idiot with a camera. I also have a very dedicated cast and crew ready to make this happen!</p>
<p>$10,000 is my goal for this campaign, I feel that amount will be enough to make this a great movie. The basics of the film don't require a huge budget, so any money will help, and if you can't contribute money, just get the word out!</p>

Hi! I’m the producer of Busking Turf Wars, a zero-budget indie comedy documentary about a street musician called Steven from my hometown of Leeds, northern England. As you may have seen from the video above, we recently had some good news about our film: we have had our first acceptance to screen Busking Turf Wars at a film festival... and it's in the USA! And we DESPERATELY want Steven Lockmoore to be there in attendance with us!(Not familiar with the film? Check out the trailer here before reading on!)The Thin Line Film Festival is in Fort Worth, just outside of Dallas, Texas, meaning that our Official Premiere screening of Busking Turf Wars is going to be Stateside! Thin Line are even hosting their own version of a ‘Busking Turf War’, inviting musicians from across the city to ‘Busk Off’ in their city square! Check out the event, and here's Steven's introduction to the FIRST EVER Denton Busking Turf War!Given that Thin Line Film Festival is going to be our Official Festival Premiere, AAAAND given that they are hosting an event in honour of our film, we thought that it’s only right that we send Steven Lockmoore out to there to join them and officiate over proceedings! I mean, who could know the rules of a Competitive Busk Off better than Steven, right?!But we need your help.When we set out to make this film, we had nothing. There was a crew of 6 of us with no more than the loose change in our pockets, but we managed to make it. Remarkably, through the generosity of family and friends, we were able to successfully raise the finances needed to submit to film festivals.

<p><b>About the documentary</b><br/></p>
<br/><p>This documentary takes a look at the prevailing myth
of the apparition of St James in the town of Loíza. The title <i>Santiago de las Mujeres (James of the Women)</i> alludes to one of the
effigies of James the Apostle, perhaps a passage of annual renewal that reminds
us of the character, vitality and role Loíza women have as pillars of the
community.</p>

<b><br/></b>
<p><i>Santiago de las Mujeres</i> nace de la inquietud por explorar temas
relacionados a  la religiosidad popular loiceña
con un medio que pueda documentar los escenarios reales donde conviven los que
mantienen viva la tradición a Santiago Apóstol en Loíza. Sus personajes son
gente sencilla con la que he crecido y he aprendido a valorar la riqueza
cultural de mi región, la vitalidad y el entusiasmo de nuestra raíz
afrocaribeña.</p>
<p>Ha sido muy interesante la
observación de dichas tradiciones desde una perspectiva menos antropológica y
más estética, para lograr extraer los elementos que están en el corazón del
pueblo y forman parte de su esencia. He vivido y he disfrutado de las
celebraciones a Santiago por más de 35 años. El cine en su forma documental
como cine observacional, me permitirá documentar la fisicidad de lo
cotidiano y la interioridad de la espiritualidad humana.</p>
<p>La propuesta narrativa en
<i>Santiago de las Mujeres</i> juega a representar los límites entre lo documental y
la ficción, proponiendo un discurso con el espectador accidentado y casual. Esta
factura de la imagen por medio del montaje requiere relacionar secuencias muy
cortas que el espectador, necesitará armar y generar en su mente un proceso
embrionario en la que cada escena se encadena por causa y por casualidad de  la anterior. El diálogo con la cámara es el
vehículo  para armar la estructura del
documental, tras el mundo proyectado de los personajes. De esta manera, con sus
elementos espaciales y textuales, este documental quiere revelar algo de la
fusión social y cultural de estos ritos. Traza paralelismos entre las historias
de sus personajes, su devoción a Santiago Apóstol y de su imaginario en la vida
actual loiceña. </p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>(English Version)<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Director
Commentary<br/></b></p>
<p><i>Santiago de las Mujeres</i>
(James of the Women) was born out of the interest to explore themes related to
the popular religious beliefs of Loíza’s people in a medium that could document
the actual scenarios where those who keep the tradition in honor to Santiago of
Loíza live. The characters in the documentary are humble people with whom I
have lived and learned to value the cultural richness of my region, along with
the vitality, and the enthusiasm of our Afro Caribbean roots.
</p>
<p>It has been very interesting to observe said
traditions from an aesthetical perspective rather than an anthropological one,

<p>The narrative proposed in <i>Santiago de las Mujeres
</i>attempts to represent the limits between fiction and documentary, and proposing
a dialogue with the accidental, casual spectator. The making of these images by
means of montage requires relating very short sequences that each spectator
will have to put together and recreate in his/her mind—an embryonic process in
which each scene will lead to the next by cause and effect and causality of the

<p>The dialogue with the camera is the vehicle to put

to reveal something about the social and cultural fusion of these rites. It
also attempts to trace parallelisms between the characters’ stories, their
devotion to James the Apostle, and its imaginary in the present life of the
Loíza people.</p>

Sobre el documentalEste documental es una mirada
a la vigencia del mito de la aparición de Santiago en Loíza. El título Santiago de las Mujeres alude a una de las tres efigies del
mismo Santiago Apóstol y es  quizás un
pasaje anual de renovación que nos recuerda el carácter, la vitalidad y la
función  de la mujer loiceña como pilar
de la comunidad. 

(English Version)
About the documentary
This documentary takes a look at the prevailing myth
of the apparition of St James in the town of Loíza. The title Santiago de las Mujeres (James of the Women) alludes to one of the
effigies of James the Apostle, perhaps a passage of annual renewal that reminds
us of the character, vitality and role Loíza women have as pillars of the
community.
  

Hilda Juana Pizarro y la imágen de Santiago de las Mujeres. Foto tomada  por Cheery Viruet.Hilda Juana Pizarro and  the image of St. James of the Women. Photo  by Cheery Viruet.Comentario de la directora

Santiago de las Mujeres nace de la inquietud por explorar temas
relacionados a  la religiosidad popular loiceña
con un medio que pueda documentar los escenarios reales donde conviven los que
mantienen viva la tradición a Santiago Apóstol en Loíza. Sus personajes son
gente sencilla con la que he crecido y he aprendido a valorar la riqueza
cultural de mi región, la vitalidad y el entusiasmo de nuestra raíz
afrocaribeña.
Ha sido muy interesante la
observación de dichas tradiciones desde una perspectiva menos antropológica y
más estética, para lograr extraer los elementos que están en el corazón del
pueblo y forman parte de su esencia. He vivido y he disfrutado de las
celebraciones a Santiago por más de 35 años. El cine en su forma documental
como cine observacional, me permitirá documentar la fisicidad de lo
cotidiano y la interioridad de la espiritualidad humana.
La propuesta narrativa en
Santiago de las Mujeres juega a representar los límites entre lo documental y
la ficción, proponiendo un discurso con el espectador accidentado y casual. Esta
factura de la imagen por medio del montaje requiere relacionar secuencias muy
cortas que el espectador, necesitará armar y generar en su mente un proceso
embrionario en la que cada escena se encadena por causa y por casualidad de  la anterior. El diálogo con la cámara es el
vehículo  para armar la estructura del
documental, tras el mundo proyectado de los personajes. De esta manera, con sus
elementos espaciales y textuales, este documental quiere revelar algo de la
fusión social y cultural de estos ritos. Traza paralelismos entre las historias
de sus personajes, su devoción a Santiago Apóstol y de su imaginario en la vida
actual loiceña. 



(English Version)
Director
Commentary
Santiago de las Mujeres
(James of the Women) was born out of the interest to explore themes related to
the popular religious beliefs of Loíza’s people in a medium that could document
the actual scenarios where those who keep the tradition in honor to Santiago of
Loíza live. The characters in the documentary are humble people with whom I
have lived and learned to value the cultural richness of my region, along with
the vitality, and the enthusiasm of our Afro Caribbean roots.

It has been very interesting to observe said
traditions from an aesthetical perspective rather than an anthropological one,
in order to extract the elements grounded in the people and which make up their
essence. I have lived and enjoyed the festivities in honor of Santiago for over
35 years. Filming in a documentary format as well as in an observational one
will allow me to document the physicality of everyday life and the interior
nature of human spirituality.
The narrative proposed in Santiago de las Mujeres
attempts to represent the limits between fiction and documentary, and proposing
a dialogue with the accidental, casual spectator. The making of these images by
means of montage requires relating very short sequences that each spectator
will have to put together and recreate in his/her mind—an embryonic process in
which each scene will lead to the next by cause and effect and causality of the
previous one. 
The dialogue with the camera is the vehicle to put
together the documentary’s structure, laying behind the projected world of the
characters. Thus, with its spatial and textual elements, this documentary wants
to reveal something about the social and cultural fusion of these rites. It
also attempts to trace parallelisms between the characters’ stories, their
devotion to James the Apostle, and its imaginary in the present life of the
Loíza people.

 It's What Dad Would Have Wanted. is a film about hitting rock bottom and finding a way to get back up again featuring award winning comic book artist, and my father,  the late Ric Estrada.
My dad's friends used to call him the Cuban Forest Gump- he's sort of been everywhere, met the most amazing people, and the had craziest experiences- but most of his friends don't even know the half of it! Ric's story is hard to believe, yet amazingly true.And for me, personally, this film is much more than a simple collection of zany stories- I'm unravelling the mystery of who my dad really was and what possessed him to make some of the odd choices he did. 
I need your help to finish making this film.


The Need [What, Where, When]
 

We have a limited window to complete production in Cuba, as the US appears to be loosening the trade restrictions there- that means that the Cuba my dad knew as a child, will probably disappear forever. We feel it's important to shoot there and complete the film this year [2016]. 

We need $30k to go to Cuba and do one last major shoot, edit the film, add some animation, and enter it into festivals. 

Every dollar counts- check out the rewards to this side. The top tier is for an executive producer credit, and includes a spot on our team in Havana when we shoot.


We are going to continue production even if we don't hit the total funding goal: Again, we've got to shoot in Havana before American investors start making changes to it.


The Impact [Why]
 
Anyone who loves comic books will appreciate the humanity that Ric's story gives to the creators of our favorite characters and heroes. While he was alive, Ric inspired hundreds of young people to develop themselves artistically. Your support will help Ric to continue to inspire new artists to invest in themselves and take the right kinds of risks that will give us new heroes. 
Also, you could be listed as an associate or executive producer on IMDb. Read the fine print and check all the rewards over at IndieGoGo.

The Process [How]

American Splendor meets My Architect. 


Primarily live action, with some interviews, some locations, some animated elements/sequences, and plenty of discovery and snark.


The Qualifications [Who]



While working at Dreamworks Animation, I completed over a dozen internal video projects with high technical standards, and firm deadlines. I have shot, logged, and archived and kept the footage from this project for 10 years now.

Oscar-nominated director Christian Jensen is also on board. He is based in the San Francisco area but will rendezvous with me in Havana, Cuba. 
Cinnafilm, an award winning digital film engineering company, has offered to do some cool stuff for us so the film will be ready for the big screen- it is going to look great at film festivals!


We are committed to seeing the last leg of production through to the end: Whether or not a finished film is edited and submitted to film festivals is now up to you, our backers.

    The Challenges
We have the right team, and the right schedule: Havana will be in the off-season for tourism, and also the non-hurricane season [PHEW!] so it will be easy to get there and get what we need, without interference from tourists and tropical storms.

No one is being reimbursed for the time they've already worked on this film. It's just water under the bridge. But we do need to pay a few key individuals moving forward: a producer in Havana, a producer for any remaining US shoots, an editor, and an animator. 

The biggest challenge is simply funding the film: we are actively applying for grants, and have already invested quite a bit of personal resources and time into producing the film up to this point.    The Other Ways To Help

<p>We are an international team of passionate students and young professionals in space-related fields. We come from different backgrounds, cultures, and nations.</p>
<p>Mars is at the top of humanity's list of destinations to explore. <strong>We want to take part in the wonderful journey to Mars! </strong>We believe Earth can be a proving ground for future Mars missions, and that is why we are organizing PMAS 2017. By researching issues relevant to deep-space travel - including the challenges of time-delayed communication, the psychological effects of isolation, and the logistics of living and working on Mars - <strong>we will contribute to the long-term goal of sending human beings to Mars.</strong> Even if we won't be able to get to go to Mars in our lifetimes, we will help pave the way for future generations of space explorers!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476444769/scu3vzxdzwjwlz1apngf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Have you ever <strong>dreamt of being an astronaut</strong> - or even being the <strong>first human to step onto the surface of another planet</strong>? Becoming an astronaut is hard, but getting involved in human space exploration is easy - <strong>you can start by supporting this mission!</strong></p>
<p>By supporting PMAS, you are supporting humanity's long-term goal of exploring and settling on the Moon and Mars. </p>
<p>Space Exploration allows us to explore something bigger than ourselves. It's an extension to human curiosity; our last frontier. When we first went to space, we did that to test the limits of the human spirit. It's the ultimate challenge that all humans are collaborating, not competing, to overcome. The huge technological advancement in space led to a paradigm shift... Humans are not going to space just to explore anymore, they are going to settle on other planets. That's the goal we all yearn to achieve.</p>
<p>The first step to do this is to train and test long-term mission operations and scientific exploration under realistic conditions within an analogue mission on Earth! And that's what PMAS is all about. </p>
<p>This mission will be a <strong>serious scientific enterprise</strong> whose results will feed directly into the planning and design of <strong>future missions to Mars</strong>. Who doesn’t want to support that?</p>
<p>Plus, we are offering <strong>tons of great perks if you donate $5 or more!</strong></p>
<p>What makes PMAS 2017 different:</p>

<p>M.A.R.S. is a modular combined laboratory and living space for up to 6 astronauts. It will contain a biological laboratory, where plant growth on Lunar and Martian soil simulants under the adequate lighting can be studied. An algae reactor will recycle organic material into fresh bio mass, which can be used as food supplement. A chemical laboratory will allow to analyse rock and soil samples taking on the astronauts' EVAs (Extra Vehicular Activity). A workshop will allow us to test, maintain, and adapt hardware equipment, which can be rovers or other robotic support units. In the future, it is foreseen to make this laboratory hermetical isolated and entirely self-sufficient as a real station on Moon or Mars would have to be.</p>
<p>Video footage from the mission will be used to produce a <strong>comprehensive and engaging documentary about human space exploration</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, in accordance with <a href=""http://lunarexploration.esa.int/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ESA's plans to go to the Moon first</a> and then to Mars, we will have a <strong>3-day Lunar Simulation</strong> prior to PMAS 2017 <strong>in partnership with ESA.</strong> During the Lunar Simulation, communication will be real-time or near real-time, the analogue astronaut schedule will be in ""Lunar Mode,"" and EVAs will mostly take place at night.</p>
<p>Our PMAS 2017 team consists of some of the <strong>brightest young minds</strong> in space-related disciplines from around the world. Our Astronaut Crew and our Flight Support Team will attend multiple workshops <strong>in partnership with ESA </strong>at <a href=""http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESTEC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ESTEC</a> prior to the mission. This will ensure that we thoroughly understand all relevant aspects of space exploration mission planning and operations.</p>
<p>There have been many analog missions conducted so far, but PMAS 2017 will be <strong>remarkable</strong> in many ways: in its <strong>internationalism</strong>, its strong <strong>emphasis on outreach</strong>, and in the <strong>wide range of scientific research</strong> that it will include.

Get a custom portrait of yourself (or a friend) as a PMAS astronaut on Mars - only $10!

 

We are an international team of passionate students and young professionals in space-related fields. We come from different backgrounds, cultures, and nations.
Mars is at the top of humanity's list of destinations to explore. We want to take part in the wonderful journey to Mars! We believe Earth can be a proving ground for future Mars missions, and that is why we are organizing PMAS 2017. By researching issues relevant to deep-space travel - including the challenges of time-delayed communication, the psychological effects of isolation, and the logistics of living and working on Mars - we will contribute to the long-term goal of sending human beings to Mars. Even if we won't be able to get to go to Mars in our lifetimes, we will help pave the way for future generations of space explorers!

Have you ever dreamt of being an astronaut - or even being the first human to step onto the surface of another planet? Becoming an astronaut is hard, but getting involved in human space exploration is easy - you can start by supporting this mission!
By supporting PMAS, you are supporting humanity's long-term goal of exploring and settling on the Moon and Mars. 
Space Exploration allows us to explore something bigger than ourselves. It's an extension to human curiosity; our last frontier. When we first went to space, we did that to test the limits of the human spirit. It's the ultimate challenge that all humans are collaborating, not competing, to overcome. The huge technological advancement in space led to a paradigm shift... Humans are not going to space just to explore anymore, they are going to settle on other planets. That's the goal we all yearn to achieve.
The first step to do this is to train and test long-term mission operations and scientific exploration under realistic conditions within an analogue mission on Earth! And that's what PMAS is all about. 
This mission will be a serious scientific enterprise whose results will feed directly into the planning and design of future missions to Mars. Who doesn’t want to support that?
Plus, we are offering tons of great perks if you donate $5 or more!
What makes PMAS 2017 different:



The Modular Analogue Research Station (M.A.R.S.), which will house PMAS Analogue astronauts is built by Spacegarden Company, a prestigious research organisation in Poland. 

The Poland Mars Analogue Simulation (PMAS) is a two weeks isolation mission, whereof the first 3 days will be a lunar simulation and the remaining 11 days will be a Martian one. Main difference therein is the time delay in the communications of around 15 minutes. 

The PMAS team  is an international, multicultural and interdisciplinary team of students and young professionals.

Mission Support Centre will be located at the offices of ABM Space, a distinguished space company, in Torun, which - as the birthplace of the famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus - has a long and proud tradition in astronomy.  

PMAS research will address some of the crucial aspects of deep-space expeditions.
The Mission is organized by the Space Exploration Project Group (SEPG), a sub-group of the Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC) in support of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications. 
PMAS will conduct a realistic simulation with all aspects of a real Moon/Mars mission, including complete isolation and time-delayed communications. 
PMAS will involve and engage the public in space exploration through space outreach activities across the world. Outreach activities include educating younger generations about Space using various media, organizing workshops/events, hosting student competitions, and filming a documentary.

 

Your contributions will help us to:


Increase interest in space exploration among a broad range of people across the world.

Research strategies to send people back to the Moon, and put people on the red planet and allow them to work and live safely, efficiently, and sustainably.

Share our results and discoveries with the scientific community and the public.

Support international, multicultural, and interdisciplinary collaboration in space exploration.

Engage younger generations with space exploration and related disciplines.
Showcase ESA’s plans to establish a Moon base.

Explain why Mars is the most suitable destination to search for life in the Solar System to a broad range of audiences around the world.

 

PMAS 2017, organized by the Space Exploration Project Group of the Space Generation Advisory Council, will be a realistic human space exploration simulation mission. During the 2-week mission, our crew of 6 analogue astronauts will conduct scientific research and record their experiences while living in the M.A.R.S. Laboratory in southern Poland. They will be fully isolated from the outside world, apart from communications with the Mission Support Team, located in the offices of ABM Space in Torun, Poland. All communications between the Mission Support Center and astronauts will be via time-delayed channels to simulate the long distance between the Earth and Mars. The experience & knowledge gained from this mission will help lay the groundwork for the first human expedition to Mars.

M.A.R.S. is a modular combined laboratory and living space for up to 6 astronauts. It will contain a biological laboratory, where plant growth on Lunar and Martian soil simulants under the adequate lighting can be studied. An algae reactor will recycle organic material into fresh bio mass, which can be used as food supplement. A chemical laboratory will allow to analyse rock and soil samples taking on the astronauts' EVAs (Extra Vehicular Activity). A workshop will allow us to test, maintain, and adapt hardware equipment, which can be rovers or other robotic support units. In the future, it is foreseen to make this laboratory hermetical isolated and entirely self-sufficient as a real station on Moon or Mars would have to be.
Video footage from the mission will be used to produce a comprehensive and engaging documentary about human space exploration.

In addition, in accordance with ESA's plans to go to the Moon first and then to Mars, we will have a 3-day Lunar Simulation prior to PMAS 2017 in partnership with ESA. During the Lunar Simulation, communication will be real-time or near real-time, the analogue astronaut schedule will be in ""Lunar Mode,"" and EVAs will mostly take place at night.
Our PMAS 2017 team consists of some of the brightest young minds in space-related disciplines from around the world. Our Astronaut Crew and our Flight Support Team will attend multiple workshops in partnership with ESA at ESTEC prior to the mission. This will ensure that we thoroughly understand all relevant aspects of space exploration mission planning and operations.
There have been many analog missions conducted so far, but PMAS 2017 will be remarkable in many ways: in its internationalism, its strong emphasis on outreach, and in the wide range of scientific research that it will include. Help us make this mission a reality!

PMAS research areas include the evaluation of the performance of astronauts conducting geologic fieldwork under harsh conditions limited by bulky space suits, applications of technologies to support human activities on a planetary surface, controlled investigations and experiments in psychology and human factors, studies of plant growth on Martian soil simulants, and astronomical studies.

The PMAS 2017 team is a passionate and incredibly international group of volunteers. We are students and young professionals from 6 continents and more than 30 countries, united by the dream of space exploration.

RUNNING WITH VIOLET is a 10 episode action packed Digital Series about two women, a teenager and a toddler who try to ditch their small town for an open road of adventure but soon get entangled in a meth ring. We like to call this show Thelma and Louise meets Fargo. Intrigued?(below: sample page from our 'BE THE ZEN MASTER' adult colouring book perk) RUNNING WITH VIOLET tells the story of Jolene, a single mother longing for adventure and independence away from her constraining small town and family life, and her best friend Miranda, a closeted and repressed housewife yearning to express who she is beyond her imposing husband. Hoping to escape their little town, Jolene and Miranda take their deepest fantasies on the road on an unforgettable girls weekend -- turned bloody, treacherous drug deal.  Did we mention that Jolene brought her toddler Violet with her?Along the way, Jolene, Miranda, and little Violet pick up Frankie, a larger-than-life teen who never fails to speak her mind, and run into countless unpredictable characters. Real cops, fake cops, undercover cops, bad guys, good guys, good guys posing as bad guys, longing ex-husbands, creepy current husbands, pushy Norwegian environmentalists, meth dealing grandmas, biker chicks who bake killer pies,  curious nuns, and more sweep Jolene, Miranda, Frankie and Violet on a ""girls weekend"" beyond their wildest imaginations. Ultimately, our women must decide if they're going to give up who they thought they were - defined by the small town repression, the familial responsibilities, the patriarchal expectations - for who they were meant to be: Women who decide their own fate.RUNNING WITH VIOLET is a story that is at times violent, always adventurous, and very often romantic. Expect to be holding your breath at the end of every episode.WHO ARE WE?We are Rebecca Davey and Marie-Claire Marcotte, the leads of the show and founders of the production company SHE SAID FILMS. We have been creating together for ten years. We have big dreams for our company, each other, young girls who follow our lead...and the world!  She Said Films creates content for TV, Film and the Digital Space with strong women in our stories and behind the camera. We like how they say it over at Tello Films:  “we advocate for women (mostly) who are allies, mothers, daughters, bosses, explorers, dreamers, doers, go-getters, go-get-hers, lesbian, bi, undecided, complex and fluid.” THEMES!One of the important themes of the show is women breaking free— can a woman/person break free, what happens when they try—not to mention when there’s a kid in the mix. Breaking free with a toddler is its own thing entirely. IMPACT!We want to bring the complex female experience to the screen. We have lots of aspects to us as women!! We are not just a device to complete the male story, right?! We are full and complete human beings with stories to tell all on our own. And times are changing and gender equality is on the agenda, but it takes time for real change to happen. Most of the content in today's media is still about men and being made by men. If you make a donation to Running With Violet you're supporting the proliferation of female content around the web. Phew! WHY DO WE NEED YOUR MONEY?We are 75% funded after winning a Canada wide competition. We need your support now to get to the finish line. Our remaining 25% will fund the really fun stuff!******ACTION PACKED SPECIAL EFFECTS ******                                    Typically women get asked to make ‘relationship’ movies and men get the superhero action packed adventures. We want to do both of those things in our series. The relationships are important but so is the action! But to bring you action we need a bigger budget. Our array of stunts will include:
car chase
combat
use of firearms
cop cars
gun wounds
special effects
blood
 With this last 25% we could achieve the shots we dream of (example: get the cop car to make the wide shot realistic), hire a bigger production design team, invest a little bit more money in wardrobe, be able to hire all the background talent we need to sell the story--all the little things that add up to the quality of show we think you deserve! OUR TEAM!Rebecca Davey is a lead in the series as well as one of the creators. For the past two years she has taken films to the Cannes Film Festival along with Marie-Claire. In her spare time she works on her Masters of Creative Writing and takes care of her two daughters, one of whom will be appearing in Running With Violet. Rebecca is an avid eavesdropper – watch out! Marie-Claire Marcotte is a lead in the series as well as one of the show creators. Her first web series ON THE HEATED FLOOR was an official selection at ITVfest and at the Raindance WebFest. She is also producing and acting in the feature film Pippa and the Bees written by Rebecca. She is originally from Saskatchewan and fluffy croissants make her really happy. Lindsay MacKay is directing the series. She is a graduate of the prestigious American Film Institute. Her film Wet Bum premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014. She splits her time between LA and Toronto. She’s had two perms in her life.  Jessii Vee has made a name for herself on her wildly successful YouTube channel which boasts over 650K subscribers. She is making her acting debut in Running With Violet! Did you know Jessii does her own graphics? Violet is...well Violet. She is Rebecca’s daughter and super excited to be acting alongside Mama. She is full of smiles and lots of zany turns of phrase. We can't get enough of this 3-year-old! Guy Godfree is the Director of Photography for the series. He is a member of the Canadian Society of Cinematographers. His most recent film Maudie premiered at Telluride and the Toronto International Film Festival and starred Sally Hawkins and Ethan Hawke. He’s originally from Nova Scotia and will charm any woman or man with his accent. The multi-talented Michelle Irving is composing all the music for the series. She specializes in audio post-production including music composition, music editing, sound design & editing, foley, and mixing. She also DJs under the name dashussy. Michelle’s patterned ‘party pants’ make the whole “Running With Violet” team very happy.SO HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED IN OUR CAMPAIGN?
Donate a small amount.
Donate a large amount.
If donating is out of the question, then mentor a young girl instead as a nod to the underlying feminist themes in our show. Actively reach out and be a positive role model by showing a young girl how you take risks, sometimes fail, but always try again. This is what we try to model to Rebecca’s daughters and any young people we have encountered in our years of teaching theatre workshops.

<p>When asked to give to his community by teaching and nurturing young minds, he couldn't help but answer his call to service. His passion, more than golf, is in seeing his students achieve all that they never knew possible.</p>

<p>Joe has given so much, I believe its time for his community to give back.</p>
<p>Please donate any amount you can: one dollar, five dollars, ten dollars.</p>

<p>When Joe finds out about this, he'll be embarrassed, he'll try to say no, and, eventually, he will say thank you and win the Brooklyn Open.</p>
<p>Brooklyn deserves Joe as much as Joe deserves this. Marine Park was Joe's stomping grounds before he moved to Myrtle Beach to make a life for his family.</p>
<p>He's beaten me there, many times, and he'll beat anyone else on his home course.</p>
<p>For each donation, I say thank you. For each donor that enters an email address, I will send a picture of Joe Carbonell, downloadable via email, of him hoisting the cup over his head, with his loving family smothering him in adulation.</p>

known as Florentino. Viola moves from San Francisco, California to Mexico City

The film is a tribute to victims of hate crimes and dedicated to two close friends of Hector who were killed for dressing in drag and being openly gay. In 2005, after a night out in drag, our friend Amancio was tortured and murdered in Yuma, Arizona. His body was found five days later. In 2006, another friend Paul was stabbed multiple times in his home while he slept.</p><p>Viola’s story gives us hope and strength through the darkness.

The Queen and
the Dead follows the life of a young drag songstress, Viola Corona also
known as Florentino. Viola moves from San Francisco, California to Mexico City
to follow her dream of becoming the next international female pop star only to
discover the zombie apocalypse has just begun. Through the support of amazing
friends, Viola discovers that her voice has the power to hypnotize zombies. This
film chronicles Viola’s hilarious butt kicking adventures to stardom. The Queen and the Dead is a homage to all superheroes who inspire us to be better human beings. Viola reminds us to be true to ourselves no matter our ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity. The film is a tribute to victims of hate crimes and dedicated to two close friends of Hector who were killed for dressing in drag and being openly gay. In 2005, after a night out in drag, our friend Amancio was tortured and murdered in Yuma, Arizona. His body was found five days later. In 2006, another friend Paul was stabbed multiple times in his home while he slept.Viola’s story gives us hope and strength through the darkness. The Queen and the Dead encourages us to follow our dreams and overcome obstacles that get in our way including the flesh eating undead.Who we areWe are a devoted and hard working team of artists who have a passion for dance, theater, drag queens and zombies. Together we have over 25 years of experience in performing and making art. Antonio Ortiz (director/screenwriter) has a BA in Comparative Literature from the University of California Berkeley. Antonio worked for KPFA/Pacifica Radio and Berkeley Public Access TV for 15 years. He’s a man of many hats. He can do everything from radio and TV production and post-production to technical support. Antonio is also an accomplished dancer.  Hector Zavala (producer) has 19 years of experience in theater and film production in the United States and Mexico. 
Back in 2014, our project made a successful theatrical debut
as a play in the Home Theatre Festival in Oakland, California. The
Queen and the Dead short teaser was screened in San Francisco on February 21st,
in San Diego on February 24th and in Mexicali, Mexico on February 27th
to excited audiences who loved the film and most importantly wanted to see
more.
What We Need and What You Get

We need $250,000 to
complete the feature film. Funds will cover production and post-production
expenses like film equipment and crew, sound engineers, location permits,
make-up artists, costumes, special FX artists, and contributor perks. Our film
will feature up to a hundred talented actors, dancers and star-studded cameos. The
incomparable Mexican actress, Aida Pierce, known for her work in telenovelas
and sitcoms and the one and only Heklina (formerly known as Trannyshack) drag queen and entrepreneur
from San Francisco are on board! We are also thrilled to have renowned composer
Lawrence Rush produce two original songs for the film score. Scene
Runner app is sponsoring our rehearsals by creating a special link for
our actors to rehearse and run lines.
We
assure you that each and every dollar contributed will be put to good use. Here
is a graph breakdown showing how the money will be spent: Please take a look at the short film, The Queen and the Dead. We produced this 21 minute short with a week of preproduction, 3 days of filming on an iPhone 5s, producing 1 cover song, plus 2 zombies for a budget of $ 5000 USD. Don't you want to see what happens next?! Imagine all the zombies, special FX and original songs we can create your with support.

<h3><strong>Our Film</strong></h3>
<p>Within the world of <i>The Chameleon</i>, the allure of Hollywood has worn off, long ago replaced by the vapid nature that lurks beneath the parties, auditions, and lies being spun to ""make it big."" In this forlorn landscape, our titular hero — a failed actor — finds himself on the verge of breaking free of Los Angeles and moving on from the industry altogether. Yet, as he takes the first steps to do so, the city both literally and metaphorically attempts to block his escape while all the while, his grasp on reality slowly erodes.</p>
<p>Blending dark comedy with atmospheric drama, <i>The Chameleon</i> seeks to challenge as often as it entertains, begging the central question: once people learn who they truly are, is it possible to change? Eerie and inspiring all at once, the film sketches an idealistic version of the Hollywood limelight over the revealing backdrop of the industry's darker tendencies to great effect, both visually and narratively. In the process, <i>The Chameleon</i> pits naivety against guilt, intention against inaction and ultimately, ""the self"" against the self one wishes they could be. </p>
<h3><strong>Our Team</strong></h3>
<p>To create this vivid world on screen, a talented team of artists came together to lend their passion, skill and vision.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stephanie Phoutrides (Director/Producer)</u></strong>: Stephanie fell in love with filmmaking after a series of memorable productions with her siblings, including such favorites as <i>A Crime Best Forgotten, Cluedo,</i> and <i>Save the Globe.  </i>After her first serious endeavor producing a documentary on competitive Greek folk-dancing, Stephanie went on to study film in college.  Upon graduating, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue filmmaking and currently works at a studio in development.</p>
<p><strong><u>Alex Hanno (Writer/Producer)</u></strong>: After trying his hand at writing in elementary school, Alex fell in love with the craft and made it his life goal to share stories with the world from then on. Upon entering the English program at Tufts University, he found himself drawn toward a focus in film studies and screenwriting and after joining the school's daily newspaper, <i>The Tufts Daily,</i> worked his way up to the role of editor for both the Film and Television beats. After graduating, Alex moved to Los Angeles to pursue screenwriting and film production full time. He has since written and produced a number of short films, including Australia's Tropfest submission, <i>The Tramp</i>, and has received wide recognition for his feature comedy script, <i>Fairly Certain</i>, including the credit of Semi Finalist in both the Creative World Awards and Screencraft's Comedy Awards. In addition, Alex works as a script reader for select production companies in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong><u>Gianluca Malacrino (Lead Actor)</u></strong>: Born in Cardiff, Wales, Gianluca began training as a performer at 19 years old under the instruction of Rebecca Hardy at the Actors Workshop in his hometown. After securing nominations for his lead roles in short films <i>Managed</i> and <i>Couple Confine</i> at the Cardiff Mini Film Festival and Camarthen Bay Film Festival, Gianluca made the move to Hollywood to pursue his passion full time and has since graduated from AMDA College &amp; Conservatory for the Performing Arts. His latest work includes a lead role in the Robey Theatre Company's professional production of the Pulitzer Prize winning play, <i>No Place to Be Somebody</i> and a part in an upcoming project directed by Francis Ford Coppola, titled <i>Distant Vision</i>. </p>

<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>Thus far, the team behind the <i>The Chameleon</i> has ushered this amazing project through pre-production, casting, and all principle photography, but to get our short to the finish line, we're going to need your help. As you can see from the clips and stills in our video above, <i>The Chameleon</i> is finally starting to come together, but there are still a slew of post-production elements that need to be completed, such as constructing the visual effects, cutting together the footage, mixing the sound, and composing a stellar music score. What's more, after the film is complete, we're planning to take it around the festival circuit, submitting to competitions domestically and internationally. Of course, in order to get <i>The Chameleon</i> to that point cinematically and then cover submission fees and other outstanding costs, we're asking for your support in raising a total of $5,500 (or more!).</p>
<p>After seeing the passion that has gone into our short film thus far, it means the world to all of us here that <i>The Chameleon </i>gets completed the way it deserves. As with any piece of art, it's vital to us that <i>The Chameleon </i>is shared with the world, for it boasts a simple, albeit thought-provoking theme (i.e. identity or the lack thereof) that pushes viewers to really look within for an answer.

<p>We are going to be making a full on fan-film based upon Spider-Man and his journey after being bitten as well as Harry Osborn's journey into darkness as the psychotic villain, Green Goblin. We get to see Peter Parker as he gains the confidence to ask out the girl of his dreams, goes through trauma, loses his best friend and motivations, loses his way, and and tries finding hope. This web of a story introduces not only the Green Goblin but also Wilson Fisk also known as the Kingpin. This film hints at bigger plot points with subtle Easter-eggs and name drops to countless comic book stories. In this (approximately) 60 minute long fan-film we get to see the relationship between Peter and Harry, Gwen, and of course his aunt and uncle. The cast for this is what is called a ""rolling cast"" where besides the official cast of the main characters, we will fill roles as the project rolls along.

<div>As a huge fan of BOTH Marvel and DC comics, the wall crawler has always been part of my life.

I remember my brothers watching the animated series from the 90's, and that is when I first became interested in the character. I picked it up and fell in love with Peter Benjamin Parker and all of his triumphs and struggles. He was the every-man superhero, and I loved that! The older I got, the more I looked toward him and his stories, and being in high school, I found myself often relating to him.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Whenever working on any sort of film or series there are bound to be many obstacles. Most of which will be spontaneous and expense related. For instance we could have a costume malfunction that needs to be fixed, a prop or set piece breaks, the need for another piece of film equipment, or even just re-shoots can be a monetary hassle. We have some money set aside in the budget just for these sorts of things, and luckily with my theatre background I have many connections in the theatre world to help fix a problem that can't be fixed with something I have in my ""utility belt"" of options.<br/>If you notice we are also using flexible funding, however if we don't get a certain amount for mics, cameras, green screens, rigs, etc then we will not take out any money. We will not take money unless we are able to create what we set out to do. If needbe, we can cut certain small moments in the story that have less of an effect, or even just cut equipment and find alternatives. But we will never take your money if we can't give you the product we intended.</p>

Risks & Challenges
Whenever working on any sort of film or series there are bound to be many obstacles. Most of which will be spontaneous and expense related. For instance we could have a costume malfunction that needs to be fixed, a prop or set piece breaks, the need for another piece of film equipment, or even just re-shoots can be a monetary hassle. We have some money set aside in the budget just for these sorts of things, and luckily with my theatre background I have many connections in the theatre world to help fix a problem that can't be fixed with something I have in my ""utility belt"" of options.If you notice we are also using flexible funding, however if we don't get a certain amount for mics, cameras, green screens, rigs, etc then we will not take out any money. We will not take money unless we are able to create what we set out to do. If needbe, we can cut certain small moments in the story that have less of an effect, or even just cut equipment and find alternatives. But we will never take your money if we can't give you the product we intended.
