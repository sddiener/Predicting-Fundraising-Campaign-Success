<br/>Hi, I'm <b>Brandon Foster</b> and I created the first ""<b>Teach 'Em Early</b>"" product for some good friends of mine who happen to work for a very familiar and large conservation organization with headquarters in western Tennessee (I don't think I can name drop here).  They were expecting their first child and I wanted to give them something unique that they could identify with while at the same time welcoming the new addition to their family with a ""tongue in cheek"" humorous yet functional product.<br/><b><br/>Contributors to my campaign</b> will first receive the product 
(duh).  It's what you're buying for yourself or your friends.  And if 
you're buying as a gift, you'll also be viewed by your peers as the <b>coolest ""Friend, Spouse, Aunt, Uncle, Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother, Stranger"" on the planet</b>. 
 You'll hear things like, ""Wow!  Where did you get that!"" and ""Dude, 
that's freaking awesome"" and all sorts of other accolades.  (Be aware, 
you might also get a few dirty looks from non-amused spousal units... 
you know who they are...)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1215028/files/20150211130804-topper.jpg?1423688884"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>But what's more important is that <b>when you participate in my campaign</b>
 by purchasing  a ""Teach 'Em Early Waterfowl Identification Crib Moble"" 
product (or 10 of them for future ""gifting""), you're passing along a 
legacy of conservation and family tradition to the next generation in a 
very cool way.  You're passing to the next generation your passion for 
outdoor pursuits and support for conservation organizations... 2% of the
 net sales of these products from this campaign will be donated to 
wildlife conservation organizations, most likely the big one I referred 
to in the first paragraph... : )<br/><b><br/></b><p></p>

<h3>
<br/>The back story behind the original ""Teach 'Em Early""<br/>
</h3>When I made the first one for my friend, there was <b>nothing like it in
the market </b>(and still isn't).  I went to baby store after baby store
after baby store... outdoor mass retailers and small hunt/fish stores and had
ZERO success finding something like this.  “Surely there are other outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen
who ""get it""? I asked myself.  After a little impromptu research
(a.k.a. ""duck blind"" questions during the slow periods - ""hey,
would you buy one of these?""), the answer was a resounding
""YES!!!""  Hopefully, that sentiment will be reflected here in
about 30 days.<br/><br/>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1201533/files/20150206085029-originalmobilepkg.jpg?1423241429"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>The original package design for the Teach 'Em Early crib mobile... the first unit featured ""Hartz Dog Toys"" as the plush ducks.</i> <b><br/></b>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Back to the story…</b> I searched the world over (and thought I
found true love… no wait, that was HeeHaw) and eventually found the “ducks” for
the original version not at a toy store… not in a baby product store… but, get
this, in the <b>dog food aisle at the local grocery</b>.  No one makes a realistic looking duck out of
plush material.  Insane.  So I bought 4 “mallard-looking” dog toys,
sewed string into the body of them and hung them on the mobile.  My oldest daughter had received a sewing
machine for Christmas one year, so I enlisted her to sew the canopy and support
structure cover out of material I found at the local  fabric store.  (She now wants a cut, or a new saddle, whichever is more attainable... darn capitalist.) </p>
<i></i>
<p>I needed a custom look to complete the “package”, so I
started designing… After an hour or so with Illustrator &amp; Photoshop, the
first package was born.  I printed it out
and pasted the sheets over the original box I purchased and it was ready!</p>
<p></p>We went to the baby shower (with other gifts as well) and
gave it to the couple.  Everyone thought
it was a hit, and most asked where we got it.... hmmmmm, was I <b>on to something</b> or <b>on something</b>?  We'll never know, but that’s how
this idea came to life.<br/><br/><p>From its crude beginnings, the idea for a series of products
was born.  I found a company that could
help me in the sourcing and manufacturing of the components, paid them to
create some sample prototypes (which you see the first round here and in the
video), and now it’s time to make it happen!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1201604/files/20150206092816-IMG_0300.JPG?1423243696"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does it work?</b><br/>I know research has been done about infant brain stimulation and most logic would tell you that anything that goes in during the critical formative periods stays in. Google it.  However, I have evidence in the form of a conversation I had with the same friend I made the original mobile for, and the conversation went something like this...</p>
<p align=""center""><i>""You know, there's probably something to this.  I mean, when I was tiny, I distinctly remember being in a bouncy chair at my grandpa's house.  They'd put me in front of the fireplace and all I could see were three wooden ducks he had up on the mantel.  I'd stare at those things for hours... maybe that's why I'm such a fanatic about waterfowl hunting...""</i>  <br/></p>
<p align=""center"">See, it works.  Case dismissed.<br/></p>
<p>So anyway... I created this campaign to <b>fund the manufacturing and
marketing of these crib mobiles</b> (and more like them in the future) By
participating in the funding of this campaign, you’ll receive the actual
product, and you’ll be able to spread the love to others like us.<br/>
</p>
<p><b>Changes for the final
version in process – </b>what will be different about the final product is the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ducks will be 15% larger &amp; color correction and
revisions will be done to make them more realistic looking</li>
<li>Blue Sky under the canopy when viewing from underneath –
the sky print will also feature small silhouettes of ducks in the sky</li>
<li>

Lab Center – there will be a black Labrador
retriever suspended from the center loop slightly lower in elevation from the
ducks.
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The view from the Crib...</i><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>How much, and what's in it for me?</h3>
<p>When you participate in my fundraising campaign, you’re
purchasing the product for your own personal self and/or gifting.  Simply stated, you’ll be the coolest “gifter”
on the planet with this unique product. 
And, it’s been a cold winter up in the northern segment of the country,
so the Fall will be a banter season for infant production, if you know what I
mean… </p>
<p><b>But you're also helping</b>
me create a whole new category of affinity products in a market space that
currently has very little innovation.  I’ve been in marketing my entire
life, and I can see the potential here.  My
goal is to use this funding to start a business that caters to people like
us... people who have interests outside of what's currently being offered at
the major retailers.  </p>
<p>The Waterfowl Crib mobile is just the beginning.  If
successful, I'll be rolling this idea out into all kinds of unknown territory,
including other outdoor sports pursuits like big game, sport fishing and upland
game, but also into the licensing world.  Harley Davidson?  Fender
Guitars?  John Deere?  Absolutely.  I know people...<br/>
<br/>
<b>Goal - Raise (hopefully) $14,000 or more, $49 at a time. </b>  The
main purpose of this campaign is to fund the startup and manufacturing of the
first series of ""Teach 'Em Early Waterfowl Identification Musical Crib
Mobiles""...  This is the primary purpose of this campaign.  I’ve
been to banks… most don’t “get it.”  You
do.  Please help!</p>
The money will also be used to fund marketing
activities and product development.<span>  As I
said earlier, this is just the “starter” product.  I have many more on the drawing board.  Marketing activities will be focused around
digital direct response advertising (Facebook, Google, YouTube, etc.) and
design.<br/><i><br/>Teach 'Em Early Camo Pattern I designed...</i><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1202377/files/20150206152621-IMG_9347.jpg?1423265181"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/> </span>
</div> <div> <h3>Where I am in the Process now... a.k.a. - when will I get my stuff?</h3>I am in the final stages of prototype and sample development.  I have a few tweaks to make to the ducks (colors were off on the wigeon and the wood duck needs a little more finesse), the canopy underside pattern has been designed and sent off for printing, and the Labrador retriever design is in process now.  I anticipate all of these changes to be done and completed by the 3rd week in February. <br/><br/>If funding goes well, estimated delivery of product will be mid to late May, 2015.  Just to be safe, let's call it early June.  If I don't reach my funding goal (but please don't let that happen... this is a cool concept and execution!), the ship date may get delayed because I'll have to seek additional funding for the initial minimum order quantity.  Package design is almost complete and production on it will most likely commence over the next few weeks.  I'm still tweaking the packaging because eventually I'll have it retail ready.<br/><br/>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you like this project but don't want the product, I'll gladly accept donations small and large for funding purposes.  I'm pretty sure there's a way to do this via Indiegogo...  at the top right, just select the ""other"" box and type in how much you'd like to give.  It's easy, pain-free and remember, every little bit helps.  As Ed Bartles used to say, ""Thank you for your support.""<br/><br/>Also, <b>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE share this campaign</b> on your facebook page, email it to friends, text it to your buddies... however you choose to get the word out.<br/>Use all of the ""share"" tools at the top (just under the video) to post, tweet and email to the friends you think would be interested in this project.  Send it to all of your hunting and non-hunting buddies... you never know who will want to ""Teach 'Em Early!""  I'd really appreciate it!<br/>

video), and now it’s time to make it happen!



Does it work?I know research has been done about infant brain stimulation and most logic would tell you that anything that goes in during the critical formative periods stays in. Google it.  However, I have evidence in the form of a conversation I had with the same friend I made the original mobile for, and the conversation went something like this...
""You know, there's probably something to this.  I mean, when I was tiny, I distinctly remember being in a bouncy chair at my grandpa's house.  They'd put me in front of the fireplace and all I could see were three wooden ducks he had up on the mantel.  I'd stare at those things for hours... maybe that's why I'm such a fanatic about waterfowl hunting...""  
See, it works.  Case dismissed.
So anyway... I created this campaign to fund the manufacturing and
marketing of these crib mobiles (and more like them in the future) By
participating in the funding of this campaign, you’ll receive the actual
product, and you’ll be able to spread the love to others like us.

Changes for the final
version in process – what will be different about the final product is the
following:

Ducks will be 15% larger & color correction and
revisions will be done to make them more realistic looking
Blue Sky under the canopy when viewing from underneath –
the sky print will also feature small silhouettes of ducks in the sky


Lab Center – there will be a black Labrador
retriever suspended from the center loop slightly lower in elevation from the
ducks.


The view from the Crib...




  How much, and what's in it for me?
When you participate in my fundraising campaign, you’re
purchasing the product for your own personal self and/or gifting.  Simply stated, you’ll be the coolest “gifter”
on the planet with this unique product. 
And, it’s been a cold winter up in the northern segment of the country,
so the Fall will be a banter season for infant production, if you know what I
mean… 
But you're also helping
me create a whole new category of affinity products in a market space that
currently has very little innovation.  I’ve been in marketing my entire
life, and I can see the potential here.  My
goal is to use this funding to start a business that caters to people like
us... people who have interests outside of what's currently being offered at
the major retailers.  
The Waterfowl Crib mobile is just the beginning.  If
successful, I'll be rolling this idea out into all kinds of unknown territory,
including other outdoor sports pursuits like big game, sport fishing and upland
game, but also into the licensing world.  Harley Davidson?  Fender
Guitars?  John Deere?  Absolutely.  I know people...

Goal - Raise (hopefully) $14,000 or more, $49 at a time.   The
main purpose of this campaign is to fund the startup and manufacturing of the
first series of ""Teach 'Em Early Waterfowl Identification Musical Crib
Mobiles""...  This is the primary purpose of this campaign.  I’ve
been to banks… most don’t “get it.”  You
do.  Please help!
The money will also be used to fund marketing
activities and product development.  As I
said earlier, this is just the “starter” product.  I have many more on the drawing board.  Marketing activities will be focused around
digital direct response advertising (Facebook, Google, YouTube, etc.) and
design.Teach 'Em Early Camo Pattern I designed...
 
  Where I am in the Process now... a.k.a. - when will I get my stuff?I am in the final stages of prototype and sample development.  I have a few tweaks to make to the ducks (colors were off on the wigeon and the wood duck needs a little more finesse), the canopy underside pattern has been designed and sent off for printing, and the Labrador retriever design is in process now.  I anticipate all of these changes to be done and completed by the 3rd week in February. If funding goes well, estimated delivery of product will be mid to late May, 2015.  Just to be safe, let's call it early June.  If I don't reach my funding goal (but please don't let that happen... this is a cool concept and execution!), the ship date may get delayed because I'll have to seek additional funding for the initial minimum order quantity.  Package design is almost complete and production on it will most likely commence over the next few weeks.  I'm still tweaking the packaging because eventually I'll have it retail ready.
 Other Ways You Can HelpIf you like this project but don't want the product, I'll gladly accept donations small and large for funding purposes.  I'm pretty sure there's a way to do this via Indiegogo...  at the top right, just select the ""other"" box and type in how much you'd like to give.  It's easy, pain-free and remember, every little bit helps.  As Ed Bartles used to say, ""Thank you for your support.""Also, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE share this campaign on your facebook page, email it to friends, text it to your buddies... however you choose to get the word out.Use all of the ""share"" tools at the top (just under the video) to post, tweet and email to the friends you think would be interested in this project.  Send it to all of your hunting and non-hunting buddies... you never know who will want to ""Teach 'Em Early!""  I'd really appreciate it!
 Thanks for your support!Brandon",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

support from my amazing wife Angela Duran, my children and brothers and sisters in 
Christ.
My goal is to give, free of charge to the end user, a small business card sized digital device in an effort to bring as many of my brothers and sisters here on earth to faith in Jesus the son of God.
 Reading the Bible, hearing the Bible and having it explained saturates an individuals understanding of God's word, strengthens their faith and gives them the courage and desire to become disciples themselves.
  With one very inexpensive and small audio/visual device we can give thousands of potential Christians all around the world all of God's Word. And just imagine how many people they in turn will reach.
To the end of the earth.

What is in✝via



in-via is a small business card sized text e-reader and audio content player with the following attributes and digital content for learning God's Word, finding faith in Jesus Christ, becoming disciples and additionally gaining literacy:





a text copy of God's Written Word (KJV to follow along with thru the bible).
an audio copy of God's Word  (KJV).

an audio copy of the Thru the Bible Radio ministries featuring Dr. J Vernon McGee.
All of Dr. McGee's Notes & Outlines.
Optional USB cable for charging (if this feature falls in the per unit budget).
Rear button navigation, side power button, side audio jack and lanyard loop.
A graphene ink display for viewing and navigating the content with very low cost and very low voltage use.










A graphene solar panel on the backside for charging anywhere.





Headphones for hearing the content.

Bluetooth for sharing the content.
Synchronized text and audio content so the person can view and follow along with the text of the scriptures as they read aloud.





Pending the the overall budget, it is also our goal to give all of this content in the end user's native language as well as in English in an effort to teach English.


   What We Need & What You Get Here's how simple it is:  Our initial goal is to design, produce, package and ship 20,000 in-via units all around the world, include right here in the US, to people of many different languages and backgrounds in order to teach them God's Word,  lead them to salvation is Jesus, and ultimately make disciples of them.  Are we to reach our goal then this initial batch will see a single in-via unit shipped for your small donation of $50.



 Were we to fall short of our goal we will attempt to get the design phase of the project finished so that a prototype can be presented again as a new crowd sourcing campaign; or to acquire other private Christian backing for the production/shipping phase of the project.

What do you ultimately get? The knowledge that you are saving souls. And some free stuff that acknowledges your gift to others; which may perk the interest of those around you that they might consider doing the same.
And most importantly, we need your prayers. God listens to his people and it will only by His will that this project should be a total success.
    The Impact And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth:  Jesus' final words to his disciples before ascending into heaven were his command that they spread his good news to all of the people of all the world.




We as Christians are to pick up that torch, but often we do not even know where to begin. The in-via digital content player is an effective and inexpensive way of overcoming that hurdle, and giving our fellow man the gift of eternal life with God.
A secondary but still very important impact would be that this device 
could increase literacy among those it reaches. Looking at the Word and 
listening to it spoken helps people understand what they are able to 
read in the written form. Knowledge is strength, which we hope will lead
 to courage. Courage to share the blessing that we wish to bestow up 
them.
God has called my heart to this simple solution. Please listen him call your heart to do the same.

  Risks & Challenges  Persecution. Spiritual attacks:  Putting the word of God in people's hands is sometimes very dangerous depending on where they are in the world. A portion of the proceeds will be use to organize the distribution of the units via partnerships with Christian Mission Organizations to ensure that they are given to the end user discreetly; and to help them to learn how to use the unit, should they need assistance.



 The battle between Good and evil is all around us at all times and the deceiver will attempt to place many stumbling blocks in the path of this and other projects that wish to increase the body of Christ. But with your prayers and any financial blessings this simple idea could become a phenomenon that is pleasing to the Lord Jesus, God the Father and Holy Spirit; and could save millions of souls.
    Other Ways You Can Help Not everyone has extra to give financially, especially today:  Your prayers would be a blessing to help spread God's Word.
Share this campaign on all of your social media and help to spread the Word (pun intended).

Consider donating to, praying for and promoting the Thru the Bible Radio Ministries to help support the legacy that Dr. McGee established to disciple to all people, to the end of the earth, with God's Good News! - http://www.ttb.org/supportus

</p><p>Hello! My name is Maddie Cohen. As
a recent high school graduate, I am excited to begin my adventure into adult
life.  Before I attend college, I plan to spend a year abroad with the
program “Thinking Beyond Borders”. I hope this amazing opportunity can help me focus
my passion for global issues in an area that I will study in college.</p>
<p><b>Why Take a Gap Year?</b></p>
<p>Service and celebrating cultural
diversity has been a major part of my life. I started doing community service
in middle school and have traveled to Mexico and El Salvador for service trips.
While here in the States, I have participated in other service projects in
Baltimore, MD, Camden, NJ and Washington, DC. Every summer since seventh grade,
I participated in the “Friends for Peace” summer camp in a the DC low income
community. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432930502/soeo8h2yrgj74btymd2r.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 417.3333333333333px; height: 313px;""/></p><br/>
<p>When I first started going on these
service trips, I saw volunteering as giving back to the community and helping people
better themselves. Instead, I learned that volunteering is a two way street of
giving and receiving. Where I often feel like the people I meet give more to me
than I give to them.  Each volunteering experience has greatly influenced
my decision to dedicate my life to service. In Baltimore, I helped a wealthy family,
who had settled in a dilapidated neighborhood, renovate the house next door to
give to a homeless family. They had sacrificed their life of privilege in order
to create a supportive community in this impoverished area. They chose to use
their wealth to buy homes and renovate them for those who did not have basic
necessities. This experience inspired a desire to pursue a career in non-profit
work.</p>
<p>I look forward to attending college
after my gap year and I hope to identify a specific area of focus before I
attend. I know that eventually, I want to have a job that enables me to travel
around the world and tackle issues that affect people each day. Taking a gap
year allows me to explore the world beyond my D.C. “bubble” and help me make responsible decisions in college.</p>
<p><b>Why Thinking Beyond Borders?</b></p>
<p>The Thinking Beyond Borders gap
year program will allow me to continue and focus my passion for global social
justice issues. Thinking Beyond Borders encourages students to explore the
challenges and solutions to critical global issues in communities around
the world. This program enables me to travel to six different countries,
including: Ecuador, Peru, Thailand, Cambodia, India, and South Africa. Each
country focuses on a specific global issue that I will learn from and discover
first hand. I am excited to live with a rural farming family in Thailand to see
the path of food from field to plate. I will be able to experience what I
learned in AP Environmental Science first hand. Thinking Beyond Borders teaches
students through first hand experience, opposed to a traditional classroom.
This opportunity will expose me to communities and people outside of the world
I have grown up in. Staying with local families will allow me to learn from
different cultures and diverse ways of life. My love for volunteer work and
travel has greatly influenced my decision to go on this program. This program
will allow me to explore my passion for history and humanities in the cultural
emersion opportunities. It empowers students with the skills and
experience to critically address global issues - fieldwork, homestays, Program
Leaders, and the curriculum will challenge us to look critically at global
issues and create solutions. </p>

SILV admission
scenario: when their alumni are out in the world working and someone asks
""Where did you learn all of that stuff?"" the SILV alumni will answer
""At Stagecraft Institute"" and the someone will say ""I should
have known."" 
SILV process:  a work in
progress preparing each year to push beyond the work they have done before and
totally energize the next level of training!
SILV business model: 

And it never gets any
easier!
By traditional business standards SILV should
never have survived - let alone be embarking on their 9th summer! SILV had no outside funding, no reserves, and no
resources other than the nerve of the founders and their hundreds of friends
within the industry they were intent on serving. The commitment of those friends
allowed SILV to act on its mission of better training for a better tomorrow,
and those friends invested right along with SILV itself.

Truth is that training
and learning are not just task or industry specific - they are life specific. Sharing
the potential of what the collaboration of integrity and imagination can
accomplish is the reality that is Stagecraft Institute of Las Vegas. SILV goes
after it one day at a time.
Ways you can help You can help SILV by simply spreading the word about what
SILV is doing out in the desert of Las Vegas. You can also help us with whatever support is available to you. To date, students have come to
SILV from 49 states (come on, North Dakota!) and 41 countries and we want to be here for them! 
The Legacy
that is SILV believes that entertainment transcends borders of all kinds and
contributes to a better world. SILV exists on the kindness of friends, so
welcome to our world. You can help make a difference! 

Now, SILV invites
(challenges?) you to pick up your piece of the challenge and keep SILV students
rolling!It’s all about the experience!

Hanno autofinanziato ogni trasferta e chi, come molti giovani, é lontano da casa si é dovuto incaricare personalmente di ogni spesa di vitto e alloggio senza alcun aiuto.

Contro ogni pronostico e in mezzo a mille difficoltá sono riusciti a salvare la societá portando la squadra a compiere quello che é a tutti gli effetti un vero miracolo sportivo, grazie anche all'aiuto dei tifosi, dominando in campo per quasi tutta la stagione._____________________________________________________________________________
Dear friends,Isernia FC has just concluded a fanstastic season from a sports perspective, winning the championship 5 match day earlier and the Italy Cup, but bankruptcy.From November 2014 the team has no management and no funds. The players, guided by the captain Nicola Panico, have taken over the club taking all the risks and responsibility and giving up to any remuneration. These wonderful guys, with the help of a few supporters, have taken care of the stadium, cutting the grass of the soccer field for example. They have payed for the travel expenses and those who were living away from home, like many young people, had to pay for room and board by their own.Against all odds and facing many difficulties they managed to save the club bringing the team to accomplish a real sports miracle, thanks also to the help of the supporters, dominating on the soccer field for the most part of the season.

_____________________________________________________________________________

Perché raccogliamo i fondi?

Ad oggi la societá é ancora in mano ai giocatori che a questo punto sono encomiabilmente motivati a perpetrare lo sforzo della passata stagione, volendo in ogni caso partecipare al campionato nazionale di Serie D. Qualora la societá fallisse, andrebbe perso quanto di buono i ragazzi hanno fatto in questi anni e lo sforzo di molti sarebbe vano.
L'aiuto che vi chiediamo é per dare una mano all'Isernia FC a sostenere i costi di iscrizione al campionato da versare alla F.I.G.C. a breve.


Ci rivolgiamo a tutti coloro che amano lo sport, quello vero privo di interessi economici. In un calcio sempre piú corrotto e malato riteniamo che ci sia bisogno di realtá sane e ancora attaccate a valori che vanno scomparendo giorno per giorno._____________________________________________________________________________

Why do we raise funds?

The club is still without management and the players are still motivated to participate to the championship in the national ""Serie D"".If the company should fail, everything good done until now by the players would be vain.We ask for help for paying the entry fee to the F.I.G.C. for participating to the next year championship.We call on to everyone who loves sport, the real one without any economic interest. In a sport more and more corrupt and sick we feel there is a need for healthy reality and people still attached to values that are disappearing day by day.

This is a group that works with some of the most remote and isolated people in Australia. Through the medium of circus and performing arts they can improve their self-esteem and confidence in efforts to lower the rate of substance abuse, self-harm and suicide that is prevalent in many Aboriginal communities. We are now in collaboration with Nyangatjatjara College to incorporate Circus into the school curriculum and help improve the concentration and work ethic of the ninjas in the classroom.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The kids work hard to train and practice skills in juggling, acrobatics, comedy and magic. Having the opportunity to go on tour is the highlight of the program and often the highlight of their lives. These kids live amongst their indigenous community and rarely have the chance to leave their homes and travel around the country. There is much misunderstanding and prejudice about indigenous people in Australia, and performing is a very special way for the kids to showcase their hard work and take pride in what they can do, while showing that to non-indigenous Australians.<br/><i><br/></i><p><i>(NOW FUNDED!) The Garma Festival tour will be a two week trip, by bus across the 
desert, from the Red Centre of Uluru up to Arnhem Land at the top of the
 country. This is a huge opportunity for the individual kids and for 
Desert Ninja Circus to be seen and possibly to gain critical funding to 
continue as a nonprofit, charitable organization. (NOW FUNDED!)</i><br/></p>
<p>The National Circus Festival will be held in Mullumbimby, NSW. For some of the ninjas it will be there first time seeing the Ocean. Included in the trip is an intensive professional training and development week with some of the top performers and artists and in the country. They will also get to perform several shows in front of large crowds of non-indigenous Australians who have never even heard of Mutitjulu or experienced the remote areas of this country.<br/></p>
<p>Last year the kids went to Byron Bay, Alice Springs, and Melbourne for Dreamtime at the 'G in front of 85,000 people! The whole community, elders, younger siblings, came out to welcome them home and show their pride. It impacts everyone, not just the ninjas. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>These kids come from a very unique and ever-diminishing tradition and it still poses a lot of challenges for living in the way they are expected to today. They often get very shy and nervous before performing in front of large groups of both indigenous and non-indigenous crowds. Sometimes they change their mind the day or minute before a show. But over time, Ninja Circus has created a team and a family that is separate from their home life and separate from school. It's a place that they have learned responsibility and discipline as well as creative expression. So far, we haven't had a single show where they actually drop out and the troupe is constantly growing and evolving. <br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>The ninjas are very excited for the trip! The money raised will go towards plane tickets, fuel, food, and accommodation for the long journey. If there are any unused funds they will go into the charity's bank account towards new circus equipment to create a safer training space and provide new props to replace the old damaged ones we still use. One the list is a new stunt trampoline, stilts, and unicycles which the ninjas are very eager to learn and use in upcoming shows. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for any size of donation that you can manage.

Summer camp activities 4Kids and especially 4PalKids are needed more than ever. PalKids are no different in wanting to have fun and participating in community spirit. Because feeling good about oneself is just so important. 850 Palestinian Kids in Central Gaza belong to the Herak Youth Centre and this summer hopefully will be a summer with some good times and positive lasting memories. Herak Youth Centre volunteers don't want to miss one opportunity for the kids to be...  just kids this coming summer!

""Film nights"": access to films that the kids can attend and enjoy an day of entertainment
Transportation to the beach and other places for picnics, fun and games


Funds:

Once the funds have been collected they will be sent to the Herak Youth Centre board treasurer (Rana Jamal Quffa) for dispersement which we will report on how the funds are spent in September 2015. Because the Herak Youth Centre is integrated and the kids have a say and participate in its work and development, the kids will help us with the perks.
We are starting low because we can make money stretch far and wide. But the more we raise, the more we can do! Such as English classes, music and dance training and other cultural activities important to being Palestinian. 
   The Impact 850 kids from central Gaza will have the chance to experience positive moments in a social setting in which they are secure and able to express themselves while enjoying themselves in just being a kid.  Most adults in North America have experienced summer camps whether they are day or overnight camps and have many positive memories that last their lifetimes. Camps are places for kids to be just kids. We can take a little and make it go far in Gaza. Our Gaza team are dedicated volunteers since 2013 and have given not just their time and expertise but also money and material things to make this youth centre not just fantastic but also functioning. 
   Risks & Challenges  Sadly the world thinks that Palestinians and Palestinian kids are not deserving of joy or peace and therefore make great efforts to block these initiatives.  We use local technologies and materials that with our ingenuity we will find ways to give these kids time to smile and experience positive life.  Instead of flying kites, we can build sandcastles; instead of providing snacks and drinks we will ask parents to pack a light snack and water; instead of hiring a coach to transport the kids, we will make a trip to the park and have sing-a-longs and other activities that don't require material things; instead of having a movie night, we will make skits and play games such as charades.

Here’s some background information on what we’re up
to:<br/></p>
<p>For the past 3 years, Jen has run a thriving, FREE summer
and after school program for middle school youth at Sixth Street Community
Center, a cozy and colorful neighborhood enclave in the Lower East Side that
runs a bustling CSA program and focuses on food and housing justice in the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>Jen’s programs were a great success, grounded in rich
exposure to the creative arts and building affirmative and inclusive community
for youth during the critical beginning of adolescence. The programs supported
low-income families by providing their children with no-cost, varied and
enriching summer and after school experiences. All of the work was funded
with the support of a company, whose three year commitment to the program recently ended. </p>
<p>Our partners at Sixth Street Community Center encouraged us to continue the summer program, offering help in fundraising as well as providing the needed program and office space. Jen brought
Libby, a dear friend and collaborator, back on board, and we began advertising
Summer at Sixth Street in early May, with a vision of charging families a
per-session fee in order to fund our first independently run program for upper
elementary and middle school youth. The program would feature <b>daily arts and creative
writing/poetry workshops, supplemented by urban/rooftop gardening and capoeira
workshops.</b> Students’ creative work would be shared and celebrated at the end
of the session with an open house for friends and families. The program would
celebrate <b>creative self-expression and skill building, friendship and community
building, and exposure to new and enriching experiences. </b></p>
<p>Many of the families in our community network expressed
great enthusiasm for having their children attend the program, but the prices
just weren’t in their budget. We have a growing amount of interest for both our July
and August sessions, and we would love to offer the program to families for
free or very low cost, as we have in the past. Many young people in the
neighborhood still don’t have summer plans, and anybody who has attended an
amazing summer program knows the lasting impact such an experience can have.</p>

about teaching, the kinds of creative arts workshops we plan to offer, and why
this project is important to our personal growth. </p>

At this point I need to move on to a steadier occupation with better pay. I've entered the Automotive Technician program at Bellingham Technical College in pursuit of an Associate of Applied Science degree and a new career. I'll be pursuing ASE certification and in August I'll be interning with a local business.In order to have the best chance of finding a good job from my Internship on I need every advantage I can create. Since I'm attempting this entirely on grants and juggling three kids, a wife with severe PTSD and school I have exactly ZERO budget for tools.In the Auto industry there are a few things employers look for. I have a clean driving record and no drug habits. I don't even drink more than a handful of beers a year. So that part is covered.What I need is my own set of tools. Small shop owners, who make up the market I'm most interested in are very possessive of their tools and shop space. Over the years of fixing small machines I've come to really appreciate the difference quality tools make.For the month of October in conjunction with standard Educational prices I have a chance to order a complete set of tools from Matco at the ridiculous discount of 60%. Naturally I'd like to leverage that as far as possible.A full set of tools, storage included comes to just under $8,000.00 for about $15,000.00 worth of professional grade, lifetime warranty tools. If I can combine a full set of my own tools with the above and get them ordered before October 30th I'll both be able to get the whole set for a lot less than I will ever be able to again and have enough time to get muscle memory with them before the onset of my internship.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact
 
Your contributions help the mentors to provide an alternative to stagnation and crime for kids in the inner city of Rochester, NY, the third-poorest city in America.
We have made great strides with the M.I.B. youth. Many of our youth have come out of their shells and where initially they spoke just above a whisper, upon entering the program, now have little issue speaking in front of a group, socializing with their peers, sharing their ideas and performing in front of an audience. We have seen many cases where youth were struggling in classes, and with the support of our staff, have raised their grades.

Because of the level at which our youth carry themselves at events and perform on stage, they have been asked to perform at numerous events around the city and have even performed in Albany, in front of an audience of 2,000! One of performing groups won 1st place in the Ms. Sweet Potato Pie Talent Contest.


M.I.B. has produced plays and involved youth from the city of Rochester, NY at every level of production, including acting in shows to a packed house!  One  play produced was called ""Black and Blues"" and another was called ""Where You At Lord"".  Mentors weave the moral and the real: the lessons taught via creative expression are of African American faith and perseverance restored despite tragedy, trouble, and chaos in the inner city where stories unfold.  To learn more, visit http://ddppmedia.com/  and https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mentors-Inspiring-Boys-Girls/651532078211877 on Facebook.

    The Impact 
After I launched my puzzle books, I realized that kids (even those below 10yrs) were taking to the game in a big way as well.  We have books on categories like Animals, countries etc so it is very useful for kids.

My name is Tigran Tarbiyan, from Yerevan, Armenia. This year I got an Admission from one of the best universities of Germany Goethe University Frankfurt and I am highly motivated to do my two-year Master in Management at Goethe University Frankfurt. After a long research I came to INDIEGOGO and strongly decided to start my fund-raising campaign for one of the most important for me life-event. Through INDIEGOGO I am going to apply You - my Friends and Followers to raise money for my studies.

It has been always critical for me to constantly enrich and diversify my educational background taking into account that more than 12-years working activities in my life made me always busy, as since the start of my study at Yerevan State University my parents had health problems and weren't able to work - so I was studying and working part-time to ensure the study expenses and support my family. 
So the reason I apply for financial help is justified on the grounds of my limited resources to finance myself.
The best point is the semester fee amounts to approximately 350 EUR per semester - it is why I had selected to apply to this university, otherwise the study expenses would be at least 3 times more than now. 

The $15.500(13.400 EUR) amount include these expenses:
8.040 EUR - Living costs per year: the applicant must have 8040 EUR on a German bank account.Master in Management course is a full-time consecutive studies program for 2 years. 
350 EUR - the fee per semester. I will study 4 semesters, so the total amount will be 1.400 EUR. 
For the second year I need 8.040 EUR as well, but I want you to contribute me only for 1,5 year, as while studying I hope I will the rights to do a part-time job and will ensure myself the living costs for the next 6 months (I'm not sure I will the rights to do a part-time job, as this is a full-time course).

I kindly ask you to bring your active contribution to help me to care my study expenses at Goethe University Frankfurt for which I am going to state other reasons why you shall make your financial contributions for me.


The first reason is that Goethe University Frankfurt is one of the Europe’s oldest and most well established universities. In a large student survey, about 80% of students recommended studying at Goethe University.

One of the reasons is that Armenia is an economically developing country and it is in the beginning stage of its development therefore our country is seeking to build bridges between Armenia and Europe in the fields of business and culture. The promotion of the European model is crucial and me and my generation want European values to have an impact in our country too. It is our task to adapt European values to the realities and needs of the 21st century by setting the right priorities and by bringing the European Union closer to our citizens.

The other reason is my confidence that Master in Management at Goethe University Frankfurt will provide me with knowledge, confidence, and contacts to realize my dreams. I do believe that this program will enhance my knowledge in the sphere I work and will help me with implementing the acquired knowledge and techniques in my country upon return. 

Taking into account all above mentioned and also the fact that there is no course of Master in Management in Armenia, I am highly inspired to do study in Frankfurt, which is the heart of Europe, and I strongly believe that I can learn much from the professionals in an economically developed country. 
The Master in Management at Goethe University Frankfurt will provide me with the skills that I need to operate as an experienced marketing and management professional and finally to help my country to flourish and enter the international arena as an economically developed country.

Anyway, I thank you for your time and efforts - at least you can share my campaign with your friends and followers.

</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Hi, my name’s Alex Landry. I live in Auburn, Maine and
attend Edward Little High School. I’m going to graduate next year, but before I
do I have an amazing opportunity. I was recently accepted into an esteemed gap
year program called Thinking Beyond Borders. The program selects eighteen young
people to embark on various journeys throughout the world, and I am glad to say
I am one of the few selected!</p><p>                                                                   </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436308707/gyoi5rwio0pnfqddrj28.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282957/gqdrollhvrtuae5zomtf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                    

<p><b>What
I Plan To Do</b></p>
<p>Thinking Beyond Borders (TBB) is unlike any other gap
year program I researched (and I did <i>a
lot</i> of research) because it is more than simply going to a different place in
the world and doing service there. Sure, service and enrichment are integral
parts of the program, but Thinking Beyond Borders is more dedicated to
fostering long-lasting change. This is attempted by thinking critically about
various world issues, such as education, justice and morals, and sustainable
agriculture, and possible solutions to worldwide “problems.” </p>
<p>While looking externally at critical issues, Thinking
Beyond Borders also stresses <i>internal</i>
growth and development. While interacting with and learning from host families
and the esteemed group leaders who will help guide the journey, I hope to
develop and grow stronger as a person on an intellectual and emotional level. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282023/tll76ukzbtuytttshhrt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Why
I’m Doing It</b></p>
<p>As I end high school and prepare for college, I want to put myself in a
position to be successful, happy and contribute in a meaningful way in the world.
I believe TBB is a great way to provide more worldly experience for me as I
begin to contemplate what exactly I want to study, but also they type of person
I wish to become. I want to learn and grow and fail and succeed in order to get
the most out of a wonderful opportunity – higher education. I believe the
opportunity of a college education is a wonderful one, and I want to get as
much as I can out of it. I believe a gap semester with Thinking Beyond Borders
will be abundantly valuable in helping achieve this goal. Alums of TBB have
praised the program as a life-changing experience that helped shaped their
views on different cultures and define who they were as people. I hope to get a
similar result out of this great opportunity, and am extremely excited for the
life-changing experience! </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The
Itinerary </b></p>
<p>The program starts on February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2016
in Mindo, Ecuador. Mindo is home to “cloud forests” and canopies of vegetation.
It’s here where the members of the TBB program meet and get to know each other.
After that initial week, we travel to live with host families and study
education in Ecuador. We’ll work with public and private schools, and try to
evaluate how education effects equity and justice within the community and as a
whole. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282484/jgjpjr9rly5nx4yj0guh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 340.12px; height: 227px;""/></p>
<p>Next is an excursion to the Incan ruins of Machu
Picchu, in Peru. The ruins are mysterious as they are beautiful, as the actual
construction and use of the many fortresses remains unknown.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282624/bp03eiv66ax2gloqq4mw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 417.87px; height: 282px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282875/vbeb4u4utyfgtwlmsmkl.png"" src="""" style=""width: 255.682px; height: 152px;""/>    <br/></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436282698/qpvjfsr3gnngsxjzegbm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 320.54px; height: 213px;""/></p>
<p>After our hike, we go to Bolivia to study sustainable
agriculture. Bolivia is one of the most prominent farming countries in South
America, so it is a great place to learn firsthand the “ins and outs” of
long-term, reliable food supply for a vastly expanding world. </p>
<p>At long last, the TBB group will return to the United
States. Our nation’s capital – Washington, D.C. – to be exact. Here we will
bring what we learned during our three months abroad to critical discussions
with members of Congress, the World Bank, and various NGOs. This part of the
trip is labeled the “culmination” and it is just that. Here is an opportunity
to reflect on my learning and experiences into powerful conclusions, and create
a final project to raise awareness about critical global issues.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436308831/uqbj2xdz89vct76nulcg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>How
You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Thinking Beyond Borders is an amazing, enriching
experience. But with all good things comes a price. The total cost of a gap
semester with TBB is $12,000, not including airfare and other expenditures. I’m
asking you to make a contribution towards this campaign and my goal. This
contribution serves as an investment in me, and will not be taken lightly. I
understand that in asking for money to attend a program dedicated to fostering
worldly understanding and self-improvement, I will have to take risks and
action. I want to live up to the expectation presented here that I am a driven
individual who wants to understand both himself and the world he inhabits
better. </p>

</div>","Introduction
Hi, my name’s Alex Landry. I live in Auburn, Maine and
attend Edward Little High School. I’m going to graduate next year, but before I
do I have an amazing opportunity. I was recently accepted into an esteemed gap
year program called Thinking Beyond Borders. The program selects eighteen young
people to embark on various journeys throughout the world, and I am glad to say
I am one of the few selected!                                                                                        

What
I Plan To Do
Thinking Beyond Borders (TBB) is unlike any other gap
year program I researched (and I did a
lot of research) because it is more than simply going to a different place in
the world and doing service there. Sure, service and enrichment are integral
parts of the program, but Thinking Beyond Borders is more dedicated to
fostering long-lasting change. This is attempted by thinking critically about
various world issues, such as education, justice and morals, and sustainable
agriculture, and possible solutions to worldwide “problems.” 
While looking externally at critical issues, Thinking
Beyond Borders also stresses internal
growth and development. While interacting with and learning from host families
and the esteemed group leaders who will help guide the journey, I hope to
develop and grow stronger as a person on an intellectual and emotional level. 
Why
I’m Doing It
As I end high school and prepare for college, I want to put myself in a
position to be successful, happy and contribute in a meaningful way in the world.
I believe TBB is a great way to provide more worldly experience for me as I
begin to contemplate what exactly I want to study, but also they type of person
I wish to become. I want to learn and grow and fail and succeed in order to get
the most out of a wonderful opportunity – higher education. I believe the
opportunity of a college education is a wonderful one, and I want to get as
much as I can out of it. I believe a gap semester with Thinking Beyond Borders
will be abundantly valuable in helping achieve this goal. Alums of TBB have
praised the program as a life-changing experience that helped shaped their
views on different cultures and define who they were as people. I hope to get a
similar result out of this great opportunity, and am extremely excited for the
life-changing experience! 
The
Itinerary 
The program starts on February 14th, 2016
in Mindo, Ecuador. Mindo is home to “cloud forests” and canopies of vegetation.
It’s here where the members of the TBB program meet and get to know each other.
After that initial week, we travel to live with host families and study
education in Ecuador. We’ll work with public and private schools, and try to
evaluate how education effects equity and justice within the community and as a
whole. 
Next is an excursion to the Incan ruins of Machu
Picchu, in Peru. The ruins are mysterious as they are beautiful, as the actual
construction and use of the many fortresses remains unknown.            
After our hike, we go to Bolivia to study sustainable
agriculture. Bolivia is one of the most prominent farming countries in South
America, so it is a great place to learn firsthand the “ins and outs” of
long-term, reliable food supply for a vastly expanding world. 
At long last, the TBB group will return to the United
States. Our nation’s capital – Washington, D.C. – to be exact. Here we will
bring what we learned during our three months abroad to critical discussions
with members of Congress, the World Bank, and various NGOs. This part of the
trip is labeled the “culmination” and it is just that. Here is an opportunity
to reflect on my learning and experiences into powerful conclusions, and create
a final project to raise awareness about critical global issues.
How
You Can Help
Thinking Beyond Borders is an amazing, enriching
experience. But with all good things comes a price. The total cost of a gap
semester with TBB is $12,000, not including airfare and other expenditures. I’m
asking you to make a contribution towards this campaign and my goal. This
contribution serves as an investment in me, and will not be taken lightly. I
understand that in asking for money to attend a program dedicated to fostering
worldly understanding and self-improvement, I will have to take risks and
action. I want to live up to the expectation presented here that I am a driven
individual who wants to understand both himself and the world he inhabits
better. 
ANY contribution, large or small, is so greatly
appreciated. A donation shows me that my story resonated with you, and that you
believe in me and my goal. That kind of interpersonal faith is truly inspiring,
and extremely powerful.
Thanks
I’d like to thank you for taking the time to read my story
and for considering contributing to my goal. As a major “thank you” for showing
your support in both me and my goal, I’ve listed some “perks” that are
available to contributors. I hope you find them satisfactory! Also, if you
leave me your email address, I intend on providing updates along the way
describing my journeys and learning for those that wish to follow me on this

<h1>Help Humanity First restart its vocational training operations in Liberia after the Ebola Outbreak !!!</h1>
<br/><h2>Vocational Training Project </h2>Humanity First set up a vocational school in 2011 to help the underprivileged youth in Liberia to become self-sufficient.  The goal is to teach the youth skills at a subsidized rate so that they can earn a living.  After being non-operational for a year during the ebola crisis, the HF Liberia team has just restarted its new session this past May.  Currently the school offers the following trades: <em>construction works, electrician, auto-mechanic, auto-electrician, plumbing, and AC repair</em>.  The courses are 6 months long and we offer certificates and references through which the graduates are able to find employment.  In our current operations we are able to generate back 70% of the cost of operations while relying on external funding and grants to sustain the remaining costs.  Since 2011, the school has graduated 800 students and approximately 40% have found jobs in their relevant trades.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439379406/wz75jxzza8izcyrix4aq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Now we are seeking to expand through several projects and seeking funding for the following: staring up a driving training program, starting a computer literacy class, building renovations, and lab equipments.<br/><br/><h4>Startup of a driving school</h4>
<p>Many prospective students have inquired about driving classes.  Driving is indeed a privilege in Liberia and most of the youth do not know how to drive.  By opening a driving school within the current infrastructure of our vocational college we will be able to teach approximately 20 people how to drive each month.  This will pave the way for employment opportunities for underprivileged youth to get jobs as chauffeurs, taxi drivers, and truck drivers.  Below is a financial breakdown of what we need to get started </p>
<ul>
<li>2 used cars ~ $2500</li>
<li>Auto-mechanical adjustments to install instructor side controls ~ $500</li>
<li>2 instructor salaries to cover first 3 months ~ $600</li>
<li>classroom items such as whiteboards, tables, instruction manuals ~ $200</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Total cost: ~$3800</b><br/></p>
<h4>Startup of a computer literacy class</h4>It is not possible to survive in today's world without a computer, yet too many youth in Liberia don't know how to use a computer, let alone use it proficiently.  Humanity First want to start a 3 month computer literacy training course for underprivileged youth.  The course will cover basic component of a computer, typing, using word editors and other office software, and using the internet.  Your donations will help us set up and start this meaningful project in the upcoming semester. <p>Below is a financial breakdown of what we need to get started</p>
<ul>
<li>20 computers ~ $5000</li>
<li>One instructor salaries to cover 1st 3 months ~ $600</li>
<li>classroom items such as whiteboards, tables, instruction manuals ~ $200</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Total cost: ~ $5800</b></p>
<h4>Lab Equipment</h4>
<p>The HF vocational school seeks to prepare students in their respective trades with a solid theoretical foundation as well as provide them with an opportunity for applied and practical training. </p>
<p>We need to complete our lab equipment inventory so that our students have access to top quality practical training.  We need equipment ranging for ignition switches for the auto-mechanical students to flexible tubes for plumbing students, to refrigerants for air conditioning students.  In total we need about $850 dollars worth of equipment.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Total Cost : $850</b></p>
<h4>Building renovations</h4>
<p>After 1 year of being non-operational their is an urgent need to repair the surrounding walls and floors.  While fixing all the walls and floors will be quite expensive we are starting by fixing the main entrance wall and the main auditorium floor.</p>

<br/>“Ambassadors of Hope” is a feature-length film documenting India’s 
child laborers. Children in several parts of India are subject to torturous work conditions in 
mines, factories or farms  to support their families. Despite 
the country’s “Right to Education Act,” the promise of free compulsory 
education remains an unrealized dream because India’s child laborers are
 the backbone of the economic engine that runs the heavily populated South Asian country. <br/><br/> Now, there 
may be hope. A new generation of 
empowered students, nestled in  Silicon Valley, 
home to high-tech innovation and development, want to turn that unrealized dream into a reality. <br/><br/>Can they do it? Can these students change
 a legacy of torment and abuse? </div><div>
<br/>Our team's mission through this documentary is to reveal the practices of child labor and hopefully show how educating India's youth can begin to lay a 
foundation to help end child enslavement. Telling 
the children's stories can change, one life at a 
time, which  causes a ripple effect that can transform communities. Imagine
 what these children can contribute to their family, their community and to the world once they are no longer bound by harsh work conditions and able to help others! Mostly, kids can be kids.<br/><br/> A percentage of your donation will go to Home of Hope, a charity that works to help 
these children rise out of poverty and create a new way of living. Please join

</div></div>","Short Summary
“Ambassadors of Hope” is a feature-length film documenting India’s 
child laborers. Children in several parts of India are subject to torturous work conditions in 
mines, factories or farms  to support their families. Despite 
the country’s “Right to Education Act,” the promise of free compulsory 
education remains an unrealized dream because India’s child laborers are
 the backbone of the economic engine that runs the heavily populated South Asian country.  Now, there 
may be hope. A new generation of 
empowered students, nestled in  Silicon Valley, 
home to high-tech innovation and development, want to turn that unrealized dream into a reality. Can they do it? Can these students change
 a legacy of torment and abuse? 
Our team's mission through this documentary is to reveal the practices of child labor and hopefully show how educating India's youth can begin to lay a 
foundation to help end child enslavement. Telling 
the children's stories can change, one life at a 
time, which  causes a ripple effect that can transform communities. Imagine
 what these children can contribute to their family, their community and to the world once they are no longer bound by harsh work conditions and able to help others! Mostly, kids can be kids. A percentage of your donation will go to Home of Hope, a charity that works to help 
these children rise out of poverty and create a new way of living. Please join 
our movement.Meet our TeamVera Anderson, Co-Director, Executive ProducerVera Anderson is an award winning producer whose passion for excellence in media production is the cornerstone of her company, Anderson Entertainment.

  The Impact The internet, social media, FaceTime, Skype and so many ways of connecting us have made clear what many of us have always felt deep inside-we are all connected in ways that we sometimes do not realize. What that means is that some night when we can't sleep well, we may be acutely aware on some level that somewhere in the world, children are suffering, without a decent place to sleep, with stomachs growling and a bleak future of back-breaking, spirit stifling work ahead. They need you and the difference that your heartfelt generosity can make.There are nearly 28 million child laborers in India today.  Nearly 10% of adolescents working in hazardous conditions are working in family enterprises. 56% of the working adolescents are no longer studying. And 70% of those in hazardous conditions are not studying.  More boys (38.7 million) than girls (8.8 million) are involved in hazardous work.

  Risks & ChallengesOur team may face personal danger and unforeseen challenges as we face dangerous circumstances to capture slave operations in the act, businesses that are sometimes funded by organized crime. We will work with local law enforcement and trained abolitionists who routinely raid and shut down these companies.

<p><b>Half of All Kids Are Bitten by Dog - Shocking, but True!</b></p>
<p>Half of all children are bitten by a dog and most of these bites are by the family dog or a dog known to the child. Statistics support this assertion, but you can easily verify it by asking a group of adults if they were bitten as a child and if they knew the dog. Dog bites, even if relatively minor (as most are) are traumatic because of the feelings of betrayal and also the impact of being physically harmed by another creature. In many cases the emotional scars last a lifetime, even if the physical ones heal quickly. For the dog that bites, the consequences are often the loss of his home and family and sometimes his life. </p>
<p><b>Most Bites are By the Family Dog and Are Completely Preventable</b></p>
<p>Most of these bites are completely preventable, because dogs don't bite out of the blue and dogs don't want to bite. The dog will have warned, often for weeks, months or even years, but kids and parents don't recognize the warning signs. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""The kids were thrilled to come and tell me that they did a tree on the beach and made a strange dog go away."" <b>Cathy Vanderheyden - mother - Atlanta GA</b></i><br/></p>
<h3><b>Compassion</b></h3>
<p>Kids and families need to learn how to be compassionate with their training and management of the dog, so that the dog is happy and does not get anxious enough to bite.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Parents unknowingly allow kids to behave in ways that the dog doesn't like (hugging, kissing, taking things away, sitting on the dog etc.). Most dogs are extremely tolerant, but it's not fair for a good dog to be feeling anxious and unhappy when this could be easily prevented. And it's tragic when this goes on and on and the dog eventually resorts to a bite to get it to stop.</p>
<h3><b>Cool and Fun</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Doggone Crazy app will be a fun, cool and interactive way for kids to learn what it means when a dog uses its various body parts to communicate. This app will provide a new way to reach even more kids and families so that they can learn fascinating facts about dog body language, stay safer and have happier dogs.</p>

Kids will learn how to tell if a dog wants to meet them or interact with them and when a dog wants to be left alone. They will learn what to do in various fun and serious scenarios with both strange dogs and the family dog. The focus will be on fun and learning and not fear.</p>

    Risks & Challenges Joan and Teresa have been dedicated to dog bite prevention and child safety for just as long as Greg and Jeff have been dedicated to 3D animation, graphics, video and iOS development. We are a strong team with the skills, knowledge and experience to bring you a fun, engaging and educational game. Most of all, we are each dedicated to making this happen.
If we don't reach our funding goal, the app will still be developed, but with limitations in functionality and in a longer time frame. With your help it will be as awesome as possible, taking advantage of all the recent developments in 3-D animation and kinetic functions of the ipad and it will be done much faster than without funding. More funding means more different 3-D animated dogs in the game and more and varied game play scenarios. Your contribution will be used for the app development and you will get your app.

But best of all, our Ghana Travel related perks mean you get to come to Ghana and visit us!  While the Create Change team in Canada will organize your trip, we will be part of your hosting team and will act as your tour guides.  While flights to Ghana are not included, after you have arrived in Ghana, we will take care of everything including transport, food, and accommodation.  







The Team Behind This Campaign
We are 7 young women living in Northern Ghana, who work for Create Change: Martha, Gloria, Sumaya, Jelila, Kate, Hamida and Jennifer.   We will be launching and managing this campaign with the support of Create Change's Founder from Canada, Shannen O'Brian.

FAQs AnsweredIf any of your questions are not answered below, please don't hesitate to get in touch!


How much money from this campaign actually goes to support girls to attend high school in Northern Ghana?With the exception of IndieGoGo/PayPal fees, and the cost of perks and shipping, 100% of your donation will go directly to supporting a girl to get to high school in Ghana THIS SEPTEMBER, 2015.


What will you do with funds should you raise more than your financial goal?  We hope to support as many girls to school as possible, so any additional contributions will go towards sending additional girls to school.


How much of this IndieGogo Campaign is managed by girls' in Ghana?This campaign is truly being run and managed by girls in Ghana!  While we have received some support from our founder in terms of setting up the campaign, we did the pitch video ourselves and only had help with editing.  We put together network lists ourselves to try to get related groups and celebrities to share our campaign.  We are also managing all of the perks ourselves, from purchasing them to packaging them organizing their shipping.  


Will you update me on the progress of the project?Of course!  We will show you videos of when we are able to tell girls we are able to support them, and keep you updated through the year as the girls' progress through school through photo and video.


Can I donate from anywhere in the world?Absolutely!


What payment methods do you accept?We accept PayPal and major credit cards.  Funds will go directly to our Create Change Foundation in Ghana, who will transfer 100% of funds directly to our branch in Ghana.


When will I receive my perk?Anything being sent from Ghana should arrive sometime in September or October, as mail usually takes 4 - 6 week.  For the personalized video or virtual Skype meet ups perks, these will be arranged in September to take place sometime in October.  For trips to Ghana, we can begin planning together once the campaign has ended.


How do I get more information on the perks related to traveling to Ghana?We have hosted many people in Ghana and would be glad for you to be our next guest!  First, you can find out more about Create Change on our website.  Secondly, read about Field School, our new Voluntourism Centre we are launching in 2016 where we will accommodate you during your time in Tamale.  If you are seriously interested, get in touch with us and we would be happy to set up a call to answer all of your questions.


Is Shipping Included?Shipping of perks is included in your contribution.


Can I get a Tax Receipt?Create Change is a Canadian registered charity and but unfortunately can offer charitable tax receipts to Canadians only.


Do I get a Tax Receipt if I get a Perk?If you are a Canadian and are eligible for a tax receipt, you can receive a tax receipt for the amount of your contribution, minus the cost of your perk.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer tax receipts for any Ghana Travel related perks.


What if I decline to receive my Perk?If you decline to receive your perk and are eligible for a Canadian tax receipt, then you will get a tax receipt for the full amount of your contribution.


                                   THANK YOU!We cannot thank each and every one of you enough for helping us to reach our goal: to get as many girls in Northern Ghana as possible to senior high school for the 2015 -2016 academic year.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the fall of 2013, a small group of organizers, artists, and educators came together to discuss the social and economic challenges facing communities in Baltimore and around the world. At the heart of this conversation lay two questions: How can we develop alternative forms of organizing broad-based social movements?  And, what role can artists and cultural producers play in eliminating social and economic inequality?</p>
<p>This conversation resulted in a

art exhibition with residents and neighbors synthesizing our work into 
audio-visual experience and dialogue. <br/></p>
<p>During our second summer, 
we conducted an in-depth study of the Reconstruction era using the text,
 Black Reconstruction in America by W.E.B Du Bois. In a short time, we were able to
 create a series of cultural materials to explore complex questions of

<p>My son Donald has an apartment and a car and two part-time jobs. Pretty normal stuff for a young man just beginning adulthood. Except Donald has an intellectual disability that not so long ago would have made the normal life he lives today almost impossible.</p>
<p>As with most young people, the difference for Donald was college. It’s where he developed the social skills, confidence and practical knowledge to live independently. And he’s not alone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>Hundreds hungry for college’s promise.</strong></h2>
<p>In 2005, we began College Transition Connection to help students who have an intellectual disability experience college. By 2008, three students, Donald among them, had enrolled at the University of South Carolina, the state’s first program. There are now five university programs across the state with 100 students enrolled.</p>
<p>Hundreds more students qualify for college but lack the funds. <strong>Lift 100</strong> is a campaign to help qualified students who have an intellectual disability realize their college dreams, reach their potential and live self-directed lives as contributing members of their communities.</p>

<p>Our goal is $1 million to fund scholarship pools at each of the five universities. Deserving students will get help with tuition, fees, books and/or housing — help where they need it to ensure their success. This sum will allow us to drastically increase enrollment, drawing more attention to the need — as well as the success stories — and inspiring the state legislature and philanthropic sources to provide the additional support required to sustain the program. $1 million can lift 100 students through their first year of college. $5 million, our reach goal, would carry them through to completion.</p>

<p>I could afford to fund Donald’s college education. Many parents are not so fortunate. I’m so proud of where Donald is today, on his own, a working man and tax-paying citizen. A life most of us take for granted but that means so much to him and to his community. Knowing these funds will lift 100 more young people to a full, independent life seems to me a job worth doing.

I'm 19 years young from Edmonton, Ablerta. I have to tell you I'm a city boy representing the Northside of course. That doesn't mean however I don't love adventure and going all over the place!!! Roughing it out in nature doesn't bother me one bit.</li>
<li>Family, friends, and even strangers have shown me so much prayer, love and financial support. However some unexpected costs have popped up recently and I am reaching out for a need that I can't fulfill while I'm in Minnesota during my lecture phase. This is something I'm learning to work on. I come from a culture that you work for every penny you earn and I need to swallow my pride because I know my God. I know my Father is blessing me and that he wants to use people like you out there to fulfill his promise of providing for my needs so I can show love across the nations! So I would ask that you would pray about supporting me and being a part of this amazing adventure. </li>
<li>I am passionate about making a difference in people's lives. I've worked a lot of jobs that pay well. I could go into trades or business and do really well. That however does't define success to me (Not that those things are bad at all). One of my prides and joys is my first ever tattoo. An hourglass with the world falling to the bottom has so much meaning and deep personal morals built into it. You get only one shot at living and I want to make it count, and I want to live everyday knowing that this world I'm living is in a little better shape then it was that morning. One person can make a difference and I want to connect with everyone so we all can achieve something that will be written in textbooks. Yeah I sound crazy, but if you don't dream big what's the point? I want to see people come to a personal relationship with God, I want to see children/orphans be saved from preventable disease and malnutrition, I want to reach teens who know the pain of self harm! I want to do so much, but at the end of the day it can be summed up in one word. LOVE! I want to love those who might not feel it, who might not know what that looks like. Those who feel forgotten and to let them know, NO YOU ARE LOVED!!! </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Where your money is going </h3> <ul> <li>$1500-1800 Flights </li> <li>$375 monthly costs (food, local transport, communications<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </b>

I know my Father is blessing me and that he wants to use people like you out there to fulfill his promise of providing for my needs so I can show love across the nations! So I would ask that you would pray about supporting me and being a part of this amazing adventure. 
I am passionate about making a difference in people's lives. I've worked a lot of jobs that pay well. I could go into trades or business and do really well. That however does't define success to me (Not that those things are bad at all). One of my prides and joys is my first ever tattoo. An hourglass with the world falling to the bottom has so much meaning and deep personal morals built into it. You get only one shot at living and I want to make it count, and I want to live everyday knowing that this world I'm living is in a little better shape then it was that morning. One person can make a difference and I want to connect with everyone so we all can achieve something that will be written in textbooks. Yeah I sound crazy, but if you don't dream big what's the point? I want to see people come to a personal relationship with God, I want to see children/orphans be saved from preventable disease and malnutrition, I want to reach teens who know the pain of self harm! I want to do so much, but at the end of the day it can be summed up in one word. LOVE! I want to love those who might not feel it, who might not know what that looks like. Those who feel forgotten and to let them know, NO YOU ARE LOVED!!!     Where your money is going   $1500-1800 Flights  $375 monthly costs (food, local transport, communications

AUTOMATIC STUDIOS’ mission is to empower NYC children to realize their individual talents and foster professional and creative skills in the film and television industries. Our students learn important life skills such as navigating teamwork, task and project completion, organization and planning. Ultimately, the specialized technical and social skills learned at Automatic Studios helps lead interested young filmmakers into future employment in the film and television industry.
In our unique MOVIE ARTS© program, students learn the art of film making through hands-on experience, active collaboration and teamwork. Our students learn Script writing, Pre-production Planning, On-Set Job Roles, Studio & Location Production Shooting and Editing.  Further focused studies include aspects of film technology such as camera work, lighting and editing, as well as costume and prop design, and acting.

something off. It sounded like extremely loud and rumbling, like engine 
problems,” said Melissa Bush. “All of a sudden, we didn’t hear the 
helicopter. We looked out and there was literally fire, and right in 
front of us, fire and flames coming down… As they were coming down, all 
of a sudden you see a big fire explosion and then all of a sudden we 
didn’t see anything. It went black.”<br/>  A massive search-and-rescue 
effort is underway after two U.S. Marine Corps helicopters crashed off 
Haleiwa late Thursday night.<br/>  A total of 12 crew members — six were on board each helicopter — remain missing at this time.<br/> Search and rescue personnel with military, federal, state and city agencies joined forces in the search-and-rescue operation.<br/>  The Coast Guard says a safety zone has been established between Kaena 
Point and Turtle Bay, though “with 10-12 knot winds, swells at 16 feet, 
and breaking surf at 30 feet, it’s moving the debris all over the 
place,” <br/>  As of Friday afternoon, no dive teams were sent into the water. “It’s 
just barely safe for our rescue crews to be out there, so it’s not safe 
for divers just yet,” <br/>  After five full days of searching, multi-agency rescue crews found no 
signs of survivors. The search was called off on Tuesday, Jan. 19.<br/>  
On Friday, 12 flak jackets, helmets, rifles, boots, and lei draped over a
 cross represented each Marine who was taken too soon. Communities from coast-to-coast are mourning these Marines, and our 
nation is forever grateful for their patriotism, service, and sacrifice.
 Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones at this
 difficult hour. This is one of many heartbreaking disasters where Scuba Search and Rescue is needed.<br/><p></p>
<p><span>    </span><span><b>People
need us!</b> Anywhere there are bodies of water where people work or play,
search and rescue divers inevitably find themselves called to action. I want to
make search and rescue diving my life’s work. This demanding and rewarding
calling requires training and skill, plus a high level of physical fitness, and
more. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>  <b>Search and Rescue Divers mission:</b></span><span>  Lost divers and swimmers, hurricane and storm
victims, shipwreck survivors, along with many others who find themselves in
need of rescue.Accidents take place in a variety of environments; in
mountain lakes and rivers, in quarries and ponds, and at popular open water
dive sites, on reefs and at wrecks.<span>  Equipment
malfunctions, ice breaks beneath people walking across it, currents become
unmanageable, tunnels inside caves collapse; what can go wrong does.  As any professional search and rescue diver
can tell you, the circumstances in which people find themselves are often
unpredictable and frightening; often, by the time dive teams arrive at the
scene of an emergency, victims are unresponsive or have already perished.
 It is a tragic horrible event when someone loses a loved one. It is never
an easy process dealing with the loss of a friend, family member, or loved one
especially if it comes unexpectedly. <u>The number one rule rescuers must
remember is to always expect the unexpected<b>.  </b></u></span></span></p>
<p><b><span> 
</span></b>Any
unexpected death is difficult at its best, but I have to say that a drowning
victim that has not yet been recovered has to be one of the worst. In a typical
situation where a person passes away, the family immediately starts funeral preparations.
After the funeral, the closure/healing process can begin.<span>  In a drowning however, typically funeral
arrangements do not happen before the body is found.Which means the
healing process is delayed: day – after day - after day.  For some people,
every new day is another day of reliving the day of tragedy.<b>  Can you
imagine the pain? </b>I have seen people that have relived this day for several
days, weeks, and months. I’m sure there are people that have relived it for
years.<b> It is heartbreaking! </b>Anyone’s heart would break just listening to
the stories of people that have suffered waiting for someone to bring their
loved one home so they can one day begin their closure. For some people they
know that their loved one is gone, but yet in the back of their mind (because
the body has not been found) they hope that their loved one will still come
walking through the door at any time. <br/></span></p>
<p> <span> Hi folks, my name is Ryan,  I moved to Florida to pursue a career as a Water Search and Rescue/Master Diver. I am currently a certified Scuba Diver with Nitrox training out of Bradenton Scuba Quest in Bradenton Florida. I was studying and training to be a Water Rescue Diver for a host of reasons. One is to save lives. God gives everyone talents. He gives us those talents in order that we may serve others. He expects us to use the talents he has given us. He has given Scuba Divers certain talents that enable us to do this type of work. To help make a difference in water rescue, disaster and prevention. What we get in return for making a recovery. The greatest gift of all: being able to help someone else in need.</span><br/><span> <span></span></span></p>
<p><span>  In order to maintain rescue team safety
and increase the odds of saving lives, rescuers must be well equipped and well
trained; which means ongoing training is necessary on a regular basis and you have
to invest in your own training and own equipment.  Equipment requirements
vary depending upon the environment and conditions that are typically present

 cross represented each Marine who was taken too soon. Communities from coast-to-coast are mourning these Marines, and our 
nation is forever grateful for their patriotism, service, and sacrifice.
 Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones at this
 difficult hour. This is one of many heartbreaking disasters where Scuba Search and Rescue is needed.
    People
need us! Anywhere there are bodies of water where people work or play,
search and rescue divers inevitably find themselves called to action. I want to
make search and rescue diving my life’s work. This demanding and rewarding
calling requires training and skill, plus a high level of physical fitness, and
more. 
  Search and Rescue Divers mission:  Lost divers and swimmers, hurricane and storm
victims, shipwreck survivors, along with many others who find themselves in
need of rescue.Accidents take place in a variety of environments; in
mountain lakes and rivers, in quarries and ponds, and at popular open water
dive sites, on reefs and at wrecks.  Equipment
malfunctions, ice breaks beneath people walking across it, currents become
unmanageable, tunnels inside caves collapse; what can go wrong does.  As any professional search and rescue diver
can tell you, the circumstances in which people find themselves are often
unpredictable and frightening; often, by the time dive teams arrive at the
scene of an emergency, victims are unresponsive or have already perished.
 It is a tragic horrible event when someone loses a loved one. It is never
an easy process dealing with the loss of a friend, family member, or loved one
especially if it comes unexpectedly. The number one rule rescuers must
remember is to always expect the unexpected.  
 
Any
unexpected death is difficult at its best, but I have to say that a drowning
victim that has not yet been recovered has to be one of the worst. In a typical
situation where a person passes away, the family immediately starts funeral preparations.
After the funeral, the closure/healing process can begin.  In a drowning however, typically funeral
arrangements do not happen before the body is found.Which means the
healing process is delayed: day – after day - after day.  For some people,
every new day is another day of reliving the day of tragedy.  Can you
imagine the pain? I have seen people that have relived this day for several
days, weeks, and months. I’m sure there are people that have relived it for
years. It is heartbreaking! Anyone’s heart would break just listening to
the stories of people that have suffered waiting for someone to bring their
loved one home so they can one day begin their closure. For some people they
know that their loved one is gone, but yet in the back of their mind (because
the body has not been found) they hope that their loved one will still come
walking through the door at any time. 
  Hi folks, my name is Ryan,  I moved to Florida to pursue a career as a Water Search and Rescue/Master Diver. I am currently a certified Scuba Diver with Nitrox training out of Bradenton Scuba Quest in Bradenton Florida. I was studying and training to be a Water Rescue Diver for a host of reasons. One is to save lives. God gives everyone talents. He gives us those talents in order that we may serve others. He expects us to use the talents he has given us. He has given Scuba Divers certain talents that enable us to do this type of work. To help make a difference in water rescue, disaster and prevention. What we get in return for making a recovery. The greatest gift of all: being able to help someone else in need. 
  In order to maintain rescue team safety
and increase the odds of saving lives, rescuers must be well equipped and well
trained; which means ongoing training is necessary on a regular basis and you have
to invest in your own training and own equipment.  Equipment requirements
vary depending upon the environment and conditions that are typically present
as well as conditions that could arise.  Full face masks and
communications equipment, plus a diver propulsion vehicle are some of the items
you might need to utilize during the course of training and operations. Along

A Dive Rescuers
Prayer

When I'm called for duty God
to dive beneath the waves.
To search for an unfortunate soul
whose body they have claimed.
Let swiftness be my virtue
to find that soul in time.
Please let this be a rescue lord
and not the other ""kind""
Be my eyes in the darkest waters
and guide me with your hand
that this person may be saved
when we return to land.
If this is not your will Lord
then please show me the way
to sort out this sad mystery
and to dive another day.
If things become the darkest Lord
and it's I that you call home
please guide my friends and family
that they'll never walk alone.

<h3>The Favorable Time does not guarantee your success but it enhances your chances of producing a positive outcome.</h3>
<p>I found in my research that these financially lucrative events tend to manifest themselves in the favorable times, so if we continue to do our intraday trades, casino visits, sports betting, and job interviews during these favorable times, we will have a much more higher chance of achieving a positive result out if it.</p>
<p>However, not all of these favorable times would produce positive results, but my three-year-research concluded that over 70% of all positive events do occur during these favorable time periods.</p>

</div></div>","YeeeeeeeeHA! is what you shout out when you are feeling lucky at the casino and this is what our app is all about.
I am Khit Wong and I have been researching for this ""Lucky Streak"" or ""Favorable Time"" for 15 years now.
You may regard this ""Favorable Time"" as
""The time period for something good, but out of your normal expectations, to occur.""

and it can occur in various forms:
It can be manifested as a tangible prize in a lucky draw, the no.3 top prize for the night, for example.
   
It can be manifested as an unexpected cash prize. for example, paying out $1,000 from a $10 scratch card.

It can, as well,  be manifested as winning an mini-Jackpot. The image below shows the slot machine paying 50 times its normal payout during the Favorable Time.

The Favorable Time is not limited to money related matters, it can also be manifested as a job promotion.


and of course, it could be manifested as profit from your successful trading activities, and from betting at the right time.

and it works for horse-race betting as well. Despite the return is not very high, the accuracy level is very high.  Having 5 out of 5 winning during the Favourable Time.


Here are just a few of the Khit Wong's many references 
(more can be found at his website)
This is a Euro Forecast Khit made in January, 2015. The youtube post date was 11 Jan 2015. Arguably he could make 50 videos and only show the correct one after-the-fact, but there were over 365 x 365 possibilities of catching both of the Euro's year low at the beginning of 2015.
source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24mnQru87gY


Actual year lows were just two and seven days away from his forecasted Euro lows, 11 months ago.




And here are some of Khit's many happy customers' testimonials
 
 
 
 
    
The Favorable Time does not guarantee your success but it enhances your chances of producing a positive outcome.
I found in my research that these financially lucrative events tend to manifest themselves in the favorable times, so if we continue to do our intraday trades, casino visits, sports betting, and job interviews during these favorable times, we will have a much more higher chance of achieving a positive result out if it.
However, not all of these favorable times would produce positive results, but my three-year-research concluded that over 70% of all positive events do occur during these favorable time periods.


There are more complicated formulas in this App, and we need your help!
Although this is actually the second App I have developed, The first one - Ephemeris Alarm , a Top 200 App (http://www.mobbo.com/iOS/App/net.biggo.eph-alar...) and has already helped hundreds of traders around the globe to reap profit from the stock market.

This YeeHa! App is much more complicated and I need to find a new programmer to program the individual favorable time periods which can go down to specific hours in a day.
If you are interested, please feel free to click on the Early Adopters Perk and help kick start this project, thank you!

<p>My name is Ales Raus, I’m 33 years old and I’m from Slovakia. While my studies at University, I decided to go to London for my summer break and improve my English skills. My trip was almost over, when I decided to help my friend to clean windows. When we were almost done, I accidently felt from the ladder. This fall was such disconsolate that it left me paralyzed on half of my body and it damaged my spinal cord as well. In one second my whole life changed; horrible pain and struggle to stand up, all this in foreign country. I was hyperactive since I was a child and I could not imagine myself without walking or running; just sitting for the rest of my life. Dear God, that was such a horrible imagination. It took me a while until I was able to stand again on my feet from the wheelchair and get back to normal life. Strong belief in God along with my faith to get soon better got connected with my faith to accomplish something big in my life and urge to become successful among healthy individuals. It has been couple years after my accident and I had the opportunity to visit me the most admired New York City. The city you can see almost in every movie. This amazing city gave me the idea about interactive clothing. The idea came to me while waiting in metro station for train. I was observing people; everyone was super busy with their phones either texting or calling. Some young boys were sticking stickers on trash cans... I was thinking to myself; what a busy life. Nobody is paying attention to others, they don't even look at each other’s. And suddenly - idea: "" Why don't we start to communicate on ourselves? This could be the way we can express ourselves, leave the message, draw attention and be original at the same time. For the most of the time, I was working on this project on my own. With support of this campaign, you will help me to accomplish my dreams.</p>

<p><b>RISK and CHALLANGES </b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are watching crowdfunding for a long time now and this is ours first campaign, so We make extra effort to get everything right.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  Our biggest challenge is getting the word out quickly and eventually expanding the product line to accommodate all of our consumers’ needs. We are committed to delivering high-quality apparel, on time, and with the goal of exceeding expectations. As mentioned above, all of the necessary precautions have been taken to assure a smooth production transition. Some risks include material shortage, labor shortage, or shipment issues. But CHATEEE team has worked hard to make sure none of these potential threats become real.</span></p>

<p><strong>Prečo práve Chateee ?</strong><u><strong> </strong></u></p>
<p><strong>zvyšuje deťom IQ</strong> – pretože hádajú slová textu, snažia sa zapamätať rôzne názvy a mená na mikinách, ktoré si deti medzi sebou vytvorili . Z abecedy skladajú slová, ktoré sa naučili, alebo vymýšľajú vlastné . Rozmýšľajú nad hrami v ikonkách, vytvárajú rôzne básne v textových ikonkách , každý deň môžu stvárňovať inú obľúbenú postavičku a premyslieť ako ju vytvoria , ..</p>
<p><strong>Nadväzuje  priateľstvá</strong> pretože doslova láka deti medzi sebou sa hrať , písať si, vymieňať si postavičky navzájom, kresliť si a hrať spoločné hry na sebe.</p>
<p><strong>Spestruje detskú kreativitu</strong> - pretože v bublinkách vykresľujú rôzne postavičky , tvary,  na ďalších nášivkách sa hrajú hry, vytvárajú rôzne príbehy medzi postavičkami, zvieratkami a inými nášivkami</p>
<p><strong>Pretože je koncept využiteľný ako učebná pomôcka pre deti v škôlkach a školách .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pomáha prehĺbiť rodinné putá</strong> - pretože rodičia sa viac so svojimi deťmi hrajú, hádajú čo napíšu, nakreslia, hrajú s nimi hry , zanechávajú si rôzne odkazy a núti ich to premýšľať!</p>
<p><strong>Určite budete nadšení , že nie sme on-line ale OFF-LINE</strong> ! Čo to znamená ? Že pri mikinách sa deti uvoľnia, nepotrebujú stále šťukať do mobilu . Hrajú sa tradičným spôsobom, učia a vymýšľajú presne tak ako my keď sme boli mladí !</p>
<p><strong>Pretože koncept je ilustračne obohatený počtom asi 40 obrázkov. Je variabilný, použiteľný pre širokú škálu rôznej úrovne rozvoja mentálnych schopností, vedomostí detí.</strong></p>
<p>Pretože obsahuje kompletnú líniu detských nášiviek oslavujúcich športy, rozprávkové bytosti, vesmír, dopravné prostriedky, jedlo – proste všetko čo deti milujú !</p>
<p><strong>Pretože je vytvorený ako UNISEX, COOOL a je originálny .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pretože mikiny sú moderné, viacúčelové, imidžové, ručne robené, zapamätateľné a cenovo dostupné.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>O nás:</strong></p>
<p>Koncept sme najskôr vymysleli pre seba, aby sme skúsili komunikovať aj iným spôsobom, zabávali, odkazovali na sebe myšlienky okoliu.. Avšak časom sme pochopili, že je ti ideálny produkt pre deti ich rodičov a školy .Strávili sme pri tom vyšše 1,5 roka, dali si vyvinúť vlastnú zmes a technologický postup na priliepanie suchého zipsu o mikiny, tak by sa dali prať a na stovky ráz namáhať priliepaním a odliepaním. Oslovili sme čo najväčšiu skupinu detí, rodičov, riaditeľov škôlok, škôl a rôznych študentských organizácií o tom aké farby mikín sa im najviac páčia, aké by chceli mať postavičky na ikonkách a aké druhy ikoniek by radi nosili. Dnes môžeme CHATEEE mikiny kľudne nazvať riešením „Všetko V Jednom“ je to produkt zábavný pretože deti si kreslia rôzne hry , píšu rôzne veci do bubliniek , vymieňajú obľúbené nášivky, hádajú kto má čo vo vrecúšku, vytvárajú priateľstvá, píšu si rôzne básničky do nezmývateľných textových bubliniek atď.   </p>
<p><strong>Grafiky na 3D plastické PVC nášivky</strong></p>
<p><u>Obrázky nižšie slúžia nato, aby ste si presne vedeli vybrať aké nášivky chcete do svojich balíčkov ! </u></p>
<p>Je na vašom výbere, ktoré a koľko postavičiek si vyberiete do svojich balíčkov.</p>
<p>Na základe výskumu medzi deťmi sme vybrali najobľúbenejšie postavičky.</p>
<p>Niektoré z postavičiek nakreslili sami decká ! </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Risk a výzva </strong></p>
<p>Crowdfunding projekty už sledujem dlho, toto je naša prvá kampaň takže si dávame záležať. Našou najväčšou úlohou je dodržať rýchlo a poriadne slovo. Zaviazali sme sa k zaslaniu vysoko kvalitného oblečenia, včas a s cieľom nad očakávania. Ako bolo uvedené vyššie, prijali sme všetky potrebné opatrenia, s cieľom zabezpečiť hladký prechod výroby. K niektorým rizikám patrí materiálny nedostatok, nedostatok pracovných síl alebo problémy zásielok. Ale CHATEEE tím tvrdo pracoval, aby sa ubezpečil, že žiadna z týchto potenciálnych hrozieb sa nestane skutočnosťou.</p>
<p><strong>Často kladené otázky:</strong></p>
<p><i><u>Moja veľkosť nieje k dispozícií, čo mám robiť ?</u></i></p>

<p><i><u>Kde si môžem vybrať akú chcem veľkosť, farbu, nášivky , druhy a počty nášiviek? </u></i></p>

<p>Odliepať a priliepať nášivky na mikiny môžete tisícky ráz – máme to testované !</p>
<p><i><u>Zdravotná nezávadnosť ?</u></i></p>
<p>Mikiny sú certifikované a zmes, ktorým sa priliepa suchý zips na mikiny je zdravotne nezávadná.</p>
<p>Certifikát posielam na vyžiadanie.</p>

</div></div>","WHY CHATEEE ? It  enhances  childrens  IQ,  because  they  guessing  words,  they try to  remember different terms  and  names on  sweatshirt,  which  they  have  created.  They create words out of alphabet,  which  they  have  learned,  or  they  can  create  their  own words. They think about various games in patches, creating  poems in text patches, they can  create  different  character  every  day   and  think   about   how  actually create it.They can make new  friendships,  because kids are still so open  minded,  they can write to each other and  exchange  characters in between  them,  but still being part of it.It enriches  creativity,  by coloring  sticky bubbles,  they change shapes,  they play games in other icons, even creating stories.This concept could be also applied in schools and daycares. 
 
It could help to improve communication and relationships between parents and kids. They can draw, play guessing games and leaving each other messages, which makes them think!!!
You will be pleased to know that you dont have to be ONLINE! What that does  mean? Kids are going to feel more relaxed in these sweatshirts, they dont need to be spending time on phone. They play and learn like we used to!
This concept contains aproximately 100 patches. It is flexible, usable for wide scale of audience, different age levels, also knowledge.
It contains different types of the pictures.  Sports, fairytale characters, universe, transport, food – everything what children love!
Because it has been created to be UNISEX, COOL and ORIGINAL.
Because it is modern, multipurpose, partly handmade, memorable and affordable!

 FOUNDER STORY:
My name is Ales Raus, I’m 33 years old and I’m from Slovakia. While my studies at University, I decided to go to London for my summer break and improve my English skills. My trip was almost over, when I decided to help my friend to clean windows. When we were almost done, I accidently felt from the ladder. This fall was such disconsolate that it left me paralyzed on half of my body and it damaged my spinal cord as well. In one second my whole life changed; horrible pain and struggle to stand up, all this in foreign country. I was hyperactive since I was a child and I could not imagine myself without walking or running; just sitting for the rest of my life. Dear God, that was such a horrible imagination. It took me a while until I was able to stand again on my feet from the wheelchair and get back to normal life. Strong belief in God along with my faith to get soon better got connected with my faith to accomplish something big in my life and urge to become successful among healthy individuals. It has been couple years after my accident and I had the opportunity to visit me the most admired New York City. The city you can see almost in every movie. This amazing city gave me the idea about interactive clothing. The idea came to me while waiting in metro station for train. I was observing people; everyone was super busy with their phones either texting or calling. Some young boys were sticking stickers on trash cans... I was thinking to myself; what a busy life. Nobody is paying attention to others, they don't even look at each other’s. And suddenly - idea: "" Why don't we start to communicate on ourselves? This could be the way we can express ourselves, leave the message, draw attention and be original at the same time. For the most of the time, I was working on this project on my own. With support of this campaign, you will help me to accomplish my dreams.

AFTER  OUR  CAMPAIGN  END,  WE  WILL  SEND  YOU  SURVEY  WHICH   SIZE, COLOR,  PATCHES  AND  NUMBER  OF  PATCHES  YOU  WANT EXACTLY INTO YOUR PERK !

RISK and CHALLANGES 
We are watching crowdfunding for a long time now and this is ours first campaign, so We make extra effort to get everything right.  Our biggest challenge is getting the word out quickly and eventually expanding the product line to accommodate all of our consumers’ needs. We are committed to delivering high-quality apparel, on time, and with the goal of exceeding expectations. As mentioned above, all of the necessary precautions have been taken to assure a smooth production transition. Some risks include material shortage, labor shortage, or shipment issues. But CHATEEE team has worked hard to make sure none of these potential threats become real.

Prečo práve Chateee ? 
zvyšuje deťom IQ – pretože hádajú slová textu, snažia sa zapamätať rôzne názvy a mená na mikinách, ktoré si deti medzi sebou vytvorili . Z abecedy skladajú slová, ktoré sa naučili, alebo vymýšľajú vlastné . Rozmýšľajú nad hrami v ikonkách, vytvárajú rôzne básne v textových ikonkách , každý deň môžu stvárňovať inú obľúbenú postavičku a premyslieť ako ju vytvoria , ..
Nadväzuje  priateľstvá pretože doslova láka deti medzi sebou sa hrať , písať si, vymieňať si postavičky navzájom, kresliť si a hrať spoločné hry na sebe.
Spestruje detskú kreativitu - pretože v bublinkách vykresľujú rôzne postavičky , tvary,  na ďalších nášivkách sa hrajú hry, vytvárajú rôzne príbehy medzi postavičkami, zvieratkami a inými nášivkami
Pretože je koncept využiteľný ako učebná pomôcka pre deti v škôlkach a školách .
Pomáha prehĺbiť rodinné putá - pretože rodičia sa viac so svojimi deťmi hrajú, hádajú čo napíšu, nakreslia, hrajú s nimi hry , zanechávajú si rôzne odkazy a núti ich to premýšľať!
Určite budete nadšení , že nie sme on-line ale OFF-LINE ! Čo to znamená ? Že pri mikinách sa deti uvoľnia, nepotrebujú stále šťukať do mobilu . Hrajú sa tradičným spôsobom, učia a vymýšľajú presne tak ako my keď sme boli mladí !
Pretože koncept je ilustračne obohatený počtom asi 40 obrázkov. Je variabilný, použiteľný pre širokú škálu rôznej úrovne rozvoja mentálnych schopností, vedomostí detí.
Pretože obsahuje kompletnú líniu detských nášiviek oslavujúcich športy, rozprávkové bytosti, vesmír, dopravné prostriedky, jedlo – proste všetko čo deti milujú !
Pretože je vytvorený ako UNISEX, COOOL a je originálny .
Pretože mikiny sú moderné, viacúčelové, imidžové, ručne robené, zapamätateľné a cenovo dostupné.
 
O nás:
Koncept sme najskôr vymysleli pre seba, aby sme skúsili komunikovať aj iným spôsobom, zabávali, odkazovali na sebe myšlienky okoliu.. Avšak časom sme pochopili, že je ti ideálny produkt pre deti ich rodičov a školy .Strávili sme pri tom vyšše 1,5 roka, dali si vyvinúť vlastnú zmes a technologický postup na priliepanie suchého zipsu o mikiny, tak by sa dali prať a na stovky ráz namáhať priliepaním a odliepaním. Oslovili sme čo najväčšiu skupinu detí, rodičov, riaditeľov škôlok, škôl a rôznych študentských organizácií o tom aké farby mikín sa im najviac páčia, aké by chceli mať postavičky na ikonkách a aké druhy ikoniek by radi nosili. Dnes môžeme CHATEEE mikiny kľudne nazvať riešením „Všetko V Jednom“ je to produkt zábavný pretože deti si kreslia rôzne hry , píšu rôzne veci do bubliniek , vymieňajú obľúbené nášivky, hádajú kto má čo vo vrecúšku, vytvárajú priateľstvá, píšu si rôzne básničky do nezmývateľných textových bubliniek atď.   
Grafiky na 3D plastické PVC nášivky
Obrázky nižšie slúžia nato, aby ste si presne vedeli vybrať aké nášivky chcete do svojich balíčkov ! 
Je na vašom výbere, ktoré a koľko postavičiek si vyberiete do svojich balíčkov.
Na základe výskumu medzi deťmi sme vybrali najobľúbenejšie postavičky.
Niektoré z postavičiek nakreslili sami decká !

Risk a výzva 
Crowdfunding projekty už sledujem dlho, toto je naša prvá kampaň takže si dávame záležať. Našou najväčšou úlohou je dodržať rýchlo a poriadne slovo. Zaviazali sme sa k zaslaniu vysoko kvalitného oblečenia, včas a s cieľom nad očakávania. Ako bolo uvedené vyššie, prijali sme všetky potrebné opatrenia, s cieľom zabezpečiť hladký prechod výroby. K niektorým rizikám patrí materiálny nedostatok, nedostatok pracovných síl alebo problémy zásielok. Ale CHATEEE tím tvrdo pracoval, aby sa ubezpečil, že žiadna z týchto potenciálnych hrozieb sa nestane skutočnosťou.
Často kladené otázky:
Moja veľkosť nieje k dispozícií, čo mám robiť ?
Prosím napíšte mi v emaily mi akú potrebujete, a ja Vás informujem , či je možné vyhovieť Vám .
Kde si môžem vybrať akú chcem veľkosť, farbu, nášivky , druhy a počty nášiviek? 
Po ukončení kampane Vám zašleme emailom formulár, kde musíte presne uviesť všetky detaily ako veľkosť, farbu, druhy a počet nášiviek. 
Dá sa oblečenie prať ?
Áno , samozrejme doporučujeme na 30 tke
Odliepať a priliepať nášivky na mikiny môžete tisícky ráz – máme to testované !
Zdravotná nezávadnosť ?
Mikiny sú certifikované a zmes, ktorým sa priliepa suchý zips na mikiny je zdravotne nezávadná.
Certifikát posielam na vyžiadanie.
·Čo v prípade, ak mi moja veľkosť nebude dobre sedieť ? 
Pokiaľ Vám objednaná mikina nebude sedieť, pošlite ju jednoducho späť a my Vám ju vymeníme za druhú! Medzinárodný zákazníci budú spoplatnený poštovným 10 EUR.
Môžem ti zaslať vlastný motív a vybrať k tomu oblečenie ?
Ano samozrejme, avšak Vašu požiadavku budem môcť vykonať až po ukončení kampane.
Pošlete mi Váš návrh, a ja posúdim či sa to dá technicky zrealizovať a odpíšem Vám.
Ako môžem objednať viac ako len jeden sveter cez Indiegogo?

<p>My name is Barbara Post-Askin. I was born in 1931 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York during the Great Depression and World War II. During my childhood years, I treasured the hours I spent listening to survivors of the Civil War on the radio. It helped me to understand the sacrifices made in building this great nation. My journey through these challenging times inspired my thirst for history and validated the power of liberty on which America was built.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was compelled to write my memoir as a gift to my family. America was once again being challenged, but this time from within. I wanted to ensure the foundation of freedom that our Country was built on, would not be forgotten by future generations. My book, Reflections of Liberty, reminds us of what made this Country great and how each of us must take responsibility for our liberty.</p>
<p>After writing my book, I have been privileged to be able to speak to high schools and universities about my book and history. While speaking to them, it shocked me to find out that many students do not even know who our first president was! History is not an important subject in schools anymore and many schools are completely doing away with it.</p>
<p><i>This is a horrible mistake. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p>History is one of the most important aspects of learning. Without it, the younger generation is doomed to repeat the mistakes a younger America made.</p>
<p>Along with this, I also discuss how, as a result of technology and information overload, children are not given any time to prioritize information and learn about events going on around them. Patriotism is waning, as are the values that our country has held so dear since it's birth. </p>
<p>Thousands of people in my generation pass away every day, and I believe it is our responsibility not to let the lessons they learned defending our country and American values die with them. Telling my story is one way of preserving the diaries, photographs, artifacts from WWII and the Great Depression. Take the challenge with me and help me get my book into museums, schools &amp; historical societies. So together, we can keep history alive!<br/></p>
<p><i></i><i>My mission is simple:</i> With your contributions, I would like to donate 100 books to museums, schools and historical societies across the country to help keep my story alive, as someone who has lived through America's darkest days. </p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>Breakdown of the $2500 we hope to raise: </i></p>
<p>$2100 for the cost of the books including shipping and handling</p>
<p>$400 for marketing this campaign to reach more people (This includes hiring a marketer to help spread the word and Facebook ads) </p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">About <i>Reflections Of Liberty</i>: </h3>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">""Barbara Post-Askin becomes the voice of a dying generation in her memoir, Reflections of Liberty. From the mass European migration in the early 1900s, to the end of World War II, Post-Askin's stories relay the triumphs, losses, and often forgotten values of a young America. Throughout the stories Post-Askin tells, she highlights the differences between her generation and those of today. The steady decline of family values, the ambivalence towards political issues, the increase in everyday fear and violence, as well as the lack of face-to-face communication are all hazardous changes to the ideals of upcoming Americans. She also discusses the quickly waning sense of patriotism, as well as the lack of freedom amongst our nation's people, and reminds us that these are the founding tenets of this country. To lose them is to lose our identity! By allowing us to experience the life of a woman raised in a time and in conditions so different from today, Reflections of Liberty encourages readers to question our own values and decisions. These stories will inspire readers to reconsider what is truly important, while also calling the young adults of today to action. The new generations are the only ones who will be able to turn the United States back into the ‘Land of the Free.’ If we cannot reclaim our liberty, Post-Askin fears that the darkest days of our nation are doomed to repeat themselves.""<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464374840/ref_recfa0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

My mission is simple: With your contributions, I would like to donate 100 books to museums, schools and historical societies across the country to help keep my story alive, as someone who has lived through America's darkest days. 

Breakdown of the $2500 we hope to raise: 
$2100 for the cost of the books including shipping and handling
$400 for marketing this campaign to reach more people (This includes hiring a marketer to help spread the word and Facebook ads) 





About Reflections Of Liberty: 
""Barbara Post-Askin becomes the voice of a dying generation in her memoir, Reflections of Liberty. From the mass European migration in the early 1900s, to the end of World War II, Post-Askin's stories relay the triumphs, losses, and often forgotten values of a young America. Throughout the stories Post-Askin tells, she highlights the differences between her generation and those of today. The steady decline of family values, the ambivalence towards political issues, the increase in everyday fear and violence, as well as the lack of face-to-face communication are all hazardous changes to the ideals of upcoming Americans. She also discusses the quickly waning sense of patriotism, as well as the lack of freedom amongst our nation's people, and reminds us that these are the founding tenets of this country. To lose them is to lose our identity! By allowing us to experience the life of a woman raised in a time and in conditions so different from today, Reflections of Liberty encourages readers to question our own values and decisions. These stories will inspire readers to reconsider what is truly important, while also calling the young adults of today to action. The new generations are the only ones who will be able to turn the United States back into the ‘Land of the Free.’ If we cannot reclaim our liberty, Post-Askin fears that the darkest days of our nation are doomed to repeat themselves.""

In January of this year he was fitted with a pacemaker to resolve a problem with his heart beating irregularly. Whilst this condition nearly cost him his life, another had gradually eroded his lust for life.</p><p> </p><p>Ageing does not cause any of the conditions or diseases associated with old age. Much like a sore throat is a symptom of a cold, an age related illness is a symptom of tiny changes that have taken place within a person's cells overtime. Regardless of when, where and how those changes occur, their effects do not always present gradually.</p><p> </p><p>The onset of dad's eczema was aggressive. Almost overnight his entire skin turned scarlet in colour and became dry, with an itchiness that was unbearable. Eczema presents no threat to a person’s mortality. However, the reality of living with chronic eczema is that the skin is so sensitive that the slightest touch sets off irritation and itchiness that spreads. This poses a real problem for wearing clothes, for sitting in a chair, travelling by car or bus, for laying down to sleep, and many other routine activities. On average, he would get 20-30 minutes sleep followed by hours of being awake. The exhaustion he experienced from his inability to have any kind of sleep pattern, combined with the loneliness of his own thoughts and the ceaseless itching of his skin, took their toll. His usual resolve eventually gave way and a weariness of life set in. Watching him go through this was heart breaking. His doctor would tell him the condition is a part of getting older, there is no known cure and that he could only apply medication to ease it.</p><p> </p><p>I was not prepared to accept this. This is the greatest age for scientific discovery that humans have ever known. We are accomplished at deriving solutions. I understand the mindset that underpins this achievement because this is the single most important thing that dad has tried to impress on me, all my life, a sense of self reliance and a confidence in my ability to learn that which is necessary for finding an answer or completing a project.</p><p> </p><p>Whilst researching the condition I discovered that other age related illnesses are experiencing break throughs. I found that I was quickly becoming familiar with scientific language and developing an understanding of the inner workings of the human body. I started to formulate, what I thought as being then, and still do now, a grandiose idea. If no one else can cure him, may be I should try. Even as I write this, when I contemplate that statement, I’m aware of how arrogant it sounds. But the idea has taken hold of me and I can’t let it go.</p><p> </p><p>I looked for universities that have research departments that specialise in age related illness and diseases, and then contacted them to get information about the direction I should be working towards. I eventually identified that the role I was looking to occupy was that of a Biogerontologist. There are many routes through science to this job, but I knew, from my research, that the answers for these illnesses exist at the genetic level, so biology and, more specifically, molecular and cellular biology, was my route of choice. However, in order to qualify for a position on a molecular and cellular biology degree, at Newcastle University, I would have to, not only, pass every part of an access diploma, I would have to get distinctions as well. Universities of great standing can take their pick of the best students, so competition for places is immense. In September 2015 I signed up for an Access to Higher Education Diploma in the sciences. </p><p> </p><p>I got the grades I needed and Newcastle University has accepted me.</p><p> </p><p>And, this is why I have come to Indiegogo and to all of you.</p><p> </p><p>My stalling point is this.</p><p> </p><p>In order to progress with my study, at Newcastle University, I need a total of £31,900, which breaks down as follows.</p><p>Course fees…             £27,500</p><p>Travel costs…             £  1,500</p><p>Indiegogo fees…        £  2,900</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475936127/kw4wwgk3egyu0dozctow.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Neither Sarah nor I have any personal wealth. We barely get by. Whilst deliberating how to keep moving forward with this, both Sarah and I have discussed selling our house, as a contingency plan should the full amount not be reached. Whilst we are fully prepared to do this, the idea of separating ourselves from the memories and attachments of our home weighs heavy on us. But more than this, in recent years our home has provided respite from the world, a place where I could hide.Throughout my life I have cycled through periods of depression and anxiety and I have always tried to not let this have an impact on my professional and personal life. It is a consequence of a capable mind.</p><p> </p><p>I do not qualify for student funding because I already have an English degree, there are no scholarships available to me and banks do not provide finance for education programmes of this length. It is important to acknowledge that, whilst my english degree was stimulating and did open up some avenues into employment, it has not been so immersive as to task or occupy my mind. This is something of a problem for me because of the high functioning nature of my depression and anxiety. In terms of the science access diploma, and the work that stems from it, I've found that it is so immersive it almost leaves me with a sense of feeling normal, whatever normal is. Still, I have never had this before, in my entire life. I still have to be careful, as I still experience feelings of anxiety and panic, thoughts that I am failing, I'm a disappointment to my friends and family and that I'm letting everyone down. But it is knowing that what I'm doing is bigger than me, that one day some part I've played in a scientific process will ease or cure a person's suffering, that it will go unnoticed, people will never know of my involvement and never should because it is not of important. Performance of a thankless task, somehow, makes my mental illness bearable.</p><p> </p><p>Three years ago I experienced a mental breakdown. Since then I have worked hard to get back to something resembling normality, whilst continuing to manage the depression and anxiety. More importantly, I have also faced up to something I have never really been truthful with myself before, the reality that this illness is part of who I am. From this experience I have had to re-evaluate who I am, what I do and what is necessary. I am not the only person in my family to be afflicted with mental illness, but I am one of the few who are still here, fighting everyday to survive it. </p><p> </p><p>On my best days, I find being around large groups of people, busy situations or loud environments intolerable. Sixth form/further education colleges have a large cohort of enthusiastic sixteen year olds, which guaranteed that at every turn I would find everything that would pose me difficulty. Now at university, the people are not as boisterous, but the number of people is much greater. During my time at college, and currently at university, no matter how depressed I am, how unworthy I feel for the opportunity to be on the course, how the paranoia has me believing that everyone is laughing at me, how the anxiety is sometimes so bad I feel like I cannot breath or how I secrete myself in empty classrooms to avoid the people and the noise, I think about dad’s eczema, how it grinds him down, how it maddens him, and I know I have to finish what I have started.</p><p> </p><p>Very few things are achieved by the efforts of one person. Most things are collaborative and there are people I must thank. Lee Chapman, Phil Pritchard, Lucy Wood and Simon Kemp are members of Middlesbrough College’s science faculty who, whilst providing me with a first class education this year, have supported me during my lowest points. Adam Mendum and Lance Julian have been an amazing source of knowledge, experience and support for this campaign, as well as producing the film that accompanies it. I must thank my friends, Martin and Andrea Hirst, Craig and Dusty Reed, Francesca &amp; David Fox-Holmes, Gavin &amp; Faye Jasinek-Smith, Nick and Marie Scott, Martin &amp; Claire Wright, Jackie Steven, Kirsty &amp; Adam Clarke, and Steven Brown, who have all stood for me when I could not stand for myself. Throughout this my mum and dad have been willing me on, not for my dad’s sake but because they know it is better for me to not lock myself away from the world. Most importantly, the single most important person is my wife, Sarah, for whom there will never be enough words, not a sentence, a phrase, or dirty limerick to describe her. She is greater than the sum of her virtues and the person I aspire to be (only without the lady bits).</p><p> </p><p>And then there are all of you.</p><p> </p><p>Whilst my need is to discover how to make my dad better, we all have an ageing relative who requires treatment for something. So, whilst I want to make this happen I know such things are inspired by our collective need and achieved by our collaborative power. Billions of people I have never met and, most likely, never will, have the power to push forward with this wildly arrogant idea, that as we continue to live longer and longer we do so free from illnesses that are withering to our bodies and minds. Dad has always been an independent and industrious chap, doing things for himself, learning what he has needed along the way to get through life. I suppose I share his spirit. People should be the most productive and healthy versions of themselves, living with the utmost dignity. We must learn the science of what the human body is genetically programmed to do, so we can understand what causes its functions to shut down. The information that Biogerontologist obtain has potential for use in any field of medicine, which, potentially, should liberate millions of people from diseases and conditions, whether they be age related or not.</p><p> </p><p>A recent consultation with a dermatologist has resulted in a change of medication that has brought dad some relief, he is not free of the condition because there is no known cure, and he still experiences flare ups.</p><p>Please help me to continue... No donation is too small! </p><p> </p><p><strong>FAQs.</strong></p><p><strong>Why should I get something for nothing, when other students have to take out loans?</strong></p><p>Ever since I first contemplated using crowd funding to further my education I have considered how I can make this a zero cost sum. I discussed this with Sarah and we both observed the following points.</p><p>·      Once I am qualified and get my first paying job, I intend to pay forward 9% of anything earned over £21,000 into this fund so that it may, one day, benefit someone else.</p><p>·      This is inline with the current repayment rates for student loans.</p><p>·      We considered the spirit of those who want to help and contribute to the health and prosperity of others, and understand that such contributions are not made on the proviso that they see their money returned. In fact, some people consider this improper, as it undermines the spirit in which the money was first proffered.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Have I tried to get a student loan?</strong></p><p>Yes, I have applied for a student loan and have been notified by the student loan company that I am not eligible.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are you not eligible?</strong></p><p>I have completed an English honours degree. Of itself it is a very interesting and mind expanding subject. Because I took out a student loan for this degree, for which I have paid back some of that existing loan, I cannot get another.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Have I considered applying for a position in a European university where tuition is free?</strong></p><p>There are a few problems with this:</p><p>·      The main obstacle to this is that my parents are dependent on me for a number of their routines. If I did go, this is something that could be supported by other family members.</p><p>·      A few years ago my dad took a tumble and ended up in hospital. When I got to the hospital and found out he had broken his nose we all had a laugh about it. But on the way there I was a mess. In January this year dad was admitted to hospital for a heart problem, for which he was fitted with a pacemaker. If that call ever comes again, I don’t want to be six hundred miles away.</p><p>·      I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression. Sarah would support any ambition I have. But three years of intense study in a German university, without my family around me, would be a cost to my health that is difficult to predict. She has seen me in my lowest moments and knows how I react in situations of extended stress. This would only be compounded by the absence of my support network.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the extent of age related disease?</strong></p><p>The following list is by no means exhaustive, but includes the most prolific conditions that affect morbidity and mortality as we age.</p><p> </p><p>Histological Conditions:</p><p>Any condition that involves deterioration of cells, tissues, and by extension, organs.</p><p>Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Cancer.</p><p>Arthritis.</p><p>Osteoporosis.</p><p>Cataracts.</p><p>Your digestive system:</p><p>Constipation.</p><p>Diabetes.</p><p>Your bladder and urinary tract:</p><p>Urinary incontinence is common with aging. Diabetes can contribute to, as can menopause (women) and an enlarged prostate (men).</p><p>Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Respiratory Diseases:</p><p>Asthma.</p><p>Chronic Bronchitis.</p><p>Emphysema.</p><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>Influenza and Pneumonia:</p><p>Although the flu and pneumonia aren’t chronic conditions, these infections are among the top eight causes of death in people over age 65.</p><p>Adult onset sporadic ataxias:There are several disease categories:</p><p>toxic causes.</p><p>immune-mediated ataxias.</p><p>vitamin deficiency.</p><p>infectious diseases.</p><p>degenerative disorders.</p><p>genetic conditions.</p><p>Depression.</p><p>Current studies suggest that depression can be affected by bacteria in the gut. With older people having less money, and consequently a poorer diet, it is possible that depression in the elderly could be improved by making gut bacteria more resilient.</p><p>Poverty</p><p>Poverty affects senior health if you're unable to afford doctor visits, medication for chronic conditions, and other essential senior healthcare needs.</p><p>The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with aging (increases exponentially with age, in the case of cancer).</p><p> </p><p><strong>How will the funders be kept informed during and after the campaign?</strong></p><p>We will be sending all of our supporters updates through our Indiegogo page and via email to the email address you have provided when signing up to the Indiegogo site.

All money raised will go towards my tuition fees and travelling costs. If the fund does not achieve the final goal, we will use the money that has been donated to pay what we can and then achieve the rest of the goal by activating plan B. Plan B is to sell our house and my parents’ will also sell their home. We will buy a house to accommodate all of the family, with a percentage of the money from the sale of my parents’ house being used to pay the rest of my tuition fees.</p><p> </p><p><strong>If the project reaches it goal, what will happen to any extra donations?</strong></p><p>Any extra money made above the target will go straight into research of age related diseases via SENs or CDRF.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When will the perks be delivered?</strong></p><p>We start delivering perks and give more information and details on the delivery after the campaign.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Have you ever donated money to other people’s campaigns before considering funding for yourself?</strong></p><p>Yes, we have. We have donated small amounts of money to a number of very select causes. We would love to give more and distribute it more broadly because there are many more causes we are touched by than our miniscule amount of disposable money can stretch to. We have also raised money for Mind, diabetes UK, cancer research, Daisy Chain and the NSPCC.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks and Challenges:</strong></p><p>The challenge of full time education and the demands of higher education in relation to my mental illness.</p><p> </p><p>The challenge of being in a much busier environment in relation to my mental illness.</p><p> </p><p>Because part of my psychological make up includes Imposter Syndrome, I attribute little to no worth to anything I do. It is my hope that by studying this subject from the ground up I will be earning my place at the table with all those other people in the scientific sector. It is no guarantee that I will transcend my feelings of inadequacy, but I will have gained the knowledge and experience to prove it, and with the occasional nudge from Sarah I will be more inclined to recognise this status.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other ways you can help:</strong></p><p>Please,  spread the word.</p></div>","What does the Ending Illness campaign hope to achieve?Hello.My name is David Brown, I’m 45 years old and I am married to Sarah.  My father, who is in his eighties, has developed a number of medical conditions that are normally attributed to growing older.

Billions of people I have never met and, most likely, never will, have the power to push forward with this wildly arrogant idea, that as we continue to live longer and longer we do so free from illnesses that are withering to our bodies and minds. Dad has always been an independent and industrious chap, doing things for himself, learning what he has needed along the way to get through life. I suppose I share his spirit. People should be the most productive and healthy versions of themselves, living with the utmost dignity. We must learn the science of what the human body is genetically programmed to do, so we can understand what causes its functions to shut down. The information that Biogerontologist obtain has potential for use in any field of medicine, which, potentially, should liberate millions of people from diseases and conditions, whether they be age related or not. A recent consultation with a dermatologist has resulted in a change of medication that has brought dad some relief, he is not free of the condition because there is no known cure, and he still experiences flare ups.Please help me to continue... No donation is too small!  FAQs.Why should I get something for nothing, when other students have to take out loans?Ever since I first contemplated using crowd funding to further my education I have considered how I can make this a zero cost sum. I discussed this with Sarah and we both observed the following points.·      Once I am qualified and get my first paying job, I intend to pay forward 9% of anything earned over £21,000 into this fund so that it may, one day, benefit someone else.·      This is inline with the current repayment rates for student loans.·      We considered the spirit of those who want to help and contribute to the health and prosperity of others, and understand that such contributions are not made on the proviso that they see their money returned. In fact, some people consider this improper, as it undermines the spirit in which the money was first proffered. Have I tried to get a student loan?Yes, I have applied for a student loan and have been notified by the student loan company that I am not eligible. Why are you not eligible?I have completed an English honours degree. Of itself it is a very interesting and mind expanding subject. Because I took out a student loan for this degree, for which I have paid back some of that existing loan, I cannot get another. Have I considered applying for a position in a European university where tuition is free?There are a few problems with this:·      The main obstacle to this is that my parents are dependent on me for a number of their routines. If I did go, this is something that could be supported by other family members.·      A few years ago my dad took a tumble and ended up in hospital. When I got to the hospital and found out he had broken his nose we all had a laugh about it. But on the way there I was a mess. In January this year dad was admitted to hospital for a heart problem, for which he was fitted with a pacemaker. If that call ever comes again, I don’t want to be six hundred miles away.·      I suffer from chronic anxiety and depression. Sarah would support any ambition I have. But three years of intense study in a German university, without my family around me, would be a cost to my health that is difficult to predict. She has seen me in my lowest moments and knows how I react in situations of extended stress. This would only be compounded by the absence of my support network. What is the extent of age related disease?The following list is by no means exhaustive, but includes the most prolific conditions that affect morbidity and mortality as we age. Histological Conditions:Any condition that involves deterioration of cells, tissues, and by extension, organs.Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Cancer.Arthritis.Osteoporosis.Cataracts.Your digestive system:Constipation.Diabetes.Your bladder and urinary tract:Urinary incontinence is common with aging. Diabetes can contribute to, as can menopause (women) and an enlarged prostate (men).Alzheimer's disease.Respiratory Diseases:Asthma.Chronic Bronchitis.Emphysema.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Influenza and Pneumonia:Although the flu and pneumonia aren’t chronic conditions, these infections are among the top eight causes of death in people over age 65.Adult onset sporadic ataxias:There are several disease categories:toxic causes.immune-mediated ataxias.vitamin deficiency.infectious diseases.degenerative disorders.genetic conditions.Depression.Current studies suggest that depression can be affected by bacteria in the gut. With older people having less money, and consequently a poorer diet, it is possible that depression in the elderly could be improved by making gut bacteria more resilient.PovertyPoverty affects senior health if you're unable to afford doctor visits, medication for chronic conditions, and other essential senior healthcare needs.The incidence of all of these diseases increases rapidly with aging (increases exponentially with age, in the case of cancer). How will the funders be kept informed during and after the campaign?We will be sending all of our supporters updates through our Indiegogo page and via email to the email address you have provided when signing up to the Indiegogo site. We will also post updates on our Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/?stype=lo&amp;amp;jlou...... If the project doesn't reach its funding goal, what will happen?This is a Flexible Campaign which means that even if we don’t reach our goal, I will still receive all the funds raised. All money raised will go towards my tuition fees and travelling costs. If the fund does not achieve the final goal, we will use the money that has been donated to pay what we can and then achieve the rest of the goal by activating plan B. Plan B is to sell our house and my parents’ will also sell their home. We will buy a house to accommodate all of the family, with a percentage of the money from the sale of my parents’ house being used to pay the rest of my tuition fees. If the project reaches it goal, what will happen to any extra donations?Any extra money made above the target will go straight into research of age related diseases via SENs or CDRF. When will the perks be delivered?We start delivering perks and give more information and details on the delivery after the campaign. Have you ever donated money to other people’s campaigns before considering funding for yourself?Yes, we have. We have donated small amounts of money to a number of very select causes. We would love to give more and distribute it more broadly because there are many more causes we are touched by than our miniscule amount of disposable money can stretch to. We have also raised money for Mind, diabetes UK, cancer research, Daisy Chain and the NSPCC. Risks and Challenges:The challenge of full time education and the demands of higher education in relation to my mental illness. The challenge of being in a much busier environment in relation to my mental illness. Because part of my psychological make up includes Imposter Syndrome, I attribute little to no worth to anything I do. It is my hope that by studying this subject from the ground up I will be earning my place at the table with all those other people in the scientific sector. It is no guarantee that I will transcend my feelings of inadequacy, but I will have gained the knowledge and experience to prove it, and with the occasional nudge from Sarah I will be more inclined to recognise this status. Other ways you can help:Please,  spread the word.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Realistically speaking we

regularly reported to you, our loyal supporters, and publicized via the media

objectives.  The research program was
especially designed to be conducted piecemeal, in a flexible and modular

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The precise long-term
advantages of supporting the Zero Project are not easily quantified.<span>  <b>But look at the benefits numerous generations
of our ancestors have derived from progress over the centuries from exploring
the frontiers of science.  The zero digit
has been instrumental in breakthroughs in mathematics, science and technology
for reasons still not well-understood. 
</b>Why did the concept of emptiness play such a pivotal role in the mindset
of modernity?  The Zero Project aims to
tackle that and related issues with its novel working hypotheses, plural,
combined with a systematic approach to the research required, which frankly has
never been done to date, baffling as that may be.  But better late than never, as the old adage
goes.  The ZerOrigIndia Foundation has
sound reason to assume that this strategy will pay off in spades.  Some of the reasons are rather technical, but
are related to cutting-edge research in the field of modern physics.  Lest this sound remote from our immediate personal
lives, the very insight that has led to the proposed research program also
holds the potential of paving the way to crossing new thresholds by questioning
old paradigms that have outlived their usefulness.  <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470901029/bronkhorst_dquzd9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

the project.  We have very experienced
academics on board, who are quite familiar with how such research projects are
run.  The challenges would be more in the
nature of tackling the central objective of finding fresh evidence of the
origin of the zero digit in India.  But
there, too, it bodes well that one of the few acknowledged authorities on
ancient Indian mathematics and astronomy, Prof. K. Ramasubramaniam, associated
with one of India’s most renowned research institutes IIT Bombay, has taken on this
challenge.  Prof Ramasubramaniam recently
participated in a meeting organized by a French think-tank, to inform the Dalai
Lama in Dharmsala (India) about his subject.

virtuoso Indian-style violinist accompanied on tabla by a master musician --
apropos the Indian theme.  The perks as
well as a number of introductory videos to the campaign may be sampled on our
website: www.zerorigindia.org.  Dr Annette will also keep a regular blog to update you on latest developments while hot on zero's trail.  Follow the blow by blow account from Bombay.
What if?
Realistically speaking we
cannot expect to raise all of the funds required until 2020 during the present
crowdfunding campaign alone.  But we will
go for the InDemand option on Indiegogo to get as far as we can.  We will see to it that we set the bar as high
as reasonable and push the research program as far as possible with the
resources available.  The results will be
regularly reported to you, our loyal supporters, and publicized via the media
and educational system for the benefit of posterity, as per our formal Foundation
objectives.  The research program was
especially designed to be conducted piecemeal, in a flexible and modular
manner, whenever required.  Together we
will set the stage and the pace, which can always be resumed at a later date,
the tried and tested scientific method. 
Nothing is lost but much is gained by fixing the intended horizon.  

The Impact
The precise long-term
advantages of supporting the Zero Project are not easily quantified.  But look at the benefits numerous generations
of our ancestors have derived from progress over the centuries from exploring
the frontiers of science.  The zero digit
has been instrumental in breakthroughs in mathematics, science and technology
for reasons still not well-understood. 
Why did the concept of emptiness play such a pivotal role in the mindset
of modernity?  The Zero Project aims to
tackle that and related issues with its novel working hypotheses, plural,
combined with a systematic approach to the research required, which frankly has
never been done to date, baffling as that may be.  But better late than never, as the old adage
goes.  The ZerOrigIndia Foundation has
sound reason to assume that this strategy will pay off in spades.  Some of the reasons are rather technical, but
are related to cutting-edge research in the field of modern physics.  Lest this sound remote from our immediate personal
lives, the very insight that has led to the proposed research program also
holds the potential of paving the way to crossing new thresholds by questioning
old paradigms that have outlived their usefulness.  
Emeritus Professor Johannes Bronkhorst, Indologist, University of Lausanne


  ""Unfortunately little is known about the origin of this digit. Strong 
indicators point to India, but research so far has done little beyond giving us 
some rough idea as to the date when this digit came into use (or had come into 
use). It has not so far explained what intellectual context provided the 
background and/or context that made this momentous invention 
possible.""If research sponsored by the ZerOrigIndia 
Foundation will shed light on this last question, not only Indologists and 
historians of mathematics will be grateful. Understanding how and why the great 
inventions were made that made modern science and technology possible, concerns 
all mankind. And the invention of zero certainly ranks among the 
greatest.""
Our track record
The ZerOrigIndia Foundation is
a newly established Dutch-based nonprofit. 
However, all of our Trustees individually and together have decades of
experience in various walks of life, including in the sciences, the humanities,
the arts and business world, that insures balanced and pragmatic policies calculated
to lead to the desired results.  In
addition, we enjoy the unstinting support from our wider support network, our
Committee of Recommendation and Advisory Committee comprising, former
ambassadors and reputed academics, who have all endorsed the Zero Project over
the past two years or longer.  At our
formal launch in May of this year, the Ambassador of India in the Netherlands
welcomed the initiative and considered it to be important (excerpts of his address in the video gallery on Indiegogo).  Full details may be found on the ‘About Us’
page of our website and Facebook.  We
also have the stamp of approval from the very exacting Dutch Tax Office, which
after a demanding application procedure granted the ZerOrigIndia Foundation
nonprofit status under Dutch law and keeping a close tabs.

Risks & Challenges
As far as risks are concerned,
perhaps an academic research program is not subject to risks faced in trade and
commerce, and so may be less applicable to the Zero Project.  The ZerOrigIndia Foundation only facilitates
the project.  We have very experienced
academics on board, who are quite familiar with how such research projects are
run.  The challenges would be more in the
nature of tackling the central objective of finding fresh evidence of the
origin of the zero digit in India.  But
there, too, it bodes well that one of the few acknowledged authorities on
ancient Indian mathematics and astronomy, Prof. K. Ramasubramaniam, associated
with one of India’s most renowned research institutes IIT Bombay, has taken on this
challenge.  Prof Ramasubramaniam recently
participated in a meeting organized by a French think-tank, to inform the Dalai
Lama in Dharmsala (India) about his subject. 
There are numerous You Tube videos available of his popular lectures.Risks have been kept to a minimum!  Dividing by zero is a no-no.

Other Ways You Can Help
As mentioned above, don’t
think of yourself as a donor, but stakeholder! 
This project belongs to everyone who opts to participate in whatever way
deemed appropriate.  It would help a lot
if you would sign the website petition free of charge (home page), but also if
you would network on our behalf to recruit participants for the upcoming Camp
Zero 2016 session in India this Fall. 
The recruitment document is posted on the ‘Crowdsourcing’ page of
the website.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Garvin Reid and I would like to introduce you to LiveteachingTV.</p>
<p>As an Educator, one of my pet peeves is the unavailability of free public education to all. I understand some of the challenges that make this seem impossible. However, I noticed that despite the disparity in our global socioeconomic  lifestyles, ""In 2014, nearly 60 percent of the population worldwide already owned a mobile phone,"" (<a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Statista.com</a>) For me, every one of those users should be literate, informed, and have some form of education, preferably to at least high school level. Unfortunately, that's not the case. But it can be!</p>
<p>""According to UNESCO, in the world today there are about<strong> 1 billion non-literate adults</strong>. This 1 billion is approximately <strong>26 percent of the world's adult population</strong>. <i>Women make up two-thirds of all non-literates.</i> <u>98 percent of all non-literates live in developing countries."" </u>(Emphasis, mine). Source: <a href=""http://www-01.sil.org/literacy/LitFacts.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SIL International</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some other facts gathered from their website and UNESCO's:</p>
<ul>
<li>52 percent of all non-literates live in India,  sub-Saharan Africa and China.</li>
<li>In all developing countries, the percentage of children aged 6-11 not attending school is 15 percent</li>
<li>Of the world's non-literate population, an estimated 476 million are speakers of lesser-known languages. In other words, approximately 50 percent of all non-literates are minority language speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>UNESCO defines literacy as having the ""<i>ability to read and write with understanding a simple statement related to one’s daily life. It involves a continuum of reading and writing skills, and often includes basic arithmetic skills (numeracy)</i>.""</p>
<p>Here is another interesting fact gathered from the <a href=""http://www.worlded.org/WEIInternet/us/adult-ed-facts.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Education</a> website: In the <strong>United States of America</strong> (a developed country) over 30 million adults do not have a high school diploma. Need I say more?</p>
<p>The reality is that we cannot walk on the moon, build bridges, cure diseases, build platforms like Indiegogo and Facebook, without some form of education. Yet, only <a href=""http://www.collegeamerica.edu/blog/who-in-the-world-holds-a-college-degree"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">6.7% of the world population</a> have a college degree. And the higher the degree, the smaller the percentage gets.</p>

<p>My dream is to see an interactive, online learning platform where educators, passionate about spreading their knowledge, meet with equally passionate seekers of knowledge via live streaming. This can happen at any time, at any level, from anywhere in the world. There are no barriers to entry. This is a lofty idea, I know. But it is doable. We may not be able to reach everyone. But it won't stop us from trying.</p>
<p><i>Statistics also show there is a gender gap across generations. LiveteachingTV will level the playing field, making education available to ALL.</i></p>
<p>Presently, we have great institutions with websites such as Coursera, Udemy, and Lynda.com. However, many times students get stuck and don’t have an opportunity to raise their hands in the classroom to get immediate answers to problems they are facing. Not only that, these websites mostly caters to individuals who already have some form of education, which is usually a high school diploma.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476155475/ee3o91inpchqfwskokfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is where LiveteachingTV comes in. The LiveteachingTV platform will facilitate learning at <strong>every level,</strong> including those who simply want to learn <u>how to read and write</u>. LiveteachingTV will have instructors who have the patience and understanding necessary to teach beginners, yet the know-how to work with intermediates, and even share ideas among their peers.</p>
<p>LiveteachingTV will bring to the Internet what has been lacking from the other streaming platforms offering online courses: the excitement a teacher feels when he or she knows a student has finally grasped the material. LiveteachingTV will bring structure to the self-paced viewer who wants to solve the problem himself, but who is thankful you, the teacher, are there to help guide him along the right path. With LiveteachingTV, knowledge can easily flow in both directions, giving meaning to the interaction. For example, a teacher can have a Question and Answer session. This would truly connect both viewer and instructor.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476155677/qdprbhonxx9qlbth2dgn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I am excited about the new vistas we can reach through technology in education. I believe this website could be a potentially very valuable resource for all different levels of learners around the world. They say knowledge is power and that the Internet has connected the world, so if we connect the right teachers with willing students, we can empower a large population of the world.</p>
<p>With my dedicated team including <i>Joan Gumbs, Chidi Osirike, and Christopher Murray,</i> plus an ensemble of web developers and designers, we will put together a platform that is not only functional, but also aesthetically pleasing, giving UI/UX that equals and surpasses other players in the industry. We will market the idea to our target audience, which is basically everyone who has a passion for lifelong learning, and a passion to share knowledge. Once we have all the players in place, we will launch LiveteachingTV to the world, circa late November, early December.</p>
<p>We are open to investors and donors. By getting involved in our campaign, you are literally giving the endless gift of knowledge. Once we have the essential infrastructure that will facilitate teachers streaming their content live from anywhere in the world, the site will more or less run itself. Yes, there will be some required initial screening for “professionals” and the continual screening for potential inappropriate or incorrect material.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476155625/annblrykcfoinvjfmrti.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The vision is for LiveteachingTV to be like Twitch, in terms of its infrastructure, except, instead of gaming, streamers will be teaching subjects like Mathematics and English. On Liveteaching.tv viewers will be able to actively engage and ask their teachers questions as though they were sitting in a classroom. Students will be able to watch teachers solve Mathematical problems, enabling them to learn faster. Once done, the streams will be available as videos for download, where they can watch over and over again, until they have mastered the subject.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get up and running—i.e. design and build the platform for streamers and viewers, Liveteaching’s budget is: $50,000. We are starting small. We believe in creeping, before we walk.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476155813/raixcttzaqrcz8ubdtmr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our vision is to facilitate free education. Unfortunately, due to the maintenance of the site, and the fact teachers would want to receive some stipend for their service, we will have to charge  a subscription fee to access the site. However, initially the site will be FREE... But unlike Facebook, it won't always be.  As the site is new, we think it's only fair to make it available to you as we work out all kinks that will arise due to user engagement. We will gauge the stability of the site based on traffic, etc, and will monitor to ensure the site works as it should and our viewers and streamers are satisfied. We will try to keep it FREE for at least the first three months.</p>
<p>When we do start charging a subscription fee it won't be more than $20 per month. A $20/month subscription, is ""doable,"" for most, if not all seekers of knowledge. This is significantly less than the cost of lunch and bus fare for one student in a developing country. We promise that the subscription fee will never increase. We will find other avenues for funding, if the need should ever arise for us to need additional funding. We will even offer a 30-day FREE trial!</p>
<p>As the user-base increases, the site is going to need to hire moderators. Other personnel that will initially be hired to get this project off the ground include <i>graphic designers, website developers, marketers, public relations, an accountant, and an attorney for legalities.</i></p>
<p>This is an ideal time to make an investment in a website that could be world-changing, and could one day become a household name. By investing in LiveteachingTV, you are contributing to a website that will be beneficial to humanity, not to mention the added bonus of a potential return on your investment.</p>
<h3><strong>Here are some of the perks you will receive when you make a pledge:</strong></h3>

<p>Note:</p>
<p>If we reach and exceed our target; hooray! A big thank you, to you! This will allow us to build a site comparable to all the other great learning institutions online, and hire a marketing team to help spread the word across the globe.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our target. It’s still okay. The domain name is bought and the website is already hosted with GoDaddy. We won’t have Amazon’s powerful server, nor will we be able to facilitate a huge traffic to the site, but the mission will be carried out, even if it is with only two subjects: Mathematics and English—at different levels. Already, we have teachers available for these subjects.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to our website, which is presently a WordPress site: <a href=""http://liveteaching.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://liveteaching.tv</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>This project will make a difference in the world because it will connect passionate educators with people from less-privileged, more isolated backgrounds</i>. <strong>Think of the millions of people in developing nations who cannot read and write. </strong>And it’s not only a problem for developing nations. There is a prominent preacher who recently said on national television that he learned to read only a few years ago. He is from the United States of America--a developed country.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476157205/nsxwo1pwk3uvs3s68v67.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Education is very expensive in many parts of the world. </strong>Yet almost everyone has  mobile phone. Think of the possibilities. With the right technological know-how to set up the website, some marketing to make people aware of the new website, and some moderators to make sure the content is all legitimate, this could potentially be a ground-breaker in education. <i>There is no other website offering free live education at all levels right now, at least, not that we are aware of, and this project could be a tipping point in the world of education. </i>This website will have a huge economic and social impact on families the world over. We perish for lack of vision. Live education is the key to the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the benefits to this venture is that it is very low-risk, as it can always be guaranteed that there will be a high demand online for educational videos. That is our worst-case scenario.</p>
<p><strong>With no physical product to manufacture and drop ship, our greatest challenge is not being able to build the kind of website that could withstand an endless stream of traffic, and to pay the professionals, like web developers, who would be working to get Liveteaching up and running by late November, early December.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476160502/donokxh4kby570rkbbxs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>However, having a good marketing strategy would be key to involving the right kind of contributors and in informing the public of this new resource available to them on their phone. <i>This is the most important aspect of the business currently: developing a successful and far-reaching marketing and advertising campaign.</i></p>
<p><i>With the appropriate funds, </i><strong><i>in addition to building</i> the website, we hope to purchase the services of a marketing company with a well-established background in this sector to help us spread the word</strong>. We already have contacts, employees, students from all over the globe who are eager to see live teaching emerge as one of the new leaders in online education of the future. By utilizing our international contacts and focusing on our central goal to provide education to anyone, anywhere, I believe we are in a perfect time and place to launch this new venture.</p>

If we reach and exceed our target; hooray! A big thank you, to you! This will allow us to build a site comparable to all the other great learning institutions online, and hire a marketing team to help spread the word across the globe.
If we do not meet our target. It’s still okay. The domain name is bought and the website is already hosted with GoDaddy. We won’t have Amazon’s powerful server, nor will we be able to facilitate a huge traffic to the site, but the mission will be carried out, even if it is with only two subjects: Mathematics and English—at different levels. Already, we have teachers available for these subjects.
Here’s a link to our website, which is presently a WordPress site: http://liveteaching.tv

The Impact
This project will make a difference in the world because it will connect passionate educators with people from less-privileged, more isolated backgrounds. Think of the millions of people in developing nations who cannot read and write. And it’s not only a problem for developing nations. There is a prominent preacher who recently said on national television that he learned to read only a few years ago. He is from the United States of America--a developed country.

Education is very expensive in many parts of the world. Yet almost everyone has  mobile phone. Think of the possibilities. With the right technological know-how to set up the website, some marketing to make people aware of the new website, and some moderators to make sure the content is all legitimate, this could potentially be a ground-breaker in education. There is no other website offering free live education at all levels right now, at least, not that we are aware of, and this project could be a tipping point in the world of education. This website will have a huge economic and social impact on families the world over. We perish for lack of vision. Live education is the key to the future.

Risks & Challenges
One of the benefits to this venture is that it is very low-risk, as it can always be guaranteed that there will be a high demand online for educational videos. That is our worst-case scenario.
With no physical product to manufacture and drop ship, our greatest challenge is not being able to build the kind of website that could withstand an endless stream of traffic, and to pay the professionals, like web developers, who would be working to get Liveteaching up and running by late November, early December.

However, having a good marketing strategy would be key to involving the right kind of contributors and in informing the public of this new resource available to them on their phone. This is the most important aspect of the business currently: developing a successful and far-reaching marketing and advertising campaign.
With the appropriate funds, in addition to building the website, we hope to purchase the services of a marketing company with a well-established background in this sector to help us spread the word. We already have contacts, employees, students from all over the globe who are eager to see live teaching emerge as one of the new leaders in online education of the future. By utilizing our international contacts and focusing on our central goal to provide education to anyone, anywhere, I believe we are in a perfect time and place to launch this new venture.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b> Video Introduction to ACP Mobile Applications </b></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Workshop participants will earn an ACP Programming Certificate provided they attain standardized proficiency levels . The levels start at Novice, meaning the intern can develop an application with help using a template, and range to Expert, meaning the intern can develop an application from scratch (using open-source material if the wish).
ACP will provide and manage all the computing and training resources required to execute the program in Haiti. Application code developed under the program will be made publicly available as open-source material. ACP will seek, facilitate and encourage the support of the international open-source development community. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div><b>Program Impact </b></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Low cost computing devices are becoming commonplace in Haiti; however, very few software programs are written in the native Haitian Creole language. The full potential of the new technologies is not being realized, specifically in the areas of education. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div><b>What We Need &amp; Why </b></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">ACP estimates the startup costs for the program will be $72,000. This includes development of the training curriculum, the cost of the one month workshop for 24 individuals, a three month paid internship for 8 interns, and the cost of the required equipment. ACP has committed $24,000 to this program. We have already started setting up the program so we need your help to keep going. 
Funds will be spent in the following areas: </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><ol>
<li>Intern Training &amp; Work Center with Internet Connectivity</li>
<li>Tablets, Computers and Supplies</li>
<li>Intern Monthly Stipends</li>
<li>Program Staff</li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Long Term Sustainment Strategy </b><br/>

</div></div>","A Connected Planet Foundation is starting an internship program in Haiti to teach
college students and interested professionals how to develop software
applications. The interns will assist ACP in the development of electronic book
and education applications to run on Android mobile computing devices. 






 

We are raising funds to start the program by conducting a one month training Workshop in Port au Prince for 24 people followed by a 3 month paid internship for the 8 most qualified individuals who attend the Workshop. 




This program is being done in partnership with Ecole Supérieure d'Infotronique d'Haìti (ESIH) in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. ESIH is one of the leading universities in Haiti offering courses and advance degrees in Information Technology. We have also partnered with the Friends of Matènwa and the Matènwa Community Learning Center who will be providing educational content for our program.  

 

   


Example ACP Mobile Applications 
The workshop and our intern program is a direct extension of work already being performed by ACP in Haiti. We have over a dozen education applications available, free-of-charge, for Android devices on Google Play™ and in iTunes for Apple iOS devices. All of our applications are in Haitian Creole or a combination of Creole, French and English. Haitian teachers have helped design our apps. We are currently working on a series of applications which follow the Haitian National Curriculum standards. 

     

 Video Introduction to ACP Mobile Applications 

Workshop participants will earn an ACP Programming Certificate provided they attain standardized proficiency levels . The levels start at Novice, meaning the intern can develop an application with help using a template, and range to Expert, meaning the intern can develop an application from scratch (using open-source material if the wish).
ACP will provide and manage all the computing and training resources required to execute the program in Haiti. Application code developed under the program will be made publicly available as open-source material. ACP will seek, facilitate and encourage the support of the international open-source development community. 

Program Impact 
Low cost computing devices are becoming commonplace in Haiti; however, very few software programs are written in the native Haitian Creole language. The full potential of the new technologies is not being realized, specifically in the areas of education. 

What We Need & Why 
ACP estimates the startup costs for the program will be $72,000. This includes development of the training curriculum, the cost of the one month workshop for 24 individuals, a three month paid internship for 8 interns, and the cost of the required equipment. ACP has committed $24,000 to this program. We have already started setting up the program so we need your help to keep going. 
Funds will be spent in the following areas: 

Intern Training & Work Center with Internet Connectivity
Tablets, Computers and Supplies
Intern Monthly Stipends
Program Staff


Long Term Sustainment Strategy 

The ACP Foundation's long term goal is to transition our entire training program to qualified institutions in Haiti for execution as a profit making enterprise. ACP's ongoing role would be to provide scholarships to deserving individuals to participate in the program and to provide guidance on education content to be developed by interns.

The mission is to instill these biblical values and concepts that are the foundation for acquiring successful, interpersonal relationships and productive living.<br/></p>

<br/><p></p>When it comes to EDUCATION, Huntsville Christian Academy utilizes an exceptional technique, thus providing cutting-edge education with emphasis on teaching responsibility, integrity, and character to every child. 

	
		
		
	
	
		<p>The learning curriculum specializes in the educational concept of A.C.E--
ACCELERATED CHRISTIAN EDUCATION--to produce academic excellence.<br/>
This unique method derives from five basic laws of learning that prepare, strengthen, and allow students to
individually progress and excel--at their OWN performance level. <br/></p>

<p>HCA's main building (the first expansion from a smaller facility) was built in 2001.</p>
<br/><br/>At Huntsville Christian Academy, each child has a lesson plan designed to meet his or her academic needs. Every new student is given a diagnostic test that allows us to custom fit each child with his/her curriculum. The student is then prescribed lessons around the particular subject needing mastery. In addition, each child is afforded personalized, one-on-one instruction from a highly-dedicated and trained staff. Lesson plans are not developed for an entire class to be lock-stepped together. Once again, EACH CHILD IS AN INDIVIDUAL. Because no two children are the same, they learn at different paces and are educated on different levels. Ultimately, there’s no pressure to be ahead, but no restraint from
getting ahead!

<span>In 1993, founder/director, Pastor Reggie Whiddon, was driving
along Interstate 25 in Colorado Springs, CO, when God gave him a vision (now HCA) that inspired him to start a Christian
preparatory school to instill character and integrity into the lives of as many children as he able to reach.
Without any funds, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whiddon embarked on this mission, having to start with what they
had---five children. For the first five months they proceeded to have ""school"" in their home and once
people started hearing of this ""vision"", they began to contribute, turning HCA into the reality it is today.
The Lord helped pave the way for HCA with a blessing of a $10,000 contribution, and it was off to new heights from there!<br/></span>

		is a K-12 preparatory school that provides quality, personalized,
tailored education from a Christian perspective. Cultivated and established almost 23 years ago by founder/director Pastor Reggie, and his wife Cathy Whiddon, Huntsville Christian Academy was transpired on the belief that God gave the home and the church the responsibility to educate children, therefore, Huntsville Christian Academy's main philosophy is to teach children to view and live life through biblical principles and to expose each child to these character-building principles that will last a lifetime. The mission is to instill these biblical values and concepts that are the foundation for acquiring successful, interpersonal relationships and productive living.

Pastor Reggie and Cathy Whiddon in front of  HCA campus
When it comes to EDUCATION, Huntsville Christian Academy utilizes an exceptional technique, thus providing cutting-edge education with emphasis on teaching responsibility, integrity, and character to every child. 

	
		
		
	
	
		The learning curriculum specializes in the educational concept of A.C.E--
ACCELERATED CHRISTIAN EDUCATION--to produce academic excellence.
This unique method derives from five basic laws of learning that prepare, strengthen, and allow students to
individually progress and excel--at their OWN performance level. 

HCA's main building (the first expansion from a smaller facility) was built in 2001.
At Huntsville Christian Academy, each child has a lesson plan designed to meet his or her academic needs. Every new student is given a diagnostic test that allows us to custom fit each child with his/her curriculum. The student is then prescribed lessons around the particular subject needing mastery. In addition, each child is afforded personalized, one-on-one instruction from a highly-dedicated and trained staff. Lesson plans are not developed for an entire class to be lock-stepped together. Once again, EACH CHILD IS AN INDIVIDUAL. Because no two children are the same, they learn at different paces and are educated on different levels. Ultimately, there’s no pressure to be ahead, but no restraint from
getting ahead!

	








In 1993, founder/director, Pastor Reggie Whiddon, was driving
along Interstate 25 in Colorado Springs, CO, when God gave him a vision (now HCA) that inspired him to start a Christian
preparatory school to instill character and integrity into the lives of as many children as he able to reach.
Without any funds, Mr. & Mrs. Whiddon embarked on this mission, having to start with what they
had---five children. For the first five months they proceeded to have ""school"" in their home and once
people started hearing of this ""vision"", they began to contribute, turning HCA into the reality it is today.
The Lord helped pave the way for HCA with a blessing of a $10,000 contribution, and it was off to new heights from there!



Article written in 1994 by Huntsville Times on HCA's first big expansion/relocation to West Park.

Huntsville Christian Academy has been a
project of faith and obedience to God, and because HCA was birthed by God's vision through Pastor Reggie Whiddon, He has continued to bless the school for over 22 years now resulting in tremendous growth and an outstanding reputation throughout the Southeast. 



The first class in 1994 on opening day at the original Old Madison Pike campus.



Huntsville Christian Academy's current campus, the main building facilitates 120 students (K-12) in seven classrooms. In addition, there is a full size high school
gymnasium, playground, lunchroom and chapel for assemblies.




The playground is located between the main building and the gymnasium. 


The gymnasium/auditorium was built in 2004.


As an accomplished result of previous expansion, Huntsville Christian Academy
currently enrolls 110 students, 44 of which are in grades 9-12. 



High school class of 2015.

ONCE AGAIN, our growth has been overwhelming but a blessing, indeed! We are limited in space and have reached our capacity. We MUST expand our facilities to educate more children!
In order to continue our mission we must acquire additional property and construct other buildings to
accommodate the demanding need that only an Accelerated Christian Education can provide. 


With your support, we can accomplish
this miraculous but realistic vision. We already acquire the right philosophy of education, the right curriculum, and 23 years of
experience. ALL WE NEED NOW IS A CONTRIBUTION FROM YOU!!
 PLEASE, HELP PAVE THE WAY 4 HCA and make this EXTENDED vision of
expansion become another SUCCESS!!! Our goal of $7M will build a first-class facility that will give us the capability to receive the anticipated growth
of those families seeking a higher, more virtuous education for their children...maybe even yours. We must be prepared
for this growth. WILL YOU HELP US??!!
 Our
vision is not limited to a set building or frame, but a belief that what God knows we
need will be provided and our structures will be built from those provisions. In
order for this to occur, we have set up a three phase plan to break down the
use of expenses as goals are reached, as well as help update everyone on the
building process. 




A wide angle view of our current property and the property we desire to purchase.




In order for us to expand, purchasing land is our first priority. Currently there are three properties that we intend to acquire through this campaign. In phase one, our goal is to acquire one of the targeted pieces of land as well as start renovations on the current building. Our current campus is located in Research Park West in a prestigious business complex with three available adjoining properties.



Our current campus and the adjoining properties we desire to purchase.  






We believe that Biblical based
education is something that our community needs. With your contributions, you
are making it so that Huntsville Christian Academy can open the door to more
students in our community, as well as provide better facilities for our current
student body. Each student that comes into our school is afforded a curriculum
designed to their needs and focused on Biblical and moral values. It is those
values that present and future generations need. We want to make a change in
the world and it starts with helping bring up the next generation in the right
setting.When goals are met, we will be able to accommodate more than 500 students. That will quadruple our current enrollment, allowing for more children to receive personalized Christian education.

<h3>Our Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>Maker’s Asylum is Mumbai’s first maker space which gives just about anyone the opportunity to learn, use the tools, and build things.</p>
<p>We started about two years ago, operating from a closet-sized <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ0ZtF5wYFY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">garage</a> in the suburbs. We had one 3D Printer, power and hand tools that were donated by well-wishers. We had a handful of members that gathered to build tables, simple machines and toyed around with electronics. People started to share knowledge and materials to build projects together. Soon, this casual bunch of DIY enthusiasts grew to a sizeable group of members who didn’t fit in the room any longer. </p>
<p>Entrepreneurs joined in and used the space to develop their prototypes since it was cost-effective. Students milled in so that they could practically use what they had studied in school.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FeJ0ZtF5wYFY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeJ0ZtF5wYFY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FeJ0ZtF5wYFY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Family</h3> <p></p>
<p>Maker's Asylum recently registered as a not-for-profit organisation. For the last six months, our space has been sponsored by a well-wisher design school. Here, we organise regular workshops so students can learn more thoroughly. We offer talks by industry experts so the community can have access to them and their real-world experiences. <span>We encourage build-groups so that the community can put their different skills to test by building something wonderful together</span>. The space also allows small start-ups to build their ideas and crowd-source tips from the community. </p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Currently, we are a community of 140 members with 500 footfalls from curious minds every month and 6,000 social media supporters.</i></p> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>The good part is that we’ve ignited the Maker Movement in India. The bad part — we’ve lost the space we’ve called home for the last six months. The design school that let us use a portion of their cafeteria for our activities needs us to vacate. We have till <span><span>August 31</span>.</span></p>
<p>In order to continue feeding the hungry community of Makers, we need to find a new space to rent, and soon!</p>
<p>For our community, the risk of losing the space means projects being abandoned midway, practical learning being put on hold and tinkers left without the access to tools that make their ideas grow.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We’re raising funds to rent out a new space that will support the strength of the community. The funds will help us pay off debts incurred after purchasing the tools. Without your help, we risk losing the space and rendering our growing family of makers homeless. </p>
<p>You can help us MAKE this happen. </p>

Soon, this casual bunch of DIY enthusiasts grew to a sizeable group of members who didn’t fit in the room any longer. 
Entrepreneurs joined in and used the space to develop their prototypes since it was cost-effective. Students milled in so that they could practically use what they had studied in school.
   Our Family 
Maker's Asylum recently registered as a not-for-profit organisation. For the last six months, our space has been sponsored by a well-wisher design school. Here, we organise regular workshops so students can learn more thoroughly. We offer talks by industry experts so the community can have access to them and their real-world experiences. We encourage build-groups so that the community can put their different skills to test by building something wonderful together. The space also allows small start-ups to build their ideas and crowd-source tips from the community. 

Currently, we are a community of 140 members with 500 footfalls from curious minds every month and 6,000 social media supporters.   Challenges 
The good part is that we’ve ignited the Maker Movement in India. The bad part — we’ve lost the space we’ve called home for the last six months. The design school that let us use a portion of their cafeteria for our activities needs us to vacate. We have till August 31.
In order to continue feeding the hungry community of Makers, we need to find a new space to rent, and soon!
For our community, the risk of losing the space means projects being abandoned midway, practical learning being put on hold and tinkers left without the access to tools that make their ideas grow.   Why We Need Your Help  
We’re raising funds to rent out a new space that will support the strength of the community. The funds will help us pay off debts incurred after purchasing the tools. Without your help, we risk losing the space and rendering our growing family of makers homeless. 
You can help us MAKE this happen.

<p><i><b>A
different kind of Printing Press</b></i></p>
<p>The
Community Printing Press isn't your typical printing press. It's <b>an
alternative idea to the comercial way books are printed </b>-
typically a book may be edited in New York, designed in California,
printed in Denver and finally distributed by some ""official""
distributor. People then have to buy the book at an elevated cost
because there are so many hands in the pot!</p>

<p><br/><i><b>What
makes this different?</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>We
	want to preserve the art of printing. </b>The
	printing press has historically been used to spread ideas, and as an
	essential tool to coordinate, organize and build movements. In
	today's world, everything is digitalized and electronically
	available, but we still believe in the tradition of reading a book.</li>
<li>We
	seek to give voice to the silenced using<b>
	the written word as an outlet for the narratives of communities </b>whose
	voices need to be heard<b>
	and movements</b>
	whose experiences we can learn from. The community printing press is
	<b>a
	tool at the service of communities and social movements.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p><span>A
	community printing press </span><b>breaks
	down industry barriers and bureaucracies</b><span>,
	giving priority to the relationships that make a book happen- the
	printer, the publisher, the author, the designer, are all part of
	the process. </span><b>We
	don't work in isolation but as a team, as a cooperative. </b>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><p>
		Book
		runs can be smaller (or the size a group or collective decides),
		instead of commercially determined minimums (i.e. 1,000-5,000)!</p></li>
<li>What
		does that mean? That you don't need a huge investment, making the
		possibility of printing a book accessible to all of us. 
		<br/>
</li>
<li>Budgets
		and prices are decided in consensus, instead of by industry or market  imposition. In collaboration, we all work together to come up with
		creative, collective and alternatative funding ideas.<br/>
</li>
<li>The
		process doesn't depend on some institution or big publishing house
		but is defined by working groups for each area (printing, design,
		distribution, etc) that bounce ideas off one another and
		collaborate.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p>
		It
		offers a counter option to the elevated costs of the publishing
		industry by cutting out the middle men and doing it yourself,
		ourselves, giving way to a truly autonomous process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><span>For
	these reasons and more, the  community printing press makes </span><b>creating
	your own book something much more simple, accessible,
	practical and collaborative.</b></p></li>

<h3><b><b>Building Bridges of Solidarity: Printing Black Flags and Windmills in Spanish!</b></b></h3>

<p><b>(Our first project on our own Community Printing Press)</b></p>
<p>This
year marks the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the disaster
that hit the shores of the Gulf Coast and left hundreds to die.
Amidst the rubble and complete government failure,<b>
the Common Ground Collective rose up in defiance and came together in

</b><p><b>The

<h3><b>Who are we?<br/></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>El Rebozo
Palapa Editorial Cooperative</b> is
an independent editorial cooperative in Mexico. For us the
written word serves as <b>a
platform to awaken our imaginations</b>.
We also believe that the type of social relationships necessary
to create a cooperative are a reflection of those necessary <b>to
reweave the social fabric and build a world in which many worlds fit. <br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437074335/smw9iuv4fcb3qkfyhomx.png"" src="""" style=""width: 163.333px; height: 98px;""/></p>
<p><b>The
cooperative works around the principles of autogestion</b>:
a form
of economic self-management and sustainability with an implied
horizontalism; <b>collective
learning</b>:
seeing the book not as so much as merchandise, but a form of sharing
knowledge and learning together; <b>accessibility</b>:
increasing access to information; and<b>
the creation of new relationships</b>:
seeing the cooperative and book as intermediaries, as bridges to
create new social and political relationships. </p>

<h3><b><b>Wait, but why is it important to translate and print <i>Black Flags and Windmills</i> NOW? <br/></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<b>
</b><p>
</p>
<p><i>Black
Flags and Windmills</i> reminds us of the importance to <b>recover
our shared histories-</b>
of the movements that came before us, and at the same time form a
<b>collective
critical analysis between movements and across contexts and borders.</b>
From our different corners of the world, we can continue to build
this awakening together- sharing new texts and stories (like Black Flags
and Windmills) and <b>assuring that the narratives of the people make it
out there with tools like the Community Printing Press. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The
world today is in crisis</b>-
climate change, economic collapse, and social movements are changing
the landscape. Across the United States, people are flooding the
streets screaming Black Lives Matter! In Mexico, people are losing
their fear and saying I've had enough, enough violence, Nos Falta 43!
The people are tired and are channeling their rage into action. The
movement is growing.

<p>The
situation we face is begging for us<b>

<p>
</p>
<p>Black
Flags and Windmills does just that: it recovers the stories of an
autonomous, decentralized effort, The Common Ground Collective, while
drawing on the history of the Black Panther struggle in the US, the
living revolution of the Zapatistas in Mexico and anarchists
movements around the world.

</p>
<p><i><b>Una
imprenta diferente</b></i></p>
<p>La
Imprenta Comunitaria no es una imprenta típica, es <b>una
propuesta alternativa a la forma comercial de impresión de libros</b>
– típicamente, se puede revisar un libro en Nueva York, diseñarlo
en California e imprimirlo en Denver y finalmente una distribuidora
“oficial” se hace cargo de su circulación, toda esta separación
en los procesos hace que la gente adquiera el libro a costo elevado
ya que hay muchos eslabones en la cadena.</p>

<br/><p><i><b>¿Y
porque la Imprenta Comunitaria es diferente?</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Queremos
	p</b><b>reservar
	el arte de imprimir. </b>Históricamente,
	la imprenta ha sido usada para la difusión de ideas y como una
	herramienta esencial en la coordinación, organización y
	construcción en el movimiento social. Hoy, todo se encuentra
	digitalizado o disponible electrónicamente, pero aún creemos
	en la tradición de
	poder leer un libro.</li>
<li>Buscamos
	promover la voz de las y los silenciados, usando <b>la
	palabra escrita como una salida a las narrativas de comunidades y a
	las experiencias de movimientos sociales</b>
	que necesitan ser escuchados y de los cuales podemos aprender. 
	La imprenta comunitaria es una <b>herramienta
	al servicio de las comunidades y movimientos sociales. </b><br/>
</li>
<li><p>Una
	imprenta comunitaria <b>rompe
	con las normas burocráticas de la industria,</b>
	siempre dando prioridad a las relaciones que crean un libro- el
	autor,  la impresión,el diseño y la edición, todos son parte del
	proceso. <b>No
	trabajamos aislados unos de otras, trabajamos en equipo, como
	cooperativa. </b><b></b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Los
		tirajes
		pueden ser de tamaños más pequeños que se deciden entre todxs en
		lugar de mínimos determinados comercialmente (de 1,000 a 5,000)</span></li>
<li><span>¿Que
		significa? Que no se ocupa de una gran inversión, así la
		posibilidad de imprimir tu libro se vuelve algo accesible para
		todxs.</span></li>
<li><p><span>Los
		presupuestos y costos se toman en consenso en lugar de por las   reglas industriales. Así en colaboración tod</span>os
		trabajamos juntos y juntas para poder financiar ideas y proyectos
		creativamente, colectivamente y alternativamente.</p></li>
<li>
<span>El
		proceso no depende de alguna institución o gran casa editorial, </span>al
		contrario, se define por grupos de trabajo, por áreas (impresión,
		diseño, distribución, etc.) que rebotan sus ideas y colaboran
		juntos y juntas.</li>
<li>Al
		quitar partes de la cadena, y hacerlo nosotroxs mismos, se ofrece
		una contrapropuesta a los costos elevados de la industria
		editorial, impulsando así un proceso verdaderamente autónomo. 
		</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Por
	estas razones entre otras, la imprenta comunitaria<b>
	hace posible que crear un libro sea algo mucho más sencillo,
	accesible, práctico y colaborativo.  </b>

Help make this dream a reality! 







A little bit goes a long
way...Your dollar, euro or peso means more to us than you know and
we cannot make this happen without your support!


Your
contribution will help us buy our Offset Community Printing Press,
the machine that will make this whole project possible, and finally
begin to build our workshop! But your support goes even further: 

If
we meet our goal we will:



	1) Be one step closer to
	being an autonomous cooperative with the entire printing and
	publishing process and tools in our very own hands, and


2)
	Have the resources to be able to translate, print and distribute our
	next project, Black Flags and Windmills in Spanish!  and share these
	stories of hope and resistance with Mexico and the rest of the
	Spanish-speaking world


3)
	Print our first work on our very own printing press!


(scroll down for info about perks and how we will use your contributions!)Tell me more about this project!




A
different kind of Printing Press
The
Community Printing Press isn't your typical printing press. It's an
alternative idea to the comercial way books are printed -
typically a book may be edited in New York, designed in California,
printed in Denver and finally distributed by some ""official""
distributor. People then have to buy the book at an elevated cost
because there are so many hands in the pot!

                                   
What
makes this different?


We
	want to preserve the art of printing. The
	printing press has historically been used to spread ideas, and as an
	essential tool to coordinate, organize and build movements. In
	today's world, everything is digitalized and electronically
	available, but we still believe in the tradition of reading a book.
We
	seek to give voice to the silenced using
	the written word as an outlet for the narratives of communities whose
	voices need to be heard
	and movements
	whose experiences we can learn from. The community printing press is
	a
	tool at the service of communities and social movements.



A
	community printing press breaks
	down industry barriers and bureaucracies,
	giving priority to the relationships that make a book happen- the
	printer, the publisher, the author, the designer, are all part of
	the process. We
	don't work in isolation but as a team, as a cooperative. 





		Book
		runs can be smaller (or the size a group or collective decides),
		instead of commercially determined minimums (i.e. 1,000-5,000)!
What
		does that mean? That you don't need a huge investment, making the
		possibility of printing a book accessible to all of us. 
		

Budgets
		and prices are decided in consensus, instead of by industry or market  imposition. In collaboration, we all work together to come up with
		creative, collective and alternatative funding ideas.

The
		process doesn't depend on some institution or big publishing house
		but is defined by working groups for each area (printing, design,
		distribution, etc) that bounce ideas off one another and
		collaborate.



		It
		offers a counter option to the elevated costs of the publishing
		industry by cutting out the middle men and doing it yourself,
		ourselves, giving way to a truly autonomous process.



For
	these reasons and more, the  community printing press makes creating
	your own book something much more simple, accessible,
	practical and collaborative.


 




Building Bridges of Solidarity: Printing Black Flags and Windmills in Spanish!

(Our first project on our own Community Printing Press)
This
year marks the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the disaster
that hit the shores of the Gulf Coast and left hundreds to die.
Amidst the rubble and complete government failure,
the Common Ground Collective rose up in defiance and came together in
mutual aid, building hope and power from below. 

                  

                                                






What is the Common Ground Collective? 


The
Common Ground Collective was an autonomous, grassroots, decentralized
relief effort in New Orleans that grew out of the hope and despair of
people who were left to die and fend for themselves.
This experience brought thousands of volunteers from around the world
to support the self-determination of devastated New Orleans
communities.








These
experiences have been gathered into a book, Black Flags and
Windmills: Hope, Anarchy and the Common Ground Collective,
in order to create tools for critical reflection and disaster
response, and to inspire communities to build grassroots power,
sharing insight into what disaster recovery looks like in the face of
systemic failure, and to ask ourselves what happens when people come
together to help one another and take their survival, community
and future into their own hands. 


                                               




Up
until now, the story, lessons and hope that the Common Ground
experience generated, have yet to make it beyond the United States'
shores.


Today,
author Scott Crow and the Rebozo Cooperative are out to change that.
Together
we hope to translate this work into Spanish, in order share this
experience and build bridges of solidarity between the United States
and Mexico and the emerging movements of resistance and autonomy.

Who are we?



El Rebozo
Palapa Editorial Cooperative is
an independent editorial cooperative in Mexico. For us the
written word serves as a
platform to awaken our imaginations.
We also believe that the type of social relationships necessary
to create a cooperative are a reflection of those necessary to
reweave the social fabric and build a world in which many worlds fit. 

                                                        
The
cooperative works around the principles of autogestion:
a form
of economic self-management and sustainability with an implied
horizontalism; collective
learning:
seeing the book not as so much as merchandise, but a form of sharing
knowledge and learning together; accessibility:
increasing access to information; and
the creation of new relationships:
seeing the cooperative and book as intermediaries, as bridges to
create new social and political relationships.

Wait, but why is it important to translate and print Black Flags and Windmills NOW? 




Black
Flags and Windmills reminds us of the importance to recover
our shared histories-
of the movements that came before us, and at the same time form a
collective
critical analysis between movements and across contexts and borders.
From our different corners of the world, we can continue to build
this awakening together- sharing new texts and stories (like Black Flags
and Windmills) and assuring that the narratives of the people make it
out there with tools like the Community Printing Press. 

The
world today is in crisis-
climate change, economic collapse, and social movements are changing
the landscape. Across the United States, people are flooding the
streets screaming Black Lives Matter! In Mexico, people are losing
their fear and saying I've had enough, enough violence, Nos Falta 43!
The people are tired and are channeling their rage into action. The
movement is growing. 

    




The
situation we face is begging for us
to weave our struggles together, build solidarity networks and learn
from the experiences of one another,
and of our common histories and movements
that have inspired us to take action and believe change is possible.


Black
Flags and Windmills does just that: it recovers the stories of an
autonomous, decentralized effort, The Common Ground Collective, while
drawing on the history of the Black Panther struggle in the US, the
living revolution of the Zapatistas in Mexico and anarchists
movements around the world. 



Want to learn more about
the Zapatistas? Check out this video!- 15 questions about Zapatismo.

How will be use your contributions? 

Our
budget is divided between:

Final payments on the Community Printing Press
Equipment, materials, remodeling and refurbishing for our Printing Press Workshop in construction

Support for our team of translators
Production costs to print Black Flags and Windmills
Costs to get the book out and circulating
Including bringing the author, scott crow, to Mexico for a book tour!





The Perks! 



We
are thankful for every dollar or peso we get.  And to show our
thanks, we want to make sure you get something in return, whether it
be an E-book version of Black Flags, a signed copy of the Black
Flags, a collection of Rebozo pamphlets or a chance to have a
personal interview with author scott crow via Skype!

¡Ayúdanos hacer este sueño una realidad!



Un
poco da para mucho...un dolar, euro o peso es mucho...¡más de lo
que puedes imaginar! Sin tu apoyo este proyecto no es posible.


Nos
ayuda a
adquirir
nuestra Imprenta Comunitaria (imprenta offset), la maquina que hace
todo este proyecto posible, y por fin comenzar a trabajarla! Pero su
apoyo alcanza aún más. Si logramos nuestra meta, podemos:

1)
	Dar un paso más en la autonomía de nuestra cooperativa,
	significa tener todo el proceso y las herramientas de impresión y publicación en nuestras propias manos, y

2)
	Tener los recursos para traducir, imprimir y distribuir nuestro
	próximo libro, Banderas Negras y Molinos de Viento en español y
	así compartir historias de esperanza y resistencia con México y
	otros países,


3)
	Imprimir nuestra primer libro con nuestra propia herramienta!


(¡desplaza hacia abajo por mas información sobre los regalos y como daremos uso a sus contribuciones!)
¡Cuéntame mas sobre el proyecto!


Una
imprenta diferente
La
Imprenta Comunitaria no es una imprenta típica, es una
propuesta alternativa a la forma comercial de impresión de libros
– típicamente, se puede revisar un libro en Nueva York, diseñarlo
en California e imprimirlo en Denver y finalmente una distribuidora
“oficial” se hace cargo de su circulación, toda esta separación
en los procesos hace que la gente adquiera el libro a costo elevado
ya que hay muchos eslabones en la cadena.

                           
¿Y
porque la Imprenta Comunitaria es diferente?


Queremos
	preservar
	el arte de imprimir. Históricamente,
	la imprenta ha sido usada para la difusión de ideas y como una
	herramienta esencial en la coordinación, organización y
	construcción en el movimiento social. Hoy, todo se encuentra
	digitalizado o disponible electrónicamente, pero aún creemos
	en la tradición de
	poder leer un libro.
Buscamos
	promover la voz de las y los silenciados, usando la
	palabra escrita como una salida a las narrativas de comunidades y a
	las experiencias de movimientos sociales
	que necesitan ser escuchados y de los cuales podemos aprender. 
	La imprenta comunitaria es una herramienta
	al servicio de las comunidades y movimientos sociales. 

Una
	imprenta comunitaria rompe
	con las normas burocráticas de la industria,
	siempre dando prioridad a las relaciones que crean un libro- el
	autor,  la impresión,el diseño y la edición, todos son parte del
	proceso. No
	trabajamos aislados unos de otras, trabajamos en equipo, como
	cooperativa. 





Los
		tirajes
		pueden ser de tamaños más pequeños que se deciden entre todxs en
		lugar de mínimos determinados comercialmente (de 1,000 a 5,000)
¿Que
		significa? Que no se ocupa de una gran inversión, así la
		posibilidad de imprimir tu libro se vuelve algo accesible para
		todxs.
Los
		presupuestos y costos se toman en consenso en lugar de por las   reglas industriales. Así en colaboración todos
		trabajamos juntos y juntas para poder financiar ideas y proyectos
		creativamente, colectivamente y alternativamente.

El
		proceso no depende de alguna institución o gran casa editorial, al
		contrario, se define por grupos de trabajo, por áreas (impresión,
		diseño, distribución, etc.) que rebotan sus ideas y colaboran
		juntos y juntas.
Al
		quitar partes de la cadena, y hacerlo nosotroxs mismos, se ofrece
		una contrapropuesta a los costos elevados de la industria
		editorial, impulsando así un proceso verdaderamente autónomo. 
		


Por
	estas razones entre otras, la imprenta comunitaria
	hace posible que crear un libro sea algo mucho más sencillo,
	accesible, práctico y colaborativo.  





Construyendo puentes de solidaridad: Imprimiendo Banderas Negras y Molinos de Viento en español

(Nuestra primer proyecto en la Imprenta Comunitaria!)
Este
año marca el décimo aniversario del Hurucán Katrina, el desastre
que golpeó la Costa del Golfo, dejando a miles aislados y en riesgo
de perder sus vidas. Entre el escombro y el fracaso total del
gobierno, el
Colectivo Tierra Común se levantó en resistencia, el apoyo mutuo
conjunto esfuerzos y dio paso a la esperanza y a la construcción de
poder desde abajo. 

                       




¿Que es el colectivo de Tierra Común? 



El
Colectivo Tierra Común era un esfuerzo decentralizado, autónomo y
desde abajo  en Nueva Orleans que nació desde la esperanza y la
desesperación de la gente que fue dejada a morir y de la posibilidad de organizarse por si solos.
La experiencia trajó miles de voluntarios desde todo el mundo en
apoyo a la autodeterminación de las comunidades devastadas de Nueva
Orleans. 



El
libro Banderas Negras y Molinos de Viento: Esperanza, Anarquía y el
Colectivo Tierra Común recoge estas experiencias
para crear herramientas de reflexión crítica y respuestas en
situaciones de desastre, para inspirar a comunidades en la
construcción de poder desde abajo ante el fracaso sistémico y para
preguntarnos que pasa cuando la gente se empieza a ayudar uno al otro
y toman en sus propias manos su vida, su comunidad y futuro. 





Hasta
ahora, las lecciones, la historia y esperanza generada por la
experiencia de Tierra Común no han llegando más allá de las
fronteras Estadounidienses. 



Hoy,
scott crow autor del libro y la Cooperativa El Rebozo quieren
cambiarlo. Juntos y juntas esperamos traducir este libro al español
para dar a conocer la experiencia y construir puentes de solidaridad
entre los Estados Unidos, México y los movimientos emergentes
de resistencia y autonomía.

<h3><strong>We know you want to learn a language, and we know you have just found it too hard.</strong></h3>
<p>So many people say they want to learn a language. They imagine the joy they will get when they travel abroad and start speaking to people in a language that no one expects them to be able to speak. They open a textbook, download an app, flick through a phrasebook, and become so disappointed in how little they have learned for the time they have invested. They may join a class and pay hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, and still find that when they have to communicate in the language, that they don't truly understand what is being said or they are unable to make themselves understood.</p>
<p>For most people, learning a language becomes a painful experience, so that most people believe that they don't have the knack or the ability to learn a language.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>My name is Alosha Lynov, </i></strong></p>
<p>My passion is Practical Self Sustainability. I recently sold my <a href=""http://www.3ddeco.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Event Decor Business</a> to pursue my eco passion of teaching our planetary community on how they can thrive in harmony wth nature and universal laws without climbing into the bed with the bank.</p>
<p>I have spend 3 years on the farm experimenting with food , water and shelter sustainability, to gain the practical wisdom on large scale operations.</p>
<p>Over the years I have attended 11 live international workshops and together with our students we have practically build all the DIY eco tech that I have learned from these workshops.</p>

<p>I earned my permaculture design certificate from one of the best teachers on the planet - <a href=""http://www.geofflawtononline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Geoff Lawton</a>. I studied sewage treatment and tire house construction method at <a href=""http://earthship.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earthship head quarters</a> in Taos new Mexico and built a school with Garbage Warrior, aka Michael Reynolds in Malawi.</p>

<p>I've learned how to create biointesive gardens that use up to 20x less water from <a href=""http://www.growbiointensive.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Jeavons</a>.</p>
<p>I  attended live workshops in 2 types of dome home construction using air crete by <a href=""http://www.domegaia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dome Gaia</a> , together we constructed an additional glass room for a Waldorf School in San Miguelle de Allende, Mexico. I have also studied and sand bag dome home technology with California School of Land Art and Architecture - <a href=""http://www.calearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cal-Earth</a>.</p>
<p>I am a visionary high end entrepreneur and successfully ran my event decor business in SA with a satellite branch in Dubai. To fuel my business career I acquired a 3 year degree in Creative Brand Communications at VEGA as well as a variety of high end online marketing and business courses.</p>

<p>With all of the above biological eco technologies and applied wisdom we feel confident that together we will be able to build an alternative model to capitalism and a money enslaved society.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is this so important </h3>
<p>The reason that this Permaculture school is so important is because it will teach the practical know how of all the aspects of Self Sufficiency. From growing of your own food to building eco homes using waste, without debt, that keeps cycling all waste water for food irrigation and flushing of loos.</p>
<p>We focus on skills transferral and teaching the teachers as well as future entrepreneurs which will spread the knowledge and practical wisdom to the rest of the community, eventually taking over entire townships / ghettos with it's profitable and self sustainable models.</p>
<p>We will teach local communities in Zulu, Xhosa and English how to get off the grid through growing their own food forest parks and nutritionally dense vegetables all irrigated by human waste water treated by constructed wetlands.</p>
<p>Thereafter students will learn how build simple and almost free shelters using tires, sandbags, cans and bottles. These houses will heat, cool and energise themselves using wind, sun and permaculture design ethics without the use of electricity, gas or fire. These houses will be partially sponsored by corporations that produce the waste in the first place.</p>
<p>Long term result of our training facility will be a reduction of burning of tires, plastic and garden biomass because our students will show others how to use them as useful resources and therefore there is no use in burning useful resources if they can be used to stay warm, build homes and grow organic food. If everyone is fed and warmly housed then crime and violence will drop. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503391304/ufjgvdeql4k5yhyikqcp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have to change the environments that we live in, current gridded up cities just breed chaos and scarcity. I believe we have to start creating new reality eco villages and cities that welcome Universal laws and natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Our Permaculture school will teach future leaders on how to design their way to abundance whilst co creating together with nature and all of it's forces. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503391330/llxcy4omiqvw1ggdjetj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By investing into our eco school you will invest into our grand vision to inspire one billion people to thrive Sustainably and Abundantly in harmony with nature and each other. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503391465/yzu8yo2s9zsjrj2nsaxf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have already invested 10 years and over 200.000 USD into this school. It is 93% complete and we require funds to complete the remaining 10%. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We currently require 40000 USD. </p>
<p>The funds will be used to complete a 1 month <a href=""http://earthship.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Earthship academy at Taos New Mexico</a> after which I will be certified to teach the creation of a fully off-the-grid homes that are build entirely from waste, powered by waste water whilst releasing no waste into our our planet or municipal grid.</p>
<p>The remainder of funds will be used to complete an aircrete  Dome Home additional classroom constructed above a 40000 L underground reservoir. We will build this classroom through a live 3 week workshop.</p>
<p>The final cash flow is needed for food forest plants, nursery construction,  flooring for outside and indoor classrooms and finishing up of paving  in a parking lot that are already constructed.</p>
<p>The most important part of the budget will be used for marketing of our Permaculture training facility to other schools, institutions and corporations.</p>
<p>As an energy exchange we are giving away our fully completed online Abundance of Water Video Master class that we have put together whilst working on this property. We also have 2 more workshops coming up - Eco Dome Home Construction as well as Food Forest Biosphere  &amp; Grow Bio Intensive Urban Farming.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal the funds will go towards basic completion of the school so we can open our doors and start teaching the teachers, children and future leaders. </p>
<p>By being able to open our doors we will instantly start generating income that will assist in all other projects that need full completion. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>This is one of the most important projects on the planet. Spreading permaculture knowledge with the practical applied wisdom will change our planet around for the better. It will empower our communities to create Abundant thriving livelihoods in sync with Grand Organised Design and our planet. </p>
<p>There is an alternative reality to capitalism via money enslavement and we will teach it in the most practical hands-on way.</p>
<p>Our track record has been successful. We have completed 4 eco Machines, 2 sand bad dome homes, 2 biochar filters, converted a pool at this training facility and build 3 types of water storage reservoirs. This resulted in our city property getting completely off the water grid without the use of the borehole. We have already trained over 30 unskilled and unemployed african labourers into eco construction and wetland creation.</p>
<p>Teaching is my 3rd highest value after Inventive Design and entrepreneurship. I have been sharing practical eco consciousness via my newsletters since 2008. </p>
<p>You can also join our mailing list at <a href=""http://www.bioveda.ru"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bioveda.ru</a> for a weekly VLOG on how to practically create a new reality on earth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have dedicated the rest of my life towards this vision to create off grid ecological biogeometric cities. This vision is highly aligned with my 4 highest values of Inventiveness, teaching, Business and Learning Universal Laws. I have had the same vision for the last 17 years and thus started my decor business to eliminate square lines out of cubical rooms.</p>
<p>I have a track record of not falling down even if I fail. I carry on, especially if something is aligned with my vision and highest values of self sustainability.</p>
<p>At the age of 20 I decorated a 10000 square metre Northgate Dome for Discovery Life insurance company.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503405663/vshwdllv9f9unloucm9s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the age of 30 I had 14x water proof geodesic domes, up to 140 square metres in size, standing simultaneously at 14 cities, for World Cup, around South Africa.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503393126/dcejypjltpthy9vjvym9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I love taking on large projects and thrive when I can teach and co create with loads of people, powered by serious earth moving machinery for large food forest swale construction.</p>
<p>I keep on drilling the tasks with highest priorities until they are done. I do not stop even if I fail.</p>
<p>I was born in Russia and had enormous challenges when growing up in communist USSR, coming to South Africa a lost all my friends at thew age of 14 . Without knowing any english I started my own business by the age of 15. My 16 year old company 3D Deco , I started at the age of 19.  I recently sold my event decor business to pursue my eco passion of practical permaculture training.</p>
<p>This entire year I have been working on a new product - Abundance of Water Video Master Class and the entire course is ready for purchase. In fact I just sold 14000 USD worth of online Water Self Sufficiency courses. </p>
<p>I have invested all the profits and the funds from the sale of my company into this school and eco training.</p>
<p>My one challenge is budgeting , I am slowly overcoming this by doing a weekly cash flow forecast spread sheet. I have also started saving recently to increase my stability so I can stay focused on the grand Vision.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here is the Vision that I have committed to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a Visionary inventor, international edutainer and a master builder of Self Regenerative, Self Replicating, Biogeometric living habitats based on BioMimicry principles , cosmic geometries, geomancy, natural law and permaculture eco systemic design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I express my creativity and talents to guide our humanity to co create intelligent new reality research villages and cities that welcome natural laws and elemental kingdom whilst utilising natural phenomena and waste.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All of our Bio shelter organisms are surrounded by food forest parks, producing living air, spring water and a diverse variety of nutritionally dense medicinal food whilst transforming EMR into healing vibrations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The social structures and lifestyle in our settlements are designed to support all those living within, to joyfully thrive with Health and Abundance whilst serving each other.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Villages allow our creator and all the inhabitants to playfully interact together, awakening the visionaries within all beings to manifest a conscious new reality on earth...</strong></p>

Mature folk who wish to follow a path of Self Sustainability & Self Regenerative Abundant Bio - Design

My name is Alosha Lynov, 
My passion is Practical Self Sustainability. I recently sold my Event Decor Business to pursue my eco passion of teaching our planetary community on how they can thrive in harmony wth nature and universal laws without climbing into the bed with the bank.
I have spend 3 years on the farm experimenting with food , water and shelter sustainability, to gain the practical wisdom on large scale operations.
Over the years I have attended 11 live international workshops and together with our students we have practically build all the DIY eco tech that I have learned from these workshops.

I earned my permaculture design certificate from one of the best teachers on the planet - Geoff Lawton. I studied sewage treatment and tire house construction method at Earthship head quarters in Taos new Mexico and built a school with Garbage Warrior, aka Michael Reynolds in Malawi.
I've learned about wetland ecologies at the biggest wetland in Africa, the Okavango Delta, with John Todd & Biomimicry Institute. Aqueous Solutions taught me practical creation of Biochar Slow Sand filtration in Thailand.

I've learned how to create biointesive gardens that use up to 20x less water from John Jeavons.
I  attended live workshops in 2 types of dome home construction using air crete by Dome Gaia , together we constructed an additional glass room for a Waldorf School in San Miguelle de Allende, Mexico. I have also studied and sand bag dome home technology with California School of Land Art and Architecture - Cal-Earth.
I am a visionary high end entrepreneur and successfully ran my event decor business in SA with a satellite branch in Dubai. To fuel my business career I acquired a 3 year degree in Creative Brand Communications at VEGA as well as a variety of high end online marketing and business courses.

With all of the above biological eco technologies and applied wisdom we feel confident that together we will be able to build an alternative model to capitalism and a money enslaved society.
Why is this so important 
The reason that this Permaculture school is so important is because it will teach the practical know how of all the aspects of Self Sufficiency. From growing of your own food to building eco homes using waste, without debt, that keeps cycling all waste water for food irrigation and flushing of loos.
We focus on skills transferral and teaching the teachers as well as future entrepreneurs which will spread the knowledge and practical wisdom to the rest of the community, eventually taking over entire townships / ghettos with it's profitable and self sustainable models.
We will teach local communities in Zulu, Xhosa and English how to get off the grid through growing their own food forest parks and nutritionally dense vegetables all irrigated by human waste water treated by constructed wetlands.
Thereafter students will learn how build simple and almost free shelters using tires, sandbags, cans and bottles. These houses will heat, cool and energise themselves using wind, sun and permaculture design ethics without the use of electricity, gas or fire. These houses will be partially sponsored by corporations that produce the waste in the first place.
Long term result of our training facility will be a reduction of burning of tires, plastic and garden biomass because our students will show others how to use them as useful resources and therefore there is no use in burning useful resources if they can be used to stay warm, build homes and grow organic food. If everyone is fed and warmly housed then crime and violence will drop. 
 

We have to change the environments that we live in, current gridded up cities just breed chaos and scarcity. I believe we have to start creating new reality eco villages and cities that welcome Universal laws and natural phenomena.
Our Permaculture school will teach future leaders on how to design their way to abundance whilst co creating together with nature and all of it's forces. 

By investing into our eco school you will invest into our grand vision to inspire one billion people to thrive Sustainably and Abundantly in harmony with nature and each other. 

I have already invested 10 years and over 200.000 USD into this school. It is 93% complete and we require funds to complete the remaining 10%. 

What We Need & What You Get
We currently require 40000 USD. 
The funds will be used to complete a 1 month Earthship academy at Taos New Mexico after which I will be certified to teach the creation of a fully off-the-grid homes that are build entirely from waste, powered by waste water whilst releasing no waste into our our planet or municipal grid.
The remainder of funds will be used to complete an aircrete  Dome Home additional classroom constructed above a 40000 L underground reservoir. We will build this classroom through a live 3 week workshop.
The final cash flow is needed for food forest plants, nursery construction,  flooring for outside and indoor classrooms and finishing up of paving  in a parking lot that are already constructed.
The most important part of the budget will be used for marketing of our Permaculture training facility to other schools, institutions and corporations.
As an energy exchange we are giving away our fully completed online Abundance of Water Video Master class that we have put together whilst working on this property. We also have 2 more workshops coming up - Eco Dome Home Construction as well as Food Forest Biosphere  & Grow Bio Intensive Urban Farming.
If we do not reach our entire goal the funds will go towards basic completion of the school so we can open our doors and start teaching the teachers, children and future leaders. 
By being able to open our doors we will instantly start generating income that will assist in all other projects that need full completion. 

The Impact
This is one of the most important projects on the planet. Spreading permaculture knowledge with the practical applied wisdom will change our planet around for the better. It will empower our communities to create Abundant thriving livelihoods in sync with Grand Organised Design and our planet. 
There is an alternative reality to capitalism via money enslavement and we will teach it in the most practical hands-on way.
Our track record has been successful. We have completed 4 eco Machines, 2 sand bad dome homes, 2 biochar filters, converted a pool at this training facility and build 3 types of water storage reservoirs. This resulted in our city property getting completely off the water grid without the use of the borehole. We have already trained over 30 unskilled and unemployed african labourers into eco construction and wetland creation.
Teaching is my 3rd highest value after Inventive Design and entrepreneurship. I have been sharing practical eco consciousness via my newsletters since 2008. 
You can also join our mailing list at www.bioveda.ru for a weekly VLOG on how to practically create a new reality on earth.

Risks & Challenges
I have dedicated the rest of my life towards this vision to create off grid ecological biogeometric cities. This vision is highly aligned with my 4 highest values of Inventiveness, teaching, Business and Learning Universal Laws. I have had the same vision for the last 17 years and thus started my decor business to eliminate square lines out of cubical rooms.
I have a track record of not falling down even if I fail. I carry on, especially if something is aligned with my vision and highest values of self sustainability.
At the age of 20 I decorated a 10000 square metre Northgate Dome for Discovery Life insurance company.

At the age of 30 I had 14x water proof geodesic domes, up to 140 square metres in size, standing simultaneously at 14 cities, for World Cup, around South Africa.

I love taking on large projects and thrive when I can teach and co create with loads of people, powered by serious earth moving machinery for large food forest swale construction.
I keep on drilling the tasks with highest priorities until they are done. I do not stop even if I fail.
I was born in Russia and had enormous challenges when growing up in communist USSR, coming to South Africa a lost all my friends at thew age of 14 . Without knowing any english I started my own business by the age of 15. My 16 year old company 3D Deco , I started at the age of 19.  I recently sold my event decor business to pursue my eco passion of practical permaculture training.
This entire year I have been working on a new product - Abundance of Water Video Master Class and the entire course is ready for purchase. In fact I just sold 14000 USD worth of online Water Self Sufficiency courses. 
I have invested all the profits and the funds from the sale of my company into this school and eco training.
My one challenge is budgeting , I am slowly overcoming this by doing a weekly cash flow forecast spread sheet. I have also started saving recently to increase my stability so I can stay focused on the grand Vision.
Here is the Vision that I have committed to.
I am a Visionary inventor, international edutainer and a master builder of Self Regenerative, Self Replicating, Biogeometric living habitats based on BioMimicry principles , cosmic geometries, geomancy, natural law and permaculture eco systemic design.
I express my creativity and talents to guide our humanity to co create intelligent new reality research villages and cities that welcome natural laws and elemental kingdom whilst utilising natural phenomena and waste.
All of our Bio shelter organisms are surrounded by food forest parks, producing living air, spring water and a diverse variety of nutritionally dense medicinal food whilst transforming EMR into healing vibrations.
The social structures and lifestyle in our settlements are designed to support all those living within, to joyfully thrive with Health and Abundance whilst serving each other.
Our Villages allow our creator and all the inhabitants to playfully interact together, awakening the visionaries within all beings to manifest a conscious new reality on earth...

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>If you want better relationships, Relate Theatre uses audience participation, interuption and intervention, with a couple-therapist‘s advice, which gives you a rainbow of options for approaching tricky situations in new ways. You get to stay grounded, whole, creative and resourceful.</p>
<p>Not only that but watching with your partner will help you see and listen to each other better. Imagine the dinner conversation afterwards, spiced with insights and daring new flavours.</p>
<p>Plus, did we mention this is theatre?  It’s a great piece of entertainment too!</p>
<h3>The team </h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are a multidisciplinary company of great actors, a director, social media and stage technicians, plus couples-therapists to ""keep it real"".</p>
<p>Skilled in staging improvised drama, working with audience interventions, sometimes with members of the audience (“spectactors”) on stage and taking direction in the moment from the therapists, we look forwards to meeting you at Relate Theatre.</p>
<p>See us here on one of our training days:</p>

<h3>One relationship situation, many ways to play it</h3>
<p>Each Relate Theatre performance focuses on a difficult relationship situation, which forms the theme of the show. The actors play it out and it can get messy.</p>
<p>The scene is then replayed but differently. Then it is replayed again and again with different words, actions, attititudes. The audience or the therapist can “STOP” the action at any point and make a change. When the differences come from an audience member, perhaps they will show what they mean by coming onto the stage.</p>
<p>In Relate Theatre all interventions are useful and welcome. The results surprise, entertain and equip the audience in ways never expected.</p>
<p>Here are some sample scenes for you to enjoy:</p>

<p>But the push to diagnose and medicate has not been matched with the need for caution. There are fundamental flaws in the way ADHD is often diagnosed and, as licensed mental health clinicians, we see the consequences over and over again: children labelled as ADHD and medicated incorrectly - permanently impacting their childhood. </p>

The Diagnosis of ADHD and the medication of our children is at epidemic proportions - not just in the U.S., but increasingly around the world.
But the push to diagnose and medicate has not been matched with the need for caution. There are fundamental flaws in the way ADHD is often diagnosed and, as licensed mental health clinicians, we see the consequences over and over again: children labelled as ADHD and medicated incorrectly - permanently impacting their childhood. 


Because it's not about whether you can be diagnosed with ADHD - it's whether you should be: There are many issues that look like ADHD, but have very different underlying causes. 


 And while most people go to their family doctor for answers, family doctors often don't have time to ask the questions that need to be asked - and most parents don't know what to ask them. 


Even more extraordinary: In the age of the Internet (and Indiegogo), most psychological testing is still done with paper and pencil tests!

In addition to studying and learning from various cultures in Eastern Africa, we will also be performing, teaching clinics/workshops, and documenting our experience. </p> </div> <div> <h3>BUDGET</h3> <p>In order to make this trip possible, the AfroXchange requires:</p>

The AfroXchange is comprised of Dokun Oke, Alex Gasser, Richard Dye, Alexander Anderson, VanDarrel Woods, and Ayinde Webb.  All of the members have studied, or are currently studying at Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. We come from United States, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and Nigeria. These musicians represent different cultural aspects of the African diaspora. This trip is important to the members of the AfroXchange because it allows us to reconnect lost ties to Africa, and research the influences of African cultures and music on American music. In addition to studying and learning from various cultures in Eastern Africa, we will also be performing, teaching clinics/workshops, and documenting our experience.    BUDGET In order to make this trip possible, the AfroXchange requires:


Five round trip tickets from Boston, MA to Nairobi, Kenya ~ $7,000
Six visas covering Eastern Africa ~ $900 ($150 per person)


Lodging in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda for three weeks ~ $3,000
Transportation throughout Eastern Africa ~ $TBD

For this fundraising campaign, we are primarily concerned with raising the cost of the plane tickets ($7,000) to ensure that all the members of the AfroXchange are able to be there for the trip. 
    The Impact We have an amazing opportunity to work with the organization Global Youth Groove (http://globalyouthgroove.org), which is a non-profit organization that provides music education to the youth in Kenya. We will be joined by a team of music therapists from Berklee College of Music, and will be also assisting them at hospitals and wherever needed in Kenya. We also hope to perform at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya and at the Kigali Up music festival in Rwanda on the 24th  of July. 
    Risks & Challenges We are connected to an amazing team of artists, musicians, and organizers in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda, so our challenge is not in finding opportunity. Our main challenge, is meeting the finances required to have the trip go successfully. The expenses are high, and we as college students are unable to meet all the costs of the trip.

<h3>Bon Zanmi!</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting our page! My name is Kenel Pierre and I am the founder of Jaden PepLa, ""the people's garden."" A couple years ago, after the generous contribution of my friends I was able to purchase 3 acres of land in Mirebalais, which will produce nutritious products, including moringa peanut butter, and eventually become a farm and learning center for Hatians in the Central Plateau and visitors. </p>
<p>Jaden PepLa has made a lot of progress the past two years. This summer, we harvested over 500lbs, of which ¾ of the products were given to people around Mirebalais to feed their family, with ¼ saved for seeds for next year. We also were able to harvest peanuts and have taken the next steps to bring our organization to the next level by launching an online presence and formalizing ourself as a 501(c)3 in the state of Oregon. </p>
<p>In the future, we are planning to mix peanuts with Moringa(Doliv) to make a nutritious peanut butter that can help a lot with pregnant women and babies.</p>
<p>But we need your help to take the next steps!</p>
<h2><strong>Our campaign: </strong></h2>
<p>For those of you who know me, I started the farmhouse last September and was not able to finish it just yet because I had to come to USA to help my wife with our son Calvin. I have been here around Bend, Oregon for last 7 months.</p>
<p>I am planning to go back to Haiti mid-November this year to work on the farm and do more training in the community.</p>
<p>We are raising funds for two primary reasons.</p>
<p>1)  To complete the farmhouse. By doing so, we will have a place to store leftovers of produce and have a place to stay when we are working. This will also be the future home to host farmers that we will teach. </p>
<p>2) We would like to help some poor farmers get some seeds to start their own garden spot after being training at Jaden PèpLa. In Haiti, many people want to have their own vegetables garden but can’t afford the seeds or and may can't even find a place that offers them.  We can address this problem! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact </strong></h3>
<p>We are raising $12,000 to </p>
<p>1) put a roof on the farmhouse </p>
<p>2) install the floor, a toilet, and the kitchen </p>
<p>3) to buy seed for the local farmers</p>
<p>4) payment + food and drinks for workers</p>
<p>And finally, for other infrastructure needs to <font>begin processing and harvesting crops, including the moringa trees. </font></p>

If you know where the destination you need to reach is, but you don't know precisely how to get there, you're likely going to run into costly obstacles and detours, while trying to reach the destination. Public Education is an unknown territory that is very different and more challenging landscape than any other industry. Therefore, while navigating to the destination you're going to run into more obstacles and detours than you would've if the journey was in another industry. That's why most early-stage EdTech companies run out of capital, ambition, time and other resources before reaching the destination. That's why the return on investment (ROI) in this industry is not high enough to draw in the type of capital that can sweep innovation across the industry overnight like it has in other industries. That's why this is NOT an appetizing journey to those who want to solve Education's problems or to those who provide the capital.</p><p>But, imagine how different it would be if you have a ""guide"" or a ""bridge"", a team who has been to the destination you need to reach many times. Imagine a bridge that took you over the top of the obstacles and detours. You'd be able to reach the destination frictionlessly. You'd reach the destination faster, bigger because you wouldn't have wasted capital, time or other resources on obstacles and detours along the way, and you'd reach the destination more frequently, if not every time. Plus, you'd be better equipped to do what you needed when you got to the destination. </p><p>Now, imagine if you were also provided a rocket booster to hyper-accelerate you to the destination. Verse Capital is the guide or the bridge, the rocket booster is our expertise in <strong>Public Education Sales</strong>. So few understand Sales and fewer understand Sales in this industry. There is no investor, consultant, advisor or anyone else who is going to knock on doors with you and you can forget about finding someone who knows precisely which doors to knock on. <i><strong>We believe it's crazy because Sales solves all problems.</strong></i></p><ul>
<li>Sales generates Revenue.</li>
<li>Revenue offsets the amount of capital a company will need from an investor.<ul><li>Therefore, it reduces initial dilution of your ownership of your company and reduces the risk of needing to dilute your ownership later.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Revenue increases the value or valuation of your company.<ul>
<li>Therefore, if you do need capital, it's less expensive, easier to obtain and you'll have more options.</li>
<li>Revenue is also the key to profit, profitability and therefore your own return on investment and your investors return on investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revenue provides the capital needed to hire the best talent, increase marketing, etc.</li>
<li>Revenue reduces all Risk. </li>
</ul><p><strong>So, why aren't more Investors, who invest in early-stage companies, providing capital and Sales Expertise to ensure they invest in successful companies? We think it's a no-brainer, but in Education, there's no other way to produce the type of returns that capital requires. We are the 1st company/investor that will supply capital and Sales expertise to early-stage EdTech companies, because we have to solve the problems in Education or America will not be able to compete and we can't imagine the losses each of us will endure as America slips into the 3rd world. </strong></p><p><strong>We need your help with the initial capital. Once we prove that this is how EdTech investing needs to look, then we'll be able to raise all the capital we need. But if you don't give us a chance, we'll never know and this is a risk America cannot take.</strong></p><p>Verse Capital will partner with Educators who have developed promising EdTech solutions and provide them with business, sales and capital resources to amplify their success. Verse Capita. With over 55-years combined expertise, Verse Capital strategically addresses each challenge that has made penetrating education for new companies with innovative solutions virtually impassable, the key to amplifying each company's success that has never been done before. <strong>The companies Verse Capital works with will reach faster success, bigger success and more frequent success.</strong></p><p>After 5-yrs. of research, learning that America is deteriorating much faster than most can imagine and accepting that if something doesn't change, the future is going to change in America for the worse, the solution materialized. Public Education is a wildly different industry, for 35-yrs. business people have tried to apply old business models to Public Education with no success. They keep doing it, it's insane. If Public Education is different and we want different results, WE MUST THINK DIFFERENTLY.</p><p>Early-stage companies are the bottleneck to innovation. Innovation creates efficiency, aligns an Industry to the Global Economy's Needs. In this, Education is the Industry and because the industry is different, full of barriers that slow early-stage companies down or cause total failure, the only way for them to succeed and increase the innovation that reaches our students, there has to be a new and ""different"" type of company, that acts like a bridge, accelerating early-stage companies across the barriers to entry, penetrating Education and reaching every classroom, no matter the zip code or amount of wealth in the zip code. </p><p>Education is the primary driver of Economic Productivity, our ability to compete as a nation. It has fallen to #36 and if we don't fix it, our Economic Productivity, our Living Standards and much more will fall to #36. For perspective, Mexico's Economic Productivity is #35. This new business model is the solution.</p><p>Educators are closest to and most qualified to solve pervasive problems in America's Public Schools. They're also the least likely to succeed if attempt to create a commercial solution and roll it out to the 51 million students in America whose future depends on the education they receive.  Typically, they lack business/sales acumen and access to capital that's required to break through the socialized barriers of public education. </p><p>This may be the greatest tragedy of our time. Tragic for Educators who take the blame for education's under-performance, even-though they're under-paid, overworked, equipped with 14th century tools and when trying to solve pervasive problems, they're punished further by a viscous industry to succeed in on the business-front. It's tragic for our children who will enter an economy in decline with fewer tools and skills than generations that graduated before them. It's tragic for the rest of us who don't know the cost of neglect. We owe it to our children and to those who serve and who have served on the frontlines, protecting our freedom, to do whatever is necessary to create and maintain alignment between education and the global economy's demands.</p><p><strong>Verse Capital was created to amplify success for Educators who create solutions for public schools. Verse Capital supplies Educators with the required Business and Sales Acumen, Capital and accelerates them through Education's Socialized Barriers to Entry. Educators that partner with Verse Capital, will reach success faster, bigger and more frequently. Without these critical pieces, it is nearly impossible to commercialize scalable Education Technology (EdTech) solutions, capable of providing each of our children with personalized skills and knowledge that they must have to compete in the modern economy. Verse Capital has a solution that’s needed to align America’s Public Schools to the 21<sup>st</sup> century global economy.​</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532547039/x7enavpo6sb8iv3qacpy.png"" src=""""/></p><p>What happened? The Digital Revolution reshaped the world, but our school systems were unable to adapt while countries we compete against were able to adapt and sail right past us. Our children are digital natives, but our schools use a 14<sup>th</sup> century classical education model, designed for a different time, world and people -- designed to support a wildly different, less global economy – yet, we’re still using it in the 21<sup>st</sup> century! The more successful Educators are when introducing technology solutions into classrooms, the more successful student outcomes will be and the sooner America will be positioned for prosperity again, rather than continuing as a nation in decline.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532577104/y6i2ky8vmvbhp5u824jp.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>THE PROCESS</u></strong></p><p>First, recognize that this is a special time for solving this problem. Before, the cost of deploying over 50 million devices, IT staff, etc. was insurmountable. Today, the Cost Barrier to Entry has dropped: <strong>1. Computing Devices:</strong> Dropped by over 30% YoY. Devices are used pervasively. <strong>2. Cloud:</strong> Eliminated the need for the bulk of the cost such as servers, etc. The cloud is used pervasively. <strong>3. Broadband: </strong>94% of public schools have sufficient bandwidth, it too is pervasive and allows the devices to connect to the Cloud. Once all three aligned, there was an influx of capital and entrepreneurs, which has died off because they learned the impossibilities of penetrating Public Education, which we have solved and we know of nobody else who has. This process is capable of generating returns that will drive the market to EdTech, increasing capital investments and Educator/Entrepreneur interest, the right way. In addition, while in the trenches doing research, building a team with over 55-years of combined EdTech Expertise, our very own backyard, Utah, gained the reputation as being <i><strong>""EdTech's Home.""</strong></i></p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Align Product to Federal/State Education Budgets</strong>: If the product doesn't fit, you have to go through legislation to get it approved. We won't work with these companies because it's a 5-years process. Plus, once we know where within the budgets we need to reach, it is much faster and easier to reach for it. We leverage Christina here, she has been Presidential Staff in the White House under the Department of Education. Few people on the planet can navigate budgets like she can. </li>
<li>
<strong>Sales: </strong>The most difficult thing for a new company to navigate through is generating sales and therefore Revenue, the key to all businesses and key to generating returns. Selling to public schools is like no other industry, plus since the space has been dominated by just a few multibillion company, there just aren't many people who know how to sell. Anne worked for Pearson, the world's biggest, for 17-years and where she perfected the sales process. We leverage Anne and her network to hyper-accelerate sales, which puts more capital in their accounts, boosts the valuation and therefore the return, minimizes our need to invest, reduces their dilution and ours, plus it gives us a runway, incase we make a mistake. There is no better way to do this, most companies could never get this type of a sales team.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implementation with Fidelity:</strong> This is where it all fits together and that almost nobody even thinks about. The few companies that do get a 1st sell done, they rapidly race off to get another, not thinking about how to effectively and responsibly do an implementation to ensure the product gets used. Most companies won't get a 2nd contract or renewal because the usage is always too low. Which means the product isn't making a positive impact, if it isn't getting used. The renewal is where the profit comes too, because the first sell is expensive. So most companies don't get the usage or the profit, therefore they don't generate returns either. We help the companies develop an implementation strategy that has fidelity. </li>

If you know where the destination you need to reach is, but you don't know precisely how to get there, you're likely going to run into costly obstacles and detours, while trying to reach the destination. Public Education is an unknown territory that is very different and more challenging landscape than any other industry. Therefore, while navigating to the destination you're going to run into more obstacles and detours than you would've if the journey was in another industry. That's why most early-stage EdTech companies run out of capital, ambition, time and other resources before reaching the destination. That's why the return on investment (ROI) in this industry is not high enough to draw in the type of capital that can sweep innovation across the industry overnight like it has in other industries. That's why this is NOT an appetizing journey to those who want to solve Education's problems or to those who provide the capital.But, imagine how different it would be if you have a ""guide"" or a ""bridge"", a team who has been to the destination you need to reach many times. Imagine a bridge that took you over the top of the obstacles and detours. You'd be able to reach the destination frictionlessly. You'd reach the destination faster, bigger because you wouldn't have wasted capital, time or other resources on obstacles and detours along the way, and you'd reach the destination more frequently, if not every time. Plus, you'd be better equipped to do what you needed when you got to the destination. Now, imagine if you were also provided a rocket booster to hyper-accelerate you to the destination. Verse Capital is the guide or the bridge, the rocket booster is our expertise in Public Education Sales. So few understand Sales and fewer understand Sales in this industry. There is no investor, consultant, advisor or anyone else who is going to knock on doors with you and you can forget about finding someone who knows precisely which doors to knock on. We believe it's crazy because Sales solves all problems.
Sales generates Revenue.
Revenue offsets the amount of capital a company will need from an investor.Therefore, it reduces initial dilution of your ownership of your company and reduces the risk of needing to dilute your ownership later.

Revenue increases the value or valuation of your company.
Therefore, if you do need capital, it's less expensive, easier to obtain and you'll have more options.
Revenue is also the key to profit, profitability and therefore your own return on investment and your investors return on investment.


Revenue provides the capital needed to hire the best talent, increase marketing, etc.
Revenue reduces all Risk. 
So, why aren't more Investors, who invest in early-stage companies, providing capital and Sales Expertise to ensure they invest in successful companies? We think it's a no-brainer, but in Education, there's no other way to produce the type of returns that capital requires. We are the 1st company/investor that will supply capital and Sales expertise to early-stage EdTech companies, because we have to solve the problems in Education or America will not be able to compete and we can't imagine the losses each of us will endure as America slips into the 3rd world. We need your help with the initial capital. Once we prove that this is how EdTech investing needs to look, then we'll be able to raise all the capital we need. But if you don't give us a chance, we'll never know and this is a risk America cannot take.Verse Capital will partner with Educators who have developed promising EdTech solutions and provide them with business, sales and capital resources to amplify their success. Verse Capita. With over 55-years combined expertise, Verse Capital strategically addresses each challenge that has made penetrating education for new companies with innovative solutions virtually impassable, the key to amplifying each company's success that has never been done before. The companies Verse Capital works with will reach faster success, bigger success and more frequent success.After 5-yrs. of research, learning that America is deteriorating much faster than most can imagine and accepting that if something doesn't change, the future is going to change in America for the worse, the solution materialized. Public Education is a wildly different industry, for 35-yrs. business people have tried to apply old business models to Public Education with no success. They keep doing it, it's insane. If Public Education is different and we want different results, WE MUST THINK DIFFERENTLY.Early-stage companies are the bottleneck to innovation. Innovation creates efficiency, aligns an Industry to the Global Economy's Needs. In this, Education is the Industry and because the industry is different, full of barriers that slow early-stage companies down or cause total failure, the only way for them to succeed and increase the innovation that reaches our students, there has to be a new and ""different"" type of company, that acts like a bridge, accelerating early-stage companies across the barriers to entry, penetrating Education and reaching every classroom, no matter the zip code or amount of wealth in the zip code. Education is the primary driver of Economic Productivity, our ability to compete as a nation. It has fallen to #36 and if we don't fix it, our Economic Productivity, our Living Standards and much more will fall to #36. For perspective, Mexico's Economic Productivity is #35. This new business model is the solution.Educators are closest to and most qualified to solve pervasive problems in America's Public Schools. They're also the least likely to succeed if attempt to create a commercial solution and roll it out to the 51 million students in America whose future depends on the education they receive.  Typically, they lack business/sales acumen and access to capital that's required to break through the socialized barriers of public education. This may be the greatest tragedy of our time. Tragic for Educators who take the blame for education's under-performance, even-though they're under-paid, overworked, equipped with 14th century tools and when trying to solve pervasive problems, they're punished further by a viscous industry to succeed in on the business-front. It's tragic for our children who will enter an economy in decline with fewer tools and skills than generations that graduated before them. It's tragic for the rest of us who don't know the cost of neglect. We owe it to our children and to those who serve and who have served on the frontlines, protecting our freedom, to do whatever is necessary to create and maintain alignment between education and the global economy's demands.Verse Capital was created to amplify success for Educators who create solutions for public schools. Verse Capital supplies Educators with the required Business and Sales Acumen, Capital and accelerates them through Education's Socialized Barriers to Entry. Educators that partner with Verse Capital, will reach success faster, bigger and more frequently. Without these critical pieces, it is nearly impossible to commercialize scalable Education Technology (EdTech) solutions, capable of providing each of our children with personalized skills and knowledge that they must have to compete in the modern economy. Verse Capital has a solution that’s needed to align America’s Public Schools to the 21st century global economy.​What happened? The Digital Revolution reshaped the world, but our school systems were unable to adapt while countries we compete against were able to adapt and sail right past us. Our children are digital natives, but our schools use a 14th century classical education model, designed for a different time, world and people -- designed to support a wildly different, less global economy – yet, we’re still using it in the 21st century! The more successful Educators are when introducing technology solutions into classrooms, the more successful student outcomes will be and the sooner America will be positioned for prosperity again, rather than continuing as a nation in decline.THE PROCESSFirst, recognize that this is a special time for solving this problem. Before, the cost of deploying over 50 million devices, IT staff, etc. was insurmountable. Today, the Cost Barrier to Entry has dropped: 1. Computing Devices: Dropped by over 30% YoY. Devices are used pervasively. 2. Cloud: Eliminated the need for the bulk of the cost such as servers, etc. The cloud is used pervasively. 3. Broadband: 94% of public schools have sufficient bandwidth, it too is pervasive and allows the devices to connect to the Cloud. Once all three aligned, there was an influx of capital and entrepreneurs, which has died off because they learned the impossibilities of penetrating Public Education, which we have solved and we know of nobody else who has. This process is capable of generating returns that will drive the market to EdTech, increasing capital investments and Educator/Entrepreneur interest, the right way. In addition, while in the trenches doing research, building a team with over 55-years of combined EdTech Expertise, our very own backyard, Utah, gained the reputation as being ""EdTech's Home.""

Align Product to Federal/State Education Budgets: If the product doesn't fit, you have to go through legislation to get it approved. We won't work with these companies because it's a 5-years process. Plus, once we know where within the budgets we need to reach, it is much faster and easier to reach for it. We leverage Christina here, she has been Presidential Staff in the White House under the Department of Education. Few people on the planet can navigate budgets like she can. 

Sales: The most difficult thing for a new company to navigate through is generating sales and therefore Revenue, the key to all businesses and key to generating returns. Selling to public schools is like no other industry, plus since the space has been dominated by just a few multibillion company, there just aren't many people who know how to sell. Anne worked for Pearson, the world's biggest, for 17-years and where she perfected the sales process. We leverage Anne and her network to hyper-accelerate sales, which puts more capital in their accounts, boosts the valuation and therefore the return, minimizes our need to invest, reduces their dilution and ours, plus it gives us a runway, incase we make a mistake. There is no better way to do this, most companies could never get this type of a sales team.

Implementation with Fidelity: This is where it all fits together and that almost nobody even thinks about. The few companies that do get a 1st sell done, they rapidly race off to get another, not thinking about how to effectively and responsibly do an implementation to ensure the product gets used. Most companies won't get a 2nd contract or renewal because the usage is always too low. Which means the product isn't making a positive impact, if it isn't getting used. The renewal is where the profit comes too, because the first sell is expensive. So most companies don't get the usage or the profit, therefore they don't generate returns either. We help the companies develop an implementation strategy that has fidelity. 
Examples of Educator founded EdTech companies that Verse is working with:Red Apple Reading – Provides early learner reading intervention. Reading is the foundation of all learning and, if a student gets off track early, they will forever be behind. Red Apple Reading identifies when a child falls behind and intervenes, concentrating on their weaknesses. As a digital reading tool, it simultaneously works on writing and spelling skills.Tiered Systems Support – Supports a tiered system for academic, behavior, and attendance intervention, to ensure ALL students succeed. For example: Teachers needed technology assistance to effectively track mastery learning of each module, prior to falling behind, intervention is scheduled before students go home, where learning situations aren’t ideal.Schola – Provides families with the tools they need to find the school and educational programming that best aligns with the needs of their child.Stand for Kind – Believes every child deserves a non-threatening environment, and to feel like they belong. They provide tech solutions for bullying and suicide prevention, intervention and post trauma.And More – Hundreds of EdTech companies, each capable of solving a unique problem in America's Public Schools with an innovative solution, have contacted Verse Capital, needing to be amplified through Verse's proprietary process. The hold up is capital, which is why Verse is crowdfunding. The more capital donated, the sooner America's biggest threat, a threat to each American's future, gets neutralized. PERKS$5.00 + Shipping: Pen/Phone Stand$10.00 + Shipping: Pen/Phone Stand + Glow in the Dark Bracelet$25.00 + Shipping: Pen/Phone Stand + Glow in the Dark Bracelet + Sun Glasses$50.00 + Shipping: Pen/Phone Stand + Glow in the Dark Bracelet + Sun Glasses + Water Bottle$100.00 + Shipping: Pen/Phone Stand + Glow in the Dark Bracelet + Sun Glasses + Water Bottle + T-Shirt$250.00+: Verse Advocates for Innovation & Improvement in Public Education. On our https://verse.education/ website, we will have an ""Advocates"" page, where each donor who commits over $250.00 will be memorialized forever.  USE OF FUNDSFunds from this campaign will be used to do the following:

Equity-based Crowdfunding: This problem is America's problem, the people's problem. If Verse is going to generate recession-proof, early-stage returns without early-stage risk, while solving the people's problem, then the people should realize the financial gains. Depending on how much capital is raised, a portion will be used to launch a large scale, mass reach Equity-based Crowdfunding Campaign, giving each donor an opportunity to own part of Verse Capital. 

Existing Companies: A portion will be used to amplify the four companies above, getting them closer to success, benefitting more children and de-risking the opportunity for the proper equity investment that will come from the Equity-based Crowdfunding Campaign.

This isn't a huge ask but the reward we're offering is everything. We've invested years of our lives, risked everything, invested hundreds of thousands of dollars and this is it, we are ready to execute but we need your help, A FEW BUCKS AND TO SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE IS ALL WE'RE ASKING. Imagine you're standing there with a hose. You're house is on fire, your children are in it, but you're neighbors lawn in dying. What are you going to do? That's how simple this thought process should be, yet investors plow billions of dollars into other countries, other peoples problems, we fight other peoples wars, when our very own home is on fire and the resources we use to invest in other countries will be lost when our home has burn't to the ground. We won't be able to help others if we let this continue. Right now, we need to help ourselves or it'll be too late. There is nothing more important than fixing our education system right now.We have to stop throwing hundreds of millions into things like video games that use similar crowdfunding campaigns. We have to give NEW, creative projects like ours a chance to solve this problem, because clearly after nearly four decades of the same, what has been done before isn't doing the trick. To repeat it would be insanity. Education/Public Schools is not the most sexy problem to solve, product to build or campaign to donate to, but it is the most important and this is the most effective way to solve the problems in Education. Trust us, we know.  Education touches everything, the value of our real estate to our healthcare costs.  Better educated Americans will experience less poverty, lower welfare and healthcare costs, they are more sensitive to their environment and will have better skills to solve every other issue we become passionate about solving. Education is ""THE"" solution, if we get it right, the other issue will be more efficiently solved.  Please join with us and invest in America’s future.                    The Information Below is Supporting Data                         SUPPORTING INFORMATION, POSSIBLY INTERESTING FOR SOMEEDUCATION'S IMPORTANCEQ: How does America's Education performance impact each of our future?A: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS image below), Education's performance is the PRIMARY DRIVER of our economy and our living standards. A country's economy becomes more productive as the ratio of educated workers increases. America's future depends on all children. If your children did amazing in school but every other child didn't, there wouldn't be much of an economy to grow from. We Have Been Warned...A Nation at RiskPresident Reagan warned us 35-years ago:  ""Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world…. If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.”Educate to InnovatePresident Obama warned us in 2008:""Make no mistake, the future is on the line. At a time when good jobs can be located anywhere, OUR MOST VALUABLE SKILL IS KNOWLEDGE. EDUCATION IS THE CURRENCY OF THE INFORMATION AGE. COUNTRIES WHO OUT-EDUCATE US TODAY WILL OUT-COMPETE US TOMORROW. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)In April of 2018, the NAEP released 2017's assessment results, 35-years since Reagan's warning. NAEP 2017: America's ""Lost Decade"" for Educational Progress."" StatisticsHere are a few statistics from American Revolution 2.o by GSV Asset Management, to provide perspective on how America's public schools are performing:
In Math, when comparing 12th grade students in 46 countries, American students only outscored South Africa and Cyprus.
4 out of 100 kindergarteners entering KIPP Ascend in Chicago in 2010 were able to recognize numbers or letters.
In 2012, only 1 of 4 graduating seniors were prepared for college coursework.
75% of high school seniors were unfamiliar with basic facts about American government.
A U.S. high school student drops out every 26 seconds.
Each dropout class costs the nation $325 billion in lost contributions, which is equal to the combined GDP of Kansas, Utah, Nebraska, and Alaska every year.
The average graduation rate of the 7 schools that make up the City Colleges of Chicago is 10%.
70% of students who enter community colleges in the US do not graduate.
75% of US citizens ages of 17 to 24 are not qualified to join the military because they are physically unfit, have criminal records, or don’t have a high enough level of education.
There are more honors students in India than there are students in the United States.
Americans spend 33% of their money on housing and 2% on supplemental education. In Asia, families spend 10% on housing and 15% on supplemental education.
72% of Indian immigrants to the US returned home to start their own businesses. That number was 81% for Chinese immigrants.
American Education has fallen from #1 to #36 and is DEAD LAST in MATH improvement, 2nd to LAST in LITERACY improvement. EDUCATION'S IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMYWhen America's Education was #1, it fueled the economy and lifestyle we've become accustomed to. Since, falling to #36 our economy and living standards have slowly eroded. Per the BLS (image below), our labor productivity has reached a historic low. You probably haven't noticed America's lost productivity or living standards because, we've been subsidizing the losses with debt. Here are a few points that should help you see the actual health of the U.S. Economy.
Government debt is at a record high, over $20 trillion.
Household debt has reached an all-time record.
Household savings has reached a record low.
America has almost reached full employment, yet we're still operating in a deficit.
The current expansion is 106-months old making it the longest expansion in history. Yet, both fiscal and monetary policy  is being leveraged as if we were still in a recession.
Leaving us with no tools to stimulate a recovery if we go into a recession.
We're still pumping near-free capital into the market, to keep it afloat, absorbing more debt that we will have to repay and artificially inflating market values with an unsustainable source of capital.

<p>Frank Swai and Rev. Joshua laiser are the founders of Pambazuka Naisinyai School. The idea of starting Pambazuka Naisinyai School came to the mind of Frank and Joshua after seeing the challenges facing Maasai communities in Tanzania. Rev. Joshua is a Maasai by tribe and he was born and raised in the Maasai communities so he knows much about the challenges facing his communities.He says ""Education has been severe challenge in the Maasai communities as most of families don't know the importance of education for future life of their children. So we are working hard to educate parents and community in general so that they can know the importance of education. So the Pambazuka Naisinyai School is for Maasai children and nearby communities. Please join us and donate something to support this project!!</p>
<p><u><strong>Our School Started under the tree</strong></u></p>
<p>Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.</p>

<p><u><strong>Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls.</strong></u></p>
<p>Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!</p>
<p>So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.</p>
<p>Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.</p>
<p>Circumcision for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.</p>
<p>Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.</p>
<p>The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Education:</strong> Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.</p>

<div><strong><u>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT</u></strong></div>
<p>We decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them.

By Nelson Mandela
""Every Child has the Right to get better Education""​​
Frank Swai and Rev. Joshua laiser are the founders of Pambazuka Naisinyai School. The idea of starting Pambazuka Naisinyai School came to the mind of Frank and Joshua after seeing the challenges facing Maasai communities in Tanzania. Rev. Joshua is a Maasai by tribe and he was born and raised in the Maasai communities so he knows much about the challenges facing his communities.He says ""Education has been severe challenge in the Maasai communities as most of families don't know the importance of education for future life of their children. So we are working hard to educate parents and community in general so that they can know the importance of education. So the Pambazuka Naisinyai School is for Maasai children and nearby communities. Please join us and donate something to support this project!!
Our School Started under the tree
Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.

Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls.
Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!
So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.
Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.
Circumcision for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.
Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.
The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.

Maasai girls
 
Young Boys:  Young boys normally are send to keep cows and goats far away from home and come back evening everyday. Others they like to go to school but not allowed to go!!

Young Maasai Kids in the bush keeping cows
Education: Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.
Our effort made us to start building Pambazuka Naisinyai School http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz  for which this school started under the tree but with our own effort we have managed to build some two classes and bought some desks so we need to work hard to make it happen!!

WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT
We decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE & PRIMARY SCHOOL         http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz   . Already our school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils , grade two with 55 and grade three with 35  pupils and 4 teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language.

We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.

Our future plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good education.
  The importance of this campaign is to construct a school within Maasai society, also helping Maasai society withdraw from ignorance and illiteracy so a t cope with the changes of the world.

Under Construction please help a bit
What We Need 
We need to do the following so that we can get our school off the ground; Seven more classes, computer room, Library, computers, Office for the staff, Kitchen, Good toilet, Reading books, tank for water storage and bin maize and beans storage, lunch for the teachers and students, salaries for teachers, Scholarship and to build fence around the school. The estimation costs is $30,000.  ""Every bit will help""
 
Desks: We have managed to buy some desks for one class so class one will not sit on the ground again. Please support us so that we can buy more desks and build more classes!!

<br/> </h3></div>","Our Mission: African American History Textbooks in Our SchoolsAt Black History 365, our goal is to equip our nation’s inhabitants, and the world at large, with a more thorough, candid, and interwoven understanding of African American history and realities within the American and world historical contexts.  To accomplish this ambitious goal, we have created an independently produced textbook on African American history that encompasses the history of African Americans starting in Africa until today.  Our game-changing textbook, Black History 365: An Inclusive Account of American History, and its corresponding K-12 curriculum are designed to not only reveal the hidden, undertold, and misconceived portions of African American history but also to cultivate an atmosphere of being authentic with each other about our nation’s past with the intention to heal, not hurt.To fully complete and deliver a project of this magnitude to the school systems in Texas and beyond, we are humbly asking our IndieGogo community of collaborators for donations to fulfill this project.  With these funds, we will judiciously use them for a successful launch of the curriculum for our country’s schools. A donation from you gets us steps closer to providing our students a guide to navigating through American history and a special scholastic source from which they may draw inspiration.  This is our American story.  Let’s make history through the making history. Funding IncentivesPlease know that we are immensely grateful for any donation that we receive for our project to bring our African American history textbook into our schools.  Below is a list of the incentives for your gracious donations.

<p>The mission of the Creative Flow Arts Center is to encourage artistic development and the overall positive growth of our community as a whole.  Our intention is to nourish and engage the mind, body, and spirit of this population.  We will do this by providing a variety of creative and inspirational classes of all forms of art and help address the economic need of the citizens of Hamilton and the surrounding area. The Creative Flow Arts Center will focus on community enrichment by working with the community to design and create public sculptures, murals, and community gardens to beautify the city of Hamilton and provide mobile art classes that reach out to people in need in the Butler County area.  </p>
<p><b>Goals:  The Creative Flow Arts Center’s goal is to utilize art education as a catalyst for inducing joy, interconnectedness, and community involvement within the community of Butler County. </b></p> <ul> <li><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To provide a space for local emerging artists to teach classes that are open to the community. The focus of these classes is solely community enrichment through knowledge and self empowerment.  These classes will be open to all areas of the arts: dance, yoga, spiritual arts, performing arts, flow arts, music, creative writing, and all forms of visual art including but not limited to: painting, ceramics, glass fusing, glass blowing, printmaking, silversmithing, fiber arts, paper arts, and sculpture techniques. We will also offer classes based on the needs of the public: financial planning, tutoring, resume assistance and more. </span><br/></p></li> <li>
<b>To provide scholarships for children, adolescents, and women of low income families to receive free art classes. This work will encourage positive growth and change by helping the children and women of our city who are in need find hope and empowerment in creating and learning new life skills that will help them better succeed in life. </b>
</li>
<br/>
<li>The Creative Flow Arts Center will also branch out into the community to help people in need who are in long term care facilities and terminal hospital wards. The Creative Flow Arts Center teachers will go to local nursing homes, hospitals, and group homes to teach free art classes to those in need of creative activity. This will brighten their lives and open them up to activities that were previously not available. Social interaction and creativity encourages the healing process on many levels. <br/>
</li>
<br/><li>To provide a Center for community collaboration in order to create public sculptures, murals, community gardens and other projects that focus on community enrichment. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These community projects will focus on bringing the community together in a positive, constructive, and creative atmosphere with the goal of forming life long community bonds. We will start off with projects to add more trash cans in the parks of our city and to beautify these and existing trash can by painting them with beautiful designs that the students of The Creative Flow Arts Center create. We will then focus on large public sculptures, murals, and community gardens. Every community mural and sculpture team will go out into the community and ask the citizens what they would like to see in their city. We will take the community’s ideas and create something that everyone is a part of and can enjoy.  The outcome will be a stronger Hamilton with a community who respects and takes pride in their city and works together to make it better.</span><br/>

Having performed “Song of Myself” and many of Walt’s Civil War poems from “Drum-Taps,” hundreds of times for over twenty years, from memory, I have become adept at conveying Whitman's presence and dramatically interpreting his poems, enriching their meaning and making the buried gold accessible to those many who might never be able to contact Whitman in a book.</p><p><br/> At the close of the sixty day campaign, I will purchase (if I am not gifted with a used one) some type of vehicle to tour North America in.
