<p>Hussam, the husband and co-principal of The Free Syria School was a lawyer and early leader in the Free Aleppan Lawyers Association, a group of pro-democracy attorneys. After nearly a year of public and private activism to support the popular democratic movement Hussam's car went up in flames as he prepared to return home from the office. The bomb had been planted regime operatives. Hussam went into hiding with his family when other pro-democracy attorneys in Aleppo were reported killed, or worse, kidnapped and tortured.</p>
<h2>The Free Syria School</h2>
<p>Hussam recognizes that the future of Syria lies in the education and empowerment of Syrian children. With the little money Hussam and his wife Maysaa managed to collect before escaping Syria, they started a school in a Turkish border city that has become a hub for Syrian refugees and their children.</p>
<p>In addition to their traditional curriculum, ""we teach the students the difference between a democracy and an autocracy, the difference between having a say in the world around them and not having a voice at all"" Hussam explains.</p>
<h2>What the School Means to Students</h2>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the terms freedom, democracy, and 'saving Syria' are repeated in the student-prepared posters and essays pinned to the walls of the humble Free Syria School. Not only is the education free, the 300+ students are believing in freedom as a cornerstone of their national spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Emergency Appeal</h2>
<p>The Free Syria School is facing a funding gap of $8,000. With no money to renew the lease of the classrooms or to cover the meager wages of refugee educators, the school will be shut-down.</p>

<p>There are <i>already</i> a number of national initiatives organised by NGOs or grassroots movements aimed at opening up their homes and communities to refugees. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MyRefugeApp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MyRefuge</a> aims to bring these initiatives together by building a global community of people who want to help refugees. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MyRefugeApp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MyRefuge</a> will also step things up a bit: it will be like Uber &amp; AirBnB by simultaneously enabling direct connection between refuge provider and refuge seeker, as well as provide a <i>vetting </i>process with regards to asylum status and building in direct access to front line services and NGOs so that all relationships formed can be properly supported.</p>
<p>We are over 50% of the way through on building a basic prototype. We've done a lot of the backend and front end, registration process is complete for both refuge seekers and refuge providers and now we are implementing the search and communication features.

<p>If you want to join the growing global community to open up their homes,  please help us build this app. </p>
<p>If you want to get involved with the project, whether as a developer or in other ways, please get in touch with us via <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MyRefugeApp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/MyRefugeApp</a></p>

<p>Our current development plan for MyRefuge is as follows </p> <div><ul>
<li>In the next week to have a prototype ready for people to begin registering their free beds and for refugees to sign up and find those welcoming homes, in countries and cities of their choosing (based on availability of course). That is what the £1000 aims to cover. </li>
<li>In the next month, to build in App infrastructure connecting governments and NGOs into relationships between refugees and households opening their doors to them.

<li>In two months, MyRefuge to help facilitate support like language tutoring, mentoring, clothing etc from willing donors to organisations organising that kind of support in different countries. </li>
</ul></div>
<div>Of course, the more we raise beyond £1000, the faster we'll be able to develop MyRefuge so it can do all the incredible things we want it to do. £1000 will merely ensure we can get the prototype out. Thank you for your support!! </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>There are over 4 million refugees from Syria living in camps, with hundreds of thousands drowning as they try to make their way across dangerous waters to safe and secure countries. There are also millions of refugees from other conflicts in Africa and elsewhere. As humanity, we cannot sit by and watch these catastrophes unfold. Governments are struggling to deal with the problem. We believe citizens need to show governments that there is a political will and citizen resources for us to support refuge seekers in their time of crisis. </p>

<p><strong>In December, 2012, I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I currently work with “Opportunity Fund,” a not-for-profit social enterprise helping thousands of California families build financial stability, evaluating their microenterprise small business loans and savings program.

<p><strong>I have worked hard over the past few months and have secured scholarship funds to cover the program costs and most of the living expenses. I need your help getting me to India and back by funding my plane tickets and basic pre-departure medical expenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Donate and be part of this mission to change the world. Small or large, every donation helps, honestly! Your contribution will directly support the profound, positive, and transformative change happening in India today.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Other ways you can help:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If a donation will have to wait or you want to help even more, share this page with your coworkers, friends and/or family to help raise awareness for my campaign and the IDEX vision, inspiring others to join this movement. The generosity of complete strangers humbles and inspires me. They just need an opportunity to be generous, share my campaign and they will have that opportunity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can also help connect me with your friends in India. Since the IDEX Fellowship will send me to India and the vibrant people within it for the first time, familiar faces will definitely help me acclimate and learn.</strong></p>

I currently work with “Opportunity Fund,” a not-for-profit social enterprise helping thousands of California families build financial stability, evaluating their microenterprise small business loans and savings program. Their holistic strategy combines microloans for small businesses, microsavings accounts, and community real estate financing. They are California’s leading and largest microfinance provider. You can learn more about Opportunity Fund here: http://www.opportunityfund.org/ 
Additionally, for “IntrinsicStyles”, a social enterprise dedicated to empowering communities in developing nations via creative, holistic, and sustainable business, I work on business development and brand awareness. You can learn more about IntrinsicStyles here: http://www.intrinsicstyles.com/ 
 
Why and How you can help:
I have worked hard over the past few months and have secured scholarship funds to cover the program costs and most of the living expenses. I need your help getting me to India and back by funding my plane tickets and basic pre-departure medical expenses.
Donate and be part of this mission to change the world. Small or large, every donation helps, honestly! Your contribution will directly support the profound, positive, and transformative change happening in India today.
 
Other ways you can help:
If a donation will have to wait or you want to help even more, share this page with your coworkers, friends and/or family to help raise awareness for my campaign and the IDEX vision, inspiring others to join this movement. The generosity of complete strangers humbles and inspires me. They just need an opportunity to be generous, share my campaign and they will have that opportunity.
You can also help connect me with your friends in India. Since the IDEX Fellowship will send me to India and the vibrant people within it for the first time, familiar faces will definitely help me acclimate and learn.
 
Thank you!
To all of you who contribute, share my story, or have simply taken the time to read through my campaign, thank you from the bottom of my heart. My dream, a life dedicated to enacting positive, global change, has only become possible because of people like you lifting me along the way. I consider it a responsibility to ensure that your faith in me leads to our mutual benefit. We’re in this together.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""font-size: 36px;"">Our Story</span><br/>
</h1><p>Sometimes what works for everyone else, just doesn't work for you.</p><p>That was the case for the Sachs family. They wanted a school that would support their children's individual gifts, and nurture a love of learning.</p><p>A Montessori school seemed perfect; but the nearest school was too expensive and too far away. Homeschooling was promising, but too daunting to attempt alone.</p><p>What they needed was a combination of the two. Something that didn't exist.</p><br/><p></p>
<h4>But then, it did.</h4>
<p>Family Montessori
is a new idea, a combination of traditional homeschooling and a Montessori
classroom.  For half the week, students learn in a beautiful
Montessori environment. The other half, students are educated at
home by their parents. Certified Montessori teachers bridge the gap between the
formal classroom and home school by providing support and training specifically
tailored to each family.</p>
<p>There are many
families who want to join Family Montessori, but can't afford to, despite our
intentionally low tuition. This campaign is our effort to keep tuition at a
minimum and start a scholarship fund so that these families can benefit. Your
donation will help us share this amazing education with more children.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/333545/files/20140127173516-boy_wood_blocks.png?1390872916"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<h1>Our goal is to
serve the:</h1>
<h3>Child</h3>
<p>We believe
education is about a child’s social, emotional <i>and </i>academic development. Each
child is unique with their own learning style. Family Montessori engages every
child at their level, helping them develop at their own pace. Respect, grace
and courtesy are key facets of our curriculum.</p>
<h3>Family</h3>
<p>We make an
intentional effort to support the most important people in each child’s life –
their parents! Parent workshops, mom's meetings and potlucks are some of the
means we use to support and encourage our families.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>We want to help
our children become well-educated, thoughtful adults who have a strong sense of
community. Service projects like serving lunches to the less fortunate and
singing at nursing homes, provide opportunities to invest in others.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/333552/files/20140127173807-boy_on_floor.png?1390873087"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h4>Why should I
support a new educational innovation when I don’t even have children in school?</h4>
<p>We are all in this
together. Each child grows up to either become a positive <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">influence on your society or a burden to it. When we invest in children, we invest in a brighter
future for our whole community.</span></p>
<h4>Why should I
support Family Montessori when I already pay taxes for Public schools?</h4>
<p>If you have ever
struggled in school or had a child who struggled in school, you understand that
one size doesn't fit all. Although Lebanon has quality schools and our teachers
are doing a heroic job, some kids are just better served in a different
environment. We are here to serve those children and families. Do your public
school a favor: help provide an alternative for these children.</p>
<h4>Why should I
support a Montessori hybrid when I am an established Montessorian?</h4>
<p>Let’s face it, Montessori schools are expensive. We are making Montessori education affordable
for a whole demographic of families who couldn't otherwise afford it.
Furthermore, our hybrid structure helps parents understand and truly value the
Montessori philosophy.</p>
<h4>Why should I
support a home school hybrid when I support traditional home schooling?</h4>
<p>Some families
would love to home school their children but don’t because it seems like too
big of a challenge. Family Montessori’s hybrid structure gives families who
would otherwise not try home schooling, the support and confidence to jump in.</p>
<p>Like any parenting
choice, education decisions can be potentially controversial and divisive. Many
people complain and quarrel about education but that doesn't help children or
parents. We are not here to debate which method is best. We simply want to
share a completely new idea that happens to be working quite well. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our motto

<h1>Our Results</h1>
<p>There is no other
school out there like Family Montessori. A place that brings together the most

<p>1. High Quality
Education: We want our children to have an excellent education that nurtures
their intrinsic love of learning, lets them develop at their own pace and

keeping costs low, we make tuition more affordable. We want any family to be
able to participate regardless of socio-economic status.</p>
<p>3. Local
Intergenerational Community: Community is a rare and precious gift and
community thrives in proximity. FM creates a structure that allows child,
parent and grandparent generations to connect and enrich each other's lives.</p>
<p>4. Service: We
want our children to learn to give as well as receive; to grow through serving
others. FM provides opportunities for students and their families to engage in
service projects throughout the course of the year.</p>
<p>5. Judeo-Christian
Roots: Our classrooms reflect our faith traditions in terms of holiday
celebrations and prayer before meals. However, we do not offer a specific
religious curriculum. We welcome anyone from any tradition who wishes to be
part of a community of grace.</p>

<p><b>""There is a time in the life of every problem when it is big enough
to see, yet small enough to solve."" </b></p>
<p>January is National Mentoring Month. <b>Each One Save One</b> is a leader, the first of its kind – a school based, 99% volunteer-run,
non-profit mentoring program which recruits, screens,
trains, and supports mentors for at-risk children. <strong> Each
One Save One (EOSO)</strong> was started in 1994 by us, WWL-TV Morning
Anchor, Sally-Ann Roberts, and Cathy Harris.  <strong>That’s 20 years!  </strong>We
wanted to make a difference in children’s lives and recognized that if
like-minded individuals, and businesses would join us in mentoring efforts, it
would have a positive impact in the lives of children. EOSO is celebrating this
anniversary with <strong>Mentor Magic Gala</strong> on January 16 at the Hyatt Regency New
Orleans. Join us for a great time, <b>New
Orleans style</b>, celebrating and honoring our community’s mentoring heroes, both
individuals and organizations. Mentoring works! Be someone who matters to
someone who matters. Support Each One Save One, the Mentor Magic Gala and our
mentoring heroes.</p>

January is National Mentoring Month. Each One Save One is a leader, the first of its kind – a school based, 99% volunteer-run,
non-profit mentoring program which recruits, screens,
trains, and supports mentors for at-risk children.  Each
One Save One (EOSO) was started in 1994 by us, WWL-TV Morning
Anchor, Sally-Ann Roberts, and Cathy Harris.  That’s 20 years!  We
wanted to make a difference in children’s lives and recognized that if
like-minded individuals, and businesses would join us in mentoring efforts, it
would have a positive impact in the lives of children. EOSO is celebrating this
anniversary with Mentor Magic Gala on January 16 at the Hyatt Regency New
Orleans. Join us for a great time, New
Orleans style, celebrating and honoring our community’s mentoring heroes, both
individuals and organizations. Mentoring works! Be someone who matters to
someone who matters. Support Each One Save One, the Mentor Magic Gala and our
mentoring heroes.
Hear Arnie Fielkow, a former mentor, New Orleans City Councilman and former Exec. V.P. for the New Orleans Saints urge support of Each One Save One.
















A mentor helps



expand a child’s world and widen her view to more possibilities and life choices
serve as a positive role model 
a child feel heard, that he is worth listening to, that he matters
a child discover techniques and strategies for solving problems whether with learning school work or with social skills


Each One Save One is an extremely “lean” organization, usually having 1-3
paid employees and a working, volunteer board.  We need your support
for Each One Save One’s upcoming Mentor Magic Gala celebrating our 20th
year anniversary by honoring Robin Roberts, EOSO mentors, and other mentoring

<p> </p>
<p>I am currently traveling through Belize by bike, giving free art workshops in small rural villages an filming a documentary series called 'Loving Belize'. Please watch the episode above to get an idea of the work I do. I am filming episode 2 of 'Loving Belize' the episode above is from the documentary series I did in Mexico 'Mexico Encantador'.<br/><br/>I have been filming a free online documentary series about countries in Central America for the past year and a half. I believe the international media has given countries like Mexico and Belize a bad reputation by blowing the drug war out of proportion and things like pig flue and infected Mangos. I interview the man who had the mango farm the media pinpointed, he did not have infected mangos he was selling them to cheap to the US market, he is completely ruined now. Just like the Mango farmer the media is ruining many peoples lives and creating more poverty by scaring off the tourists.<br/><br/>So I film the beauty, tradition and culture this countries. I interview people from all walks of life to give the viewer an inside and personal experience through the documentary. I'm currently filming in Belize and I am discovering just how lovely the local people are.<br/><br/>The impact I make by giving art workshops in rural villages is one of helping the children gain confidence in their abilities, and because I am a foreigner the contact with me helps them have confidence in their communication skills with outsiders. Having the art workshops as part of each episode in the documentary series helps you to see all of the community for the oldest to and youngest, I've interview a man that was 106 years old for instance, It was beautiful to see how the community loved and respected him.<br/><br/>For other examples of my work you can see season 1&amp; 2 of the documentary series in Mexico called 'Enchanting Mexico / México Encantador' on the none profit 'Painting Pirates' website: <br/><br/>By donating to this fundraiser you are making it possible to buy materials for the workshops and food for me to continue my work. <br/>As I am biking and camping, and often I am invited to stay with families I met, I do not need a big budget to complete this project. As every thing I do is free, the workshops and the documentary series I do need help from kind hearted people who understand the problems I am dealing with.<br/>I hope you see the good that this kind of work does, and you enjoy watching the episode above. It's with your help and your kind donation that I will be able to continue. </p>
<p><br/>As a perk for your donation, how ever much you can give, I will mention your name in the credits of the next episode as a donator to the cause.<br/><br/>If you don't have any money to spear, then you can help by spreading the news to your friends by email and Facebook. Please take the time to click that you like the project and visit me on my Facebook to see the work I am doing right now in Belize.<br/><br/>Thank you!</p>

I is amazing how my philosophy of art has changed with her I have learned that everybody is an artist and art is a way of expressing feeling and sentiments and sharing frustration and success. I would encourage you to become part of her success by giving monetary contribution to a worthy cause.</h3>

Just like the Mango farmer the media is ruining many peoples lives and creating more poverty by scaring off the tourists.So I film the beauty, tradition and culture this countries. I interview people from all walks of life to give the viewer an inside and personal experience through the documentary. I'm currently filming in Belize and I am discovering just how lovely the local people are.The impact I make by giving art workshops in rural villages is one of helping the children gain confidence in their abilities, and because I am a foreigner the contact with me helps them have confidence in their communication skills with outsiders. Having the art workshops as part of each episode in the documentary series helps you to see all of the community for the oldest to and youngest, I've interview a man that was 106 years old for instance, It was beautiful to see how the community loved and respected him.For other examples of my work you can see season 1& 2 of the documentary series in Mexico called 'Enchanting Mexico / México Encantador' on the none profit 'Painting Pirates' website: By donating to this fundraiser you are making it possible to buy materials for the workshops and food for me to continue my work. As I am biking and camping, and often I am invited to stay with families I met, I do not need a big budget to complete this project. As every thing I do is free, the workshops and the documentary series I do need help from kind hearted people who understand the problems I am dealing with.I hope you see the good that this kind of work does, and you enjoy watching the episode above. It's with your help and your kind donation that I will be able to continue. 
As a perk for your donation, how ever much you can give, I will mention your name in the credits of the next episode as a donator to the cause.If you don't have any money to spear, then you can help by spreading the news to your friends by email and Facebook. Please take the time to click that you like the project and visit me on my Facebook to see the work I am doing right now in Belize.Thank you!
These are messages from the members of this project.
My name is Fidel Santoya
I am the vice principal of Sarteneja R.C. school. I am impressed with the work Miss Rose Robin does in educating and sharing her experience to support education through art work. I is amazing how my philosophy of art has changed with her I have learned that everybody is an artist and art is a way of expressing feeling and sentiments and sharing frustration and success. I would encourage you to become part of her success by giving monetary contribution to a worthy cause.",0.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My name is Maegan Hodge, and I am a Chinese herbalist &amp; licensed acupuncturist practicing in Richmond, Virginia.  </p>
<p>I graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in psychology in 2003, I attended National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon where I developed profound respect for Eastern medicine, and received my Masters of Science in Oriental Medicine in 2011.    </p>
<p>An incredibly special education opportunity has now presented itself - Dr. Wu Sheng’an, one of China’s most distinguished medicine elders will systematically transmit his view of life and medicine, as well as his unique clinical approach to difficult and recalcitrant disorders to a small group of 25 students from around the world over a roughly 2 week span in late August/early September of this year.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Impact</strong></h3>
<p>In a culture that predominately offers medical options that leave many with no answers, and no real way to get to the root of their health issues, being able to travel to China and bring these teachings home will literally benefit thousands of people over the course of my career as an Eastern medicine practitioner.  </p>
<p>I absolutely love that we can use these social funding sites to fund art and technology and band tours and business ventures - but just imagine what a powerful seed you are planting by funding this Mission to China.  What else could you donate your money towards that will have tangible, positive benefit in peope's lives every day for decades?  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>To Make This Happen</strong></h3>
<strong><br/></strong>Truly, I estimate this 2.5 week trip is going to cost about $5,000.  This will pay for my tuition, room &amp; board ($3500) and flights ($1500 estimated).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even if I don't reach my fundraising goal, which is only part of the true need, the fund are still going towards the trip.  I'm going to manifest this goal no matter what!!</div>

<h3><strong>It's Only Natural To Wonder - What's In It For You?</strong></h3>

<p>You are welcome to either claim some Chinese Medicine treatment for yourself, or to donate it to those who demonstrate financial need.  All treatments shall be performed at our clinic in Richmond, Virginia.  All new patients will still be required to fill out all of our new patient paperwork, and will still be subject to our payment &amp; cancellation policies.</p>

<h3>Even If You Can't Donate</h3>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello there, I'm Grant Clerehugh, I'm currently at University studying Chinese and Business Management. I first started learning Chinese in secondary school just out of interest, that was four years ago; and I have been interested in Chinese culture for much longer. Even though I have been learning for a while now I still haven't been to China, but this summer I have to go as part of my course requirement, I am SO excited about going as it's really going to progress my language ability so I can open up a chain of international language schools after I finish University. I won't be getting any funding from University, so I really need the support from all you lovely people.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>The educational trip will last 3 months and will cost £1,220 in total. Lessons will be £360(120 hours), Accommodation £300, Flights £500, Visa £60. I have been searching for months where the cheapest places are to live, and the cheapest courses are, so that I can go to Beijing for longer and enjoy more of the culture and exposure, every donation is wholeheartedly welcome and appreciated and puts me one step closer to my China dream that I have been waiting for, for four years.</p>
<p>This is the School I will be taking classes at (English option at top of page) - <a href=""http://www.hengshuchinese.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hengshuchinese.com/</a></p>

<h3>What it means</h3>
<p>I have, as I previously mentioned been planning this for months, but I have been dreaming about it for years, this educational summer trip will be an amazing experience and it will be my first time going to China, one of many I hope. So with your support I can get there at last and start to build the way to my future.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Short Summary</span></h2>
<p><span>  When I found out I was pregnant, I was elated and scared beyond belief.  My first pregnancy ended in great tragedy.  I was pregnant with twins, but due to complications I lost both boys.  I was devastated and depressed until the day I missed my cycle and thought, hoped, I was pregnant again.  This pregnancy was normal except for the fact that he was huge.  They induced labor, broke my water and had to suction him out.  The first time I saw Jacob, he was blue, he had rapid breathing and they immediately took him to the neonatal ICU.  After that, I didn't see him for three days.....I couldn't lose another baby.</span><br/><br/><span>      Once they brought him to me, I fell in love.  He was the best thing in my life and he was perfect. He went to bed on time, he never cried and everything was great until 18 months later.  He didn't talk and didn't make eye contact with anyone.  At first, we thought he might be deaf.  He didn't respond to ""Jacob"" or any other noises. The doctor said his hearing was fine. We took him to a behavioral physician who told us he was ADHD and perscribed ritalin. He became a zombie. The medicine seemed to suck the life out of him. Then, the physician perscribed prozac and he began banging his head against the walls.</span><br/><br/><span>     I decided from that point on, I didn't care what he had, he was not going to take anymore medicine.  After that, I decided to work with his teachers to try to help him in school.  Just about then, Autism awareness started to gain popularity. I started reading everything I could; and that lead me to UCSB, where they were doing research on Autism. They tested and observed him for hours and the diagnosis was Autism. They said he was high functioning due to the work I had done with him.  It was like an amazing weight was lifted off my shoulders, but now I had a new purpose.</span><br/><br/><span>    I had Jacob as well as my two younger girls, Katie and Becca and my kids were my love.  My second love was teaching. I was a teacher and I loved every minute of it.  I was a better teacher because of my son.  Until, while working at an underpriledged school in a ""not so great"" area, I contracted congestive heart failure and I haven't been able to work since.</span><br/><br/><span>    Though Jacob has Autism, he has taken to all art: drawing, clay, painting and fashion design.  He can do it all.  He started drawing before he could write.  Its like the space our brains use for  social conventions, interpersonal relationships or the 3 R's-reading, writing and arithmetic, his brain has filled with art.  He can sit and focus on a picture and he is in his own world and he is for, a moment, happy. With Autism comes so many challenges and when he is working on art he is at peace.  When you are a mother all you want for your child is peace and happiness, nothing more.</span><br/><br/><span>    My son turned 28 this year and got the guts to venture out. He applied to an art school.  Honestly it was a long shot, but I have learned with Jacob, anything is possible.  He interviewed, in his own awkward, complicated, innocent way, art in hand.  The admission reps seemed flabergasted .  My autistic son had shown them what Autism can do.  They accepted him. Again, this familiar feeling of elation and fear came back.  He could finally follow his dreams, but how could I afford it. </span><br/><span>  </span><br/><span>  This is why I am starting this campaign.  If you invest your money in my son, you are helping fulfill his lifelong dream.  Not only that, but you are showing the world what a boy, no a man, with Autism can accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>What We Need and What You Get</span></h2>
<h3><span>Funding</span></h3>
<p><span>    Every bit of the funding will go to Jacob's schooling.  Yes, he is receivieng money from the government, but the amount they offered, isnt even enough to cover tuition.  We also need money for him to live in London (ie food, transportation, books, and housing) and money for him to fly over there. You can imagine how expensive a plane ride to London is. One of the biggest obstacles is the down payment.  We must have 2000 pounds, which is 3072.80 in U.S. dollars by August 31st, in order for them to keep a spot for him.  He also needs to purchase a Visa, so he can hopefully find some work.  He has never wanted anything for free, he wants to earn it, just like everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>Perks</span></h3>
<p><span>     The biggest perk to you, in helping my son Jacob, is that you will be starting the career of a soon to be great artist of this time. You would be able to say I knew Jacob when he was just getting his start.  If you like, he would love to treat you to a piece af art, all your own.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p><span>   On a greater scale, you would not only be helping to benefit the art world, you would be benefitting the autistic world as well. Many have heard of Autism, but it is just a word.  They know nothing of its meaning or how it manifests. My son can show the world that Autism is not a disease, its a gift. Autistic people love, laugh and feel just like everyone else.  He should not be held back because of a diagnosis, both his and mine.  </span></p>
<p><span>    My son is truely a fantastic artist.  It is not only something he was meant to do, but something he loves with every fiber of his being.  By sharing your money with us, you would be forever changing the life of my wonderful, talented, loving son, Jacob.</span></p>

It is the unfortunate truth that almost everyone has been touched by cancer in some way. No matter the race, religion, gender, age or social class - cancer does not discriminate and for every person who fights the disease, there is a network of friends and loved ones who battle it with them. Often words are not enough to express what it truly means to experience cancer.
My son Ryder died just before his 6th birthday and I knew right then it would change my life forever and be the hardest thing I would ever have to endure. 

Losing a loved one is not something you get over or heal from. It is with you for the rest of your life. What you have to do is figure out how to deal with the knowledge that you have, and what to do with it.
Knowing the past and what we want for the future, 
gives us our mission!

While some mornings were hard to put one foot in front of the other, a fire was lit under me. A passion was born and set me off on a new path.
I set off on a mission to help raise as much money as I possibly can for BC Cancer Foundation benefitting BC Cancer Agency for cancer research, so that with the money we raise we can keep the scientists in the labs working toward the discoveries that will lead to a cure for this terrible disease. 
So that children like Ryder do not have to suffer as a result of this disease and dads like me and families like mine don't have to go through such heartbreaking journeys.

So how do we do that?  Well, I created cancer TAPS OUT!

cancer TAPS OUT! is a one-day submission-grappling tournament with the proceeds going to the BC Cancer Agency so they can continue towards their goal of a world free from cancer and to make sure cancer TAPS OUT! once and for all. 
cancer TAPS OUT! is issuing a challenge to grapplers of all levels to join us for a full day of round-robin no gi jiu-jitsu tournament.

For every $300 dollars raised, each participant will receive an entry for a chance to win the grand prize.
WHY?
Well I love to follow my passion and I believe with this event we can raise over $100,000+ for cancer research and the impact from that would be amazing. Literally the money we raise today could be saving lives tomorrow. I also believe within 4 years this could be the single largest tournament of its kind in north America raising over half a million dollars.
Why Me?
I'm passionate, I believe in this cause with every fibre of my soul. I'm a dad and I know I can do this with your help.
I also have a proven track record of raising money through my Ride to Conquer Cancer team www.ridersforryders.com it's my passion and my life’s mission and I just know this event will be amazing and the 1st of its kind in Canada and I'm just getting started.
Help me make history and raise thousands while doing it.
Here's why we need $23,800 which will turn into $100,000+

<p>Secondly, welcome to the world of bitcoin! We are a very knowledgeable group of American bitcoin fanatics, and we want to help the American people become more comfortable and familiar using <b>crypto currencies </b>on a day to day bases.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of launching this bitcoin community, is to make an informational, fun, and all-in-one interactive bitcoin website. We want to offer bitcoin newcomers and enthusiast alike, a trusted community they can call Home. If you need to do anything regarding exchanging or trading crypto currencies we ask that you start with us to find out the safest way of executing bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>This is the very beginning, and bitcoin is only going to become more popular. This is not a local currency that can be manipulated. It is worldwide, across the entire globe and its just catching on. Therefore, we want to help YOU, and that's also one of the great things about bitcoin. Most of the bitcoin community wants to help you too. Because as bitcoins become more widely used, their value rises as everyone has seen. The ONLY drawback is <b>SECURITY, </b>and thats where the community helps tries to help <b>EVERYONE</b>. We have heard from too many people, and have read too many news articles regarding people getting their bitcoins stolen. This is what we want to rid of bitcoin. Therefore, we have created the<b> American Bitcoin QR Deposit Membership Card.</b>  With the purchase of this card you will have a <b>1 year membership</b> into the <b>most trusted bitcoin community in the world</b>. Helpful, trusted American bitcoin moderators will personally oversee all daily dealings and member interactions. All member to member transactions can be expedited thru the American Bitcoin Escrow Service. The American Bitcoin wallet<b> card can be used for high security cold storage, an alternative wallet for backup, as well as a personal contact QR card.</b></p>
<p><b>Some of the features we will be offering are a live chat with very helpful moderators. As well as bitcoin faucet pages that give members free bitcoin just for entering in their bitcoin wallet address. Also, we are in the process of adding the ABBBB, short for the American Bitcoin Better Business Bureau. We encourage bitcoin savvy members to give credible first hand accounts of prior business dealings whether good or bad. There will be a ""Business Complaint"" file option for members. Other features that will be available at The ABC are a Forum, Classified Ads, and extensive bitcoin information and resources.<br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>All American Bitcoin Association membership cards will have the members name, member #, and optional phone #. In addition to, members can personalize 2 possibly 3 QR codes, 1 on the front and 1 or 2 on the back. You may not know that QR codes can be coded to almost anything, including facebook likes, friend requests; and automatic twitter follow. Never fumble entering names and numbers manually into your phone again. All you have to do is scan your American Bitcoin QR card and youre instantly connected. At that point all of the bitcoin perks are just a bonus, and very good ones. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>One of the big perks is the bitcoin faucet sites. For those of you who dont know what a bitcoin faucet is, it basically drips small amount of bitcoin to someone who types in their bitcoin address. However, these will be <b>lottery style faucets.</b> Therefore, giving members a chance to win <b>A LOT</b> more than the normal faucet payout of a few satoshis. Faucets are normally funded by selling advertisement space to bitcoin companies. Ideally, we will do the same. However, we will only promote 100% trusted bitcoin companies. We also operate a site that lets people/businesses list items or services for sale for bitcoins world wide. That site is <b>bittakers.com,</b> and we just launched so the listings are limited but feel free to sign up. Furthermore, The <b>ABC founded bitpledge.com for non-profits/charities/people in need</b> that want to accept bitcoins as donations. This makes it easy for members to donate the faucet money they earn directly to a charity of their choice.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"">As of now, The ABC is directing its attention to three things. Firstly: education, as a means of awakening the public as to the importance of crypto-currencies. For their lives, their prosperity, and the future their children will inherit.</span><br/></p>

We are The American Bitcoin Community/Association, and we are building the ultimate playground for American crypto currency enthusiasts. Help us finance the rest of this project to bring more attention and entertainment to the crypto currency world. The ABC allows anyone to chat, post on forums, form city to city bitcoin meet-up groups, earn bitcoin, and much more. Help us make bitcoin what it should be, a mainstream, worldwide, unregulated, currency.


   
 Let me start by saying, this product is for anyone who networks or is constantly trading personal contact information with others. A QR code can be embedded with almost anything, from web links, personal contact information, Facebook friend resquest and likes. The possibilities are endless. The bitcoin community is available if you want to know more about bitcoin. Its just a huge perk to help get more people familiar with a global phenomenon that has been compared by many to the original concept of the ""internet"". This card works as a contact card as well as a QR bitcoin deposit/cold storage wallet card.



Websites for personal QR Code Generation:

Secondly, welcome to the world of bitcoin! We are a very knowledgeable group of American bitcoin fanatics, and we want to help the American people become more comfortable and familiar using crypto currencies on a day to day bases.

The ultimate goal of launching this bitcoin community, is to make an informational, fun, and all-in-one interactive bitcoin website. We want to offer bitcoin newcomers and enthusiast alike, a trusted community they can call Home. If you need to do anything regarding exchanging or trading crypto currencies we ask that you start with us to find out the safest way of executing bitcoin transactions.
This is the very beginning, and bitcoin is only going to become more popular. This is not a local currency that can be manipulated. It is worldwide, across the entire globe and its just catching on. Therefore, we want to help YOU, and that's also one of the great things about bitcoin. Most of the bitcoin community wants to help you too. Because as bitcoins become more widely used, their value rises as everyone has seen. The ONLY drawback is SECURITY, and thats where the community helps tries to help EVERYONE. We have heard from too many people, and have read too many news articles regarding people getting their bitcoins stolen. This is what we want to rid of bitcoin. Therefore, we have created the American Bitcoin QR Deposit Membership Card.  With the purchase of this card you will have a 1 year membership into the most trusted bitcoin community in the world. Helpful, trusted American bitcoin moderators will personally oversee all daily dealings and member interactions. All member to member transactions can be expedited thru the American Bitcoin Escrow Service. The American Bitcoin wallet card can be used for high security cold storage, an alternative wallet for backup, as well as a personal contact QR card.
Some of the features we will be offering are a live chat with very helpful moderators. As well as bitcoin faucet pages that give members free bitcoin just for entering in their bitcoin wallet address. Also, we are in the process of adding the ABBBB, short for the American Bitcoin Better Business Bureau. We encourage bitcoin savvy members to give credible first hand accounts of prior business dealings whether good or bad. There will be a ""Business Complaint"" file option for members. Other features that will be available at The ABC are a Forum, Classified Ads, and extensive bitcoin information and resources.

 
All American Bitcoin Association membership cards will have the members name, member #, and optional phone #. In addition to, members can personalize 2 possibly 3 QR codes, 1 on the front and 1 or 2 on the back. You may not know that QR codes can be coded to almost anything, including facebook likes, friend requests; and automatic twitter follow. Never fumble entering names and numbers manually into your phone again. All you have to do is scan your American Bitcoin QR card and youre instantly connected. At that point all of the bitcoin perks are just a bonus, and very good ones. 

One of the big perks is the bitcoin faucet sites. For those of you who dont know what a bitcoin faucet is, it basically drips small amount of bitcoin to someone who types in their bitcoin address. However, these will be lottery style faucets. Therefore, giving members a chance to win A LOT more than the normal faucet payout of a few satoshis. Faucets are normally funded by selling advertisement space to bitcoin companies. Ideally, we will do the same. However, we will only promote 100% trusted bitcoin companies. We also operate a site that lets people/businesses list items or services for sale for bitcoins world wide. That site is bittakers.com, and we just launched so the listings are limited but feel free to sign up. Furthermore, The ABC founded bitpledge.com for non-profits/charities/people in need that want to accept bitcoins as donations. This makes it easy for members to donate the faucet money they earn directly to a charity of their choice.

As of now, The ABC is directing its attention to three things. Firstly: education, as a means of awakening the public as to the importance of crypto-currencies. For their lives, their prosperity, and the future their children will inherit.
Secondly: Getting the public more comfortable executing bitcoin transactions, the safest ways to store bitcoins, and who can be trusted with YOUR bitcoin.
Third: How to safely invest bitcoins, and gain a profit using bitcoins.


Perks for members:

-Learn the best ways to store bitcoin, and keep it safe and secure. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF BITCOIN
-Very cool, useful, and personal trademarked American Bitcoin QR wallet Card. This QR card is for anyone even if you dont want to get involved in bitcoin. It can be personalized anyway and makes a great gift for the kids. 
-Extensive information on the SAFEST sites to open a bitcoin wallet, buy/sell bitcoins, shop, and invest
-AmericanBit bitcoin mining contracts available for Black Card members
-Very low escrow service fees-free for black card members
(escrow- peace of mind member to member bitcoin transactions. The bitcoin is sent to a secure ABC controlled account/wallet, and it is held there till the seller gets the funds owed. Once funds are sent and no chargebacks are possible, bitcoin is released to buyer. We offer $500 USD insurance policy per transaction)
-Exclusive high paying bitcoin faucets for members only

This summer I am planning to attend a summer program called SOMA Summer which will take place in Mexico City from June 30th to August 22nd.</p><p>Here are some descriptions about SOMA and its summer program:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>SOMA was founded in Mexico City in November 2009 at the initiative of a group of artists who had joined forces, resulting in a unique platform in the cultural field.</p>
<p>SOMA’s task is to build a platform to collectively investigate what art can become and how it can work in different contexts. The pedagogical program seeks to create a space for horizontal, collective interaction and critical thinking, taking into account the many different creative communities of Mexico City.</p>
<p>SOMA’s mission—promoting dialogue and discourse in our society and tracking the professional development of emerging artists—is conceived as four different programs:</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>International Summer Program: SOMA Summer</strong><br/>During the months of July and August, SOMA offers an international eight-week summer program. Facilitated by artist Carla Herrera-Prats, the program is taught in English, and brings together a great group of artists, curators and art-historians from various latitudes who lead seminars and workshops. Every year SOMA Summer focuses on the examination and development of a specific topic. In an environment of intense work, participants have the opportunity to evaluate their practice through individual and group critiques, and to visit the studios of relevant artists in the international art world.</p></li>

$645 for the deposit + $645 for the rent + $250 (pet deposit) + $500 to restore electricity + moving expenses and campaign costs.

Along with your donations, you can receive unique perks from Kelly that range from individualized healing sessions, hands on energy and body work to a very rare, powerful and sacred oil treatment.  (see details blow).

Although we intend to reach the goal of $2500 in donations, if the goals is not reached, these funds will still be utilized to help us re-establish our lives in a healthy, safe, and productive manner.  My children and I are out of other options.


The Impact

Your contribution will literally save me from homelessness and give my children and I a warm, safe, and stable place to live... it will provide us a second chance at life.
No words can adequately express how much your generosity will do for my family... its the difference between life and death.  Thank-you for your Love and for giving us a second chance.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a PhD student who studies marine microbes. When most people hear the words ""marine biology"" they think of sharks and dolphins and all the other really cool stuff in the ocean that we can see. 
But in every teaspoonful of seawater there are
millions of mysterious and intriguing creatures that escape the naked eye, and they have existed for billions of years
longer than any other life on the planet. I study the interactions between these creatures and their environment. It's a lot like getting a peek into an invisible world.</p>
<p>Last year I got an opportunity to sail up the Atlantic from Barbados to Cape Cod on the R/V Atlantis (that's me on the bow of the ship, leaving Bridgetown). I took over 200 samples of seawater, each one containing literally billions of organisms. The only thing that remains now is to process these samples and analyze the data.</p>
<p>I have an offer to go to Argonne National Laboratories in November, to work with some of the researchers of the Earth Microbiome Project. This project's goal is to get as many microbial samples from as many different environments as possible: soils, beaches, desserts, rivers, even the inside of the human body. However, they're short on deep ocean samples like mine. Meanwhile, I need to get access to the equipment that can sequence the DNA of the microbes in my samples, and process all of the data into some usable format. Argonne National Labs has this equipment, and they want to help me complete my project, but I have to cover the cost of my travel and my stay there.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I've been able to arrange to stay with a friend who lives in Chicago. The funds you contribute will cover my airfare and the cost of a rental car for the duration of my stay (about a month). The lab is basically in the middle of nowhere and it's about a 40-minute drive from my friend's place in the city.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since we have passed my original funding goal, any money I receive beyond that goal will go towards sending me to scientific conferences to promote my work and help me find a job after graduating. So please, keep donating!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You get the satisfaction of knowing that you contributed to a young woman's education in the sciences, and that you helped further our knowledge of life in the ocean and life at the microscopic level. Also, contributions of a certain amount will earn you some sweet perks:</p>
<p>$1- A simple contribution of $1 gets you an awesome 1.5"" diameter sticker with an adorable cartoon dolphin that says ""Dolphins Are Overrated."" Hey, marine science isn't all about the cute stuff.</p>
<p>$25- A $25 contribution will earn you a postcard from me during my stay in Chicago, thanking you for your help in making this project possible, and letting you know how the project is coming along. Contributing at this level will also get you a sticker.<br/></p>
<p>$50- I have a few samples of seawater taken from the very bottom (about 6,000 m down) by the sampling equipment onboard the ship, from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The bottom water is very cold and very clear, and hasn't seen the light of day in hundreds of years. If you donate $50 you will receive your own sample of this water in a very pretty blue glass bottle, sealed tightly and strung up with traditional sailor's knots. Wear it as a necklace or hang it somewhere as a conversation piece. I'll also provide the latitude, longitude, and depth from which the sample was taken. Contributing at this level will also get you a sticker and a postcard.</p>
<p>$100- If you donate $100, I will list you in the acknowledgements on any academic journal article I publish as a result of this project, and send you a copy of the article if you wish. This will take the longest amount of time to receive, but it's well worth the wait to know that you will be forever immortalized in a peer-reviewed academic journal. Contributing at this level will also get you a sticker and a postcard.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be a HUGE portion of my dissertation (which will help me get my PhD, get a real job, and become a college professor). But in addition to that, I will be answering questions about the way life functions at the microscopic level in the ocean. All life started in the sea, and all life started as single cells. These organisms
represent a wealth of biodiversity, produce 50% of the world’s oxygen, and are
an untapped source of biological compounds that have potential uses in the
fields of pharmaceutics, cosmetics, nutrition, and bioenergy.  They
influence global temperature, and can act as indicators of global climate
change.  Microbes are the life’s blood of the ocean, and
of our planet. You would be helping me increase our knowledge of these amazing creatures, and contributing to a project that is studying the invisible world of microbes worldwide.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about this project to others! If I can get just 100 people to donate $12 (around the cost of a movie ticket) each, I will have reached my goal. If 200 people donate $6 each (less than the cost of a fast food meal), I will reach my goal. Let people know that they are not only helping someone complete their education, but also helping contribute to a growing field in science.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>Each day our students enter our classrooms and “travel” a world away to countries like France, Morocco, Spain, and Mexico. We work tirelessly to provide our students with a global education that brings real-life situations and culture to our classrooms. We are fortunate to enjoy an array of technology to assist us in providing this experience, but videos alone can never take the place of traveling to these countries to genuinely put language learning into practice.</p>
<p>This June, eight high-achieving juniors and seniors from urban areas of Birmingham will have the chance of a lifetime to travel to France and Spain to do exactly that as they embark on a nine-day learning adventure and language challenge. Before departing Birmingham, our students will participate in interactive lessons outside of the normal classroom schedule, in which they will study in great detail the history of these two countries and the cultural landmarks they will visit.</p>
<p>Our trip begins in Paris, from which we will travel to Monaco, Nice, and Collioure, ending our journey in Barcelona. As we visit the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, the Prince’s Palace in Monaco, and La Sagrada Familia and Las Ramblas in Barcelona, the students will participate in a series of structured activities aimed at putting their classroom preparations to use in real life situations as they interact with Spanish and French locals. They will write online journal entries about their experiences abroad and share their adventures with their classmates and community when they return as true world travelers.</p>

Experiencing all that Barcelona and Paris have to offer will push me to take advanced classes in Spanish and possibly French. This trip will also help me branch out from my home community and help me connect to a country I am not used to. I will learn so much, and it will become a part of my history that everyone will hear about in my future.</p>

Her dad, Wayne Olmstead, was only 50 years old at the time of his death. He left behind a wife, a daughter (Tara), a granddaughter, 3 step-children, 9 step-grandchildren and many friends.     Wayne worked for 29 years at Camillus Cutlery. The company closed their doors in 2007 after losing too much business to overseas manufacturers.         Wayne was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his early 40s. According to mayoclinic, ""bipolar disorder - sometimes called manic-depressive disorder - causes mood swings that range from the lows of depression to the highs of mania. When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts in the other direction, you may feel euphoric and full of energy. Mood shifts may only occur a few times a year, or as often as several times a day. In some cases, bipolar disorder causes symptoms of depression and mania at the same time"". With proper medication and counseling, the disorder can usually be kept under control. Wayne was able to live a productive life with the medications and counseling. When Camillus Cutlery closed Wayne lost his health insurance coverage and in turn he lost his medical care.     Wayne scrambled to find employment that would pay the household bills. He worked a few temporary jobs as well as taking on side jobs as he could find them. Eventually he couldn't keep up with all the bills and ended up losing his house, including most of his possessions as they bought a small mobile home to live in. He worked hard to make the mobile home a ""home"" for himself and his wife. He painted walls, built an enclosed porch, and they landscaped the small yard. Things just didn't seem to make him feel ""good"" as they once did.     During this time Wayne reached out for help several times. He spent some time in the psychiatric units of area hospitals trying to feel better. He made one serious attempt at taking his life and was given electronic shock therapy. He still just didn't feel ""right"". After watching everything he worked so hard for his whole life slip away from him, he hit one of his ""lows"" and wasn't able to pull himself out of it this time. Instead of reaching our for help, he made a decision that changed his family and friends' lives forever. If they only knew this would be the ""final"" cry out for help, things may have been different.     Tara, his daughter, as well as everybody else, was left with many unanswered questions. Why? Was it really that bad? How could he do this to us? Was there something we could have done differently? Tara researched mental disorders and suicide rates and was shocked at the statistics. She decided to start a nonprofit organization that would bring this horrible reality into the light.</p>
<p>    In April of 2011, Tara began really dealing with her dad's death. She endured complicated grief from her dad's suicide, she also found herself feeling depressed, not motivated, and suffering from many physical feelings of illness. After dealing with this for months, she found herself in a really dark place. After having suicidal thoughts, she checked herself into the local psychiatric unit at the hospital. After spending 11 days there, her visions became even more real. She met SEVERAL people that were there also in her same situation. Every single patient there got the help they needed and were able to leave the unit and live a productive life. Tara was diagnosed with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), Depression and PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). She is now being treated for all with medication and therapy and calls her progress ""successful"".</p>
<p>    Tara's mission then became to tell her story, both of her dad's suicide and her ability to get help to prevent her own suicide, and Stand Against Suicide now has a new dimension.</p>
<p>   Stand Against Suicide's main goal is to let the world know that mental disorders are TREATABLE and that suicide doesn't have to be the only option. We do this by providing educational literature to the public, promoting awareness at events, and hosting online support forums.</p>

<p>The burglars chiseled through the solid core door to access the deadbolt (an estimated 20-30 minute endeavor according to the police), and pounded a screwdriver to pop open the studio door handle lock. Once in, they spent an estimated 2+ hours rummaging through our space, stealing tens of thousands of dollars in computer and camera equipment.</p>
<p>It’s not just the loss of equipment that’s handicapped us but the loss of work. It’s hard enough being an artist in today’s economy, but we were doing it and we were working our tails off, and now some of us are left with nothing. They stole back-up hard drives from every one of us, including one artist’s hi-res portfolio of his last 22 years of work and computers that contained current projects for clients. The even stole some of our identities including credit and debit cards, checkbooks, a U.S. Passport, and tax documents for the last 10 years. Adding insult to injury, they left an insurance card on the door…commercial insurance is something we all wish we could afford.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>The arts are always the first to suffer during hard times. Add a fire and a burglary in a period of six months and this is where we, the artists of Studio 307, stand today. We’re putting this fundraiser together in hopes of being able to continue our dream of working in the arts, replacing some of our stolen equipment and rebuilding our studio to make it happen. <strong><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1l68ku0sdckzs8/stolen%20stuff.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(list of stolen stuff here)</a><br/></strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $10,000 because it’s the minimum we need. Chris needs a camera, lenses, and a laptop to shoot animation  of the monkey and rhino puppets for the web video game he is working on; Brad needs to replace his edit suite to continue work on the educational pilot program videos he has been working on for the last 6 months for the Seattle based Educurious. Your contributions will go toward these projects and more. Chris dreams of building up Seattle as a stop motion animation hub that artists from all over flock to to collaborate on projects—but he can’t do that without his camera, lens and equipment.</p>
<p>Please help us with this dream, and share it with everyone you know—especially if you know an artist or someone else who has been burglarized and knows what it is like to start at square one. We truly appreciate every contribution, no matter how small, and cannot begin to express our thanks for the support we’ve already received from so many of you. If we receive over $10,000, it would be amazing, but replacing the most essential tools will help us get back on our feet, and right now that is what we need most. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will replace pieces bit by bit, and keep working day to day in the hopes that it all comes together somehow.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Just as we were getting back on our feet after a fire in our building almost destroyed some of our careers and handicapped our ability to do work six months ago, a burglary took place in late June that kicked us right back down to square one.
The burglars chiseled through the solid core door to access the deadbolt (an estimated 20-30 minute endeavor according to the police), and pounded a screwdriver to pop open the studio door handle lock. Once in, they spent an estimated 2+ hours rummaging through our space, stealing tens of thousands of dollars in computer and camera equipment.
It’s not just the loss of equipment that’s handicapped us but the loss of work. It’s hard enough being an artist in today’s economy, but we were doing it and we were working our tails off, and now some of us are left with nothing. They stole back-up hard drives from every one of us, including one artist’s hi-res portfolio of his last 22 years of work and computers that contained current projects for clients. The even stole some of our identities including credit and debit cards, checkbooks, a U.S. Passport, and tax documents for the last 10 years. Adding insult to injury, they left an insurance card on the door…commercial insurance is something we all wish we could afford.
The arts are always the first to suffer during hard times. Add a fire and a burglary in a period of six months and this is where we, the artists of Studio 307, stand today. We’re putting this fundraiser together in hopes of being able to continue our dream of working in the arts, replacing some of our stolen equipment and rebuilding our studio to make it happen. (list of stolen stuff here)
We are asking for $10,000 because it’s the minimum we need. Chris needs a camera, lenses, and a laptop to shoot animation  of the monkey and rhino puppets for the web video game he is working on; Brad needs to replace his edit suite to continue work on the educational pilot program videos he has been working on for the last 6 months for the Seattle based Educurious. Your contributions will go toward these projects and more. Chris dreams of building up Seattle as a stop motion animation hub that artists from all over flock to to collaborate on projects—but he can’t do that without his camera, lens and equipment.
Please help us with this dream, and share it with everyone you know—especially if you know an artist or someone else who has been burglarized and knows what it is like to start at square one. We truly appreciate every contribution, no matter how small, and cannot begin to express our thanks for the support we’ve already received from so many of you.

<div> </div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now THIS is very EXCITING !!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The most important facet of successful learning and education is FEEDBACK.  You can follow DVD's or watch Youtube videos all you like, but unless you have direct and immediate feedback from the teacher or coach than your progress is severely limited.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So how do you and I get to talk on a personal level so I can give you feedback and help you succeed in your Tai Chi practice?</div>
<h3>Let me introduce you to <strong><a href=""http://www.vcita.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vcita.com</a> !! </strong>

<div> </div>

<h3>Haiti H.E.R.O.</h3>
<p><span>Haiti H.E.R.O was founded to house and educate the children who were displaced and orphaned in the 2010 earthquake.  At present the orphans are housed at a transitional facility in Port-au-Prince.  This campaign is to raise $30,000 to build the first of eight domes for Haiti H.E.R.O’s permanent orphanage.  Each of these eight buildings will be 40 ft in diameter (providing a floor area of 1,250 sq ft).   EcoShell Domes are earthquake, hurricane and fire proof, and provide a cool interior.  They can also be built using a local workforce, thereby keeping the money within the local community.  Furthermore, once the domes are completed, the rental of the EcoShell equipment will provide long term funding for Haiti H.E.R.O. </span></p>

<h3><strong>The Players</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Haiti H.E.R.O. President – Steven Kirby, Ed.D</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Steven Kirby is a career educator and strong advocate for disenfranchised youth. He holds five degrees in the field of education including a Doctorate in Education from Peabody College at Vanderbilt University, an Ed.M. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and an M.S.Ed. from the University of Miami. His history as an educator has taken him from the villages of Fiji and Ghana to the inner city of Miami. Dr. Kirby first learned about Haiti and its true needs as a mentor to Haitian youth in the Miami neighborhood of Little Haiti. As a result of his interactions with immigrant Haitian families he felt the need to visit Haiti personally to better understand the country and people. After moving to Haiti permanently in 2009 and experiencing first-hand the tragic 7.0 earthquake of 2010, Dr. Kirby realized the importance and need for a system that would help the orphans and street children of Haiti become educated and productive citizens of society. H.E.R.O. is a result of that realization. Currently, Dr. Kirby lives at the Transition Home for Orphans in Port-au-Prince working on a daily basis to provide housing, education, and rehabilitation for the street children and orphans of Haiti.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Haiti H.E.R.O. </strong>Vice President – Michele Deardorff</strong></p>
<p>Michele Deardorff holds a degree in Elementary Education from Northwest Nazarene University. She spent three years teaching 3rd grade in Nampa, Idaho serving ESL students from low-income neighborhoods. She has also been involved with various community organizations that provide care for at-risk children, especially the children of migrant farm workers. Michele moved to Haiti in August 2009 to teach 3rd grade at an international school in Port-au-Prince. What began as an overseas travel opportunity soon became an eye-opening lesson in true poverty. Although Michele had been teaching impoverished students in the US, that was nothing compared to the conditions she observed in Haiti. While there, she saw first-hand the many street children who are on their own because their country lacks systems to support them. Michele has since returned to the US, but continues to travel to Haiti, working with H.E.R.O. to create a place for these children.</p>

<p>Although Dan Hildebrand has a background in many areas of construction, for the last ten years he has focused on Monolithic and EcoShell Dome Construction.  Dan is one of world's top EcoShell experts and will donating his services to this build for Haiti H.E.R.O.  He will travel to Haiti from Los Angeles to manage the build, and teach the local workforce how to construct the first EcoShell, thereby enabling them to continue with the process for future buildings. </p>

Likewise, non-white Americans working and studying in Asia are frequent targets for racism and exoticism. In today's cross-Pacific civil discourse, there remains a clear, fundamental ignorance on both shores of what it truly means to be American, and what it truly means to be Asian.<br/><br/><strong>TASC is the beginning of a new story.</strong> We see the current lack of cultural exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan as a valuable opportunity to challenge the current U.S-Asia social narrative.

We believe that international collaboration is the key to addressing and resolving the world’s greatest needs. Each TASC conference is planned and led by a joint executive committee composed of American and Taiwanese students. By placing international collaboration at the heart of TASC’s creation, we provide a bold, inspiring environment for delegates to see and experience the power of cross-cultural partnership.Today, students from East Asia and the United States are interacting at historically unprecedented rates. During the 2011-12 school year, 14,887 American students studied in China, 5,283 studied in Japan, and 2,695 studied in South Korea. Taiwan, however, is missing from this growth narrative. While almost 15,000 Americans studied in China during 2011-12, only 820 Americans studied in Taiwan in the same year. The time for TASC is now. Even as we enter the so-called Pacific century, civil interpersonal discourse between Americans and Asians is still greatly lacking.  American perceptions of Asians as the ""perpetual foreigner"" are the most prolific form of hostile treatment faced by Asians living in America today. Likewise, non-white Americans working and studying in Asia are frequent targets for racism and exoticism. In today's cross-Pacific civil discourse, there remains a clear, fundamental ignorance on both shores of what it truly means to be American, and what it truly means to be Asian.TASC is the beginning of a new story. We see the current lack of cultural exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan as a valuable opportunity to challenge the current U.S-Asia social narrative. Our identity as a joint U.S-Taiwan collaboration puts us in the perfect position to initiate cross-cultural dialogue that engages and benefits both nations equally.議題實踐: TASC  TURNS  ABSTRACT IDEAS  INTO  ACTIONABLE  SOLUTIONS.


We believe that actions speak louder than words. Our Roundtable discussion format is designed to help student delegates develop creative solutions for the most important problems affecting the United States and Taiwan today. A 21-day excursion throughout Taiwan provides delegates with the necessary academic, professional, and experiential knowledge needed to formulate well-informed responses to these pressing issues. Each TASC conference culminates in the Final Forum, in which Roundtables present their findings and propose tangible solutions to a panel of local and global ripplemakers eager to invest in the ideas brought forth by TASC delegates.  





TASC is not your ordinary student conference. We share hotel rooms. We take public transportation. Sometimes we wear suits, but usually we're in shorts and T-shirts. We travel -- a lot. We're in it to learn and to grow; to challenge ourselves and to challenge each other. We're in it to change lives. Are you up to the TASC?Sponsor TASC or a TASCer!All donations will go towards our conference as a whole unless specified.

</div><b>MINI-MEDINA: </b>a project for the Egyptian children by the Egyptian children<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Our project started in October 2012, building ground to create a city made by children in Egypt. In this city children are the government, make the laws and the constitution, build the buildings and the streets. They select their professions adopting a role-play model, and they run the city<b>.</b>The first pilot mini-medina took place on 20 January 2013 in Cairo.</b></p><p>Today we can say that the pilot phase that concluded with the 5th mini-medina edition has been a success, and we are ready to continue and grow, with your help! In our experimental phase we have had an open mind, experimenting with the project in different locations of Cairo and other Egyptian cities: mini-medina took place three times in Cairo (twice inMuqqatam in cooperation with Alwan wa Awtar NGO, once at darb1718 cultural centre in cooperation with selmiya initiative), once in Abu Sir and once in Alexandria (with Alashanek ya Baladi).</p><p>We are entering a second phase now, with new locations, longer duration of play cities, more training for participating adults, and more children involved</p><p><b>WHO ARE WE? </b></p><p>Mini-Medina is a group of highly motivated Egyptians and long-time residents that seek to review the vision of society that Egyptian children have. For six months the core team of mini-medina (Nairy A, Mohamed el Khatteeb, Muhammad Nasr, Ulrike von Ruecker and Paloma Yáñez) has worked to train over one hundred facilitators in Cairo and other Egyptian cities. These facilitators have become the mini-medina messengers to the children, guiding the activities and carrying out different dialogue dynamics with the children to brainstorm a better city. The entire team is part of a network of alternative education facilitators in Egypt which mini-medina is trying to formalize. Up to now, all facilitators and trainers have worked in a voluntary manner. We work in Rasheed22, a coworking space in Cairo, and we continue to develop different partnerships to spread all around the city and the country!</p><p><b>ONE DAY MINI-MEDINA, PHASE I</b></p><p>January to June 2013</p><p>The pilot phase of the project has been based on our one day medina-model<b>:</b></p><p>When: Once a month in a different location</p><p>Cost to attend: Free and upon a voluntary agreement with the children</p><p>Who: Neighborhood children between the ages of 6-16</p><p>How Many Kids: All neighborhood kids are welcome. Up to now we have been working with 50 children at a time, but we aim to make Mini-Medinas for 600 children a day in the second phase of the project</p><p>Where has Mini-Medina started: Mini-Cairo, Mini-Muqqatam, Mini-Selmeya, Mini-Alexandria and Mini-Abu Sir.</p><p>Where is Mini-Medina going: Mini-Siwa, Mini-Nweiva, Mini-Aswan, Mini-Menya, Mini-Dar el Ahmar and much more!!</p><p>What do you do in a Mini-Medina day: Brainstorm about what are the feature of the city that we like and those that we would like to change, draw the ideal city, make the projects the city buildings in groups of 5 to 10 children, build the structures with recycled materials, paint the buildings, make the customs, select a profession within the city, play the city, meet other children, reflect upon the city, experiment with the mechanisms of the city, make the rules and laws, play with the concept of citizenship and have fun!</p><p><b>SECOND PHASE OF MINI-MEDINA: OUR GOALS</b></p><p><b>One day Mini-Medina model:</b> In the next six months we plan to continue using the one day city model in the new locations: Siwa, Aswan, Nweiva, Menya...</p><p><b>Play the city Mini-Medina model:</b> In Cairo and Abu Sir we will take the model to the next phase of the project that steps up from simply building the city and works more with the functioning and mechanisms of the city. We will make cities specific of different professions, for instance the craft city is a project that we are developing in Dar el Ahmar in Cairo, in this case the city will be made with wood and carton, to last for at least a week. With the aid of traditional Egyptian craft makers, who will be the facilitators, the children will be able to take different traditional crafts and spend a week experimenting with such professions. At this step the role-play becomes more realistic, and the children leave the role of city planners to become city doers, further deepening the citizenship exercise.</p><p><b>The Alternative Education network:</b> The Mini-Medina team finds it fundamentally important to develop a network of alternative education facilitators in Egypt. Such network is still maturing, and to help the process we want to create an online space where the different projects can be discussed and developed. A framework, or umbrella where the facilitators can experiment and propose new ideas to improve the educational opportunities to Egyptian children. This network would of course be accompanied by different off-line events, meetings and encounters where we can learn from each other and support with trainings or ideas, the different projects. It will also serve as a portal for new people to integrate in the network, and a legitimacy base for the work in alternative education that is being done in Egypt.</p><p><b>Online platform for children: </b>Although Mini-Medina is inclusive and free for all children of Cairo, there is a space and time limitation in every edition we do. Thus we want to create an online environment in which children can make suggestions, all year round, on how to improve Mini-Medina. The play city is their city, and they need to have time and space to propose new ideas, debate the best option among them and create effective changes to the play city.</p><p><b>Mini-Muenchen: </b>The play city model exists in over 70 countries of the world. One of the biggest edition takes place in Munich every 2 years. In the summer of 2014 we plan to take a group of 14 Egyptian children to the Mini-Munich so they can participate and explore which aspects can be further explored in Egypt. The children that go will be part of the Mini-Medina children founding team!</p><p><b>Per diem: </b>Six months down the road and our facilitators are still paying their own transportation costs and food when working in Mini-Medina. We love them for their support, but we would like to du justice to the effort of their work by providing a per diem salary.</p><p><b>Storage: </b>Mini-Medina is built upon recycled materials (literally).

We are ready to work more, but ... unfortunately the mini-medina money is nothing but paper in real life - and we have emptied our pockets.To play more, and train the needed facilitators, we need a total of EUR 8,000.-OUR COSTS that we need to cover:1- one day mini-medina model: once a month edition for the year to come will cost EUR 1,500.- (including per diem)2- play the city mini-medina model: one week craft city will cost EUR 1,500.-3- establishing and curating the Alternative Education network: EUR 500.-4- establishing and curating the interactive online platform for children: EUR 500.-5- participation in mini-muenchen 2014: travel expenses and accommodation for 14 participants (10 children and 4 accompanying adults) EUR 4,000.-6- materials storage and workspace: rent for one year EUR 500.-Total: EUR 8,000.-With this first campaign we aim to raise 50% of the total costFor the other 50% we are fundraising from various sources, including a second campaign in July/August.We are also contacting local organisations and institutional partners for financial and other support.IMPACTNot only we will be able to carry out the above mentioned steps, but we will be able to keep working towards developing citizenship and democracy values among Egyptian children!Respect: towards each other and the cityUnity: to make a city look beautiful through collective workCritical Thinking: through questioning existing structures and proposing creative ways of improvement.Independence: by allowing for a degree of autonomy, creativity sparks and ideas are brought to lifeExperimentation: how does a certain profession feel and why does s/he feel that way?Creativity: The process of building their city allows children to imagine, fly, and dream. This will help them build an original future!YOU CAN'T DONATE? HERE, A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS TO HELP US OUT!If in Egypt:

<p>Hi guys, my
name is Jeff Mitchell, founder of Decks. I’m just one member of a large team of
Dallas citizens who have been committed to bringing you that “Beats. Park Life”
mission to Dallas. Decks is the city's premier monthly electronic music gathering that is one of the largest of its kind in the country and now draws 4000-5000+ people per event. Our team is made up of Real Estate people, DJs, Music business
veterans, Graphic Designers, Marketers and just generally super cool and good
hearted people who want to make Dallas a better place to live.  </p>
<p>For those of
you who are new to Decks... think of a music festival like Coachella or
Electric Daisy Carnival who draw couple hundred thousand people, then subtract 195K
people, condense it into 3.5 hrs. and imagine it free and fun for all ages to
enjoy on a regular basis.  Not only that,
we give Big Brothers Big Sisters and Music Weapon who are great local charities a voice at our
events and also donates 10% of our net profits to them.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Decks Needs to Continue... </h3> <p></p>
<p>Decks is now
going on its third year and only happen if we get the generous support of our
fans to donate and our sponsors partners to help fund the event. That being
said, we can’t do this without you. This event production costs alone to put
this Decks on for a season is $70,000 at minimum and we really need to be able
to raise $100K per season to make this event sustainable for years to come. We do get some occasional funding from official sponsors but that doesn't cover the entire costs. That being said, we are only asking for a portion of the costs listed below for now.</p>
<p>The great
news is that if we have 4,000 people attend who donate $3 per person that will
be $12,000 per event which will allow us to continue to have this monthly event
free. Every dollar helps!  </p> </div> <div> <h3>Beats I Park I Life...The Impact (see video in gallery)</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Beats: </b>Decks is committed to serving
the community with best beats from a wide variety of music genres from the
classic funk, soul, and hip hop to all genres of electronic music ranging from
house, Trapp &amp; Bass and Indie Dance plus other World music genres like Reggae
and Samba to name a few.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>Park: </b>We want to inspire and promote
the use of our cities amazing public spaces like Klyde Warren Park where we
host Decks. Finally the most important…</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Life:</b> Its our goal to connect people
through music, enhance the culture and quality of life in our community and help
inspire one another to actively get involved in making a difference in the
community by serving others in enjoyable ways like becoming a child mentor or donor
with Big Brothers Big Sisters or giving of your time and resources to serve the less fortunate in
fun musical way like Music is Our Weapon. Decks donates 10% of its net profits
to our community charities of choice.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What Does it Cost to Make Decks a Reality?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Most of the
event costs are mainly in rental fees for the park, professional quality sound,
lighting and video, marketing and promotion costs and event insurance. Other
costs include design work, web site, rental fees for stage production, banking
fees, legal fees to operate the business, merchandise and production staff. </p>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Why Support?</h3>
<p>So why
support Decks in the Park?? Because it super Cool and fun and hey…who doesn’t
want to be super cool and fun? But even better than that it gives the community
a unique outlet to experience music in an amazing public space that’s fun for
the whole family and finally it brings the community together.</p>
<div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div> <p>We are always looking for introductions to potential partners and sponsors. Please send referrals, contacts and introductions to: Beats@decksinthepark.com</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Bigger Picture</b></h2>
<div>We would love nothing more for this experience to spread into other communities across the U.S. and into places like LA, Oklahoma City and Austin for example. We have the technology, the team and DJ contacts to make this a reality, we just need the right partner and money to make it so!</div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Closing Statements from Decks</h3>
<p>Decks is not
something we get paid to do but Team Decks do out of love for music and the
community. We truly feel that we are creating memories and experiences that will be with friends and families for years and years to come. This event has become uniquely Dallas and we hope Dallas decides to take action and donate so we can all makes this a musical legacy to last for years to come in the city! </p>
<p>So ask yourself…
Are you a music lover? Do you want to help connect the community through music

</div></div>","A Brief History of Decks In the Park from the Founder 
Hi guys, my
name is Jeff Mitchell, founder of Decks. I’m just one member of a large team of
Dallas citizens who have been committed to bringing you that “Beats. Park Life”
mission to Dallas. Decks is the city's premier monthly electronic music gathering that is one of the largest of its kind in the country and now draws 4000-5000+ people per event. Our team is made up of Real Estate people, DJs, Music business
veterans, Graphic Designers, Marketers and just generally super cool and good
hearted people who want to make Dallas a better place to live.  
For those of
you who are new to Decks... think of a music festival like Coachella or
Electric Daisy Carnival who draw couple hundred thousand people, then subtract 195K
people, condense it into 3.5 hrs. and imagine it free and fun for all ages to
enjoy on a regular basis.  Not only that,
we give Big Brothers Big Sisters and Music Weapon who are great local charities a voice at our
events and also donates 10% of our net profits to them.
   What Decks Needs to Continue...  
Decks is now
going on its third year and only happen if we get the generous support of our
fans to donate and our sponsors partners to help fund the event. That being
said, we can’t do this without you. This event production costs alone to put
this Decks on for a season is $70,000 at minimum and we really need to be able
to raise $100K per season to make this event sustainable for years to come. We do get some occasional funding from official sponsors but that doesn't cover the entire costs. That being said, we are only asking for a portion of the costs listed below for now.
The great
news is that if we have 4,000 people attend who donate $3 per person that will
be $12,000 per event which will allow us to continue to have this monthly event
free. Every dollar helps!     Beats I Park I Life...The Impact (see video in gallery) 
Beats: Decks is committed to serving
the community with best beats from a wide variety of music genres from the
classic funk, soul, and hip hop to all genres of electronic music ranging from
house, Trapp & Bass and Indie Dance plus other World music genres like Reggae
and Samba to name a few.


Park: We want to inspire and promote
the use of our cities amazing public spaces like Klyde Warren Park where we
host Decks. Finally the most important…



Life: Its our goal to connect people
through music, enhance the culture and quality of life in our community and help
inspire one another to actively get involved in making a difference in the
community by serving others in enjoyable ways like becoming a child mentor or donor
with Big Brothers Big Sisters or giving of your time and resources to serve the less fortunate in
fun musical way like Music is Our Weapon. Decks donates 10% of its net profits
to our community charities of choice.   What Does it Cost to Make Decks a Reality? 
Most of the
event costs are mainly in rental fees for the park, professional quality sound,
lighting and video, marketing and promotion costs and event insurance. Other
costs include design work, web site, rental fees for stage production, banking
fees, legal fees to operate the business, merchandise and production staff. 


Why Support?
So why
support Decks in the Park?? Because it super Cool and fun and hey…who doesn’t
want to be super cool and fun? But even better than that it gives the community
a unique outlet to experience music in an amazing public space that’s fun for
the whole family and finally it brings the community together.
Other Ways You Can Help We are always looking for introductions to potential partners and sponsors. Please send referrals, contacts and introductions to: Beats@decksinthepark.com

Bigger Picture
We would love nothing more for this experience to spread into other communities across the U.S. and into places like LA, Oklahoma City and Austin for example. We have the technology, the team and DJ contacts to make this a reality, we just need the right partner and money to make it so!


Closing Statements from Decks
Decks is not
something we get paid to do but Team Decks do out of love for music and the
community. We truly feel that we are creating memories and experiences that will be with friends and families for years and years to come. This event has become uniquely Dallas and we hope Dallas decides to take action and donate so we can all makes this a musical legacy to last for years to come in the city! 
So ask yourself…
Are you a music lover? Do you want to help connect the community through music
and make it a better place to live and enjoy? 
If the
answer is yes we hope you will make a choice to donate  $10,$20, $100, $1000 or more to
this music movement so that in can be enjoyed in
the community  for years to come.
Thanks for Listening!

Hello all! I am an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University in New York; a rising senior with dreams to make waves in the nonprofit field. I became involved in the fate of these children when I heard some starting facts about Cameroon.

<h1><b>Aaron’s Story</b></h1>
<p>My name is Aaron Samuel Mulenga, and I am 24 years old.
Originally from Zambia, I am entering my third year of a four-year Bachelor’s degree
in Fine Art and Anthropology at the University of Cape Town. <b>I have been creating art since I can
remember, mainly in an effort to share my faith, experiences and understanding
of the world.</b></p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to fund the third year of my education at UCT. Studying at UCT’s Michaelis School of Fine Art
grants me access to an art library and a multitude of art facilities such as
kilns, laser cutters, and print media facilities. In addition I am afforded
the opportunity to immerse myself in the broader circles of Cape Town’s
internationally recognised professional art &amp; culture scene. <b>These are resources that I would not be
able to find in Zambia</b>, and for that reason it is of the utmost importance
for me to be able to complete my studies at UCT.</p>
<p>My father passed away in May 2012, and his absence has put a
substantial amount of pressure on my mother and my family, particularly in
financing our education—my sister is also in university and my younger brother
is in primary school. To help my mother, I sell my artwork, assist my
lecturers at Michaelis, work as a waiter, and have applied to be an orientation
leader and a library assistant for the upcoming semester. However, <b>without
additional assistance I will not be able to afford the costs of completing my
studies</b><i>. </i>UCT does not provide tuition assistance to international students at the undergraduate level, so I'm reaching out to you, my friends and family, for your help!</p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>Upon completion of my degree at UCT, my intention is to return
to Zambia and work to expand the art scene there. The long-term goal is to open
a gallery, while in the more immediate future I plan to collaborate with a
friend in Zambia on a project to use art as a platform for disability
awareness. I believe that the presence of visual arts in our culture has the potential
to influence society.</p>
<p><b>My aim is to use the knowledge I will obtain from this degree to affect positive change in art
when I return to Zambia.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>
</b></p><h2><b>What I Need </b></h2>
<p>To cover the cost of university in 2015 I need the following: </p>

This is my story:</p><p> </p><p>I was born in 1994 in Dirhata, a small village in <strong>Darfur</strong>, in the western part of Sudan. In 2003, when the Janjaweed militias came to kill all the males, I was nine years old. My father and older brother were shot dead. I was saved only because my mother dressed me as a girl. The killers hit her and asked where her other sons were, but she said she only had daughters left: these were my sisters and I. The militias burned the house, waiting outside to make sure we were dead. My mother told us to cry and shout. The militias thus thought we were dying and left the place. We escaped the burning house and left the village. <strong>On the way, we spotted my fatherʼs body, and few meters ahead my brotherʼs</strong>. We arrived to a UN refugees camp in Chad, in which we lived together until 2007. At that point I decided I could no longer live in the hard conditions of the camp. Rather than going back to our village and fight, <strong>I wanted to study</strong>. </p><p><strong>I realized we could gain back our homes by studying, by understanding the politi</strong><strong>cal situation and how it evolved, and by coming up with non-violent ways to make peace and end the genocide. </strong></p><p>I left the UN camp when <strong>I was </strong><strong>only thirteen</strong>, leaving behind my beloved ones.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445803296/fzdefjqlxgt7rlfttv14.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>I crossed Chad and reached Libya. In the city of Bengazi I started learning English and I worked in a shop, earning some money for living. After a year and a half I moved with a friend to Egypt, where studying was cheap, according to what I had heard. But the Egyptian and Sudanese governments collaborated to send the Darfur people back, only <strong>to face either limitless imprisonment or death</strong>. I had to leave Egypt.</p><p>One day, on the television, <strong>I watc</strong><strong>hed a documentary about the Shoah</strong>, the Jewish Holocaust. The only thing I knew about the Jews was that Israel is the only Jewish country in the world. Watching the documentary, I learned about the <strong>Jewish people's past</strong>, about their <strong>being freed from slavery in Egypt</strong>, about the persecutions and discrimination they have suffered over the centuries until they were able to found their own country and live there freely. <strong>I could identify myself with this story</strong> and I had no doubt that the Jewish people would sympathize with my and my people's story: <strong>I had to go to Israel</strong>.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445803432/keedm6tyibtjiddx7wbe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>I got in touch with someone who smuggled migrants over the border to Israel. We were twelve people in the group, including me and my friend. At night, we crawled towards the Israeli part, trying to avoid the Egyptian soldiers. Then, suddenly, someone in the group got panicked: he jumped to his feet and started shouting. Three bullets in the head, shot by the soldiers, killed him on the spot. The soldiers now came in our direction and <strong>we had no choice but to start running towards the Israeli border fence and hope that the</strong><strong> bullets would not hit us. </strong>We dropped everything we had and <strong>ran, ran ran</strong>. <strong>My friend and I ran as fast as we could, holding hands</strong>. On the way, another man in the group was shot dead, followed by his fellow who came back to assist him. The rest of us reached the border fence and climbed on it. The Israeli soldiers gave us water and treated our wounds.</p><p>I was taken to a prison, where I spent a month and a half in the adults section. When I was released, I got a temporary visa and moved to Tel Aviv, where I lived without any clear purpose. But I kept learning English. In 2010 <strong>I moved to Yemin Orde, a youth village that provides migrants and refugees with a place to live in</strong> and with the possibility to study. <strong>I felt safe for the first time</strong> since I had arrived to Israel. I learned Hebrew and did high school there. In 2014, I finished my exams. Since then, <strong>I have been volunteering</strong> in the village, <strong>trying to give back at least some of what I</strong><strong> have received there so generously</strong>.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445803597/toyn7ap5guhaj08efqwt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Now I would like to make the next step and acquire higher education</strong>.

This is my story: I was born in 1994 in Dirhata, a small village in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan. In 2003, when the Janjaweed militias came to kill all the males, I was nine years old. My father and older brother were shot dead. I was saved only because my mother dressed me as a girl. The killers hit her and asked where her other sons were, but she said she only had daughters left: these were my sisters and I. The militias burned the house, waiting outside to make sure we were dead. My mother told us to cry and shout. The militias thus thought we were dying and left the place. We escaped the burning house and left the village. On the way, we spotted my fatherʼs body, and few meters ahead my brotherʼs. We arrived to a UN refugees camp in Chad, in which we lived together until 2007. At that point I decided I could no longer live in the hard conditions of the camp. Rather than going back to our village and fight, I wanted to study. I realized we could gain back our homes by studying, by understanding the political situation and how it evolved, and by coming up with non-violent ways to make peace and end the genocide. I left the UN camp when I was only thirteen, leaving behind my beloved ones.I crossed Chad and reached Libya. In the city of Bengazi I started learning English and I worked in a shop, earning some money for living. After a year and a half I moved with a friend to Egypt, where studying was cheap, according to what I had heard. But the Egyptian and Sudanese governments collaborated to send the Darfur people back, only to face either limitless imprisonment or death. I had to leave Egypt.One day, on the television, I watched a documentary about the Shoah, the Jewish Holocaust. The only thing I knew about the Jews was that Israel is the only Jewish country in the world. Watching the documentary, I learned about the Jewish people's past, about their being freed from slavery in Egypt, about the persecutions and discrimination they have suffered over the centuries until they were able to found their own country and live there freely. I could identify myself with this story and I had no doubt that the Jewish people would sympathize with my and my people's story: I had to go to Israel.I got in touch with someone who smuggled migrants over the border to Israel. We were twelve people in the group, including me and my friend. At night, we crawled towards the Israeli part, trying to avoid the Egyptian soldiers. Then, suddenly, someone in the group got panicked: he jumped to his feet and started shouting. Three bullets in the head, shot by the soldiers, killed him on the spot. The soldiers now came in our direction and we had no choice but to start running towards the Israeli border fence and hope that the bullets would not hit us. We dropped everything we had and ran, ran ran. My friend and I ran as fast as we could, holding hands. On the way, another man in the group was shot dead, followed by his fellow who came back to assist him. The rest of us reached the border fence and climbed on it. The Israeli soldiers gave us water and treated our wounds.I was taken to a prison, where I spent a month and a half in the adults section. When I was released, I got a temporary visa and moved to Tel Aviv, where I lived without any clear purpose. But I kept learning English. In 2010 I moved to Yemin Orde, a youth village that provides migrants and refugees with a place to live in and with the possibility to study. I felt safe for the first time since I had arrived to Israel. I learned Hebrew and did high school there. In 2014, I finished my exams. Since then, I have been volunteering in the village, trying to give back at least some of what I have received there so generously.Now I would like to make the next step and acquire higher education. I have already been accepted to undergraduate studies in the prestigious Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC).Studying is the reason I why left the camp in Chad. Despite all the difficulties I encountered ever since, I have never forgotten this goal and dream. I learned hard to get good grades in high school, and also the acceptance to the two institutions of higher education is the fruit of hard work. I want to have a degree in political science and international relations. I want to go back to my country and help my people live in peace on their land. I want to build a bridge between my first homeland, Africa, and my second one, Israel – the country of the people who I am still convinced can best identify with my situation, since they had precisely the same unfortunate experience.While I am pursuing my goals, I am not forgetting my brothers and sisters who have gone through the same hell like me.

I am also not forgetting the youth village that has given me the possibility to live well and study.

</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Making an Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Deforestation is a huge problem in Zambia and Africa. The effects of deforestation are reduced biodiversity, desertification, disrupted water cycles, increased greenhouse gas emissions and disrupted livelihoods. Natural forests are cut down and made into charcoal fuel for cooking. In order to decrease pressure on forests an alternative to charcoal fuel is essential. A viable and cheaper alternative is to use fuel made from waste biomass and renewable energy sources. </li>
<li>We are already making an impact. To date in Zambia, we have sold 2000 domestic pellet stoves to middle and low income households who are now no longer dependent on charcoal. Since July 2014 the University of Zambia, the Olympic Youth Development Center and Silva Catering (Lusakas largest catering firm) have replaced their out-of-date charcoal stoves with our modern pellet burning stoves.</li>
<li>
<b>Six tons of virgin forest are cut down to make one ton of
charcoal</b>. Substituting this one ton of charcoal will leave 6 tons of forest
standing and reduce CO2 emissions by more than 4 tons. </li>
<li>A typical school uses 500 kg to a 1 ton of charcoal per month. 1 ton of
charcoal costs 1 650 Kwatcha, or 288 US dollars (even more in the rainy
season). When using a modern pellet stove, 200 kg of pellets will give the same
amount of cooking at a cost of 94 US dollars, <b>a saving of up to 194 US dollars per month</b>.</li>
<li>Though small by Western standards, we have one of Africas largest pellet
plants with the capacity to produce enough pellet fuel to replace charcoal for
all the schools and orphanages in Lusaka.</li>

On campus, I am a member of the Longhorn Scholars Program, Liberal Arts Honors, and an active voice within the African & African Diaspora Studies department. I would like to graduate from this university imbued with the strength of my ancestors and knowledge of their achievements, a better understanding of both my tongues (English & Spanish), and a plan to continue my creative pursuits. Please help me finish the work I have started!Other Ways You Can HelpI realize some of us have access to more or less resources than others, so if you are not able to contribute financially, please share this link with your friends & family & social media! Help spread the word! I appreciate support in all the forms that it comes.Thank you!- Ariana",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

the people that provide children's activities for 7 years and we have presented
over 200 awards across the world with hundreds of thousands nominations and votes cast.  <br/><br/>Even
Susan Boyle supported our <a href=""http://www.whatson4littleones.co.uk/awards.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What’s On 4 Junior awards</a>
in 2013 and promoted a group based in Scotland that went on to win Most Outstanding Baby
&amp; Toddler Group!<br/><br/><strong></strong><h1><strong>Activities make a difference</strong></h1><p></p><p></p><p>Through
our websites and awards we have seen first-hand how much the thousands of
activities running every day mean to the parents and children.  </p><p></p>
<p>Just a
few of the reasons why activities for our young children are so
important:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Socialisation
and learning life skills</p></li>
<li><p>Support
network for parents</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce
music, dance, sport, art, arts, education, language and more - fostering interest from a young age</p></li>
<li><p>Parents
and children doing an activity together and enjoying quality, focussed time </p></li>
<li><p>Improve
health and well-being for all the family - at a time when obesity levels are of on going concern</p></li>
</ul><p>But don’t
take our word for it, this just a taste of some of the heart-felt reasons
parents gave in 2013 for nominating their local activities in our awards:</p>
<p><em>“This class has changed my sons life - he has become
confident- sociable and he has learnt colours and numbers through this great
class”<br/><br/>
“Amazing opportunity for little ones to
be exposed to foreign languages. I take my six month baby and we sing songs -
listen to stories and play games/crafts. Good fun but educational- providing
something our schools lack.”</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>“She dedicated so much time and effort
in to her classes and really has enriched new parents life's and offered
support not just a weekly class x”<br/><br/>
“A fantastic pre-school fitness and dance programme that all mums should know
about!  It really gets them moving for
the entire session.”<br/>
“The classes are so much fun and so educational.  The children really get a lot out of them.”</em></p><em>
</em><p><em></em></p><p><em><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/287658/files/20140102095428-Winner_small.jpg?1388685268"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><em>“Jenny
works so hard to give every baby a wonderful experience - every
week without fail. She takes time to get to know each child and parents feel
welcome as a result. Every class that my baby and I go to really is the
highlight of our week! All our friends love her sessions too. Everyone needs a
jenny in their life.”</em><p></p>
<p>And there
is another side to the benefits of activities -  many are led by Mums and Dads
looking for a way to earn a living whilst working flexibly around their
families and this is goes to the heart of What’s On 4 too.</p>
<p></p><h1>Giving the gift of education, activity and fun!</h1><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits to the parents and young children and the
activity leaders themselves are immense SO we want to do even more to help families
get out there and try new activities and classes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of
the ways we can do this is launch a multi-activity gift voucher to encourage
more families to try new activities in their local area.<span>  Friends and family can give the gift vouchers
as a present and it is a great alternative to the latest plastic toy or video
game.  There is an already strong and
growing trend of giving experience days and leisure vouchers and our gift
vouchers would be very similar.</span></p>
<p>The gift
voucher will be purchased on-line via our websites and can be used with 1000s of
activities.<span>  We will use our huge
database of activities and our close connections with the biggest providers to
sign up 100s of companies and individuals that offer these activities and
classes.  </span></p><p><span>Activities we work with include Baby Sensory, Jo Jingles, Monkey Music, Water Babies, Gymboree, LCF Clubs, Little Kickers, Socatots, Debutots, Talking Tots, TinyTalk, Sing and Sign, Baby College, Tumble Tots, Musical Minis, Creation Station, Caterpillar Music, Mad Academy, Diddidance and many, many more.<br/><br/>But don't forget you have a no-quibble guarantee that you will receive a full refund if the activity where you want to spend your gift vouchers is not accepting them.<br/></span></p><p><span>We can even promote the gift vouchers as a present on our party website <a href=""Http://www.whatson4kidsparties.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.whatson4kidsparties.co.uk</a></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289270/files/20140103081135-All_Gift_vouchers_smaller.jpg?1388765495"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

We will start in the UK but then rapidly roll out the gift vouchers across our
websites in Ireland, Australia, Singapore and Switzerland, and new countries as
they join us.<p></p>
<p>So far we
have tested the concept by running a small promotion in November and December
in the UK, Ireland, Australia in Singapore promoting individual activities gift
vouchers in the run up to Christmas.<span>  <br/><br/>
Many companies offer gift vouchers for their own activity but there is no combined
gift voucher scheme that we know of anywhere in the world.  We would be ground-breaking just like we were
with our What’s On 4 Awards over 7 years ago.<br/></span></p><p><span>

people out there making a difference by providing brilliant activities both commercially

have grown and grown and it is our pleasure that we continue to recognise

Our gift vouchers would give many more parents and their young children a

<li><p>Tech – We have quite a bit of work here to design, build and test this lot but it will be worth it:  create a gift voucher purchase and fulfilment area of our websites, a gift voucher validation area within our new app and update our websites to enable gift voucher holders to find activities where their vouchers can be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Partners – Create a prospectus and sign up our activity providers, many have given early indications they want to be part of the scheme.  There is no cost to the providers, we just take a commission from the redeemed vouchers.</p></li>

<p><b><b>Thai Education </b></b></p>
<p>A few weeks ago I went to Thailand for a month long adventure. I had won
a travel grant through my high school. Without the grant I would not have been
able to travel to the most beautiful country I have ever seen or meet such wonderful children.
I traveled with Rustic Pathways on a trip called <i>Come with Nothing, Go Home
Rich. </i>The program name is not a joke. If you come, you can
only pack one light bag. I quickly became close friends with Julie who is currently working on this project with me. During our trip we stopped at the Rustic Pathway's
Children Home. Here is some of the background history about the Children's
Home. </p>
<p>""In 2001, David Venning – the Chairman and Founder of Rustic
Pathways – stumbled across the Baan Rai School, which provides an education and
support system for more than 300 Karen children. Since then, Rustic has supported
this school and come to love these children and the amazing teachers who
sacrifice so much to give them an education and an opportunity for a better
life. They are respectful, gentle, happy young folks with great spirits and
broad smiles.</p>
<p>To celebrate its 25th anniversary in 2008, they began construction on a
new facility that serves as a boarding house. Since then, a total of 49
students have been supported through the Children’s Home. Their mission is to
provide these students the opportunity to graduate high school and increase
their likelihood of attending a facility of higher education and learning
skills to better prepare them for adult life.</p>
<p>Rustic Pathways supplies accommodation, covers operating costs such as
electricity and water, and provides several full-time supervisors at the
facility to oversee the needs of the children. Rustic Pathways welcomes
sponsors who can step in to cover food costs and school fees for the sponsored
child.""</p><p>(Source: <a href=""http://www.rusticpathways.org/hilltribesupport.html)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rusticpathways.com/thailand/the-hill-tribe-support-project)</a></p>
<p>Once Julie and I came back home we started thinking about ways to give
back to the Thai children we had met. Finally we figured out what we wanted to
do. We decided we would raise money to sponsor Thai children and help them get
the education they deserve.  </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The money we raise here will go directly to The Child Sponsorship
Program through Rustic Pathways. The cost of a one-year sponsorship for
one child is US $ 550 – about $ 1.50 per day.  This cost covers food for
the child we sponsor, school uniforms, school fees, and a weekly allowance for
the child to use for personal items. More than that, it enables a child to
receive the intangibles of the Rustic Pathways Children’s Home - loving staff,
close friends, a window into the outside world, and a path to a brighter future
for themselves and their Karen people. This is where you all come in. We are
hoping to sponsor at least <b>two children</b> this year. </p>
<p><b>The additional money
will be used to pay for the second year of education for the two

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>""The Karen people are one of many Hill Tribe groups who have lived in the
mountains along the Thai-Burma border for centuries.  Karen people living
on the Thai-side of the border have long been marginalized by Thai authorities
and have struggled to gain access to basic public services like health care and
education. The Karen people living on the Burma-side of the border face violent
persecution at the hands of the ruling junta. Many Karen youth are struggling
to balance the recent past in which their parents lived in a subsistence economy
in traditional, isolated Karen villages with their goals for a future in an
increasingly modern and global world. They need earnest support, strong
education, and to develop relevant skills to enable them to take an active role
in the larger Thai society, as well as contribute to the development and
preservation of their home-villages and precious culture.</p>
<p>Many Karen children must leave their families behind and travel to urban
areas to continue their education. Most Karen families, thrust into an economy
without the resources or skills to compete, are now poor, and they cannot
support the basic costs for further education in urban centers, such as food,
housing, uniforms and books or basic spending money. These young children live
on the edges of urban life as they seek access to affordable, quality and
relevant education that will enable them to find employment to support their
families and build a future.""</p><p>(Source: <a href=""http://www.rusticpathways.org/hilltribesupport.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rusticpathways.org/hilltribesupport....</a>) </p>

</div></div>","Thai Education 
A few weeks ago I went to Thailand for a month long adventure. I had won
a travel grant through my high school. Without the grant I would not have been
able to travel to the most beautiful country I have ever seen or meet such wonderful children.
I traveled with Rustic Pathways on a trip called Come with Nothing, Go Home
Rich. The program name is not a joke. If you come, you can
only pack one light bag. I quickly became close friends with Julie who is currently working on this project with me. During our trip we stopped at the Rustic Pathway's
Children Home. Here is some of the background history about the Children's
Home. 
""In 2001, David Venning – the Chairman and Founder of Rustic
Pathways – stumbled across the Baan Rai School, which provides an education and
support system for more than 300 Karen children. Since then, Rustic has supported
this school and come to love these children and the amazing teachers who
sacrifice so much to give them an education and an opportunity for a better
life. They are respectful, gentle, happy young folks with great spirits and
broad smiles.
To celebrate its 25th anniversary in 2008, they began construction on a
new facility that serves as a boarding house. Since then, a total of 49
students have been supported through the Children’s Home. Their mission is to
provide these students the opportunity to graduate high school and increase
their likelihood of attending a facility of higher education and learning
skills to better prepare them for adult life.
Rustic Pathways supplies accommodation, covers operating costs such as
electricity and water, and provides several full-time supervisors at the
facility to oversee the needs of the children. Rustic Pathways welcomes
sponsors who can step in to cover food costs and school fees for the sponsored
child.""(Source: http://rusticpathways.com/thailand/the-hill-tribe-support-project)

A $5 Tax Deductible Donation Brings the Joy of Oneness to More Than 3,500 People! What is Oneness?Oneness is the transfer of universal energy that has been scientifically proven to reduce mind chatter and stress, and increase peace, love, and joy. How does it work?There are two ways this universal energy is transferred:

Trained Blessing Givers act as a conduit to transfer the universal energy into the receiver. 


Trained Oneness Meditators (OMers) have the ability to transfer the universal energy through their gaze. 

The EventOn May 17 people from all walks of life who can benefit from the gifts of Oneness are coming together at Speckles Organ Pavilion from 10 AM to Noon to experience Oneness through blessings and meditations. We're in the process of inviting people from: 
Recovery Programs and 12-Step Groups
Women's and Homeless Shelters
Active Military, Veterans and their families
Healthcare and Alternative Health Providers
Schools and Higher Education.

How it all started ...Hi, my name is Deepaa Maria Mazzi and I'm a yoga therapist/teacher, sound bath facilitator and Oneness Blessing Giver. 

(Deepaa in front of the Oneness Temple at Oneness University in southern India.)Two years ago, Doug Bentley, a monk from the Oneness University in India, asked the Oneness communities across North America to reach out and expand Oneness into their greater communities so that more people can experience Oneness. In that moment, I saw the Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park filled beyond capacity - with all the seats taken and people standing in the back and on the wings. Everyone was receiving the blessings of Oneness. When I saw this vision, I felt awed and elated - and I wanted to know how to make this happen. This vision kept popping up over the next two years - getting stronger, clearer, and more compelling each time I saw it. I had to go to India to talk to Doug. He told me, if the Divine gave me this vision, it was an invitation and my choice to accept that invitation or not. I chose to accept. The ImpactYour incredibly gracious tax deductible contributions enable us to introduce the blessings of Oneness in a massive way to more than 3,500 people!    We'll be at the Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park live Saturday, May 17; 10:00am - Noon PST and via Livestream for people worldwide to experience Oneness with us. The Livestream address is: www.liveOMTV.comAt the Event there will be:

<h3>The Energy Crisis</h3>
<p>The current energy supply infrastructure in each hospital provides <b>precarious, unpredictable and unreliable power</b> to the most critically ill and vulnerable members of Palestinian society, particularly during periods of conflict, when there are drastic increases in Emergency Department, Operating Room and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. Securing a sustainable and reliable energy source to power these critical units is necessary in order to provide <b>safe emergency and intensive medical care.</b></p>
<h3>The Solar Energy Solution</h3>
<p>Providing Gaza’s hospitals with a source of <b>sustainable, reliable and renewable energy</b> will decrease risks to the most vulnerable patients. Solar powered energy systems provides an eco-friendly, renewable and sustainable alternative, replacing expensive and unreliable emergency power provided by dirty and expensive diesel generators.</p>
<p>The long-term conversion to solar-powered energy will guarantee a working and self-supporting power supply to the hospital's daily operation.</p>

<h3>The Objective: Empower Gaza</h3>
<ol>
<li>Empower Gaza to run the most critical units in hospitals 24 hours a day without the need for expensive diesel.</li>
<li>Empower Gazans to have a renewable, reliable source of energy for intensive care units, operating rooms and emergency departments.</li>

<h3>Empowering Gaza: One Major Obstacle is Funding</h3>
<p>EmpowerGAZA is a joint initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Islamic Relief Canada to provide a renewable, reliable source of energy for intensive care units (ICUs), Operating Rooms and Emergency Departments.</p>
<p>We have planned as much as possible for the success of this project. The UNDP will be handling the logistics on the ground and we have all permits and permissions necessary to move forward.</p>
<p><b>The next important step</b> for the project to succeed is <b>raising the funds</b> to complete the project.</p>
<p>Each hospital will cost USD$200,000 (with the exception of the larger European Hospital which will cost $600 000 USD), with solar panels to go up beginning January 2016.</p> This Indiegogo campaign aims to fund the first hospital, with stretch goals to fund the other three.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello, our names are Lily and Rachel and we are both undergraduate students at Mills College in Oakland, CA. </p>
<p>A little about Lily is that she is majoring in nursing with the hope to work in low income districts around the United States, with a focus on the social determinants of health in specific communities as well as working on international level to help provide accessible healthcare to mothers and children. Lily has been to Haiti and worked in the Reveil Matinal Orphanage twice since the winter of her senior year in high school in 2011. She is passionate about continuing to be a part of the girls lives as they grow up. <br/></p>
<p>A little about Rachel is that she is double majoring in Public Policy and Environmental Science, and minoring in Spanish and Spanish American Studies. She aspires to become a senator and reform public education in California, as well as improve environmental legislation, and make a link in communities between environment and education. She has been on a service trip to Costa Rica to build recreational facilities for children in a public school in Copey, Costa Rica. She has also lived in Mexico and worked on an organic farm their to understand the links between agriculture and education. </p>
<p>We both want to go to Haiti to work on building a new and improved orphanage for the girls so that they will have more living and playing space, be able to have their own garden, and be in a safer area of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The winter of 2013, will be the time when Rachel and Lily are on their holiday break from college, and will also be the time that the new orphanage will be in it's beginning stages of construction. </p>
<p>With your support of our endeavor you will be directly helping the twenty-three girls of the Reveil Matinal Orphanage have a new home with more space to live and play. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we are fundraising for is to pay for our plane tickets to fly to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, along with money for some the building materials that we will need to purchase when in Haiti. </p>
<p>We need $1000 each for the plane tickets. This is because a ticket to Haiti can range from $600-$1000 plus the extra cost of luggage, because they charge heavily for the extra baggage around holiday season when traveling to Haiti. </p>
<p>We then need money to pay for a driver while in Haiti, which can be expensive. </p>
<p>Also every time volunteers go to the orphanage, they bring the materials that the girls need for school, such as binders, pencils, books (in French and English), pens, paper, etc. This is something that we would like to be able to bring them as a Christmas Present, along with board games, and other activities. </p>
<p>In previous years, when the orphanage receives gifts for the girls, even when it is as simple as a new toothbrush, or a rope for jump roping, the girls will light up and be so grateful for the small gift you have given them. </p>
<p>The money adds up fast when shopping for twenty-three young girls so we are hoping to reach our goal of $4000, but if we can't then all the money we raise will be sent to the orphanage to ensure that they have enough food and water to get through the winter, as this is always a constant worry. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because Lily has gone to Haiti twice already she can ensure that the orphanage is a well run, established house in Haiti, which keeps its girls safe and is providing them with an education at a private school in Haiti, which is not something that happens for many children in Haiti. The orphanage believes in not dislocating the girls out of their country to have a ""better life"" in the States, but to educated them in their own country so that these young ladies can become some of the next leaders of Haiti. </p>

<p>To help spread the wealth of knowledge in this book Nicole and the ""Are You In Inc Team"" are setting out to create a multi-market book tour. Already being received greatly by Universities and professional conference around the nation, the ""Are You In Inc"" team understands that this powerful tool can not only inform but inspire and wants to touch as many people as possible.  </p>

<h2>About Us:</h2>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT IN HELPING US FUND OUR PRODUCTION TO END BULLYING! IT COULD BE YOUR CHILD WHO NEEDS TO SEE THIS PLAY!</h3>
<h3>Imagine being the parent of a child who commits suicide because they are bullied 'to death' due to their race, sexuality, body type, social status, learning ability, etc. Help us change the lives of your children!</h3>
<p>We are an edutainment organization stationed in Montgomery, Alabama. Southern Soul Performing Education Association (SSPEA) is comprised of EDUCATORS, directors, and performers committed to producing life altering performances. It is the mission of this collective to reach EVERY child in the world, one performance at a time.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Bullying and the lack of positive self-esteem and self love are an epidemic in our youth.</h3>
<p><br/>SSPEA strives to produce innovative live theater, film, musical productions, camps, seminars, and workshops with impactful messages that transcend any particular gender, race, class or culture. They simply want to speak to the HUMAN experience by tapping into the emotions that foster introspection and positive change. With the primary focus being to serve as the village that assists in instilling knowledge, wisdom, morals and values in today’s youth, this group has worked hard to create a production that will lead to a generation of socially conscience and productive citizens.</p>
<h3>""This Skin I'm In"" is a production aimed at beating down the statistics related to the casualties of bullying and low self esteem. As the producers of this production, we have been bullied and we have bullied, and for that reason we are dedicated to ending the cycle.</h3>

</div></div>","About Us:
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT IN HELPING US FUND OUR PRODUCTION TO END BULLYING! IT COULD BE YOUR CHILD WHO NEEDS TO SEE THIS PLAY!
Imagine being the parent of a child who commits suicide because they are bullied 'to death' due to their race, sexuality, body type, social status, learning ability, etc. Help us change the lives of your children!
We are an edutainment organization stationed in Montgomery, Alabama. Southern Soul Performing Education Association (SSPEA) is comprised of EDUCATORS, directors, and performers committed to producing life altering performances. It is the mission of this collective to reach EVERY child in the world, one performance at a time.

Bullying and the lack of positive self-esteem and self love are an epidemic in our youth.
SSPEA strives to produce innovative live theater, film, musical productions, camps, seminars, and workshops with impactful messages that transcend any particular gender, race, class or culture. They simply want to speak to the HUMAN experience by tapping into the emotions that foster introspection and positive change. With the primary focus being to serve as the village that assists in instilling knowledge, wisdom, morals and values in today’s youth, this group has worked hard to create a production that will lead to a generation of socially conscience and productive citizens.
""This Skin I'm In"" is a production aimed at beating down the statistics related to the casualties of bullying and low self esteem. As the producers of this production, we have been bullied and we have bullied, and for that reason we are dedicated to ending the cycle.
 What We Need & What You Get:




The funds we are seeking for this project will go towards our mission to put this play in front of every child we can. Your financial blessing will fund the following:





Copyrights and licenses


Set contruction and materials


Costumes and props


Rehearsal fees


Travel expenses


Marketing/Promotions


Correspondence duplication


Actors fees


Technical staff





Every contributor is special to us, and every dollar matters. Here's what your support will get you.





The ability to say, ""I helped to end bullying and promote self love""


EVERY individual who contributes will be listed as a supporter on our organization's website (unless they request anonymity).


A contribution of at least $100.00 will earn a special limited edition t-shirt in support of anti-bullying.


Higher level contributions come with a complete package of paraphernalia and gifts along with marketing and promotional opportunities.  (Full package details available by emailing SouthernSoulEducators@gmail.com)


Additional perks to come!



In the event that we do not reach our goal of 15,000.00, we will use the funds raised to put a dent in as much of our production costs as possible.  We never stop producing quality edutainment and we have a season of performances we will be producing for 2012-2013.


The Impact:
WE ARE THE CHANGE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE! We teach through performance and we mentor through our daily lives.

<p>My name is Wendy Miller and I moved to Belize in January 2012.  I am a real estate agent here and during the course of my daily interactions I have come to meet and know several bright young individuals who just need a break. </p>
<p>During my time here I have learned a few things about Belize, including how the education is funded.  I feel strongly about the power of education, especially in the education of young women.  It has been documented in countries around the world that education of the young women goes a long way to improving the lives of the community in which they live.</p>
<p>For now I would like to set up a campaign to help one young lady in Punta Gorda.  Her name is Jennifer and she is a young Maya lady.  Her parents are able to pay the tuition for her first year in high school but they are not able to pay for the textbooks, her writing materials, her uniform including shoes and socks.  This young lady wants to go on and either become a teacher or a nurse and it breaks my heart that she may not have the opportunity to follow her dream due to financial constraints, that we in North America take for granted - to be able to go to high school.</p>
<p>Our contributions will help Jennifer towards her goal of continuing her education and the goal stated above is to provide funds for her for each year of high school.  She will be moving to another city in Belize, away from her parents, in order to get assistance with doing her homework.  This is a sacrifice that Jennifer and her parents have already agreed to so that she may continue her education.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The average cost for one year of high school is $500 USD, which includes tuition, textbooks, paper, pens, pencils, school uniform including socks and shoes.</p>
<p>The goal of this drive is to raise whatever funds we can.  The entire amount raised will be used to help Jennifer with her goal and if there are additional funds, other young ladies will be helped, as yet unnamed.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Belize, as a country, is still quite young, having reached full independence from the British on September 21, 1981.  This puts this country in its infancy still, trying to sort things out, to figure out how to make their way, after being under British rule since 1862.   The country has many objectives to meet, fully funded education being one of them, and until such time that this happens, we can show our support by providing assistance to the people who are quite deserving but because of financial circumstances, and often times gender, are unable to take advantage of higher education.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.right-to-education.org/node/187"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.right-to-education.org/node/187</a>, education of the females in a society leads ""directly to better reproductive health,  improved family health, economic growth, for the family and for society, as well as lower rates of child mortality and malnutrition. It is also key in the fight against the spread of HIV &amp; AIDS.""</p>

<p>Cambodia is a tough place to be a kid. Decades of conflict,

that are supposed to help keep children safe. Thousands of families are living
in extreme poverty in the toughest slums of the capital Phnom Penh, many of

lost a lot of time in schooling (her parents had to take her out of school 3
years ago as there were fatal bombings targeting her school – female education
is not really accepted). She only got back to school late last year when they
settled into Malaysia. Due to the Malaysian public school system she was put
into the grade for her age not her schooling level. Sania has gone from only
knowing ""Thank you"" in Malay to being able to converse with her teachers and
fellow students, writing is still quite difficult – Malay is a hard language to
learn. Sania did top her class in English and did quite well in Science and Maths (the only two other subjects taught in English). Sania has done so well catching up as well as learning Malay, but if she
continues this way she will never be able to continue into further studies, college
and university, and will not be able to break the cycle of poverty let alone
achieve her dream job – a doctor.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi.  My name is Christine King and I am the founder of MySupervisorOnline which is a website (at beta stage) to support postgraduate students globally who are experiencing inadequate supervision, isolation and limited finances. </p>
<p>After being a postgraduate student and then a postgraduate supervisor myself for over 10 years I have first hand experience of the difficulties facing these students.  Here are some frightening statistics globally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 30-60% of postgraduate students drop out in their first year</li>
<li>Of those that survive the first year, only 50% complete their degree</li>
<li>If a student completes only 30% will do it in the time originally allocated</li>
</ul>
<p>To add to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of the constraints to students completing are social (and not to do with the actual content of their thesis)</li>
<li>80% of students are dissatisfied with their current supervision and/or academic supervisor</li>
<li>72% of students experience some form of isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>Being frustrated with these statistics and also being embedded in the system that made it difficult to change these statistics, I left the University to develop MySupervisorOnline.com. </p>
<p>When I first started talking about the ideas behind MySupervisorOnline, I found something quite extraordinary.  Every person I spoke to either experienced difficulties themselves or knew at least one person who had difficulties within the current University system and/or their supervisor/advisor.  This led to students being completely demotivated or demoralised, rather than being enabled to reach their potential as researchers who should be focusing on trying to solve real world problems facing society today.</p>
<p>Being convinced of the problem, and then doing extensive market research with postgraduate students representing 18 different countries, our initial prototype was built.  The site we have today is not too different and has a range of functions to help students network, search for students across the globe doing similar research, develop research communities, and access a range of resources, including independent supervision.  (No more waiting for 3 months to get feedback on that thesis chapter!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When I first developed the site we had a $100 registration fee to cover website development and maintenance costs but we soon realised that postgraduate students from developing countries could not afford this.  I did a test for 4 weeks using a $1 google ad to see the interest in our website and in this time we had 5000 students visit the site from every country you can think of (the top 5 countries were Ethiopia, Pakistan, India, Ghana and Cambodia).  The downside is that the majority were from developing countries asking to register but saying that they could not afford to.  (Compare our $100 registration with the average annual salary of $900 in Ethiopia)  This presented us with a challenge and while experts in the business field advised us to forget about these students and just concentrate on those that could pay, we were determined to ensure access to everyone.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  To bring on students from developing countries under our new freemium model we need to make significant changes to our website as well as provide some moderator/supervisory support when they become a member.  The changes we need to make to our website include database changes for the new freemium model, integrating a crowdfunding platform so that these students can raise funds for their research expenses like buying a textbook or conducting their field work, as well as building a new supervisor portal from scratch.  Under the premium membership students have access to a whole range of additional resources including direct supervision with real independent supervisors.  To do all of these things we need some extra funds.  Here is how our funds will be used: </p>
<ul>
<li>The first $44,000 (our goal) goes directly to IT costs.  Our site has to be modified substantially to include these new changes and make it accessible to everyone.  We currently have 2 main platforms and we need 2 more - a Freelance/LinkedIn style platform for students to access supervisors and a crowdfunding platform to access funding.</li>
<li>The next $6,000 will go directly to additional resources for students on the site to support the use of these platforms as some of our features will be new to these students.</li>
<li>Any additional funds we raise will go directly toward providing students with our premium registration from countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Cambodia.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every supporter that pledges $50 or over, we will provide a postgraduate student a premium registration.  This is our perk.  It is a 'feel good' perk and all we can afford.  Our premium membership includes search functions to find students doing similar research across the globe (enabling them to move research forward rather than duplicate it!), private and group chats in our virtual cafe, supervisor facilitated forums, research group function, research methods and tools database, resources database (videos, blogs), thesis management tools, access to FundMyThesis (for funding textbooks, conferences and fieldwork) and access to supervisors database, as well as selected e-books and webinars. </p>
<p>So that you know this has gone toward a 'real' student's registration, you will be provided with the profile (name, photo etc.) of the student you support from our database which you can put on your fridge or on your desk, so that you know you have contributed to improving someone's chance of completing their degree.  You can also nominate a student, discipine, country or University with your pledge.</p>
<p>This means if we raise $50 000 then we will provide support to 1000 students across the globe ... and for every $50 more we raise, we will keep adding an extra student (at half price).  MySupervisorOnline is not making a profit in this process - we are dedicated to setting up a system that supports students globally and every dollar raised goes toward website changes or resources for students in lesser developed countries.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Website has the potential to change the world.  In fact, when people see what we are really doing they see that we can change the entire student experience in postgraduate education and research.  Imagine if we could enhance completion rates by just 1%. Think about these few things in terms of how we can change the world just by helping students complete on time and with less pain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding bodies spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on extravagant University fees and a stipend for students with no guarantee of completion</li>
<li>Some Universities get paid by governments when a student completes.  A University might invest in a student for 3 years and then they pull out of their degree</li>
<li>Some Universities are paid by the student directly and don't care how long it takes a student to complete.  The longer a student takes, the more money it is for them (ie. there is no motivation to improve supervision standards or address these issues)</li>
<li>International students spend years away from their families and often go back home with a debt that is often passed from generation to generation.  The longer it takes them to complete the more debt they incur.</li>
<li>In western countries there ia a high divorce rate and increased anti-depressant use as a result of students doing PhD's.</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell as many people about us as you can and and send this around your social networks.  MySupervisorOnline is currently in an accelerator program, having been chosen in the top 10 out of a Global pool of IT companies, to launch it to success.  Our sponsors in this program believe we can change the world and we do to!  The more you can support us and the more you tell people about us, the more we can raise funds to bring students into the network, and bring in investors who can help us bring on board some more team members to support more students.</p>
<p>If you have had difficulties with your own supervision or advisors, or you know someone who has had difficulties trying to just get through their degree - please support us.  Your pledge will highlight to others how much of a need there is to find  solutions to this global problem.</p>
<p>Don't forget the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the term Perk - where it says for example a Perk for $50 - this just means when you donate $50 you get the reward described.</p>

Philadelphia school district has undergone extreme budget cuts, and arts programs have been removed from the curriculum. Students in Philadelphia are no longer exposed to the creativity, exploration of individuality, and critical thinking they experienced through the arts.
We will offer one month of free art classes for Philadelphia high school students in an effort to supplement this deficit of arts education. Students will be exposed to the works, careers, and techniques of prominent local artists, including:


Justin Tyner
Conrad Benner
Mike Smith
Todd Marrone
Jason Andrew Turner


Who we are.


Miss Mac Art Class is a rotating cast of artists and activists with a vested interest in the future of art education. We believe that creatively engaged and culturally exposed youth are better equipped to shape their own futures.
The program unites high school students and artists in the community to create an art show—an exhibition to raise funds for creating and maintaining art education programs in the city.
Philadelphia is the pilot, but we intend to make this a full time program. There is universal disappointment with the lack of public school funding for art education across the country.  We will become mobile—bringing similar art education programs to 12 cities a year, or more. In so doing, we will raise money for local organizations that continue to support the arts in their communities.


What we need.

Art Supplies. We will provide each student with two canvases, a sketchbook, and drawing supplies.  There will also be communal supplies, including paints, brushes, markers, and more.

Location. We have an amazing warehouse space for the month of November, but our overhead includes a security deposit, rent, utilities, and furniture rentals—tables and chairs for the students and instructors.
Business. We need to file for non-profit status, and it takes money to do good by others. There's also insurance, advertising, websites, salaries, and all the fun start-up costs.

How you can help.

Finally, if you're an artist and you’d like to participate, please contact us. We’d love to work with you.

As you can see, we've hit our fundraising goal of $700 in one week! Hooray! Of course, the more donations we get, the more we can spread the book-love around Oberlin and beyond, so please keep spreading the word and contributing to our campaign. We can use donations beyond our initial goal to build our inventory, fund bigger and better events, and sponsor teach-ins and workshops. <i>Additional donations will allow SWAP to go above and beyond operational expenses to provide for the Oberlin community in bigger and better ways.</i> Many thanks to those who have donated their time and resources to help us reach our goal--now let's see how much more we can do together in the last 2 weeks of our campaign! This is just the beginning!</span></span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Who we are</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">We, Evan Cameron, Pablo Cerdera, Sarah Johnson, Jackson Kusiak, Joe Martin, Sophia (Zo) Paul, Dan Quigley, Silvia Sheffield, and Devon Wells, are the founding management team of <a href=""bookcoop.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SWAP: The Oberlin Book Co-op</a>. We’re all students at Oberlin College, and we’ve all held leadership roles in other cooperatives. Collectively we have have a rich knowledge base and skill set that includes library science; web/database development; community organizing, education, and outreach; event planning; consensus; facilitation; coalition building; and budget balancing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Why Oberlin needs a book co-op</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As students, we were frustrated by the options that we had for getting books for classes. <em>Too many students are forced to buy expensive textbooks to use for a semester, and then are getting scammed into selling them back to the big corporation-owned campus bookstore for a fraction of their true value</em>. We saw the need to create an organization that would provide a more economical and sustainable way for students to get their textbooks and create a community space for the exchange of knowledge. <span>We want SWAP to act as a support system for education inside and outside of the academy, and hope to use our space to facilitate skillshares and knowledge exchanges.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What we’ve already done</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>During the spring of 2013 we developed the framework of how the co-op will function. Our mission is to make knowledge free and accessible by creating and sustaining a cooperative to exchange, share, and recycle books, and to do so democratically, sustainably, equitably, accessibly, with an emphasis on member participation. You can read more about our guiding values at the bottom of this page.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We also are committed to a dynamic collective decision-making process; members will agree upon the value of commodities, resources and labor. To start us out, we created a system of valuation for the books. Each book is assessed cooperatively by the member donating it and by a neutral party working on behalf of the co-op; the factors that determine the book’s value are usefulness (is it a text for a class?), physical condition, market value, and awesomeness.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We started advertising ourselves to the Oberlin community at the end of the semester and were happy and relieved to discover that we weren’t the only ones who thought this co-op was a great idea. We had a great kickoff event and tabled for a few weeks and over those few weeks <em>80 people came to us with their books</em>, wanting to be members!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What’s next</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After going public at the end of last semester, <em>we already have a space for our office/inventory and around <strong>700 books</strong> … but only a couple bookshelves</em>. We need your help with the bookshelves and other start-up costs. We have plans to pursue more sustainable funding for our long term operating costs, but we need to get our space set up NOW. It’s critical that we have our inventory organized and ready for the beginning of the school year.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Here’s what you can do</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><em>If you’re able to spare some dollars, we’d really appreciate it.</em> Your donation will make immediate and tangible impact on the co-op. To show our appreciation, we’ve come up with some pretty cool perks, which you can claim on the right side of this page.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you aren’t able to be donate money right now, we’d love your help finding people who can. <em>Seriously, if you believe this co-op is a worthy organization, talk it up to your friends, parents, and any Oberlin alumni that you know</em>.

<h3>Why send me to Oxford?</h3> <p>My name is Matthew Diep and I am an 18-year-old, first-year psychology major attending Pasadena City College. I currently compete on a collegiate level dance team, teach tennis, tutor, and mentor while maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I'm currently working to finish my general education requirements, but my end goal is to finish my Ph.D. The reason I'm pursuing a degree in psychology is because I want to make a difference in the way people approach treatment for mental illness. In this society of 'quick fixes' many people who are diagnosed with mental disorders are moving away from psychotherapy and often resort to taking medications because they think they will be healed quickly and permanently. This is misleading as patients often become dependent on these prescribed drugs which result in less healing and more damage to the patient's mental health. With my higher degrees, I will be able to do research and make a positive impact on the improvement of our mental health system. Being able to study abroad in Oxford for a semester will help me gain a new perspective of our world which will be extremely beneficial for my academic goals. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>My school is offering a program for me to study at Oxford for this coming Spring semester of 2015; however, the cost is roughly $10,000. Because of our current financial situation, my family and I are only able to afford $2,000 of the full amount which includes my parent's contribution and my contribution from my tutoring job. If I do not reach my fundraising goal, I will have to miss out on this amazing opportunity that would expand my network and broaden my mind by allowing me to experience new cultures as well as learn from a new perspective. This is why I am reaching out to you, my network of family and friends, to donate as much as you are willing to help me afford this great opportunity. All the money that I raise will be used towards paying for this trip and I will end this campaign as soon as we reach the goal of $8,000.

I will gain insight by looking at the world from a new perspective which will benefit my pursuit for higher education.

<div>Three years ago, Susan Saunders began a small Montessori school in three rooms of a sprawling farmhouse in Floyd, VA after seeing a need for high-quality, child-centered alternative education in the area.  As a certified Montessori teacher, she recognized the benefits of mixed-age groupings, access to the outdoors, and an environment rich with materials that would call to the children and guide them along their own pathway to learning.</div>
<div>That class began with six children and ended with sixteen - a testimony to the time-proven Montessori method, as well as to the need the school was meeting in the community.</div>
<div>Fast forward to three years later, and Rising Sun Community School still operates from the same sprawling farmhouse, but has taken up the entire bottom floor and expanded greatly.  We now have two mixed-age classes.  Our primary class serves children from 2 1/2 to 6, and our elementary class serves children ages 6 - 12.  Both classes are child-led, individually-paced and peace-centered.  Our two lead teachers are both Montessori trained, as is our primary assistant teacher.</div>
<div>Living, working, and learning in a small rural community is full of benefits, and yet, there are also some drawbacks.  The average income is lower.  It is more difficult to find local work.  </div>
<div>Rising Sun remains committed to providing exceptional education at the most reasonable prices possible.  We've made our tuition prices so that Montessori education can be accessible in this community.  We've offered work-trade, barter, and parent hour trade agreements to make it affordable as well as to involve the families.  In short, we have done everything we can to bring the best quality alternative education to our community.</div>
<div>And now, we need your help!</div>
<div>As we grow, so do our expenses, our need for more staff, and our need for more materials.  </div>
<div>Rising Sun has been a beacon of light to the children we serve, and now, it's your turn to help us shine even more brightly!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goal of $5000.00 will help us in many ways:</p>

<p>4.  Allow us to begin investing in our playscape fund;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>5.  Allow us to begin a Scholarship Fund and serve even more local children!</p>
<p>It's our belief that Montessori education truly empowers children to go on and make a true difference in their families, their communities, and the world at large.  That's because our unique, holistic approach to learning is tailored to each child, honoring his or her own individual spirit.  Our classrooms are tiny communities, and each child is a proud citizen.  The conflict resolution skills, mindfulness, and communication tools taught in our classes will last for their lifetime.</p>
<p>The success of Montessori graduates is well-known, no matter how you define 'success'.  The founders of Google attribute their divergent, out-of-the-box thinking skills to their Montessori foundations.  Actress Helen Hunt is an outspoken advocate for Montessori, speaking often of how it helped to enable her to think for herself.    More major supporters include Erik Erikson, Sigmund Freud, Buckminster Fuller, Mahatma Gandhi, the Dalai Lama, Fred Rogers, Bertrand Russell, Leo Tolstoy and Alice Waters, just to name a few.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>1. What are we doing?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am 24 years now and 20 years ago in Kenya I went to primary school without books,no uniform or inherited uniform from my older friends,I walked barefoot for over 3miles to seek education and there were no blackboards or proper writing materials I.e we used to write/draw sketches on the ground/soil using our fingers to imitate alphabets and numbers or count bean seeds/bottle tops to learn and master numbers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our exams used to be oral since the schools even lacked money to print exam papers to us,parents lived below quoter dollar per day and they would contribute nothing to get us do proper exams,we went hungry and we attended classes under trees such that when it rained,that would be the end of school for that day-even if rain fell as early as <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">8:00am</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were just a few people in school then but now the population has increased from 10 to 50 or over 60 children per class,poverty enrages due to lack of education and still it is part of us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The irony is,the same same way and situation I went to school in the year 1992 is the same way children in Kenya are still doing it in the year 2012,Just what does it take to change this?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My belief is that nobody is so poor that he has nothing to give and nobody is so rich that he has nothing to receive,let's live a life of forgiveness and understanding as we answer the question ""What gift do you give to someone who has it all?"" My answer is ""A CHANCE TO HELP THOSE WHO DO NOT""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sponsor a child Kenya (SPAC) is a Kenyan non- profit community based</div>
<div>organization which works with experts in children rights, social development, macro and micro- entrepreneurs, medical practitioners and legal experts. Through its humanitarian works, SPAC aims to assist, enable and empower the less fortunate children and impoverished communities to improve their livelihood through Education, juvenile rehabilitation,community care and treatment, championing for children’s rights, HIV/AIDS</div>
<div>sensitization with an aim to enhance prevention of mother to child transmission. Overall, SPAC aims to promote child rights, nature talents and build capacity of communities through children to transform poor communities into success hubs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. How are we doing it?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Through its education pillar, SPAC has been able to identify needy children</div>
<div>in schools and sponsored their education though well-wishers kitty,we started with 6 children and now we have 217! SPAC,through its networks and the support of local administration has been able to identify needy children who fell out of school for various reasons and.    </div>
<div>facilitated their return to school through well- guided counseling and rehabilitation</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(See SPAC website <a href=""http://sponsorachildkenya.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sponsorachildkenya.org</a>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Kenyan government has recently launched free primary school education</div>
<div>to raise literacy levels since education is one basic need for every child.</div>
<div>In so doing, a lot of children have returned to school increasing volumes</div>
<div>of pupils per class to at least fifty pupils per class. This has stretched</div>
<div>capacity of the classes to the level that most students do not have the</div>
<div>clear visibility of the small writing boards available in average Kenyan</div>
<div>schools. Again because of the over- stretched class capacities, some pupils</div>
<div>are forced to stay outside classrooms and learn through the windows or take</div>

1. What are we doing?
 
I am 24 years now and 20 years ago in Kenya I went to primary school without books,no uniform or inherited uniform from my older friends,I walked barefoot for over 3miles to seek education and there were no blackboards or proper writing materials I.e we used to write/draw sketches on the ground/soil using our fingers to imitate alphabets and numbers or count bean seeds/bottle tops to learn and master numbers.
 
Our exams used to be oral since the schools even lacked money to print exam papers to us,parents lived below quoter dollar per day and they would contribute nothing to get us do proper exams,we went hungry and we attended classes under trees such that when it rained,that would be the end of school for that day-even if rain fell as early as 8:00am.
 
We were just a few people in school then but now the population has increased from 10 to 50 or over 60 children per class,poverty enrages due to lack of education and still it is part of us.
 
The irony is,the same same way and situation I went to school in the year 1992 is the same way children in Kenya are still doing it in the year 2012,Just what does it take to change this?
 
My belief is that nobody is so poor that he has nothing to give and nobody is so rich that he has nothing to receive,let's live a life of forgiveness and understanding as we answer the question ""What gift do you give to someone who has it all?"" My answer is ""A CHANCE TO HELP THOSE WHO DO NOT""
 
Sponsor a child Kenya (SPAC) is a Kenyan non- profit community based
organization which works with experts in children rights, social development, macro and micro- entrepreneurs, medical practitioners and legal experts. Through its humanitarian works, SPAC aims to assist, enable and empower the less fortunate children and impoverished communities to improve their livelihood through Education, juvenile rehabilitation,community care and treatment, championing for children’s rights, HIV/AIDS
sensitization with an aim to enhance prevention of mother to child transmission. Overall, SPAC aims to promote child rights, nature talents and build capacity of communities through children to transform poor communities into success hubs.
 
 
2. How are we doing it?
 
Through its education pillar, SPAC has been able to identify needy children
in schools and sponsored their education though well-wishers kitty,we started with 6 children and now we have 217! SPAC,through its networks and the support of local administration has been able to identify needy children who fell out of school for various reasons and.    
facilitated their return to school through well- guided counseling and rehabilitation
 
(See SPAC website http://sponsorachildkenya.org

 
Facebook page www.facebook.com/SPAC.KENYA

 
The Kenyan government has recently launched free primary school education
to raise literacy levels since education is one basic need for every child.
In so doing, a lot of children have returned to school increasing volumes
of pupils per class to at least fifty pupils per class. This has stretched
capacity of the classes to the level that most students do not have the
clear visibility of the small writing boards available in average Kenyan
schools. Again because of the over- stretched class capacities, some pupils
are forced to stay outside classrooms and learn through the windows or take
classes under trees.
 
SPAC has hence seen a need to respond to the plight of these children by
providing black writing boards ( SPAC boards) which are large enough to
enable visibility from a distance and also supply the same to schools that
have either constructed new class rooms or poor schools that have “Sunlight
classes” – Taking classes under trees.
 
We are constructing 250 blackboards to poorest rural schools in Kenya with erected classroom walls by use of sand,cement and black paints or we take wooden blackboards to schools that learn under trees since we do not have the capacity to build classrooms but we believe it will be possible one day. 
 
These 250 blackboards will impact 12,600 children into comfortable education by the end of our first year.
 
Our approach is unique in that we involve the community in need to take part in this,women bring the water for mixing the sand and cement while men do the mixing,the drug addicted youths who wish to rehabilitate give up drugs worth $20 every month in order to channel the money wasted on drugs to a better cause as teachers contribute $1 from their pockets to pay the constructors,we provide cements,sand,paints,chalks,architectural advise and monitoring of the full activity implementation with a group of our worldwide volunteers.
 
 
3. What happens when we reach goal of $5000?
 
SPAC believes that capacity building is not a one- off event but a process.
Once the SPAC boards are acquired and distributed in schools. SPAC intends
to ensure consistent follow up to see that there is tangible outcome from
the investment put in child education. This will be done through reviewing
performance of the pupils on a quarterly basis and address any unforeseen
needs within SPAC’s mandate. Alongside the intellectual investment, SPAC
intends to identify talents in young children and coach them to be able to
use their talents to better their lives. Successful pupils will then be
welcomed in the SPAC academy ( A group of successful students all through different communities) to act as role models to other less fortunate children in the society. 
 
Here are the details of SPAC Academy;
 
1. Selection

We select over 18 year old pupils through a participatory interview process that includes group and individual challenge games.

3. Funding

4. World reception
If we had it our way we would keep these talented students around forever. However, we want our youth to continue to grow to their fullest potential.This is why we select the TALENTED who can in turn Employ their fellows. SPAC customizes each youth’s exit strategy to ensure their continued success with a wish that Previous graduates will start their own business, find full time employment, or continue their education with the help of SPAC’s Education Scholarship Program.
At SPAC academy ""WE DO NOT JUST FUND PROJECTS,WE FUND PROGRESS""
 
This will ensure continuity,sustainability and full capacity of the communities with the intervention.The intervention will be piloted in a number of schools and rolled out to other schools across the nation once the SPAC academy finds root.
 
 
4. Why is education/blackboards at this time important than the others like
health,protecting children from abuse etc?
 
SPAC believes in the adage “knowledge is power”. Providing knowledge to the
students will empower them and enable them to know how to prevent diseases
and live healthy hence reduce on hospital bills. Through education, the children will also get entrepreneurship skills that they will use to vend for themselves in their hay days as well as build business skills in their parents who may though be in their sunset days. The children will also learn how to identify and protect themselves from social abuses like rape,child labor and domestic violence as well as handle them amicably.
 
Through talent couching, the children will from an early age start making a living out of their wealthy talent outfit ranging from athletics, music,arts, theatre among others.
 
Education as coming out is a self- replenishing fountain that represents a
proverbial spring of life.

<h3>My Goal</h3>
<p>To Raise $3000 so I can fund my tutition &amp; board which is not part of my scholarship for my Sophmore/Junior year, so that I may complete my Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science/Geography.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Cheyenne Stewart. I am currently 20 years old living in Barbados. I have 4 siblings of which I am the second oldest.</p>
<p>I LOVE jumping. Love it! I can't say it enough times! High Jump, Long Jump, Triple Jump, I am always so excited to be out there soaring over bars or jumping amazing meters into a pit. It was always my dream to become a world renouned athlete. From as young as 7, I was always involved in extra circicular; learning to swim and cook from a young age. I had earned my first Track and Field medal in middle school at the age of 10 where I placed 3rd in Long Jump. From High School onwards, I earned good grades and participated in almost every extra circullar at school: Netball, Basketball, Cross Country, Chess, Swimming and excelled tremously in them, but Track and Field had continued to be my one love.</p>
<p>With many great records held and amazing personal bests, I am now a Sophmore looking to attend Northern Michigan University in Fall 2012. There, I'll be training with the best coaches on the World's largest Indoor Track (The Wooden Dome). I have recieved an 85% scholarship from the school's excited coach to fund my 3rd year at school but as an international student, the remaining 15% is a tremendous bar standing in my way.</p>
<p>This campaign holds extreme importance to me because I know they are many people in the Caribbean who would love to be offered the chance to recieve more than a High School education so they can persue their athletic dreams. I am one of them. With your help, I can finally leap over this last obstacle and finally reach my dreams.</p>

<h3>Where does your Money Go?</h3>
<p>The money gained from this campaign will go towards:-</p>
<ul>
<li>My tuition and housing for sophmore - Junior year.</li>
<li>Signing of international documents by Northern Michigan University.</li>
<li>Allowance to buy books, school supplies, winter clothes, food, sanitary and other basic needs.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>What If I exceed my goal of $3000?</h3>
<p>Even though this campaign runs until a few days after school starts, I can continue to run this campiagn until the time runs out. My draft of plans for this campiagn if it reaches its goal are below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winter clothes: Many people warn me that the winters in the Upper Pennisula of Michigan can be extremly harsh. Scary! Living in a tropical environment for 20 years where the temperature hardly ever drops below 80 degrees Farenheight; you can imagine that I will not have many warm clothes in my closet.</li>
<li>New shoes: I've literally worn my 1 and only pair of sneakers into the ground! Finding a track worthy pair of sneakers will be a challenge for my soon to be active college life. Also, track shoes for Pole Vault (A new event for me!) and Triple Jump (which I have never recieved shoes for) will go a long way.</li>
<li>A return ticket: After a long year of college life away from home, if there isn't any summer classes I might have to take, I get to go home!</li>
<li>Other than those three ideas, I am basically open to suggestion. Hit me with what you've got! I love to hear any ideas :)</li>

We are a group of parents and educators working to build a democratic free school for the South Side of Chicago.
At the Chicago Free School, students choose their classes and activities based on their individual interests.  We do not have required classes, grades, or standardized tests.
Students participate in democratic decision-making to create school rules, resolve conflicts, and suggest topics to study.

Our small size of 60 students with 5 full-time teachers ensures that students get lots of personal attention in a caring community.

We emphasize learning that is authentic, exploratory, and connected to the community. Our location on the second floor of Augustana Lutheran Church of Hyde Park is ideal for accessing local parks and museums and taking public transit on field trips throughout the city.

We are committed to social justice and racial and socioeconomic diversity. We offer sliding-scale tuition so that we are affordable for every family, regardless of income.

Every day, families express to us their urgent need for a new kind of school for their children. Your donations help us prepare to open in September 2014 and keep our school affordable to everyone through sliding-scale tuition.

What We Need & What You Get
The money we raise from this campaign supports start-up costs for our school.  In the long run, we'll meet over 90% of our costs with money collected from tuition, but we need your help to get us ready for the first day of school!  

The money we are raising now goes to pay for furniture, books, technology, supplies, and staff pay for our teacher planning and orientation period.

The Impact
In our current climate of high-stakes test pressure and resource cuts, it is increasingly difficult for many schools to meet the social and emotional needs of students and provide an environment where learning can be authentic and fun.  Families are eager for a school that will give students the autonomy and flexibility to pursue their own interests in a supportive community.

Our group includes educators with years of experience serving Chicago's students who will apply their expertise to create a school that will really meet the needs of children in a caring, joyful environment.  

Our school functions as a truly democratic community - we involve students, parents, and teachers in making decisions and give everyone a voice.

Help Us Reach Our Goal!

<p>I am working towards my Bachelor's degree in Social Work.

This in conjunction with my fascination for other cultures and the international application of Social Work are what bring me here.</p>
<p>UMBC and UMB are partnering to send a group of undergraduate and graduate Social Work students to India for 16 days in January 2013 as part of an independent study.

<p>While I realize the idea of turning to the community at large to ask for contributions towards a personal excursion is sort of ridiculous, the fact remains that I cannot make this trip happen on my own. That all being said, I feel this trip would be an invaluable experience toward my academic and professional career. Having participated in some international service already, I am now driven to expand upon those horizons and see what else is out there in terms of need and aide. It would give me an opportunity to witness and participate in how my field is being applied in an area of the world wracked by poverty, trafficking, sex trade, and a variety of other issues of personal interest. I also intend to do my part to share my experiences and inevitable lessons upon my return. </p>
<p>My campaign is set under fixed funding. Meaning if I don't meet the goal/can't go on the trip within the 60 day deadline, everyone who contributed walks away without having had to pay a dime/with any funds returned. </p>

<h3>What is this for?</h3>
<p>This campaign goes directly to help afford two trips. One is to Philadelphia, PA For 9 students who have qualified for the NCFL Tournament, and the other is to Birmingham, AL for 2 students who have qualified for the NFL. We have done numerous fund raisers but the community we are in has fallen on difficult times and we are short of our goal. Most of the students we have in our program fall into a demographic where parental contributions are difficult to ask for, which is why we are reaching out to the goodwill of strangers.</p>
<p>This is a cause that is important to me and the others who coach and help with the team because of the tremendous impact these types of activities have on these students. Each and every one of these kids is an amazing individual!</p>
<p>Your contributions help support 11 students who have spent countless hours preparing and practicing. These 11 students practice their public speaking daily, something most of us are terrified to do!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are short over $2000.00 in relation to our goal. This money is going to go to a few items. First this will be going to finish off paying for travel expenses. Our district has attempted to help, but as I mentioned before, we are still a bit shy. Second, this money will go to support the students while they are in Philadelphia. These types of trips are expensive in relation to food and travel and we want to help these kids who have worked so hard at something they are so passionate about.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students involved in these academic extracurriculars are much more likely to go to and succeed in, college. Especially from a low income demographic, the skills these students learn and use will help them in almost every aspect of their life. Support for academics is dwindling. We need to be ready and willing to help each other, for the benefit of those generations who come after us. These students make up your next set of innovators, small business leaders, and even government officals. If we make the world better for them, they will pass it on!</li>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p></div>","What is this for?
This campaign goes directly to help afford two trips. One is to Philadelphia, PA For 9 students who have qualified for the NCFL Tournament, and the other is to Birmingham, AL for 2 students who have qualified for the NFL. We have done numerous fund raisers but the community we are in has fallen on difficult times and we are short of our goal. Most of the students we have in our program fall into a demographic where parental contributions are difficult to ask for, which is why we are reaching out to the goodwill of strangers.
This is a cause that is important to me and the others who coach and help with the team because of the tremendous impact these types of activities have on these students. Each and every one of these kids is an amazing individual!
Your contributions help support 11 students who have spent countless hours preparing and practicing. These 11 students practice their public speaking daily, something most of us are terrified to do!


What We Need & What You Get

We are short over $2000.00 in relation to our goal. This money is going to go to a few items. First this will be going to finish off paying for travel expenses. Our district has attempted to help, but as I mentioned before, we are still a bit shy. Second, this money will go to support the students while they are in Philadelphia. These types of trips are expensive in relation to food and travel and we want to help these kids who have worked so hard at something they are so passionate about. They should not have to miss such an amazing trip!

I have commissioned a classically trained artist to create a bronze sculpture of one of my personal heroes, Dr. Ron Paul. For 30+ years Ron Paul and his fight for Liberty has been an inspiration to myself and many others. I think that it’s time that we honor Dr. Paul by creating a symbol of him in recognition of his contribution to the cause of Liberty that will serve as a reminder to future generations! </p>
<p>The artist whom I have commissioned, Suzanne Johnson, has over 25 years of experience. Her museum quality bronzes capture the personality of each subject with exquisite detail and are collected worldwide. She has generously spent many hours of her time on this project because she understands how important and influential Dr. Paul is. If you would like to view some of her previous works feel free to visit either her <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SuzanneJohnsonSculptureJewelryDesign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> or her <a href=""http://sjsculpturedesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>.  </p>
<p>As you can see from the photos, she has already begun working on a life sized bust of Dr. Paul in clay, which once completed will be molded and cast into bronze. It is important that you see the quality of her work and realize that you will not just be funding a piece of art, but a significant moment in history. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise the necessary funds by August 20th (Ron Paul's Birthday) to cast this sculpture in bronze and have it mounted onto a solid granite base which will feature a memorable quote by Ron Paul. Once completed we intend to present this sculpture to an organization which aligns with the principles of freedom and liberty. This is the really cool part: You get to decide where we donate the sculpture and which Ron Paul quote we will use! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ron-Paul-Commemorative-Sculpture-Project/361907550543483"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Join the Ron Paul Commemorative Bronze Sculpture Facebook Page and cast your vote today!</a></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that we chose a <strong>conservative</strong> goal of $4,500 which is essentially the minimum amount we need in order to cover the cost of casting and transporting the sculpture as well as fulfilling the rewards to our contributors to this project, so please give as much as you are able to!</p>
<p><em>*Additional funds beyond our goal will be used to compensate the artist for material costs, her time spent on the project and arrange travel accommodations to participate in the presentation ceremony. In the event that the project becomes overfunded by a substantial margin we will consider casting an additional identical bronze sculpture to be donated to the organization which receives the second most votes!</em></p>
<p><em>donors please understand that many of the rewards feature photos and/or photo books which will feature the finished bronze sculpture, we hope to have the rewards completed as soon as possible, but the bronze can take anywhere from 6-8 weeks to finish, so please have patience and we promise we won't forget about you</em></p></div>","Welcome to the Ron Paul Commemorative Sculpture page!

<p>My name is Louise Oliver; I'm 28 years old, from Scotland and am about to risk everything for the opportunity of a lifetime.  In August 2012 I attended a rare open audition for the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts when they were in Scotland for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  At the time, in my head, a successful result was equivalent to a lottery win.  Things like that don't happen...except when they do.  I got in, and not only that, they offered me a scholarship in recognition of what I have achieved in my career to date.  Cue a lot of ""pinch me I'm dreaming"" and double checking it wasn't, in fact, a wind up and here I am; about to revisit the dream of a little girl from small town Scotland who wanted nothing more than to be an actress and who, as an adult, thought that dream had long since passed her by.  </p>
<p>Why now?  I didn’t attend drama school the first time around like I really wanted to for a number of reasons; lack of confidence, circumstances and financial limitations.  But I did get into the University of Glasgow where I achieved a Masters in Theatre Studies, a very academic course, and have been working my butt off for the past 10 years carving out a career in arts management.  However, I’ve had an itch and a little voice in my head for ten years telling me I let what I really wanted to do, what truly lit me up, slip away.  It’s not that I don’t enjoy what I do currently but I can’t ignore the feeling that I got here through necessity rather than choice.  Through my own perseverance and ambition I have managed to align my circumstances and as a result I have been presented with a rare and unique chance to pursue what I believe to be my own unfulfilled potential. </p>
<p>The thing is dreams don’t come cheap, certainly not ones this big.  Although being in receipt of a scholarship is a wonderful position to be in, the amount awarded to me is a contribution towards my tuition as opposed to a blanket cover of costs.  The total cost of my tuition, room and board, supplies and general living is an intimidating figure of £33,192.88 per academic year. </p>
<p>I know I am not exactly unique; I am not professing to be.  In this age of Glee and X-Factor everyone has a dream and a sob story to support why theirs is the most important.  I guess all I am trying to say is that opportunities like this don’t come along very often; only once if ever at all and I have managed to get myself to this point.  Now I am at an impasse and need a little help to push through.  That’s what this campaign is all about, it’s part of a wider fundraising effort to raise the tuition money and get me to NYC. </p>
<p>Everything I have worked for and this life that I've built, as I know it, I’m putting at risk.  I’m taking a huge gamble and I need to stack the odds in my favour or, well, as the title of the campaign would suggest, I’m bust.  And that’s not a cry for help, it’s just a fact.  I suppose what I am asking is for you guys to blow on my dice.  You can make the difference on whether or not I go to NYC or go Bust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Target and Your Perks</strong></p>
<p>Ok mathletes, here comes the scary money bit.  As mentioned above I need to raise <strong>£33,192.81</strong> and in the interest of transparency, so you know exactly where your money is going, here’s how that breaks down...</p>
<p>Tuition &amp; Fees - £18,983.30</p>
<p>Room &amp; Board - £11,719.25</p>
<p>Books &amp; Supplies - £331.16</p>
<p>Local Transportation - £588.16</p>
<p>Misc. (insurance, medical, etc) - £1,570.94</p>
<p>And that’s <strong>per academic year.  </strong>Sure, it’s expensive, but it has every right to be.  It’s acting training in one of the most selective schools in the State, in one of the most competitive and thrilling cities in the world.  If it wasn’t damn hard to get there everyone would be doing it.  But it seems a waste to let this opportunity get away because of money.  My target through Indiegogo is a relatively modest £2K.  I know what you’re thinking, that’s a pretty small percentage of my overall goal, and you’d be right.  Rest assured I am not resting on my laurels here; I have spent the last six months writing to dozens of trusts, stashing my own cash and chasing down Skills Development Loans.  However, you guys are probably going to be the most integral piece in this financial jigsaw.        </p>
<p>I am not oblivious to significance of what I am asking for, it’s a hard ask and one that I hope I am getting right.  I’m not a band you’re a fan of trying make an album, I’m not trying to change the world and I’m not Veronica Mars so what can I offer you?  The best of me, I suppose.  My perks have been structured around what I feel I have to offer; the parts of me that are personal, reflective of my personality and will require special care and dedication to get them to you.  They may not be much but they are small, personal commitment to you that I hope communicates just how grateful I am for your support.  </p>
<p>If I don’t hit my target...I could say that’s life but that doesn’t mean that wouldn’t suck!  But that’s OK, every little helps and those who will donate will help me get a few steps further and allowing me the breathing space to figure out how to fill in the gaps if I don’t hit the £2K. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t make a pledge...Do.  Not.  Worry.  Seriously, I know how painfully skint everyone is at the moment.  These are tough times for living the dream and we are all in the getting by boat together.  However, in the absence of a pledge, it would be super cool of you to share my Indiegogo campaign with others; maybe on your Facebook, your Twitter or in an email. </p>

Our youth leaders with an adult facilitator will offer this course of study for any group anywhere in the world. From this training these 20 youth will go back into their communities around the world and offer training to other youth creating a ripple effect. No longer disillusioned, disenfranchised, they will move into trust and hope that they can build a world with systems that bring forth peace on all levels. Their inner revolution leads to participants impacting social, economic and environmental evolution. Spiritual Activism is the thread that weaves all humanity together as one family.
 





""COE has changed my perception about life and taught me what L.I.F.E. is. It is Leadership, Integrity, Fellowship and Excellence.  I now have started M.A.D for children.""
Mark Conrad, Philippines





""This training has given me a direction to which I can see myself and others living as one family of the one world within the sphere of love, trust, respect, unity, oneness and human dignity.""
Jimmy Lama, Nepal





""I will always in remain in search of a peaceful nature and how can I use my talent and skill to provide inner peace in my self and how I can share that with other people, not only limited to my country. Children of the Earth is the forum that has provided me with the development of inner soul thoughts and initiating peace related activities.""
Ashfaque Hussain, Pakistan 





""I believe ""Spirituality"" is the key to harmony and oneness. It is a way to overcome our fears, doubts and limits. Because spirituality to me, is reaching into ones divine self and realizing what life is all about. Like no clouds could ever harm or violate the sun, I believe that no experiences, thoughts or action could ever harm or violate the deep soul within. Therefore I feel it is our mission to reach out and awaken all the beautiful souls. And from there we can all start acting towards peace and oneness.""

<h3>Short summary</h3>
<p>I am a Canadian registered nurse who decided to go to Peru to volunteer my skills through the <a href=""http://amorprojects.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AMOR Projects</a>, a non-profit oganization (<span>EIN: 912094236). In my time there, I met Wendy. She is a local 18 year girl from the slums who showed an amazing drive to learn what ever medical skills I was teaching. She was in charge</span> of patient care and running the pharmacy. The volunteer doctor agreed to train her because of her intense desire to learn and her excellent work ethics.</p>
<p>I was inspired to help her find a way to attend the local university to learn nursing. She would not have the opportunity to get an education otherwise as her family does not have the financial means. If we help educate Wendy, she will in turn contribute to her community, family, to the AMOR Projects and to herself for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>I believe in her. Please believe in her as well to help the community of Pucallpa in Peru for many years to come. </p>
<p>The video you see here was made in Novemver 2012 during my visit there. It's a video put together by other AMOR Projects volunteers to help them realise a medical mission of visiting native villages and provide free medical care to the locals.</p>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Wendy needs 150 dollars a month to pay for school fees and materials. The course is 5 years long. I have personally contributed 1500 dollars and she needs 6000 dollars more to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the Universidad Alas Peruanas. The math: 10 months a year @ 150/month = 1500 x 4 years = $6000 + misc fees = $6420. All proceeds are being donated to the AMOR Projects, a tax deductable non-profit organization.</p>
<p>You can donate by using this website or <a href=""http://amorprojects.org/donate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">donate directly to the AMOR Projects</a>. If you choose to donate directly, please include ""for Wendy’s education"" in the purpose section of the web page. Either way, you will receive a tax deduction and a receipt. Furthermore, I will upload the university records to show accountability of funds.</p>
<p>For updates on Wendy's progress, visit the drop box <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vq2c6x1gg68ghuk/7bVVS-KIlE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vq2c6x1gg68ghuk/7bVV...</a> </p>
<p>I speak to Wendy regularly and we have a support system in place and multi-layers of accountiblity to ensure her success.</p>
<p>Meet Wendy and volunteer if you want! It's an amazing experience that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>If we don't meet this funding goal, all the funds will be forwarded to the AMOR Projects. If Wendy does not meet her goal of completing her education, the funds will be used to buy supplies for the AMOR Projects to continue providing free health care in Pucallpa. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>This is my way of paying it forward as I was one of those people who was given an unforeseen chance at obtaining an education. One woman can educate and help others she comes into contact with.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, 'It takes a village to raise a child'. The education of our children is the task of community as a whole, not merely the province of the teachers and local school administrators.</p>
<p>Thank you for your compassion.</p>
