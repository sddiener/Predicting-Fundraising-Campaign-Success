<div><br/></div>
<div>We had big goals for a brand new team in a brand new city. Where most cities have a team for every high school, we decided to merge four different schools to create a powerful cooperative community team. </div>
<div>The mission began with a challenge: <b>we needed to build a robot from scratch in 6 weeks. </b>We didn't have much in terms of money or parts, but what we did have was more important: a strong, shared passion.

The ones who don't drive the robot, cheer as loud as they can for hours  on end. The experience is phenomenal, and we have only yet seen a regional competition. </p>
<p>However, finances are a barrier to our participation. Up until the point when we won the chance to compete, we weren't struggling for funds. <b>Now, we are struggling.</b> </p>
<p>Honestly, without the rapid support of others, our team will lose the chance to go to St. Louis, and we might not get the opportunity again for several years.

Hi. My name is Katie Fiebig. I'm a single mom to a beautiful girl. She's a strong, spirited, creative, vivacious, outside-the-box thinker. She always has been and hopefully, that will never change.


 


In my work as an Oncology Nurse, I loved helping people.  I knew that if I couldn't get you want you needed, I would find the person who could. That's my passion--connecting people with what they truly need. 



When it was clear that my own daughter needed something different than what a typical school had to offer, I got to work. I spent years looking for a place where her gifts and unique way of seeing and experiencing the world would be valued, supported and reflected back to her, rather than one where her differences and challenges were too often the main focus of time and attention.



I couldn't find that place in Cincinnati, so I decided to create it and The Ethel Streit School (TESS) was born.



In September, TESS's Pilot Program will open its doors. We're launching this fundraiser to ask for your help to make this program the rich, exciting, multi-disciplinary, sensory-smart experience we know it can be! We have 30 days--help us reach our goal!


TESS's Pilot Program is a mindful collaboration of children, parents, educators, and community members that supports and guides students to take ownership of their learning. Our school creates a real-world, interdisciplinary context that fosters joyful exploration and develops students’ natural curiosity, personal interests, and individual potential. 
At TESS, we know that kids who think outside the box can’t learn inside a box. 

We believe in the philosophy of Collaborative Problem Solving, a powerful and fundamental understanding that Kids Do Well When They Can, rather than Kids Do Well When They Try. 
If a student is struggling, we know that our first job is to presume competence. That means we assume two things: All kids are doing the best that they can, and, All kids want to do well. Our task--our responsibility–is to discovery whatever is getting in the way, and work as a team to clear it out of the way. 
Our Mission is to establish an inclusive and collaborative educational community where each individual’s academic, social, and emotional intelligence is fostered in a warm, authentic, and purposeful way; where the students' passions and interests are discovered, nurtured, and respected; where bravery and curiosity are cultivated and encouraged in a safe and flexible environment; and where innovation and creativity are embraced as essential tools for lifelong learning and success.
All children are curious. All children deserve to have their brilliance reflected back to them. Please join us in this worthy and much-needed endeavor!
What We Need 
 What we have: A vision, a plan, a committed staff, a small and excited student body, and a welcoming space. 
What we need: The basics and more! Art supplies, math manipulatives, iPads, a project table, bean bags chairs, a rug, a filing cabinet, a giant whiteboard and chalkboard, outdoor play-space equipment, a small budget for outings in the community–an essential ingredient of any outside-the-box learner. 

Every little bit truly does help! We are grass-roots, creative, and thrifty! A handful of $1.00, $5.00 and $10.00 donations very quickly becomes enough to stock our shelves (heck, to first buy the shelves!) with supplies a group of kids can eagerly use to inspire, design, and build.

This program offers the possibility for international sponsors to finance the education of one child at least. We target orphans, impoverished and disabled children from the rural areas of the Central Region of Togo, for whom it would be impossible to go to school without our support.Getting an education in Togo is critical not only to get a sufficiently paying job, but also to live more conveniently. Because more than 40 ethnic groups live together in one country, their only means of communication between each other is often the French language. This is only learned at school.Being educated also means contributing to the development of Togo, and supporting one's family. It means not needing the help of NGOs to send one's children to school anymore. By investing in these children's future, we are investing in the development of a country.To this day, SADIL - TOGO has helped more than 175 children go to school. Today, some of them are getting to the end of their education: a student from our program got her high school diploma this year and is ready to pursue her education at a higher level, with the help of our new program, Université Pour Tous. This was only made possible by our generous sponsors and partners. But we can do even more!Let them knowWho are ""they""? They are:
the togolese children needing our support 
the team of our organization fighting so that these children can go to school every year,

the sponsors providing the funds.

While the children supported by our program ""Education Pour Tous"" get money every month from their international sponsors, the team of SADIL - TOGO rarely gets any funds to pay for supplies, except from a few donations.This is resulting in them lacking the means to really carry out  the program effectively. They struggle to work without computers, or to pay for gas when visiting the children for the 3 yearly follow-ups. (The only way to get around here is driving their motorcycles.) This leads to poor communication and a lack in effectiveness. Indeed, the team is only composed of volunteers, sometimes sent by a national program which pays them only enough so they can survive.Simply said: if the working conditions of the team are not fixed, the program will suffer from the lack of resources, no matter how hard-working the team is.In order to prevent these communication and technical problems, we have put together this ""let them know"" campaign.What do we need funds for?Every donation on this campaign will help our team work more effectively.
Our team will be able to communicate more with the families and local communities. We need updates about the family situations, especially because we have had cases in the past where children were sent to work in other places instead of going to school, sometimes within child trafficking networks. With more resources for gas and telephone, we will be able to visit them and phone them more often.

More communication with the international sponsors is also one of our goals. To communicate with them, the team presently relies on their private internet connection or the connection of temporary communications interns. They need a common internet connection at the office and their own computer (we only have 3 computers at the office, 2 of which are really slow and not adapted to go on the internet). It will allow more trust between them and the organization.
With a domestic internet connection, they will be able to work more effectively on computers, write reports, articles, organize the data relevant to the program, communicate with other local organization, set up work groups in the area.
Professional communication material will convince more international sponsors to support children through the organization.
The team will be able to organize their resources and files more effectively with additional office supplies. Right now, everything is stuffed in a big cupboard, and we lack a safe place to store our cash money.
In general, we will create more means for our team to rely on for their work.

Help me raise $18,000 to sponsor an underprivileged student to study at the Vedanta Academy in India for 3 years.


Background Hello! Many years ago I returned to Australia, from India, after six years of studying Vedanta — a practical philosophy that originated in the Himalayas over 10,000 years ago.  The ancient wisdom of Vedanta introduces us to our true Self. It is the source of all knowledge and from it all religions and philosophies have emerged.Vedanta completely changed my life. Before Vedanta I was superficial, disconnected and unhappy, but after Vedanta I felt connected and content — and ever since I have been communicating to people about how to live a more fulfilled, focused and harmonious life. However I am well aware that a teacher can only pass onto their students the level of their own understanding. That is why I feel it's time to return to the academy to raise my level of knowledge.
I plan to go back at the end of October for two months. However I cannot go empty-handed. After all the academy has given me so much already and continues to give so much to so many.    It's Time to Give Back 
The Vedanta Academy offers a 3-year full-time residential course and sponsors students, from around the world, who cannot afford to pay. In essence, many students study at the academy for free. All their food, tuition, books, stationery, accommodation and medical costs are covered by sponsors.
This is very dear to my heart because initially when I studied at the academy I saved enough money to pay for my first three years myself. However after the course I wanted to stay on and continue my studies, but I couldn't afford to pay, so I was sponsored — and to my sponsor I am eternally grateful, because without his generous support I would not have had the education that I was fortunate enough to have. 

    Sponsoring a Student
Sponsoring a student for three years costs $18,000. This covers food, tuition, books, stationery, accommodation and medical expenses.
The Impact
After completing the 3-year course at the Vedanta Academy students go out into the world and teach the higher values of life and living and help change peoples' lives for the better.
Your contribution will not only make a difference to a student's life, it will have a ripple effect and make a difference to many peoples' lives.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute financially you can still help us by sharing this campaign with others though social media.
What happens to the money if we don't make the target?
Irrespective of whether this goal is reached or not, all the money raised goes to the Vedanta Academy to support students who cannot afford their tuition and board.
Thank You!
Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign and sharing what you can towards making a positive difference in the world.

From heart disease to colon cancer, we have definitive data that proves that nutrition can be of incredible value for those suffering and in need.In the US, it is estimated that over the next ten years, there will be a 21% increase in the need for nutritionists!  Therefore it is essential that we rise to the challenge and meet that goal, offering a top-notch nutrition education that allows our single moms to become Board Certified Holistic Nutritionists. Our community is filled with people ready to help. People who, like Dr. H, wish they could have even one more day with the ones they love so much. And now, after more than a decade of development, that is possible.This is where you come in...every dollar spent is a vote cast. Every dollar you donate to our scholarship fund is a vote in favor of helping single moms become trained healthcare professionals. They are needed in our hospitals and classrooms now more than ever. You have an incredible power to make a difference!The World Health Organization and CDC estimate that over 10 Million people die of cancer and heart disease each year, with approximately 3 Million of those occurring in the United States alone. And here's the important part...they estimate that at least 1/3rd of those could be prevented through education and Holistic Nutrition. Now factor in that reality that more than
110 Million adults and 12.7 Million children are either overweight or
obese, and the need for healthcare professionals that are highly trained in using food as medicine becomes even more apparent.When you support scholarships for our single moms you are literally supporting millions of families, giving them the chance to have even one more day with a loved one.The EHI Community is made
up of many traditionally under served populations like single moms trying to help their family as the make a career change. And there is tremendous opportunity for each of them here.     Jolene Goring, EHI Graduate & Board CertifiedAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual salary earned by a nutritionist is $55,240!  Imagine a single mom trying to help her family. Imagine how much it would mean to her and her family if she could afford to go back to school to learn something that will help their health as it helps position them for a better financial future. This is why we need your help...your generosity will make a difference in that mom's life, her family's life, and in the life of everyone she is able to help after graduation.We're devoted to the development of each and every student here at the Energetic Health Institute where we take great pride in our commitment to academic excellence. In
academia, the typical drop rate is between 12 -18% per new
enrollments. At EHI, our drop rate is currently at an unprecedented 1.35% meaning
that only 1 out of every 100 students drops our program. Why? Because of the amount of support we provide for each student. We promise unlimited interaction and we deliver on that promise. When you add encouragement, amazing information, and hand-on experience that students can feel to the mix...the result is a very happy student community progressing towards their future.  At EHI we are a true community…but it goes even deeper than that…at
EHI we are a true family.Our 1st Core Value at
the Energetic Health Institute is EVERYONE MATTERS, and we take great
pleasure in serving traditionally underserved populations.Currently we serve a student population that
is approximately 92% female, ranging in ages from 17-72. Of those women, approximately
45% are single moms trying to care for their children and better themselves at the same time. While all of our new
students receive some form of partial scholarship, more than 50% still require
financial assistance. 
We are so grateful for anything you can give and so appreciative for all you can give. Your generosity will make an immediate difference...it is a vote in favor of getting trained professional Holistic Nutritionists into the work force...it is a vote in favor of single mom's providing for their family...Your generosity is a vote in favor helping family's dealing with serious illness get one more day with the people they love so much.Thank you for supporting our student community!Thank you for supporting our mission!Thank you for making tomorrow amazing!If this cause resonates with you, then after you support our cause please share this crowd funding campaign with your family and friends on Facebook. You have our gratitude. :)                                  Together WE Are the Greatest Energy!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h3>What is The Dream Center?</h3> <p></p>
<p>From
awakening dormant dreamers to birthing valiant visionaries, The Dream Center is
a multifaceted transformative hub that unearths unlimited possibilities. Our mission is simple: to
inspire EVERYONE—regardless of race, age, religion, gender, orientation or shoe
size—to dream again. By way of dynamic programming,
focused on Leadership Development, Economic Empowerment and Creative Arts, The
Dream Center inspires, informs and ignites the imaginations of visionaries and
dreamers across a myriad of genres.</p>

<p>The Dream Center truly is a catalytic space. Lives
change. Attitudes evolve. Dreams are realized. We develop dreamers, creatives,
entrepreneurs, and civic-minded individuals. We fundamentally believe that by

<p></p>
<p>Here are some alarming statistics: </p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>From 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. juvenile crime
and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex peak at a startling
rate <span>(Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, 2012). This
is no different in Harlem. </span></p>
<p>b.<span> 
</span>We are situated in the midst of the
largest school district in the country. There are more students in New York
City public schools than people in eight U.S. States. </p>
<p>c.<span> 
</span>Of the 1.1 million students in the
NYC public school system 72 percent are Latino or black. </p>
<p>d.<span> 
</span>Less than half of them will graduate
from high school in four years. </p>
<p>While
statistics can be <span>disturbing, places like The
Dream Center are positioning themselves to change the narrative about the
people in our community. Every day, we walk by youth of all ages who are
seeking ways to engage and get involved. What if we could transform those
peak hours into an opportunity for possibility, exploration and engagement in something
that would push youth to be their better selves? </span></p>

<p>We need your help. $15,000 will enable 30 high school students to complete an entire year of
Vision Academy. That breaks down to $500 per student. We are seeking support to
help us do the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>$5,600 to pay the facilitators and industry
     professionals that will teach the students during this program.</li>
<li>$2,700 for food and snacks to feed the students. Most
     will be coming from school and will be hungry. They need to eat to focus.</li>
<li>$2,000 to hire a part time program coordinator for one
     year.</li>
<li>$1,850 for a MAC and Adobe Creative Suite 6
     Subscription for student projects.</li>
<li>$1,200 for field trips and exploratory excursions that
     deepen the exploration process.</li>
<li>$950 for fees associated with putting on a final
     production in a theatre that seats 1,500 people!</li>
<li>$500 for supplies needed for the students to participate
     in each semester.</li>
<li>$200 for marketing materials to promote the program in
     the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we
are fully confident that we can reach this goal, if we do not we will first
seek funding to offset the remainder of the money. We want to help no less than
30 students complete this program. If we still have some trouble we will adjust

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our youth and teen centered programs
ARE making impact.  The Dream Center
offers Freedom School, a summer and after-school enrichment program that
promotes reading, increases self-esteem and generates positive attitude toward
learning.  The age demographic ranges
from ages 6-18 and covers a curriculum of five major components: high quality
academic enrichment; parent and family involvement; civic engagement and social
action; intergenerational leadership development; and nutrition, health and
mental health.  In
2014, <span>78.9% of participants maintained or gained in
instructional reading level and did not experience summer learning loss. On
average, participants demonstrated a 4-month increase in instructional
reading level.</span></p>

<p><b>The Harlem Teen Shakespeare Intensive (HTSI)</b> is a free six
week program wherein teens and pre-teens (12-18) will learn appreciation, basic
mechanics, and grounded understanding of Shakespeare’s work, its importance in
literature, and its relevance in their lives. The Dream Center partners with
Classical Theatre of Harlem (CTH) for the implementation of this program. </p>

My Voice (public speaking) and The Apprentice Project (entrepreneurship
cohort). </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014 we
ran the Vision Academy program in different ways. We had some successes, but
also some obstacles. In the end, we learned a lot about what is necessary to do
this program in a way that has real world impact. Teens require a lot of
attention and their needs sometimes go beyond the time they spend in The Dream
Center. When they walk in, the come with their own fears, challenges, concerns,
hopes and dreams. We have to ensure that we have enough people and resources to
provide a village to support them in their successes. We know that we can do
it. We have a model. We have done programming that has supported 50 youth at a
time all day, five days a week for six weeks in the summer. We can and will do
this.</p>

</ol><p></p></div>","What is The Dream Center? 
From
awakening dormant dreamers to birthing valiant visionaries, The Dream Center is
a multifaceted transformative hub that unearths unlimited possibilities. Our mission is simple: to
inspire EVERYONE—regardless of race, age, religion, gender, orientation or shoe
size—to dream again. By way of dynamic programming,
focused on Leadership Development, Economic Empowerment and Creative Arts, The
Dream Center inspires, informs and ignites the imaginations of visionaries and
dreamers across a myriad of genres.


The Dream Center truly is a catalytic space. Lives
change. Attitudes evolve. Dreams are realized. We develop dreamers, creatives,
entrepreneurs, and civic-minded individuals. We fundamentally believe that by
abolishing fears and fully realizing potential, we can change ourselves, our
communities, and the world.﻿
Why Support our Vision Academy?

Here are some alarming statistics: 
a. 
From 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. juvenile crime
and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex peak at a startling
rate (Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, 2012). This
is no different in Harlem. 
b. 
We are situated in the midst of the
largest school district in the country. There are more students in New York
City public schools than people in eight U.S. States. 
c. 
Of the 1.1 million students in the
NYC public school system 72 percent are Latino or black. 
d. 
Less than half of them will graduate
from high school in four years. 
While
statistics can be disturbing, places like The
Dream Center are positioning themselves to change the narrative about the
people in our community. Every day, we walk by youth of all ages who are
seeking ways to engage and get involved. What if we could transform those
peak hours into an opportunity for possibility, exploration and engagement in something
that would push youth to be their better selves? 



Vision Academy is a FREE program
geared towards assisting high school students in the exploration of real-world
challenges and possibilities. Completed over three semesters, with an option of
an additional summer session, it provides experiential learning opportunities
focused on Leadership Development,
Economic Empowerment, and Creative Arts. 
Vision Academy emboldens our
community of young dreamers to become
what they believe. Through self-affirmation and critical thinking,
our pedagogical approach incorporates inquiry-based learning and interactive
strategies to illuminate new ideas and transformation. 
Our program is also designed to develop skills in literacy,
critical thinking, problem solving, public speaking and teamwork. The goal is
to create innovative, lifelong learners who have a passion for what is possible
and a hunger to make change within themselves, the community, and the world.





What We Need & What You Get
 
We need your help. $15,000 will enable 30 high school students to complete an entire year of
Vision Academy. That breaks down to $500 per student. We are seeking support to
help us do the following:




$5,600 to pay the facilitators and industry
     professionals that will teach the students during this program.
$2,700 for food and snacks to feed the students. Most
     will be coming from school and will be hungry. They need to eat to focus.
$2,000 to hire a part time program coordinator for one
     year.
$1,850 for a MAC and Adobe Creative Suite 6
     Subscription for student projects.
$1,200 for field trips and exploratory excursions that
     deepen the exploration process.
$950 for fees associated with putting on a final
     production in a theatre that seats 1,500 people!
$500 for supplies needed for the students to participate
     in each semester.
$200 for marketing materials to promote the program in
     the community.

While we
are fully confident that we can reach this goal, if we do not we will first
seek funding to offset the remainder of the money. We want to help no less than
30 students complete this program. If we still have some trouble we will adjust
the number of students we accept into the program for 2016.

The Impact 
Our youth and teen centered programs
ARE making impact.  The Dream Center
offers Freedom School, a summer and after-school enrichment program that
promotes reading, increases self-esteem and generates positive attitude toward
learning.  The age demographic ranges
from ages 6-18 and covers a curriculum of five major components: high quality
academic enrichment; parent and family involvement; civic engagement and social
action; intergenerational leadership development; and nutrition, health and
mental health.  In
2014, 78.9% of participants maintained or gained in
instructional reading level and did not experience summer learning loss. On
average, participants demonstrated a 4-month increase in instructional
reading level.



The Harlem Teen Shakespeare Intensive (HTSI) is a free six
week program wherein teens and pre-teens (12-18) will learn appreciation, basic
mechanics, and grounded understanding of Shakespeare’s work, its importance in
literature, and its relevance in their lives. The Dream Center partners with
Classical Theatre of Harlem (CTH) for the implementation of this program. 


Checkmate is an
after-school chess program created to engage youth and teen chess players, from
beginner to grandmaster levels.  Chess
develops the same skills necessary for academic excellence, critical and
strategic thinking, problem solving, memory skill and focus.  



Market Yourself Seminars provide participants with basic online marketing strategies including search
engine optimization, building and managing a website, improving online image
through social media, using social networking to optimize a product and
learning the beginnings of creating a business plan.  
These are just a few of more than 25
original programs and 12 partner programs offered at The Dream Center.  Some other programs include Breathwork
Meditation, yoga, dance, This is My Story (writing and storytelling), This is
My Voice (public speaking) and The Apprentice Project (entrepreneurship
cohort).    Risks & Challenges  
In 2013 and 2014 we
ran the Vision Academy program in different ways. We had some successes, but
also some obstacles. In the end, we learned a lot about what is necessary to do
this program in a way that has real world impact. Teens require a lot of
attention and their needs sometimes go beyond the time they spend in The Dream
Center. When they walk in, the come with their own fears, challenges, concerns,
hopes and dreams. We have to ensure that we have enough people and resources to
provide a village to support them in their successes. We know that we can do
it. We have a model. We have done programming that has supported 50 youth at a
time all day, five days a week for six weeks in the summer. We can and will do
this.

opportunities are severely lacking. I have had numerous chances to travel outside
Gaza to show the world that *even girls living under siege and
occupation can make a better change* under different conditions; however,
I was unable to leave the Gaza Strip for many of these opportunities because of
the blockade.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>As examples of opportunities I was able to
achieve, I has extended an invitation to meet with the Deputy US Consul in
Jerusalem, where I was the youngest of several women who were asked to discuss
the social situation in Gaza and how we can make things better. This
invitation gave me the chance to see my capital city of Jerusalem for the first
time in my 20 years of living under siege in Gaza, despite Jerusalem being less
than 50 miles away. My other major accomplishment was that, during the summer
of 2015, I attended a Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) student
leadership program in the United States for 6 weeks of training on how to
be a good leader in society. I am now working on a project for this program concerning
*violence against women*, which teaches young women about their importance in society
and involves training them and familiarizing them with true-life stories of
successful Palestinian women in order to motivate them. I intend to represent our
project team at a conference for MEPI alumni put together by the US Consulate
in Istanbul, Turkey, in March 2016.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>However, I cannot forget other
opportunities that I’ve lost because of the political situation on the Rafah
border (normally the only exit point for Palestinians in Gaza). One such
opportunity was that I was supposed to be the young female representative from
Gaza at a conference for children who overcame adversities in Kenya in 2013; I
was unable to leave the strip because the borders were closed despite having my
visa. Moreover, I lost the chance to represent Palestinian young women at a “Women2Women”
Harvard University conference in 2014 as I was unable to leave the Strip to
reach Jerusalem and obtain my US visa stamp because of the Israeli war on Gaza
that summer. </p>
<p>All of the things I
have done, and still want to do, involve leadership and business, and I
believe that I am a good spokeswoman. Despite the chances that I lost, I didn't
and won't give up because a good leader never gives up, so I am not going
to surrender my educational future of studying business administration at Portland
State University. I am doing this for me, my family, and as a representative of
my country with a goal towards a better future with freedom</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why am I doing this crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>This is to help me move from Gaza City in
Palestine to Portland State University in the US to study Business
Administration – I am very serious about obtaining a better education. I have
to pay the first term’s (Winter Term) tuition in advance; however, I also plan
to start working on campus as an international student once I arrive. Some of
the funds will cover my school fees after my arrival.</p>
<p><b>What will achieving my goal do?</b></p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Achieving my goal of collecting almost $7000 will help me restart
my higher education properly. Since I finished high school, I attended two
different colleges in Gaza; however, I had very limited choices at both
institutions at every step, and it reached a point where I was at an academic
dead-end, especially as this city lacks opportunities as I mentioned above. After
I found a better institution of higher learning in the US during the MEPI
program this past summer (watch my video above), I felt that I would be
welcomed and supported.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Achieving my goal would make my parents, friends, and community
proud of me as somebody who was able to obtain a higher education degree, which
is one of the most important accomplishments of one’s life.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Finally, achieving my goal would be my only hope for a higher
education, and I sacrificed a lot to make this dream come true and am really excited
about beginning a new life far away from all the wars and the political
situation that we live in. Obtaining a better education is all that matters,
but if I do not achieve my funding goal by December, I will stuck with limited
choices and won’t be able to do any of this.</p>

<p>The Name ""Team No Breaks"" was coined about 2 years ago. Initially it was intended as  a 'Thank You' from Andrea Nettel to all the amazing people who have assisted her son, Alex Boettger, and with that her family.

Over the past two years Team No Breaks has become synonymous for anyone who does amazing things with Alex or for Alex. </p>
<p>Alex Boettger (14) is in need of funds in order to pay for his high school fees. He is permanently in a wheelchair due to Congenital Muscular Dystrophy.  This year we are hoping to raise double his school fee money i.e a total of R 64000 in order to also donate to organisations who are working towards making INCLUSIVE EDUCATION a reality in South Africa.</p>This year <span>Team “NO Breaks” is made up

Wir, die Abiturientia des Geschwister-Scholl Gymnasiums werden im Frühjahr
nächsten Jahres unser Abitur absolvieren. 

Zur Finanzierung der anstehenden Abiturfeierlichkeiten haben wir bereits in den
vergangenen Monaten zahlreiche Aktionen selbstständig organisiert und durchgeführt.  Jedoch ist der Betrag für unseren Abiball für viele unserer Schüler kaum zu stemmen! 

Unsere Schule, das Geschwister-Scholl Gymnasium steht
bereits seit 40 Jahren für Toleranz,
Interkulturalität und eine vielfältig engagierte Schülerschaft. 
Aufgrund unseres Standorts in einem der ""Problembezirke"" Münsters hat unsere Schule leider oft mit Vorurteilen zu kämpfen, weshalb die Sponsoren Suche besonders schwer ist!
Auch kommen viele unserer Mitschüler aus weniger wohlhabenden Familien und können deshalb die Finanzierung unseres Abiturs kaum ausgleichen!

Deshalb brauchen wir Ihre Hilfe!
Die Einnahmen aus dieser Kampagne würden zu 100% in die Miete für die Räumlichkeiten unseres Abiballs fließen!
Wir suchen also nicht nach spenden für unnötige Extras!!

Es wäre unvorstellbar wenn einige wenige uns ein wenig bei unseren Bemühungen unterstützen würden!
Wenn Sie kein Geld zur Verfügung haben so würden wir uns dennoch freuen, wenn sie unsere Kampagne hier über das dafür vorgesehene Tool teilen würden.

<p>Formula hybrid is part of the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Collegiate Design Series and is regarded as the
most complex and dynamic of the series. Students are tasked to design, build
and create a hybrid vehicle (roughly 1/3 of the size of an actual F1 race car)
which will compete against teams from all over the world. The project is also
an academic assessment for 4<sup>th</sup> year mechanical engineering students,
although the team consists of undergrad and graduate students. The team has
registered to compete in Loudon, New Hampshire USA on May 2-5, 2016 and would
appreciate any form of, and all the support it can get. </p>
<p><b>About The Competition</b></p>
<p>The Formula Hybrid Competition is an
interdisciplinary design and engineering challenge for undergraduate and
graduate university students. They must work collaboratively to design and
build a formula-style electric or plug-in hybrid race car and compete in a
series of events that put to the test different aspects of the vehicle’s
design, capabilities, potentials, and the quality of engineering and innovation
put into it. This educational competition emphasizes on drivetrain innovation,
fuel efficiency and the use of an alternate source of fuel to build a greener
high performance racer. Engineering a hybrid provides an unparalleled
interdisciplinary hands-on experience that encourages students to innovate
across mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering disciplines. Hybrid
drivetrains present greater challenges as the goal is to piece together a car
from scratch that runs on a combustion engine as well as an electric motor in
harmony with each other to deliver the most effective and efficient amount
power possible. Several engineering companies and most of the world’s major
automotive manufacturers support Formula Hybrid due to the high quality of
engineers it has helped develop, who have learned to work outside of their
chosen disciplines, as a team in unison and bring out the best of themselves
and others around them.</p>
<p>Lancer Motorsports/SAE Chapter at the
University of Windsor aims to compete in the Formula Hybrid event for the very
FIRST time, next year (2016). This is a challenge for the team that will be
conquered through the vision, dedicated hard work and perseverance portrayed by
passionate, enthusiastic and determined students coming together to make the
dream come alive.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are converting a few parts like
the chassis (though modified) from our 2012 Formula SAE Vehicle to build the
Formula Hybrid. Also, we’ll be adding batteries, two electric motors, a
different internal combustion engine and making adjustments to the frame, suspension
and other areas of the car in order to meet with the regulations defined by the
rulebook.</p>
<p>Our budget for the project is $25,000
and majority of that goes towards the batteries and the hybrid powertrain.

</div></div>","About Formula Hybrid
Formula hybrid is part of the Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Collegiate Design Series and is regarded as the
most complex and dynamic of the series. Students are tasked to design, build
and create a hybrid vehicle (roughly 1/3 of the size of an actual F1 race car)
which will compete against teams from all over the world. The project is also
an academic assessment for 4th year mechanical engineering students,
although the team consists of undergrad and graduate students. The team has
registered to compete in Loudon, New Hampshire USA on May 2-5, 2016 and would
appreciate any form of, and all the support it can get. 
About The Competition
The Formula Hybrid Competition is an
interdisciplinary design and engineering challenge for undergraduate and
graduate university students. They must work collaboratively to design and
build a formula-style electric or plug-in hybrid race car and compete in a
series of events that put to the test different aspects of the vehicle’s
design, capabilities, potentials, and the quality of engineering and innovation
put into it. This educational competition emphasizes on drivetrain innovation,
fuel efficiency and the use of an alternate source of fuel to build a greener
high performance racer. Engineering a hybrid provides an unparalleled
interdisciplinary hands-on experience that encourages students to innovate
across mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering disciplines. Hybrid
drivetrains present greater challenges as the goal is to piece together a car
from scratch that runs on a combustion engine as well as an electric motor in
harmony with each other to deliver the most effective and efficient amount
power possible. Several engineering companies and most of the world’s major
automotive manufacturers support Formula Hybrid due to the high quality of
engineers it has helped develop, who have learned to work outside of their
chosen disciplines, as a team in unison and bring out the best of themselves
and others around them.
Lancer Motorsports/SAE Chapter at the
University of Windsor aims to compete in the Formula Hybrid event for the very
FIRST time, next year (2016). This is a challenge for the team that will be
conquered through the vision, dedicated hard work and perseverance portrayed by
passionate, enthusiastic and determined students coming together to make the
dream come alive.
What We Need & What You Get
We are converting a few parts like
the chassis (though modified) from our 2012 Formula SAE Vehicle to build the
Formula Hybrid. Also, we’ll be adding batteries, two electric motors, a
different internal combustion engine and making adjustments to the frame, suspension
and other areas of the car in order to meet with the regulations defined by the
rulebook.
Our budget for the project is $25,000
and majority of that goes towards the batteries and the hybrid powertrain.

eat at reasonable restaurants, as well as eat local foods.  It will be
necessary for us to hire a local, small bus for transportation.  We will

</div><p></p><h3>Overview of the project</h3><p>My name is Rachel Jimenez, and I am the pianist and piano teacher behind this project. I live in Brooklyn, NY where I have been running a successful classical piano teaching studio for over 10 years. I teach 40 students per week ranging from beginner to advanced and from ages 5 to 65. I did my undergraduate studies at <i>New England Conservatory  </i>in Boston and got my Master of Music degree from <i>Yale University School of Music</i>. My degrees are in classical piano performance.</p><p>The purpose of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise support for the completion of a new edition of my classical piano teaching method, <i>Fundamental Keys</i>. </p><h3>What is Fundamental Keys?</h3><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129709/files/20150103173612-cover_-_Edited.jpg?1420335372"" src="""" style=""padding-right: 10px;""/></p>I developed the original edition of Fundamental Keys in 2009 in order to fill a gap in the world of music education. I wanted to create a new way of teaching beginners of any age that would lead seamlessly into <i>serious classical studies</i>. Fundamental Keys teaches the basics of reading music quickly and efficiently using a well-respected, modern pedagogical approach (landmarks &amp; intervals), and then, within a relatively short period of time, the student begins to play elementary level classical pieces. There is no other piano method I know of that deals with the beginning phase quite the same way. There is a complete absence of cartoons, and there are no songs with lyrics. This is because of my interest in teaching in a way that leads seamlessly into the study of classical repertoire. Fundamental Keys is a more rigorous approach that encourages students to take music seriously and strive to reach their full potential -- contrary to the popular methods today that seem to lead more naturally into playing the piano as a casual pursuit.<p></p><p>The original version is a 130+ page book taking students from the very beginning up to what I consider intermediate-level classical repertoire. I have used the book very successfully with my own students of all ages over the past 5 years, I've gotten lots of positive feedback from pianists and piano students all around the world, and I am convinced that its approach is a great way for both children and adults to get a strong foundation in music. My students get consistently high marks on the very challenging national assessments given by the <i><a href=""http://www.musicdevelopmentprogram.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Royal Conservatory's Music Development Program</a></i>. When kids get this kind of serious instruction early on, most become great fans of classical music, and I believe this approach could lead to more professional classical musicians and concert-goers in the future. <b>This style of music education has the potential to raise the level of interest in classical music in the future.</b></p><p>Right now, Fundamental Keys is in a transitional stage. In early 2014, I started to think about ways in which it could be improved. I decided that certain concepts needed to be explained and drilled more thoroughly, and I found more great classical repertoire that I wanted to work on with my own beginning students. I have decided to create a new edition broken up into 3 volumes, each approximately 60 pages in length. I also want to make a professionally produced video series that would be a major improvement over the home-made videos I started creating in 2009. Finally, this time around, I want to use Amazon.com as the printer and distributor.</p><h3>Current status</h3><p>As of now, Book 1 of the new 3-volume series is complete and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Keys-Book-classical-everyone/dp/1505540860/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">available for purchase online at Amazon.com</a>. It sold 35 copies in its first two weeks, so I'm confident there is a lot of interest in this project. Book 1 consists of original material, created by me to prepare students for studying elementary classical pieces starting with Book 2. </p><p>I will be recording the videos to go with that first book at the end of this month (January 2015). I have hired the talented <a href=""http://www.hiddenchapelstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Abhita Austin of Hidden Chapel Studios</a> to do the filming.</p><p>I am hard at work compiling and formatting the content for Book 2 and Book 3. They will be centered around pieces by classical composers and include theory, music history, and music appreciation content.</p><div>
<h3>Funding needs</h3>
<p>I have already spent quite a bit to get this new version of Fundamental Keys off the ground. Expenses incurred so far total about $5,000 and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purchase of a new computer.</li>
<li>The purchase of various software packages for: music notation, graphics creation, desktop publishing, and video editing.</li>
<li>The purchase of several volumes of sheet music and guides to repertoire graded by difficulty level so I can be thorough in my research.</li>
</ul>
<div>The expenses coming down the line mostly have to do with <b>video production</b>. It is important to produce high-quality videos to go with Fundamental Keys. Videos are essential to self-directed adult learners, and that is a demographic that has already shown great interest in and great success with my method. Videos would also be very helpful for teachers interested in using my method with their students. My plan is to offer the books and videos to teachers at minimal cost in order to encourage wider adoption of the method. <p></p>
<p>The cost for filming all three sets of videos will be approximately $1,500, and the cost for the portion of the editing job that will be done by the film-maker will be approximately $3,000. I <i>need  </i>the film-maker to do the bulk of the editing, because if I had to do it all myself, I just couldn't get it done in any reasonable amount of time with all my other commitments. It would be a shame for people to have to wait months or years after each book was released to be able to get the videos. </p>
<p>So, in all, the cost of the project is in the neighborhood of $10,000 not including marketing. I would love to be able to market the method in music education magazines and online. Even with great success, it is unlikely that I would make that amount back in the first few years of it being on the market, and that is where Indiegogo, <i>and you</i>, come in.</p>

Select the amount you'd like to donate, choose a perk if you would like one, and enter your credit/debit card details. That's it! Only takes a minute!</b></i></div>
<p>Without support from generous backers, I will not be able to get the videos done. I simply do not have the time and resources to do all the work on my own, and this past year has brought some unforeseen personal expenses (related to the health of a family member) that have made it impossible for me to put any more money into this project up front. Without the videos, the books will be of very limited benefit to self-directed adults, and it will be harder to convince teachers to switch to the Fundamental Keys method.</p><div>Without support, I will not be able to market the method online and in music education magazines and journals. I think this kind of marketing will be very important to its success.<p></p>
<p>If you are an adult beginner interested in Fundamental Keys for your personal use, the perks I offer will be great for you. At the $50 and $150 levels, you are essentially just <i>pre-ordering Fundamental Keys</i>.</p>
<p>If you are a piano teacher with a classical background, <i>support Fundamental Keys</i>  so that you will have access to a unique and effective way to teach your students.</p>
<p>If you have young children that you would like to enroll in piano lessons, I believe the best thing you could do for their development is to <i>support Fundamental Keys</i>  and urge their teacher to use it.</p>
<p><i><b>If you love classical music</b>, support Fundamental Keys to give more kids the opportunity to learn to play the piano in a way that will foster an appreciation and love for classical music.</i></p>
<p>I hope the perks I am offering will give you even more reason to <i>partner with me  </i>in this endeavor! But remember, contributing any amount also comes with the satisfaction of being a part of bringing this dream of mine to fruition.</p>
<p>Here is what I will be able to accomplish depending on how much I raise (taking into account processing fees):</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,600: I'll be able to produce the videos for Book 1.</li>
<li>$3,200: I'll also be able to produce the Book 2 videos.</li>
<li>$4,800: I'll be able to produce videos for the whole series.</li>
<li>$7,500: I'll also be able to market the method extensively in print and online, and even attend a <a href=""http://www.mtna.org/programs/conferences/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">national music teacher's conference</a> to promote it. </li>
<li>over $7,500: Anything ""extra"" will be put back into the project somehow -- more marketing, software development, wider distribution, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div>I'm making the <b>project goal</b> $7,500, but I also chose ""Flexible Funding"". That means whatever support I get (even if I don't get to the goal) will be able to go towards making Fundamental Keys as successful as possible. But, the more I raise, the more successful the project will be, and if you've read this far, you obviously want to see it succeed, so.............................<p></p>

My name is Ben Yehoshua, and today I am raising funds for the translation of my beloved grandfather's book, <i>Behind The Silk Curtain (מאחורי מסך המשי) </i>from Hebrew into English<i>.</i> My grandfather, Ben-Tzion, lives in Jerusalem, Israel and is the son of Afghani and Persian parents. My great grandfather was a community Rabbi as well as the local ""Maggid,"" (storyteller) and my grandmother was a loving and beloved housewife. Seeing that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, my grandfather has always been able to keep me enthralled for hours with his stories, the stories passed down to his from his father, and the stories of our family and our people. When my grandfather was 12 years old, his father was fatally wounded in battle while rescuing the women and children of his village from enemy gunfire. He died shortly after the battle from wounds inflicted to his torso by a grenade, and my grandfather became the family breadwinner. After working for a year to support his family, my grandfather's mother said ""Bentzi, the time has come for you to return to school."" He replied that he was done with school, and that he needed to continue working to provide for the family. His mother -my great-grandmother- then sat on the 22nd step of the entrance to their apartment, and began to cry. She told my grandfather, ""Bentzi, it is because of you that I am crying, and it will be because of you that all of my tears will dry up. I will not stop crying until you go back to school!"" Deeply moved, my grandfather agreed to return from school, and in his words - he ""hasn't stopped learning since!"" </p><p>My family and our history has always been very important to me. This is a trait that I must have inherited from my grandfather, and that is why I am running this crowdfunding campaign today.

My name is Ben Yehoshua, and today I am raising funds for the translation of my beloved grandfather's book, Behind The Silk Curtain (מאחורי מסך המשי) from Hebrew into English. My grandfather, Ben-Tzion, lives in Jerusalem, Israel and is the son of Afghani and Persian parents. My great grandfather was a community Rabbi as well as the local ""Maggid,"" (storyteller) and my grandmother was a loving and beloved housewife. Seeing that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, my grandfather has always been able to keep me enthralled for hours with his stories, the stories passed down to his from his father, and the stories of our family and our people. When my grandfather was 12 years old, his father was fatally wounded in battle while rescuing the women and children of his village from enemy gunfire. He died shortly after the battle from wounds inflicted to his torso by a grenade, and my grandfather became the family breadwinner. After working for a year to support his family, my grandfather's mother said ""Bentzi, the time has come for you to return to school."" He replied that he was done with school, and that he needed to continue working to provide for the family. His mother -my great-grandmother- then sat on the 22nd step of the entrance to their apartment, and began to cry. She told my grandfather, ""Bentzi, it is because of you that I am crying, and it will be because of you that all of my tears will dry up. I will not stop crying until you go back to school!"" Deeply moved, my grandfather agreed to return from school, and in his words - he ""hasn't stopped learning since!"" My family and our history has always been very important to me. This is a trait that I must have inherited from my grandfather, and that is why I am running this crowdfunding campaign today. Today, my grandfather is an author, and we are seeking $50,000 to translate, print, and market his magnum opus - Behind The Silk Curtain (מאחורי מסך המשי). This huge (nearly 1,000 page) book explores the history, culture, and tradition of the Persian, Afghani, and Bucharian Jewish communities throughout history.

<li>Let's be honest here: we're just getting started, so what we need is basically everything. Hardware, software, facilities, you name it. And this venture is not without risk.

We think this turbine is a real winner, and when it goes into wide production, it will make people's lives better by reducing their fuel usage, and creating less pollution in the process.<br/>
</li>
<li>The most important perk is not on our list. The most important perk is the knowledge that you worked to make life a little better for yourself, your children and your fellow man. Isn't that what makes life worthwhile? But do take a look at the perks offered. Some of them are quite valuable (a turbine-powered sports car, for example). But if you add up the total contributions that can be made, every single perk carries the potential to be worth more than the total goal for this campaign. Why is that? Well, this is a marathon, not a sprint. The total project will cost on the order of 14,000,000 USD to get from concept to final production. We want to prove to you that we can do this, and the best way to do it (for us and for you) is to do it in stages. For the first stage of the project, we wanted to make it small enough so that it could reasonably be done by a first-timer, but big enough so that it would still be a real accomplishment. So the first real need is a first rate CAD system, and a pair of commercial 3D printers so we can do prototyping in plastic. Once we get a successful plastic prototype, we will use the plastic parts to create a sand cast, which can then be used to create an aluminum prototype.</li>
<li>So what happens if we don't get to our goal for this phase? Well, from a financial standpoint, we buy what we can with the funds from this campaign, and try to get funding for the rest of this phase elsewhere. Failure to get funding in this phase does NOT mean the project is dead. It only means we failed to do what was needed to make this phase successful in this forum. We'll take a hard look at what we did, and how we could do better. And we will do better. We will make this happen, one way or the other. And we want you at the finish line with us when that first series of turbines comes rolling off the line.</li>
<li>What happens if we completely overshoot the goal for this phase? We'll use the extra to fund the next phase of the project. Whatever happens, everything donated will go toward funding this project alone. If we don't get enough, we seek additional means of funding.

</ul></div>","Reduce The Cost of Gas And Improve The Environment!We'd all like to do something about the cost of gas, and we'd all like to use our resources more efficiently. And if we could cut down pollutants and reduce dependence on foreign oil in the process, so much the better. Well, we at StewardTech believe we may have found a way to help do all of these things. And you are invited to join us in the process of bringing this dream to life.We have a unique design for a turbine that we believe could replace piston engines in everything from lawnmowers to freight trains. And we believe these turbines will be more efficient, lower maintenance, easier to produce and more durable than their internal combustion counterparts. We think this idea has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, and this is your chance to be a proud part of the revolution.The Impact
Your contribution helps advance technology, while helping the environment. The high efficiency turbine will use less gasoline than an equivalent piston engine. 
It costs less to build than a comparable piston engine, and has fewer moving parts, so there's less to break down. You make things cheaper, cleaner and more reliable. That's a pretty big win for everyone.
By helping people use less gas, you also take away dependence on foreign oil. By doing this, in many cases, you take money away from terrorists. 
Your contribution will help create jobs. Maybe a few; hopefully a lot.
You help create something really new that has the potential to make life better for a lot of people. That's a good legacy to have.

<p>So far our Rotary Road MAPS to Africa programme through climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and the Mountains of the Moon as well as amazing support from Rotary District 9700 and in particular Past District Governor Fred Loneragan 2008-2009, has raised $250,000 for our projects in the past.  This has resulted in the building and refurbishment of a medical care clinic in Hout Bay, South Africa the provision of materials and wages to help run the School of St Jude’s in Tanzania.</p>
<p>We have also provided many Orphan Rescue Kits for children of Mathare in Nairobi which has now moved into sending children of secondary school age to secondary education.  Secondary education in Kenya is not free at the moment and requires organisations such as Rotary to identify those in greatest need.</p>

</div></div>","THE PROJECT
We will be taking 10 Rotarians, three of which are over 70 years young, to climb Mount Kenya to Point Lenana (4,985 metres or 16,355 ft).  This is to raise funds via sponsorship of the climbers for our nominated beneficiaries. Each climber is funding their own travel and accommodation costs, so that every $ we raise, as a team, goes to the beneficiaries.


THE BENEFICIARIES (click on the three beneficiaries for project information)
1. LEGACY AUSTRALIA
Legacy is a charity providing services to Australian families suffering financially and socially after the incapacitation or death of a spouse or parent, during or after their defence force service. Legacy Australia currently care for around 90,000 widows and 1,900 children and disabled dependants throughout Australia.

2.  The ORK - Orphan Rescue Kits (Kenya)
Through Rotary we support vulnerable and at risk orphaned children that our Rotary partners in Kenya have identified as being in need of help.  This could be an individual or a whole school in Kenya.


Tracy Ochieng one of the girls that we met at Mathare in 2011 and have since sponsored Tracy to High School.  2nd in her class of 126 students , Tracy will be our first graduate to have a university education and degree, made possible with your assistance. We are confident that after your consideration of these, the most vulnerable children on the face of the earth, were our children and grand children we would like to think that we could all help them to achieve their goals.



Mathare, where Tracy and her sister live, used to be the vegetable gardens
of Nairobi.  Now the area houses 500,000 people who have moved from the country
to the BIG city of Nairobi looking for work.
“It is
hard to reconcile my ability to see the beauty, joy and goings on of life in
the slum, with the revolting site you have to process in order to know it must
be changed. The land is sucked of the green. The water is scarce, the trash
unbelievable. Children meander through filth, shining their glorious youth and
innocence in order to make it human, to make it bearable.

There
is music, constant music.There are babies being held, old men shooting the breeze, hunched grandmas walking together. It is life, at the same time as it
should, and never should, be.“  Megan
MacDonald. Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar.
3. Coolamon House Hout Bay Cape Town.
We support the Hout Bay Rotary Club and their work with Operation Medical Hope, supplying Comfort Boxes which will look after the needs of the families in Hout Bay with supplies of medication and nutrition.  Coolamon House is saving lives each and every day and with your support will continue to do so.



PAST SUCCESS
So far our Rotary Road MAPS to Africa programme through climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and the Mountains of the Moon as well as amazing support from Rotary District 9700 and in particular Past District Governor Fred Loneragan 2008-2009, has raised $250,000 for our projects in the past.  This has resulted in the building and refurbishment of a medical care clinic in Hout Bay, South Africa the provision of materials and wages to help run the School of St Jude’s in Tanzania.
We have also provided many Orphan Rescue Kits for children of Mathare in Nairobi which has now moved into sending children of secondary school age to secondary education.  Secondary education in Kenya is not free at the moment and requires organisations such as Rotary to identify those in greatest need.
THE LONGER VERSION OF OUR STORY

THE NEXT CHILDREN WAITING FOR A SCHOOL!

based on going beyond the anonymous services and consumption tourism, which is
reaching out to the travelling based on values for dialogue among cultures and
peace in the world.</p>The
philosophy was conceived by the Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation in Florence. The
Foundation’s mission started in 1991, after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, when
there was an urgent need in the world for promoting intercultural dialogue
among the youth of different countries.<br/>

                           Life Beyond Tourism: 
            a
Philosophy, a Community, a Model.

Life Beyond Tourism is a philosophy
based on going beyond the anonymous services and consumption tourism, which is
reaching out to the travelling based on values for dialogue among cultures and
peace in the world.The
philosophy was conceived by the Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation in Florence. The
Foundation’s mission started in 1991, after the Fall of the Berlin Wall, when
there was an urgent need in the world for promoting intercultural dialogue
among the youth of different countries.


                         Heritage Community

 
Life Beyond Tourism gave birth to
the international online heritage community. Lifebeyondtourism.org is a
10-languages interactive platform where community members can share and
exchange the true spirit of their territory. 


 

Points of interest,
itineraries, events, magazine, photoblog – Community Members use a variety of
tools to showcase their cultural richness. We save what matters to you from
ever-growing appetite of the globalization machine eliminating heartlessly
cultural diversities.  
HIGH-RANK TESTIMONIALS ON 
LIFE BEYOND TOURISM: TO MAKE YOUR HERITAGE SURVIVE
We have asked a number of high-rank experts in Culture and Heritage fields to give their testimonials and reasons on why it is important to sustain the principles expressed by the Philosophy Life Beyond Tourism and its practical applications.  See below the comments of Amra
Hadžimuhamedović, Chair of the Commission to Protect National Monuments, Bosnia
& Herzegovina - the first scholarship funded by #crazyforlife will go to the research on Bosnia & Herzegovina territory:

Tolstikova, Head of International Relations Department, All Russian State
Library of Foreign Literature, Russia: 
              Best practice: Life Beyond Tourism Model for                              Sustainable Development  


The practical application of the
Life Beyond Tourism philosophy led to the launch of the non-profit sustainable
development model Life Beyond Tourism. The model is able to generate money
through the flows of tourism. When you book your stay in travel destination,
you pay a booking fee which normally goes to multinational booking engines.
Life Beyond Tourism Model destines this percentage to the support of cultural
heritage of each concrete territory.


Life Beyond Tourism is an already
operational initiative in Florence with the local services booking portal
Vivafirenze.it. Vivafirenze.it operates under the auspices of the UNESCO
office  of the Municipality of Florence
and currently sustains 4 projects for the benefit of Florentine cultural
heritage, in complete transparency and with no additional costs for the client.        

     For each donation you will be heartily thanked by                                 Life Beyond Tourism

         
Depending on the level of involvement
and support you choose, you will receive a combination of unique Life Beyond
Tourism rewards, all accompanied by our sincere gratitude for joining our
Movement. The rewards are described in detail below:

of peace, intercultural dialogue and the innate necessity of preserving our
culture for the future of humanity.

to develop Life Beyond Tourism in its tangible and intangible aspects and
continue uniting people all over the globe with the common aim of preserving
and sustaining their territories and their cultural expressions.
We need your support: a responsible action of
conscious support, as we sustain what matters to you.

For the VERY first time this year, there will be a track (series of workshops/panels/sessions) that invites participants to go beyond the traditional understanding of the function of libraries. 
 On June 18-21, we will explore the ways that libraries can provide innovative services that facilitate the development of ideas and practices for strong communities.  Participants will develop strategies for effectively organizing information, media resources, and library spaces to be more accessible to their communities.  
The Radical Librarianship track is coordinated by Andrea Perez of Westland Public Library, Katie Dover-Taylor of Westland Public Library and Rachel Thompson of Seraphine Collective. **This campaign is raising funds on behalf of Allied Media Projects, Inc, a verified nonprofit.**


What We Need 

 The coordinators of the Radical Librarianship track need your support in order to make sure all our presenters and panelists can make it to Detroit for the conference! 
Funds will go towards stipends for travel expenses to Detroit, AMC registration fees, and lodging. 
Registration Fee: $150 per person.
Housing: About $45 per person/per night.
Travel expenses will vary.
    The Impact 
The AMC is a powerful space for creativity, transformation, and collaborative movement-building.  Presenters and participants will return to their communities with new connections and relationships, insights, concrete skills, new resources, and plans for innovative radical library projects.  The deeper our networks grow, the greater our capacity grows to take collective actions to transform our libraries and our communities!
Other Ways You Can Help

We know that not everyone can support the Radical librarianship track financially.  If you still want to help out with our campaign, please share this fundraiser on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, your blog, anywhere!  If you share with the buttons on the Indiegogo page it increases out visibility on Indiegogo.  Thanks so much for your help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Salve
a tutti, noi siamo il gruppo di robotica Pyle-1 dell’istituto E. Fermi di
Lucca. Siamo un gruppo composto da 13 ragazzi dell’ istituto accomunati dalla
passione per la robotica. <br/>
Già da molti anni l’Istituto Fermi svolge attività di questo tipo a vario
livello, sia con le classi<br/>
dell’Istituto tecnico e professionale sia con le classi del liceo delle Scienze
Applicate.<br/>
Con il nostro gruppo abbiamo partecipato a varie mostre a Lucca e fuori,
allestendo stand con i robot da noi ideati. In ogni
progetto da noi svolto,abbiamo cercato
di dare  il meglio, tornando a scuola
molti pomeriggi al di fuori dell’orario scolastico e portandoci anche a<br/>
casa il materiale per completare il lavoro non finito a scuola.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1144965/files/20150112055413-1.png?1421070853"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
Ed è con la stessa serietà e con lo stesso entusiasmo che ci siamo proposti di
realizzare questo progetto ambizioso: la costruzione di una stampante 3D.<br/>
La realizzazione di questo progetto porterà il nostro lavoro ad un livello
successivo.<br/>
La stampante, infatti, ci sarà utile per fabbricare parti meccaniche e di
design per i nostri robot e darà anche la possibilità
al nostro team di aprire una finestra sul nuovo tipo di progettazione e
di tecnologie che queste stampanti hanno introdotto.</p><p><b>A cosa serviranno i fondi?</b></p>
<p>I fondi raccolti da questa campagna saranno rivolti
all’acquisto della componentistica della stampante 3D e alla partecipazione a
corsi di formazione sulla costruzione della stampante e sull’uso dei software
di progettazione tridimensionale. Sia la stampante che i corsi ci sono forniti
dal FabLab di Pisa (il progetto completo è consultabile sul nostro sito <a href=""http://www.roboticafermi.it/?page_id=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.roboticafermi.it/?page_id=2</a>
).<br/>
Il kit per il montaggio della stampante ( HackerBot 3D ) ha un costo di circa
1870€ a cui vanno aggiunti i costi delle ore di corso per la costruzione e
l’uso della stampante. Le ricompense per le donazioni saranno prodotti stampati con la
 HackerBot (per un numero limitato di pezzi anche a 13€,
quindi affrettatevi!! ) o gadgets della scuola.</p>
<p>Se la campagna non dovesse andare a buon fine i soldi
raccolti verranno comunque utilizzati per il potenziamento della robotica
ovvero l’acquisto di materiale utile alla costruzione e allo sviluppo dei
nostri robot</p>

 Hackerbot 3D?</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>La Hackerbot 3D è una stampante open source dal design modulare
dotata di 2/3 estrusori a seconda del materiale di stampa. Ha uno schermo lcd
da dove è possibile controllare lo stato di stampa e compiere altre azioni, è
in grado di stampare da schede SD. È compatibile con tutti i sistemi operativi.
Stampa ABS, PLA, HIPS e nylon. L’ area di stampa varia a seconda del numero di
estrusori e dell’utilizzo o meno del piano riscaldato ma l’area massima di
stampa è 300x300x250mm senza piano riscaldato e 200x200x250mm con piano

<p><b>La parola ai nostri docenti</b></p>
<p>Durante i nostri incontri siamo seguiti da due professori, che
ci guidano anche ponendoci in un ottica più industriale e più lavorativa. Riportiamo
a seguito una loro introduzione al progetto e alle motivazioni che l’hanno
fatto nascere.</p>
<p><i>“Nel nostro istituto
siamo convinti che l’innovazione sia strettamente legata alle attività
produttive e che non possa prescindere da una solida formazione
tecnologica. Riteniamo importante, nel mondo di oggi, fornire agli alunni un
bagaglio di strumenti che facciano capire loro quanto di umanesimo
c’è nella tecnologia e quanto è significativo impegnarsi in prima persona
per capire, analizzare e imparare a fare, curando fino al minimo dettaglio
che garantisca il buon funzionamento di ciò che si è costruito.</i></p>
<p><i>Le attività che
proponiamo nel presente progetto vogliono essere integrative alle normali
attività curricolari. Di solito a scuola si apprende la teoria, le
abilità di base, ma non si riesce mai a vedere un prodotto finito. Con la
realizzazione di questo progetto ai ragazzi sarà chiesto di studiare
la teoria e metterla in pratica fino ad ottenere un prodotto finito.</i></p>
<p><i>I ragazzi potranno
approfondire la progettazione di apparati complessi, affiancandosi a<br/>
progettisti esperti. Per questo riteniamo queste attività pratiche e teoriche
costituiscano anche<br/>
una significativa esperienza di alternanza scuola lavoro, dal momento che ai
ragazzi sarà<br/>
richiesto di formare dei gruppi di lavoro con chi abitualmente lavora in
aziende e centri di<br/>
ricerca.</i></p>
<p><i>Si è scelto di
focalizzare queste esperienze su settori e tecnologie emergenti: in
ambito industriale, la stampa 3D sta rivoluzionando il concetto di
produzione, aprendo la possibilità di nuove professioni.</i></p>
<p><i>Queste tematiche permettono
e necessitano di un innovativo approccio multidisciplinare: ragazzi<br/>
si renderanno conto di come per realizzare una stampante 3D siano necessarie
conoscenze<br/>
diverse materie scolastiche: meccanica, elettronica, informatica e disegno
tecnico.<br/>
Il successivo utilizzo della stampante permetterà allo studente di approfondire
e mettere in<br/>
pratica materie artistiche, dal momento che diventerà possibile la
realizzazione fisica di modelli<br/>
tridimensionali. Il che apre nuovi scenari di apprendimento.</i></p>
<p><i>La stampante 3D,
consentendo una semplice realizzazione di componenti meccanici,
diventeràun’importante strumento laboratoriale per le successive attività di
robotica. Anche la robotica educativa ha importantissime implicazioni
didattiche. La rete di robotica di cui da tempo il nostro Istituto fa
parte si prefigge lo scopo di coinvolgere gli alunni fino dal loro primo
ingresso nella scuola materna e lungo tutto il loro percorso scolastico in
attività costruzionistiche, così come sono caldeggiate dal Prof. Seymour
Papert in modo che la tecnologia non sostituisca certo gli altri stimoli
formativi, ma costituisca un invito capire, costruire fare.</i></p>
<p><i>Già da molti anni
l’Istituto Fermi svolge attività di questo tipo a vario livello, sia con le
classi<br/>
dell’Istituto tecnico e professionale, che hanno realizzato vari apparati
perfettamente<br/>
funzionanti, sia con le classi del liceo delle Scienze Applicate, che hanno
partecipato a varie<br/>
mostre allestendo stand con i robot da essi stessi ideati (presso il museo
civico di Rovereto, la<br/>
 LuBe.C. (Lucca beni culturali), La notte del ricercatore,
Pianeta Galileo e Roboticamente).<br/>
Ogni volta che agli alunni è stato richiesto di lavorare per l’allestimento di
uno stand essi hanno<br/>
dato il meglio, tornando a scuola molti pomeriggi al di fuori dell’orario
scolastico, portandosi a<br/>
casa il materiale per completare il lavoro.<br/>
Noi siamo certi che anche la realizzazione di questo progetto eserciterà una
funzione maieutica sulle risorse dei nostri alunni spronandoli a dare il
massimo e questo ci sembra un grande risultato anche se nutriamo qualche
dubbio sulla sua effettiva innovatività.”</i></p>

Salve
a tutti, noi siamo il gruppo di robotica Pyle-1 dell’istituto E. Fermi di
Lucca. Siamo un gruppo composto da 13 ragazzi dell’ istituto accomunati dalla
passione per la robotica. 
Già da molti anni l’Istituto Fermi svolge attività di questo tipo a vario
livello, sia con le classi
dell’Istituto tecnico e professionale sia con le classi del liceo delle Scienze
Applicate.
Con il nostro gruppo abbiamo partecipato a varie mostre a Lucca e fuori,
allestendo stand con i robot da noi ideati. In ogni
progetto da noi svolto,abbiamo cercato
di dare  il meglio, tornando a scuola
molti pomeriggi al di fuori dell’orario scolastico e portandoci anche a
casa il materiale per completare il lavoro non finito a scuola.
Ed è con la stessa serietà e con lo stesso entusiasmo che ci siamo proposti di
realizzare questo progetto ambizioso: la costruzione di una stampante 3D.
La realizzazione di questo progetto porterà il nostro lavoro ad un livello
successivo.
La stampante, infatti, ci sarà utile per fabbricare parti meccaniche e di
design per i nostri robot e darà anche la possibilità
al nostro team di aprire una finestra sul nuovo tipo di progettazione e
di tecnologie che queste stampanti hanno introdotto.A cosa serviranno i fondi?
I fondi raccolti da questa campagna saranno rivolti
all’acquisto della componentistica della stampante 3D e alla partecipazione a
corsi di formazione sulla costruzione della stampante e sull’uso dei software
di progettazione tridimensionale. Sia la stampante che i corsi ci sono forniti
dal FabLab di Pisa (il progetto completo è consultabile sul nostro sito http://www.roboticafermi.it/?page_id=2
).
Il kit per il montaggio della stampante ( HackerBot 3D ) ha un costo di circa
1870€ a cui vanno aggiunti i costi delle ore di corso per la costruzione e
l’uso della stampante. Le ricompense per le donazioni saranno prodotti stampati con la
 HackerBot (per un numero limitato di pezzi anche a 13€,
quindi affrettatevi!! ) o gadgets della scuola.
Se la campagna non dovesse andare a buon fine i soldi
raccolti verranno comunque utilizzati per il potenziamento della robotica
ovvero l’acquisto di materiale utile alla costruzione e allo sviluppo dei
nostri robot
Cosa è la
 Hackerbot 3D?
La Hackerbot 3D è una stampante open source dal design modulare
dotata di 2/3 estrusori a seconda del materiale di stampa. Ha uno schermo lcd
da dove è possibile controllare lo stato di stampa e compiere altre azioni, è
in grado di stampare da schede SD. È compatibile con tutti i sistemi operativi.
Stampa ABS, PLA, HIPS e nylon. L’ area di stampa varia a seconda del numero di
estrusori e dell’utilizzo o meno del piano riscaldato ma l’area massima di
stampa è 300x300x250mm senza piano riscaldato e 200x200x250mm con piano
riscaldato.

La parola ai nostri docenti
Durante i nostri incontri siamo seguiti da due professori, che
ci guidano anche ponendoci in un ottica più industriale e più lavorativa. Riportiamo
a seguito una loro introduzione al progetto e alle motivazioni che l’hanno
fatto nascere.
“Nel nostro istituto
siamo convinti che l’innovazione sia strettamente legata alle attività
produttive e che non possa prescindere da una solida formazione
tecnologica. Riteniamo importante, nel mondo di oggi, fornire agli alunni un
bagaglio di strumenti che facciano capire loro quanto di umanesimo
c’è nella tecnologia e quanto è significativo impegnarsi in prima persona
per capire, analizzare e imparare a fare, curando fino al minimo dettaglio
che garantisca il buon funzionamento di ciò che si è costruito.
Le attività che
proponiamo nel presente progetto vogliono essere integrative alle normali
attività curricolari. Di solito a scuola si apprende la teoria, le
abilità di base, ma non si riesce mai a vedere un prodotto finito. Con la
realizzazione di questo progetto ai ragazzi sarà chiesto di studiare
la teoria e metterla in pratica fino ad ottenere un prodotto finito.
I ragazzi potranno
approfondire la progettazione di apparati complessi, affiancandosi a
progettisti esperti. Per questo riteniamo queste attività pratiche e teoriche
costituiscano anche
una significativa esperienza di alternanza scuola lavoro, dal momento che ai
ragazzi sarà
richiesto di formare dei gruppi di lavoro con chi abitualmente lavora in
aziende e centri di
ricerca.
Si è scelto di
focalizzare queste esperienze su settori e tecnologie emergenti: in
ambito industriale, la stampa 3D sta rivoluzionando il concetto di
produzione, aprendo la possibilità di nuove professioni.
Queste tematiche permettono
e necessitano di un innovativo approccio multidisciplinare: ragazzi
si renderanno conto di come per realizzare una stampante 3D siano necessarie
conoscenze
diverse materie scolastiche: meccanica, elettronica, informatica e disegno
tecnico.
Il successivo utilizzo della stampante permetterà allo studente di approfondire
e mettere in
pratica materie artistiche, dal momento che diventerà possibile la
realizzazione fisica di modelli
tridimensionali. Il che apre nuovi scenari di apprendimento.
La stampante 3D,
consentendo una semplice realizzazione di componenti meccanici,
diventeràun’importante strumento laboratoriale per le successive attività di
robotica. Anche la robotica educativa ha importantissime implicazioni
didattiche. La rete di robotica di cui da tempo il nostro Istituto fa
parte si prefigge lo scopo di coinvolgere gli alunni fino dal loro primo
ingresso nella scuola materna e lungo tutto il loro percorso scolastico in
attività costruzionistiche, così come sono caldeggiate dal Prof. Seymour
Papert in modo che la tecnologia non sostituisca certo gli altri stimoli
formativi, ma costituisca un invito capire, costruire fare.
Già da molti anni
l’Istituto Fermi svolge attività di questo tipo a vario livello, sia con le
classi
dell’Istituto tecnico e professionale, che hanno realizzato vari apparati
perfettamente
funzionanti, sia con le classi del liceo delle Scienze Applicate, che hanno
partecipato a varie
mostre allestendo stand con i robot da essi stessi ideati (presso il museo
civico di Rovereto, la
 LuBe.C. (Lucca beni culturali), La notte del ricercatore,
Pianeta Galileo e Roboticamente).
Ogni volta che agli alunni è stato richiesto di lavorare per l’allestimento di
uno stand essi hanno
dato il meglio, tornando a scuola molti pomeriggi al di fuori dell’orario
scolastico, portandosi a
casa il materiale per completare il lavoro.
Noi siamo certi che anche la realizzazione di questo progetto eserciterà una
funzione maieutica sulle risorse dei nostri alunni spronandoli a dare il
massimo e questo ci sembra un grande risultato anche se nutriamo qualche
dubbio sulla sua effettiva innovatività.”

youtube. Andate e spargete la voce!!. Seguendoci rimarrete aggiornati sullo
sviluppo del progetto, eventi, mostre, progetti futuri e altro ancora.
Le ricompense per chi contribuisce
Se la campagna andrà a buon fine, abbiamo deciso di fare una
conferenza di presentazione a scuola dove saranno consegnate le ricompense e
sarà illustrata la stampante. Se voi non sarete presenti alla conferenza
potrete comunque ricevere la ricompensa tuttavia in quanto scuola non ci
possiamo accollare le spese di spedizione delle ricompense e quindi le esse
saranno a carico del destinatario.
Per le aziende che fossero interessate a finanziare il
nostro progetto abbiamo pensato a una sorta di 
sponsorizzazione in quanto con un contributo dai  100€ ai 200€ metteremo sul nostro sito il logo e il link dell’ azienda per un anno. Per chi invece offrirà una cifra superiore ai 200€ il logo verrà messo

Quand il n'y a pas de sang, on s'assèche et puis on meurt. Pourtant en Afrique 400 millions d'adultes n'ont pas accès au financement formel. A titre d'exemple, le taux de bancarisation de l'UE et des USA sont autour de 90%. Au Cameroun, moins de 20% de la population y a accès. 
 
Ceci signifie que dans mon pays, prêt de 17 millions de personnes n'ont aucun contrôle sur l'amélioration de leur conditions de vie. Pourquoi? 

Je suis Dombou Dany, jeune doctorant en économie. Je ne vais pas me mettre à vous citer les articles, mais sachez que de nombreux auteurs qui se sont penchés sur la question (pour ne pas dire tous), ont démontré qu'il existe un lien étroit et positif entre l'accès au financement et la réduction de la pauvreté. 
Comprenez donc combien il est important d'aider les populations pauvres à être autonomes. 

Le gouvernement, dans toute sa bonne volonté, élabore des politiques qui des fois réussissent, des fois pas: Mais le fait est qu'en 2017, une bonne partie de la population vie en dessous du seuil de pauvreté. 

Nous avons dessine un projet qui se présente en deux étapes: Former les jeunes aux techniques de collecte de donnée (ceci durant la campagne de collecte de données pour mon projet de recherche sur toute l'étendu du pays), et puis les mettre en relation via une plateforme physique et virtuelle: Survey &amp; Stat Lab. 

Mon projet de recherche vise à Identifier les segments de population particulièrement vulnérables à l'exclusion financière, comprendre les racines de leur exclusion, et Recenser à la source leurs propositions pour l'amélioration de leurs conditions. Région par région, sur toute l'étendu du territoire. 

C'est là que moi, et comme je vous le montrerai bientôt, des milliers de jeunes étudiants chercheurs ont besoin de votre aide. Nos universités n'ont pas assez de moyens. Du coup, nous avons d'énormes difficultés durant nos travaux de recherche. D'ailleurs, ici, pour ne pas dire que c'est la coutume, il arrive parfois que des étudiants passent plus de 7 ans en cycle doctorat sans pour autant soutenir. le master qui se fait en 2 ans, ici, la moyenne c'est trois ou 4. 

Bien sur il y a d'autres causes à cette situation comme la sorcellerie (blague)... Mais soyons sérieux, la difficulté dans l'accès aux données, retardent et parfois biaisent nos résultats. On donne au gouvernement de mauvais résultats, ce qui entraînent de mauvaise politiques ...

Dans une première étape, notre projet consistera durant ma campagne de collecte de données sur l'inclusion financière, à former des jeunes dans toutes les régions de mon pays à la collecte de données. 
Par la suite, nous lancerons une structure qui mettra en relation tous ces jeunes formés à la collecte avec les étudiants chercheurs. 
Moi par exemple, pour réaliser mon projet, les plateformes demandent des financements de l'ordre de 100 000 USD, avec ce système, pour le même travail, il me faudra débourser 200 USD. Vous vous rendez compte? 
Nous formerons donc des étudiants à travailler sur les enquêtes des autres et utiliser une partie de leur salaire pour financer leur enquête à eux. 

Un pays ne peu pas se développer si sa jeunesse n'a pas accès à une éducation de qualité, si sa jeunesse ne met pas à profit ce savoir au service du développement. 
Nos frères découragés se noie à vouloir traverser la méditerranée. Nous autres qui avons encore des bribes d'espoir savons que
Notre gouvernement ne peut pas tout faire, et nous jeunes, nous avons la volonté de l'aider à nous aider.

Moi par exemple, pour réaliser mon projet, les plateformes demandent des financements de l'ordre de 100 000 USD, avec ce système, pour le même travail, il me faudra débourser 200 USD. Vous vous rendez compte? 
Nous formerons donc des étudiants à travailler sur les enquêtes des autres et utiliser une partie de leur salaire pour financer leur enquête à eux. 

Un pays ne peu pas se développer si sa jeunesse n'a pas accès à une éducation de qualité, si sa jeunesse ne met pas à profit ce savoir au service du développement. 
Nos frères découragés se noie à vouloir traverser la méditerranée. Nous autres qui avons encore des bribes d'espoir savons que
Notre gouvernement ne peut pas tout faire, et nous jeunes, nous avons la volonté de l'aider à nous aider. 
Nous voulons, mais nous ne pouvons pas: alors, nous comptons sur vous!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h2><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></h2><p><strong>Why do you need $140,000?</strong></p><p>After thorough research as to how best we can establish the most sustainable and simultaneously cheap environment for our children we found that this is the basic estimated cost to start building. Basic infrastructural needs such as lavatories, staff quarters, water supply, electricity, but also tools to help us build all of these features come together to generate this sum.</p><p>Generally, the future brings more as these are merely the first steps towards building a new home for the Philippine´s orphans, but it sets a foundation that will be the founding boulder of our dream and ambition.</p><p><strong>How do we know you will succeed?</strong></p><p>Like with all other Interhelp projects, the backed funding of ourselves and our sponsors has given us the backbone necessary to complete all our projects with no exceptions. Praise from members of state throughout both Germany and the countries we have operated in has shown that the fundamental grip and organisation used in our form of tasks is sustainable and effective.</p><p>And so, like in any other project, we have worked together with experienced professionals to determine how likely the chances for success are in terms of the Youth village project. Timings, resources and the forms of classes were taken into consideration, so that we can know how likely Jon Perez´ plan is to make an effective change in the local environment. We have come to the conclusion that it is very much possible, and very likely but that we will need a helping hand from a third party, this is where <strong><u>you</u></strong> come in!</p><p>It is entirely a matter of if we can, together, raise the required amount to determine the effectiveness of our project.

</p><p><i>In den Philippinen leben mehr als 2 Millionen Kinder ohne Obdach, und wir sind dabei, das zu ändern. Aber wir brauchen <b>Ihre</b> Hilfe!</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>Seit der Taifun Haiyan im Jahre 2013 die Philippinen heimsuchte, hat die Bevölkerung Unvorstellbares erlitten. Aber eine Handvoll Optimisten hat einen <b>Weg aus dem Elend</b> gesucht.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Durch die Wiederrichtung und Reparatur von Gebäuden und durch die Bereitstellung von Schulunterricht für Kinder in der Nähe der Stadt Davao wurde dort ein wichtiger Beitrag für den allmählichen Wiederaufbau geleistet. Aber das allein reicht nicht aus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In einer einzigartigen Zusammenarbeit zwischen philippinischen und deutschen Visionären setzt sich das <b>„Davao Youth Village“</b> dafür ein, das Leben der Kinder zu ändern, indem dort ein stabiles, zukunftsorientiertes und nachhaltiges Internat für Waisen eingerichtet wird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Durch den gemeinsamen Einsatz hunderter Freiwilliger werden diese Kinder nicht nur lesen und schreiben lernen, sondern es wird ihnen auch die aktive, selbstverantwortliche Mitgestaltung ihres künftigen Lebens ermöglicht. Indem diesen bisher chancenlosen jungen Menschen der Weg zur Bildung geebnet wird, wird es zugleich möglich, dass auch sie eines Tages selbst ihren Mitmenschen helfen können.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h2><b>Über 8.000 Menschen </b></h2><div><b><br/></b></div><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">sind entweder durch den Taifun Haiyan oder seine Nachfolger in den letzten 3 Jahren ums Leben gekommen. Familien, die durch die Katastrophe auseinandergerissen wurden, sind unter den gegenwärtigen Umständen eine grausame, aber alltägliche Realität. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tausende von Kindern leben hilflos und verarmt in einem der weltweit wirtschaftsstärksten Entwicklungsländer, das aber mit Bevölkerungsexplosion und ständigen Naturkatastrophen zu kämpfen hat, Probleme, die das Land <b>ohne Hilfe von außen</b> nicht bewältigen kann.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>Verbrechen, Vergewaltigung, Drogen </b></h2><p><br/></p><p>diese und ähnliche Missstände sind in den größten Städten des Landes ohnehin an der Tagesordnung, aber Naturkatastrophen erhöhen die Verbrechensrate noch einmal dramatisch. Eines der <b>weltweit schönsten Länder</b> führt einen verzweifelten Kampf um die innere Sicherheit, und trotz messbarer Erfolge sind es immer noch die verwaisten Kinder, die am meisten leiden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Die Probleme sind gigantisch,<b> aber wir haben einen Plan</b>...</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>Schrittweise Hilfe zur Wiederherstellung eines Landes:</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p><br/></p><p>Das „Davao Youth Village“ bietet den Kindern eine positive und nachhaltige Umgebung, in der sie gemeinsam mit Lehrern und freiwilligen Helfern aus der Region leben und aufwachsen können. Dieses Refugium ermöglicht es den Kindern, die Kontrolle über ihr Leben zu erlangen, indem Bildung finanziert und die sozio-ökonomischen Bedingungen verbessert werden. Das gelingt durch einfaches, schrittweises Vorgehen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Schritt 1: </b>Grundlegende Infrastrukturen, Gebäude, Gehäuse, Zäune, Wasser, Strom und Lehreinrichtungen erstellen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Schritt 2: </b>Aufbau von Partnerschaften mit Lehrern und Mentoren, die als Ersatz für die verlorenen Eltern fungieren.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Schritt 3: </b>Lernmittel, Bücher, Ausrüstung anschaffen, um den Prozess ins Rollen zu bringen!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Schritt 4: </b>Während die Initiative auf immer breitere Basis gestellt wird, entwickeln sich die Kinder allmählich zu Lehrern.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><b>Bildung ist Macht!</b></h3><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Die Macht, Probleme selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Ein Waisenkind zu unterrichten, bedeutet, einen wachen jungen Geist mit den notwendigen Mitteln versehen, um anderen, weiteren Waisen zu helfen. Von einem unterrichteten Kind profitieren zehn andere!</p><p><br/></p>

Getragen wurde sie seinerzeit von der Deister- und Weserzeitung in Hameln und vom Paritätischen Wohlfahrtsverband Hameln, der Mitglied ist im Aktionsbündnis ""Deutschland hilft"". Interhelp ist die Nachfolgeorganisation von „Hameln-Pyrmont hilft!“. Schirmherr der Deutschen Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe ist Alexander Fürst zu Schaumburg Lippe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am 08. Januar 2005 startete von Hameln aus ein Erkundungsteam nach Sri Lanka. Unter der Leitung des Journalisten und Kinder-in-Not-Gründers Ulrich Behmann wurde auf Sri Lanka die Küstenregion des Distrikts Galle erkundet, um nach geeigneten Gebieten für eine Soforthilfe und für eine längerfristig angelegte Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe zu suchen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In Paraliya bei Hikkaduwa, wo der Express-Zug Nr. 50 von den Gleisen gespült wurde, wo mehr als 2500 Menschen den Tod fanden und ein Dorf ausradiert wurde, wurde die Aktion ""Hameln-Pyrmont hilft"" vom Katastrophenstab des Divisional Secretariat gebeten, ein Feldlazarett zu errichten. In einem notdürftig hergerichteten Schulgebäude wurden vom 12. Januar 2005 bis zum 15. März 2005 Opfer der Flut behandelt und mit Medikamenten versorgt - unter der Leitung von Reinhold Klostermann, Unternehmer, Lehrrettungsassistent und stellvertretender Vorsitzender der Deutschen Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe (Interhelp) führte ein internationales Helfer-Team in dieser Zeit 18.500 Behandlungen durch. Kooperationspartner war das Balapitiya Base Hospital.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Amarasiri Kuruwage, Staatssekretär des Justizministers Amarasiri Dodangoda, bat ""Hameln-Pyrmont hilft!"" um Zelte und Betten. Flut-Flüchtlinge, die ihre Häuser wieder aufbauen wollten, sollten in der Nähe von Hab und Gut übernachten können. Die medizinische Versorgung wurde im In- und Ausland gelobt und begrüßt - unter anderem von der deutschen Entwicklungshilfeministerin Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, die unsere Projekte besucht hat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mit einer Geldspende des Rotary Clubs Bad Pyrmont wurden in den ersten Tagen mehr als 6 Tonnen Reis und Zwiebeln an Rückkehrer verteilt, die die Hamelner Aktion in Sri Lanka gekauft hatte. Überhaupt wurde vor Ort eingekauft. Nur Medikamente, die es auf Sri Lanka nicht zu kaufen gab, und Zelte wurden mit freundlicher Unterstützung der Fluggesellschaft ""Emirates"" eingeflogen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Das ""Hameln Hospital"" wurde am 15. März 2005 an die ""Sri Lanka Red Cross Society"" übergeben. Somit ist das Rote Kreuz künftig in der Lage bei kleineren Katastrophen selbst einzugreifen.</p><p><br/></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><b>Am 9. Juni 2016</b> werden sich die ehemalige Interhelp-Schirmherrin und jetzige Bulgari-Markenbotschafterin <b>Prinzessin Lilly zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg</b> und ihr Sohn <b>Erbprinz Donatus zu Schaumburg-Lippe</b> auf eine einzigartige Reise begeben.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mit der Unterstützung sowohl von Interhelp als auch von Bulgari wird sie ihr Projekt zu den emotionalen Wurzeln von Lillys früheren Jahren mit der Organisation in Bulgarien zurückführen, wo sie über einen Zeitraum von 5 Tagen einen fast <b>200 km langen Ultra-Marathon</b> bewältigen wollen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Das Projekt spiegelt die Hoffnung wieder, die dem Wesen der karitativen Organisation zugrunde liegt: Die Hoffnung, die Strecke zu bewältigen symbolisiert zugleich die Hoffnung auf eine bessere Zukunft in den ärmsten Ländern der Welt - in diesem Fall auch in dem wirtschaftlich schwächsten Land der Europäischen Union, <b>Bulgarien</b>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bis zum heutigen Tag hilft Interhelp Waisen im ganzen Land und trägt wesentlich zur groß angelegten Hilfsprojekten bei.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lilly und Donatus werden ihren <b>Instagram-Account täglich aktualisieren</b>, und Sie können ihnen live auf <b>Runtastic</b> folgen, um sie anzufeuern und zu motivieren! :</p>

</p><h1><b>Häufig gestellte Fragen</b></h1><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Wofür benötigen Sie $ 140.000,-?</b></p>
<p>Nach ausführlichen Untersuchungen zur Frage, wie wir die zugleich nachhaltigste und kostengünstigste Umgebung für “unsere” Kinder herstellen können, sind wir zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass dies der Sockelbetrag ist, mit dem wir unser Vorhaben einleiten können. Grundlegende Erfordernisse wie Waschräume und Toiletten, Unterbringung für Mitarbeiter, Wasser- und Stromversorgung, aber auch die nötigen Werkzeuge, um dies alles zu errichten, summieren sich zu 140 000 US-Dollar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Natürlich werden in Zukunft weitere Mittel benötigt werden, da diese Dinge nur die ersten Schritte darstellen, aber damit schaffen wir die Basis, den Eckstein für die Umsetzung unserer Vision.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>IL PROGETTO YOUTH VILLAGE</b></p>
<p><b><i>ISPIRARE UN BAMBINO, ISPIRARE UNA NAZIONE!</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Ci sono oltre <b><u>2 milioni di
bambini senza casa</u></b> soltanto nelle Filippine, e siamo in procinto
di cambiare la situazione. Ma abbiamo bisogno del<b><u> vostro</u></b> aiuto!</i></p>
<p>Dal Typhoon Haiyan nel 2013 le Filippine
hanno subito conseguenze inimmaginabili alle loro infrastrutture, e ci sono
voluti alcuni ottimisti per trovare una soluzione.</p>
<p>La costruzione di muri ed edifici e la
fornitura di istruzione ai bambini nelle vicinanze della città di Davao hanno
contribuito enormemente al lento progresso di ricostruzione dei paesi, <i>ma
questo non è sufficiente!</i></p>
<p>In una collaborazione unica tra
visionari filippini e tedeschi il <b><u>Davao Youth Village</u></b> mira
a cambiare le vite dei bambini attraverso la costruzione di un collegio per
orfani stabile, progressista e sostenibile.</p>
<p>Grazie agli sforzi congiunti di
centinaia di volontari questi bambini impareranno a costruire e creare, ma
anche a leggere, scrivere, e perseguire qualunque sogno accademico così che un
giorno anche loro potranno aiutare i loro compagni.</p>
<p><b>Oltre 8.000 persone</b></p>
<p>sono morte nel Typhoon Haiyan o nei
successivi negli ultimi <b>3 anni</b> . I risultati sono
disastrosi, e le famiglie distrutte sono una mera realtà nelle attuali
circostanze.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Migliaia di bambini restano senza speranza e poveri in uno dei più
promettenti paesi in via di sviluppo al mondo, ma con l’elevata densità
demografica/esplosione demografica(?) e le ricorrenti catastrofi naturali è un
lavoro che richiede supporto.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Crimine, stupro,
droga.</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All'ordine del giorno nelle più
importanti città del paese, con tassi di aumento allarmanti dopo ogni disastro
naturale. Uno dei paesi più belli del mondo sta combattendo per riprendere
il controllo, e con i numeri che scendono quelli che soffrono di più sono i
bambini rimasti orfani.</span><br/></p>
<p>Può sembrare difficile, ma abbiamo un piano...</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Come salvare un paese, <i>un passo alla volta</i> :</b></p>
<p>Il <b>Davao Youth Village</b> permette
ai bambini di prosperare in un ambiente positivo e sostenibile, insieme agli
insegnanti e volontari provenienti da tutto il territorio e dal resto del
mondo; questo rifugio sicuro permette alle persone di riprendere l'iniziativa,
finanziando l'istruzione, e migliorando le condizioni socio-economiche. Un
semplice passo alla volta:</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Fase 1:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Creare
infrastrutture di base, edifici, alloggiamenti, recinzioni, acqua, elettricità
e strutture didattiche.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Fase 2:</b> Costruire
partnership (partenariati) con insegnanti e mentori, che agiscono come un
sostituto per i genitori perduti.</p>
<p><b>Fase 3:</b> Fornire
strutture per l'insegnamento, i libri, attrezzature e dare il via al processo!</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Fase 4: Guarda come l'iniziativa si
diffonde; i bambini diventano i docenti</b><br/></p>
<p><b>L'istruzione è potere!</b></p>
<p>Potere di prendere in mano la situazione. Con
ogni orfano istruito si riempie una giovane mente brillante con gli strumenti
necessari per salvare il prossimo. Con un bambino istruito, dieci ne
beneficeranno!</p>

<p><b>Perché avete bisogno di $ 140.000?</b></p>
<p>Dopo una ricerca approfondita su come
meglio possiamo stabilire il contesto più sostenibile ed allo stesso tempo più
economico per i nostri bambini abbiamo definito che questo è il costo di base
stimato per iniziare a costruire. Le esigenze infrastrutturali di base,
quali servizi igienici, alloggi del personale, fornitura di acqua, energia elettrica,
si sommano agli strumenti necessari per costruire tutto questo, generando tale importo.</p>
<p>Naturalmente in futuro saranno necessari
più fondi, poichè questi sono soli i primi passi verso la costruzione di una
nuova casa per gli orfani delle Filippine, ma getta le fondamente che saranno
la pietra angolare per realizzare il nostro sogno e la nostra ambizione.</p>
<p><b>Come facciamo a sapere che avrà
successo?</b></p>
<p>Come con tutti gli altri progetti
Interhelp, il finanziamento sostenuto da noi e dai nostri sponsor ci ha dato determinazione
necessaria per completare tutti i nostri progetti senza eccezioni. Lodi da
parte dei membri dello stato ovunque sia in Germania che nei paesi in cui
abbiamo operato hanno dimostrato che la fondamentale padronanza e organizzazione
utilizzate nella nostra struttura dei compiti è sostenibile ed efficace.</p>
<p>E così, come per qualsiasi altro
progetto, abbiamo lavorato insieme con professionisti esperti per determinare
le probabilità di successo del progetto Youth Village. Le tempistiche, le
risorse e il tipo di corsi sono stati presi in considerazione, per determinare
quante sono le probabilità del progetto di Jon Perez di apportare un
cambiamento effettivo al contesto locale. Siamo giunti alla conclusione
che è di fatto possibile, e molto probabile, ma che avremmo avuto bisogno di
una mano da parte di terzi, qui è dove entri in scena <b>tu</b>!</p>
<p>E' interamente una questione di se
possiamo, insieme, raggiungere l'importo necessario per determinare l'efficacia
del nostro progetto. Il resto riguarda le mani esperte di Interhelp e
l'incredibile etica del lavoro visionario dei Filippini.</p>

Questions and AnswersWhy do you need $140,000?After thorough research as to how best we can establish the most sustainable and simultaneously cheap environment for our children we found that this is the basic estimated cost to start building. Basic infrastructural needs such as lavatories, staff quarters, water supply, electricity, but also tools to help us build all of these features come together to generate this sum.Generally, the future brings more as these are merely the first steps towards building a new home for the Philippine´s orphans, but it sets a foundation that will be the founding boulder of our dream and ambition.How do we know you will succeed?Like with all other Interhelp projects, the backed funding of ourselves and our sponsors has given us the backbone necessary to complete all our projects with no exceptions. Praise from members of state throughout both Germany and the countries we have operated in has shown that the fundamental grip and organisation used in our form of tasks is sustainable and effective.And so, like in any other project, we have worked together with experienced professionals to determine how likely the chances for success are in terms of the Youth village project. Timings, resources and the forms of classes were taken into consideration, so that we can know how likely Jon Perez´ plan is to make an effective change in the local environment. We have come to the conclusion that it is very much possible, and very likely but that we will need a helping hand from a third party, this is where you come in!It is entirely a matter of if we can, together, raise the required amount to determine the effectiveness of our project. The rest is a matter of the experienced hands of Interhelp and the incredible visionary work ethic found amongst the Filipino Locals.Where can I donate from?Absolutely anywhereDo I have to pay extra shipping fees for my perks?Not at all.How can I best endorse you?Please feel free to see the above!

In den Philippinen leben mehr als 2 Millionen Kinder ohne Obdach, und wir sind dabei, das zu ändern. Aber wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe!

Seit der Taifun Haiyan im Jahre 2013 die Philippinen heimsuchte, hat die Bevölkerung Unvorstellbares erlitten. Aber eine Handvoll Optimisten hat einen Weg aus dem Elend gesucht.

Durch die Wiederrichtung und Reparatur von Gebäuden und durch die Bereitstellung von Schulunterricht für Kinder in der Nähe der Stadt Davao wurde dort ein wichtiger Beitrag für den allmählichen Wiederaufbau geleistet. Aber das allein reicht nicht aus.

In einer einzigartigen Zusammenarbeit zwischen philippinischen und deutschen Visionären setzt sich das „Davao Youth Village“ dafür ein, das Leben der Kinder zu ändern, indem dort ein stabiles, zukunftsorientiertes und nachhaltiges Internat für Waisen eingerichtet wird.

Durch den gemeinsamen Einsatz hunderter Freiwilliger werden diese Kinder nicht nur lesen und schreiben lernen, sondern es wird ihnen auch die aktive, selbstverantwortliche Mitgestaltung ihres künftigen Lebens ermöglicht. Indem diesen bisher chancenlosen jungen Menschen der Weg zur Bildung geebnet wird, wird es zugleich möglich, dass auch sie eines Tages selbst ihren Mitmenschen helfen können.


Über 8.000 Menschen sind entweder durch den Taifun Haiyan oder seine Nachfolger in den letzten 3 Jahren ums Leben gekommen. Familien, die durch die Katastrophe auseinandergerissen wurden, sind unter den gegenwärtigen Umständen eine grausame, aber alltägliche Realität. 

Tausende von Kindern leben hilflos und verarmt in einem der weltweit wirtschaftsstärksten Entwicklungsländer, das aber mit Bevölkerungsexplosion und ständigen Naturkatastrophen zu kämpfen hat, Probleme, die das Land ohne Hilfe von außen nicht bewältigen kann.

Verbrechen, Vergewaltigung, Drogen diese und ähnliche Missstände sind in den größten Städten des Landes ohnehin an der Tagesordnung, aber Naturkatastrophen erhöhen die Verbrechensrate noch einmal dramatisch. Eines der weltweit schönsten Länder führt einen verzweifelten Kampf um die innere Sicherheit, und trotz messbarer Erfolge sind es immer noch die verwaisten Kinder, die am meisten leiden.

Die Probleme sind gigantisch, aber wir haben einen Plan...

Schrittweise Hilfe zur Wiederherstellung eines Landes:

Das „Davao Youth Village“ bietet den Kindern eine positive und nachhaltige Umgebung, in der sie gemeinsam mit Lehrern und freiwilligen Helfern aus der Region leben und aufwachsen können. Dieses Refugium ermöglicht es den Kindern, die Kontrolle über ihr Leben zu erlangen, indem Bildung finanziert und die sozio-ökonomischen Bedingungen verbessert werden. Das gelingt durch einfaches, schrittweises Vorgehen.

Schritt 1: Grundlegende Infrastrukturen, Gebäude, Gehäuse, Zäune, Wasser, Strom und Lehreinrichtungen erstellen.

Schritt 2: Aufbau von Partnerschaften mit Lehrern und Mentoren, die als Ersatz für die verlorenen Eltern fungieren.

Schritt 3: Lernmittel, Bücher, Ausrüstung anschaffen, um den Prozess ins Rollen zu bringen!

Schritt 4: Während die Initiative auf immer breitere Basis gestellt wird, entwickeln sich die Kinder allmählich zu Lehrern.


Bildung ist Macht!

Die Macht, Probleme selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Ein Waisenkind zu unterrichten, bedeutet, einen wachen jungen Geist mit den notwendigen Mitteln versehen, um anderen, weiteren Waisen zu helfen. Von einem unterrichteten Kind profitieren zehn andere!


Über Interhelp:


""Auch die besuchten Projekte ""Hilfe für Paraliya"" (Schulbau, Unterstützung eines Krankenhauses, Ausrüstung von Fischern), die durch ""Interhelp - Deutsche Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe"" durchgeführt werden, haben beeindruckende Erfolge erzielt. Auch hier gilt, dass mittels persönlicher Kontakte eine vertrauensvolle Organisation möglich ist, die zudem von Deutschland aus professionell gefördert wird.""



Undine Kurth MdB, Bericht für den Ausschuss für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung



""Sie haben gezeigt, dass internationale Kontakte nicht nur Regierungssache sind, sondern ein Netz darstellen, das gerade in Notzeiten tragfähig ist.""
""Das humanitäre Engagement der Interhelp- Mitglieder ist nicht nur Ausdruck eines guten und erfolgreichen bürgerschaftlichen Engagements, sondern auch Beleg dafür, dass aus Niedersachsen heraus nachhaltig und unabhängig von Schlagzeilen uneigennützige Hilfe für Opfer von Katastrophen geleistet wird.""



Christian Wulff, Bundespräsident aD der Bundesrepublik Deutschland



""Was Interhelp macht, hat Hand und Fuß, ist seriös, nachhaltig und effektiv.""



Hans-Heinrich Sander, niedersächsischer Minister für Umwelt



""Sie waren als erste vor Ort und sind immer noch da! Das verdient Lob und Anerkennung. Der Einsatz von Interhelp kann gar nicht genug gewürdigt werden. Wir Hamelner können stolz darauf sein, dass es in unserer Stadt Menschen gibt, die nicht gleichgültig gegenüber den Ereignissen und Katastrophen sind, die um uns herum geschehen und denen wir gemeinsam begegnen müssen.""

Susanne Lippmann, Oberbürgermeisterin der Stadt Hameln



""Für diese Organisationen bin ich sehr gern als Bettler unterwegs.""

Fürst Alexander zu Schaumburg-Lippe, Schirmherr von Interhelp



Interhelp- Deutsche Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe ist ein gemeinnütziger und mildtätiger Verein, der aus der Aktion „Hameln-Pyrmont hilft!“ hervorgegangen ist. Am 4. Januar 2005, also wenige Tage nach der verheerenden Tsunami-Katastrophe in Süd-Asien, hatte sich die Hilfsaktion in Hameln bei Hannover gegründet. Getragen wurde sie seinerzeit von der Deister- und Weserzeitung in Hameln und vom Paritätischen Wohlfahrtsverband Hameln, der Mitglied ist im Aktionsbündnis ""Deutschland hilft"". Interhelp ist die Nachfolgeorganisation von „Hameln-Pyrmont hilft!“. Schirmherr der Deutschen Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe ist Alexander Fürst zu Schaumburg Lippe.

Am 08. Januar 2005 startete von Hameln aus ein Erkundungsteam nach Sri Lanka. Unter der Leitung des Journalisten und Kinder-in-Not-Gründers Ulrich Behmann wurde auf Sri Lanka die Küstenregion des Distrikts Galle erkundet, um nach geeigneten Gebieten für eine Soforthilfe und für eine längerfristig angelegte Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe zu suchen.


In Paraliya bei Hikkaduwa, wo der Express-Zug Nr. 50 von den Gleisen gespült wurde, wo mehr als 2500 Menschen den Tod fanden und ein Dorf ausradiert wurde, wurde die Aktion ""Hameln-Pyrmont hilft"" vom Katastrophenstab des Divisional Secretariat gebeten, ein Feldlazarett zu errichten. In einem notdürftig hergerichteten Schulgebäude wurden vom 12. Januar 2005 bis zum 15. März 2005 Opfer der Flut behandelt und mit Medikamenten versorgt - unter der Leitung von Reinhold Klostermann, Unternehmer, Lehrrettungsassistent und stellvertretender Vorsitzender der Deutschen Gesellschaft für internationale Hilfe (Interhelp) führte ein internationales Helfer-Team in dieser Zeit 18.500 Behandlungen durch. Kooperationspartner war das Balapitiya Base Hospital.

Mr. Amarasiri Kuruwage, Staatssekretär des Justizministers Amarasiri Dodangoda, bat ""Hameln-Pyrmont hilft!"" um Zelte und Betten. Flut-Flüchtlinge, die ihre Häuser wieder aufbauen wollten, sollten in der Nähe von Hab und Gut übernachten können. Die medizinische Versorgung wurde im In- und Ausland gelobt und begrüßt - unter anderem von der deutschen Entwicklungshilfeministerin Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, die unsere Projekte besucht hat.

Mit einer Geldspende des Rotary Clubs Bad Pyrmont wurden in den ersten Tagen mehr als 6 Tonnen Reis und Zwiebeln an Rückkehrer verteilt, die die Hamelner Aktion in Sri Lanka gekauft hatte. Überhaupt wurde vor Ort eingekauft. Nur Medikamente, die es auf Sri Lanka nicht zu kaufen gab, und Zelte wurden mit freundlicher Unterstützung der Fluggesellschaft ""Emirates"" eingeflogen.

Das ""Hameln Hospital"" wurde am 15. März 2005 an die ""Sri Lanka Red Cross Society"" übergeben. Somit ist das Rote Kreuz künftig in der Lage bei kleineren Katastrophen selbst einzugreifen.





Run for (your) Life 2016




Am 9. Juni 2016 werden sich die ehemalige Interhelp-Schirmherrin und jetzige Bulgari-Markenbotschafterin Prinzessin Lilly zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg und ihr Sohn Erbprinz Donatus zu Schaumburg-Lippe auf eine einzigartige Reise begeben.



Mit der Unterstützung sowohl von Interhelp als auch von Bulgari wird sie ihr Projekt zu den emotionalen Wurzeln von Lillys früheren Jahren mit der Organisation in Bulgarien zurückführen, wo sie über einen Zeitraum von 5 Tagen einen fast 200 km langen Ultra-Marathon bewältigen wollen.


Das Projekt spiegelt die Hoffnung wieder, die dem Wesen der karitativen Organisation zugrunde liegt: Die Hoffnung, die Strecke zu bewältigen symbolisiert zugleich die Hoffnung auf eine bessere Zukunft in den ärmsten Ländern der Welt - in diesem Fall auch in dem wirtschaftlich schwächsten Land der Europäischen Union, Bulgarien.



Bis zum heutigen Tag hilft Interhelp Waisen im ganzen Land und trägt wesentlich zur groß angelegten Hilfsprojekten bei.



Lilly und Donatus werden ihren Instagram-Account täglich aktualisieren, und Sie können ihnen live auf Runtastic folgen, um sie anzufeuern und zu motivieren! :

Häufig gestellte Fragen

Wofür benötigen Sie $ 140.000,-?
Nach ausführlichen Untersuchungen zur Frage, wie wir die zugleich nachhaltigste und kostengünstigste Umgebung für “unsere” Kinder herstellen können, sind wir zu dem Schluss gekommen, dass dies der Sockelbetrag ist, mit dem wir unser Vorhaben einleiten können. Grundlegende Erfordernisse wie Waschräume und Toiletten, Unterbringung für Mitarbeiter, Wasser- und Stromversorgung, aber auch die nötigen Werkzeuge, um dies alles zu errichten, summieren sich zu 140 000 US-Dollar.

Natürlich werden in Zukunft weitere Mittel benötigt werden, da diese Dinge nur die ersten Schritte darstellen, aber damit schaffen wir die Basis, den Eckstein für die Umsetzung unserer Vision.
IL PROGETTO YOUTH VILLAGE
ISPIRARE UN BAMBINO, ISPIRARE UNA NAZIONE!

Ci sono oltre 2 milioni di
bambini senza casa soltanto nelle Filippine, e siamo in procinto
di cambiare la situazione. Ma abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!
Dal Typhoon Haiyan nel 2013 le Filippine
hanno subito conseguenze inimmaginabili alle loro infrastrutture, e ci sono
voluti alcuni ottimisti per trovare una soluzione.
La costruzione di muri ed edifici e la
fornitura di istruzione ai bambini nelle vicinanze della città di Davao hanno
contribuito enormemente al lento progresso di ricostruzione dei paesi, ma
questo non è sufficiente!
In una collaborazione unica tra
visionari filippini e tedeschi il Davao Youth Village mira
a cambiare le vite dei bambini attraverso la costruzione di un collegio per
orfani stabile, progressista e sostenibile.
Grazie agli sforzi congiunti di
centinaia di volontari questi bambini impareranno a costruire e creare, ma
anche a leggere, scrivere, e perseguire qualunque sogno accademico così che un
giorno anche loro potranno aiutare i loro compagni.
Oltre 8.000 persone
sono morte nel Typhoon Haiyan o nei
successivi negli ultimi 3 anni . I risultati sono
disastrosi, e le famiglie distrutte sono una mera realtà nelle attuali
circostanze.
Migliaia di bambini restano senza speranza e poveri in uno dei più
promettenti paesi in via di sviluppo al mondo, ma con l’elevata densità
demografica/esplosione demografica(?) e le ricorrenti catastrofi naturali è un
lavoro che richiede supporto.
Crimine, stupro,
droga.
All'ordine del giorno nelle più
importanti città del paese, con tassi di aumento allarmanti dopo ogni disastro
naturale. Uno dei paesi più belli del mondo sta combattendo per riprendere
il controllo, e con i numeri che scendono quelli che soffrono di più sono i
bambini rimasti orfani.
Può sembrare difficile, ma abbiamo un piano...

Come salvare un paese, un passo alla volta :
Il Davao Youth Village permette
ai bambini di prosperare in un ambiente positivo e sostenibile, insieme agli
insegnanti e volontari provenienti da tutto il territorio e dal resto del
mondo; questo rifugio sicuro permette alle persone di riprendere l'iniziativa,
finanziando l'istruzione, e migliorando le condizioni socio-economiche. Un
semplice passo alla volta:
Fase 1: Creare
infrastrutture di base, edifici, alloggiamenti, recinzioni, acqua, elettricità
e strutture didattiche.
Fase 2: Costruire
partnership (partenariati) con insegnanti e mentori, che agiscono come un
sostituto per i genitori perduti.
Fase 3: Fornire
strutture per l'insegnamento, i libri, attrezzature e dare il via al processo!
Fase 4: Guarda come l'iniziativa si
diffonde; i bambini diventano i docenti
L'istruzione è potere!
Potere di prendere in mano la situazione. Con
ogni orfano istruito si riempie una giovane mente brillante con gli strumenti
necessari per salvare il prossimo. Con un bambino istruito, dieci ne
beneficeranno!

A proposito di
Interhelp:
""Interhelp ha dimostrato che un’organizzazione
affidabile è possibile attraverso i contatti personali, e, per di più, quando è
ufficialmente supportata dalla Repubblica Federale di Germania .""
Undine Kurth MP , relazione
per la commissione per la cooperazione economica e lo sviluppo
"" Avete dimostrato che i contatti
internazionali non sono solo questioni governative, ma rappresentano anche una
rete di sicurezza, in grado di raccogliere (persone) in situazioni di
emergenza .
L’impegno umanitario dei membri Interhelp
non è solo l'espressione di un ottimo e riuscito impegno da parte dei
cittadini, ma anche la prova che la Bassa Sassonia offra aiuto disinteressato
alle vittime di catastrofi, in modo sostenibile e indipendentemente
dai titoli""""
Christian Wulff ,
ex Presidente della Repubblica Federale di Germania.
""Quello che fa Interhelp ha
senso! E’ rispettabile, sostenibile ed efficace . """"
Hans-Heinrich Sander , Ministro per l'Ambiente della Bassa Sassonia
"" Essi meritano la nostra lode
e il nostro rispetto. Le attività di Interhelp non possono essere
apprezzate abbastanza, e possiamo essere orgogliosi del fatto che ci siano
persone nella nostra città che non sono indifferenti agli eventi e catastrofi
che accadono intorno a noi, che dobbiamo affrontare insieme .

Susanne Lippmann , Sindaco del Comune di Hameln
""Mi piace molto viaggiare come un
mendicante per conto di questa organizzazione.""
Il principe Alexander di
Schaumburg-Lippe , Patrono della Interhelp
Interhelp - Società Tedesca
per l'aiuto internazionale è
un'organizzazione umanitaria non-profit, filantropica e indipendente. Aprendo
la strada a iniziative lungimiranti sostiene le popolazioni che si trovano in
situazioni di emergenza in tutto il mondo, in particolare a seguito di gravi catastrofi
naturali, come terremoti e inondazioni.
I membri della Interhelp lavorano su
base volontaria. Al fine di aiutare rapidamente, in modo efficace e
sostenibile, Interhelp dipende interamente dalle donazioni a livello nazionale
e dall'estero.
Ingaggiato dallo Stato della Bassa
Sassonia (Repubblica Federale di Germania), la sua Task Force Medica è in grado
di fornire assistenza medica in tutto il mondo entro 24 ore. Dopo la
catastrofe dello tsunami in Asia meridionale, Interhelp è stata la prima
organizzazione per gli aiuti all’estero con il permesso ufficiale di iniziare i
lavori di ri-costruzione dello Sri Lanka, questo ha stabilito un rapporto
duraturo e significativo che resta attuale.
Il patrono di Interhelp è il principe Alexander di Schaumburg-Lippe .
Correre per
salvarsi la vita
Il 9 giugno 2016 l'ex patrono Interhelp e ambasciatore del marchio Bulgari
la Principessa Lilly zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg e suo
figlio principe Donatus di Schaumburg-Lippe si imbarcheranno
in un viaggio unico.
Con il patrocinio di Interhelp e Bulgari il loro
progetto li porta alle radici sentimentali dei primi giorni di Lilly con
l'organizzazione in Bulgaria , dove condurrano un’ultra
maratona di circa 200 km su un percorso di 6 giorni .
Il progetto simboleggia la speranza
coinvolta nella beneficenza, sia che si tratti della speranza di sopravvivere alla
corsa, o la speranza di un futuro migliore nei paesi più poveri del mondo, in
questo caso la nazione economicamente più instabile della UE.
Ad oggi Interhelp aiuta gli orfani in tutto il
paese e contribuisce in modo significativo a progetti di soccorso su larga
scala.
Entrambi aggiorneranno il loro instagram
quotidianamente, ed è possibile seguire Lilly e Donatus in diretta su Runtastic
e tifare per loro!

Domande e risposte
Perché avete bisogno di $ 140.000?
Dopo una ricerca approfondita su come
meglio possiamo stabilire il contesto più sostenibile ed allo stesso tempo più
economico per i nostri bambini abbiamo definito che questo è il costo di base
stimato per iniziare a costruire. Le esigenze infrastrutturali di base,
quali servizi igienici, alloggi del personale, fornitura di acqua, energia elettrica,
si sommano agli strumenti necessari per costruire tutto questo, generando tale importo.
Naturalmente in futuro saranno necessari
più fondi, poichè questi sono soli i primi passi verso la costruzione di una
nuova casa per gli orfani delle Filippine, ma getta le fondamente che saranno
la pietra angolare per realizzare il nostro sogno e la nostra ambizione.
Come facciamo a sapere che avrà
successo?
Come con tutti gli altri progetti
Interhelp, il finanziamento sostenuto da noi e dai nostri sponsor ci ha dato determinazione
necessaria per completare tutti i nostri progetti senza eccezioni. Lodi da
parte dei membri dello stato ovunque sia in Germania che nei paesi in cui
abbiamo operato hanno dimostrato che la fondamentale padronanza e organizzazione
utilizzate nella nostra struttura dei compiti è sostenibile ed efficace.
E così, come per qualsiasi altro
progetto, abbiamo lavorato insieme con professionisti esperti per determinare
le probabilità di successo del progetto Youth Village. Le tempistiche, le
risorse e il tipo di corsi sono stati presi in considerazione, per determinare
quante sono le probabilità del progetto di Jon Perez di apportare un
cambiamento effettivo al contesto locale. Siamo giunti alla conclusione
che è di fatto possibile, e molto probabile, ma che avremmo avuto bisogno di
una mano da parte di terzi, qui è dove entri in scena tu!
E' interamente una questione di se
possiamo, insieme, raggiungere l'importo necessario per determinare l'efficacia
del nostro progetto. Il resto riguarda le mani esperte di Interhelp e
l'incredibile etica del lavoro visionario dei Filippini.
Da dove posso donare?
Ovunque.
Devo pagare spese di spedizione
supplementari per i miei vantaggi?
Niente affatto.
Qual è il modo migliore per sostenervi?
Non esitate a consultare quanto
sopra! Eventuali autori e / o gli sviluppatori, ecc sono invitati a
divulgare materiale collegato a questa campagna, ma è possibile utilizzare anche
semplici hashtag #runforlife o #interhelp. Qualunque piccolo azione aiuta!
Naturalmente non potremmo essere più emozionati se decideste di fare di più,
non esitate a contattare il Sig Ulrich Behmann, Presidente di Interhelp al ubehmann@aol.com
Quanto delle donazioni va al progetto?
Meno le spese per i benefici accessori, tutto quanto ,

We have no limit great or small. Every $100.00 opens the door to another school. There are thousands of worthy schools from the mountains of Nepal to the dry scrubland of the African bush. Please support these communities to learn the English language and enable worldwide communication through the wonderful language called…. ENGLISH.

The Impact
www.englishthroughdrama.com can be viewed today. We have 56 teaching courses for children from 3 to 18. It offers a host of support tools:
1. Translations (some) and explanations in the parents' and teachers' native languages.
2. Scripts for plays – including a fun to perform free play with an important message: The Birds Who Flew Beyond Time (see http://www.englishthroughdrama.com/the-birds-wh...)
3. Videoed teacher demonstrations.
4. Help with music and sound effects.
5. Warm up games and songs.
6. Help with pronunciation (phonics ).
7. Tips for props, scenery, costume and performance
8. Help with researching the background to plays.
9. Encouragement to create flashcards.
10. Learning from teaching peers.
The website is continually work in progress. We need more translation, filming of teaching demos and new content. We will add a performance platform to post performances worldwide. We seek sponsorship from individuals and large corporations to create life changing scholarships and challenging competitions. Your support enables us to help the children and offer a better service to teachers and parents by upgrading our website.
This is a tremendous undertaking. Join us and spread the word… English of course.

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Members of the <strong>International Churches of Christ </strong>(ICOC)<strong> </strong>community travel all around the world for many reasons. Often times a barrier to traveling is the high cost of overnight accommodations.</p>
<p>Members attempt to find other members in sister churches around the world to coordinate overnight housing. They desire to <strong>connect</strong> with other Christians for mutual encouragement and to <strong>save </strong>a few dollars along the way. <strong>This pursuit can be challenging when</strong>:  </p>
<ul>
<li>They don't know anyone personally where they are going</li>
<li>Members they knew in the city have since moved away </li>
<li>They feel awkward contacting local ministry leaders listed on the church's website to see if a host can be found</li>
<li>The list can go on and on...</li>
</ul>
<p>The very <strong>fiber </strong>of the ICOC community is <strong>love</strong>, <strong>relationships</strong>, and <strong>hospitality</strong>. For years, disciples in the church have demonstrated their love by hosting others as an expression of Christian faith. They have seen a need and answered the call, with open doors and open hearts.  They have freely shared with others out of what has been given to them.  </p>

<p>The vision for <strong>Come &amp; Stay</strong> came to Founder Cheryl Parker as a result of the joy she gained from hosting sisters in her home in Virginia when she lived there.

<p>It is from that place that the concept for <strong>Come &amp; Stay</strong> was born...<strong>a platform to simplify connections between hosts and travelers within the ICOC community</strong>. A solution to help make travel more accessible, coordination seamless and goodness shared</p>

<p><strong>TRAVELER</strong> <strong>membership</strong> will be around <strong>$129 annually</strong>. Travelers can create a member profile and will have access to Host listings. Travelers will be able to initiate communication with potential Hosts through the Come &amp; Stay messaging system.  </p>

<p>Come &amp; Stay is rooted in trust, sharing and caring.

A highly effective hacking lesson for children is ""reverse engineering"" - the processes of tearing something down and rebuilding it from the ground up. This device incorporates many learnable aspects of technology, including coding, hardware, public networks and data, and how to apply it practically in your hands. This will be another venture in itself, but this campaign is designed to jumpstart it. For now, I will be taking a poll from all contributors to decide how we allocate 5% to education. My favorite considerations are codenow.org, girlswhocode.com and under-funded NYC public schools.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Faq:</p>
<p>Q. Are these really live and accurate?</p>
<p>Due to MTA policy, I am unable to use certain words in this claim. What I can tell you is I’m working with the same exact data as they are! In short, I can’t promise accuracy, only consistency with their systems.</p>
<p>Q: Do you support line besides 1/2/3, 4/5/6 &amp; L?</p>
<p>A: Unfortunately not even the MTA has that data. I can only program for lines that physically have LED signs on their platforms. Technically the S and Sir are also available. I can substitute schedule values, but they wont be live.  However, NYC Buses and other non MTA Subway trains are available live!</p>
<p>Q: What does the sign do when there is a delay?</p>
<p>A: It's designed to be a replica of the signs underground, so in short, it will do what they do. If there's a delay, it will say, “delay”. If there's a glitch and the system goes down, yours go down. It's only as good as the data it's pulling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What happens when the L train shuts down?</p>
<p>A: I'll reprogram it for a supported stop of your choosing. But that’s a long time off, and I'll have these out way before they pull a 2nd Ave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What happens if I move to a new stop?</p>
<p>A: Contribute to the app upgrade with line and stop switching, or hack it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What kind of frames do you offer?</p>
<p>A: The prototype was handmade in my neighbor's garage workshop with reclaimed wood. He charged me $200, so he will be honoring the same price for prototypes. If you want metal, or glass I will locally source a custom fabrication solution just for your size at cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What are the mounting / stand options?</p>
<p>A: That will depend on your frame. Bare bones will have simple magnet mounts! Options are pretty limitless, and I will work with you for the perfect solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What about other transit agencies like BOS (MSHTA?), Bay Area (Bart), DC, Tor, or buses?</p>
<p>A: After some research and development I am confident that integration will be possible, however it is currently unapproved and not demonstrated. If you make this contribution, and I am not able to deliver, your money towards this perk will be refunded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What sizes are available?</p>
<p>A: For reference the prototype in the video is a large, single-wide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Small:</p>
<p>- Small Double-Wide:</p>
<p>- Medium</p>
<p>- Medium Double-Wide</p>
<p>- Large</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What if I purchase a prototype early, but upgrades aren’t available until a later delivery date, what about software upgrades?</p>
<p>A: Any prototypes purchased will be compatible with future software releases, and for purchase, and retroactively applied. You will not in any way be penalized for buying a prototype. If you are unhappy with your prototype, I will be happy to exchange during a later release stage.</p>

<p>Militancy, corruption, and violence dominate the news about Pakistan. The country’s public profile is associated with a variety of security threats and Pakistanis are often written about as either perpetrators or victims of injustice.</p>
<p>But Pakistan, a country of more than 200 million people, is undergoing a tremendous shift. While militancy, corruption, and violence are indeed a part of everyday life, Pakistanis are also using the arts, politics, technology, law, and sports, to push back against these forces and create a space for Pakistanis to have a conversation about what they want their country to look like. Their efforts are creating a deep shift not only in civil society and the country’s institutions but also within the broader culture itself.</p>
<p>A growing middle class, greater international cooperation, a robust media presence, and the existence of social media have all contributed to a growing dynamism inside Pakistan. This dynamism is on display in ordinary ways by ordinary people. Whether it’s a transgender woman openly campaigning in an election, dissidents using social media to shed light on the State’s activities, digital rights activists pushing for greater accountability, or an internet star pushing the boundaries of a conservative culture, Pakistanis are trying to change the direction of their social and political culture in big and small ways.</p>
<p>News Lens Pakistan is a news cooperative based in Pakistan and employs local Pakistani journalists to tell the stories of this vast and varied country. We are launching a project called Shift. This project will include a series of reported stories from all over the country that, collectively, will show how Pakistan is changing and the consequences of those changes, both positive and negative. Our aim is to use the stories from Shift to show how a country like Pakistan, both modern and deeply traditional, is grappling with change and how Pakistanis are re-imagining their future.</p>
<p>Why we need your help:</p>
<p>News Lens Pakistan is a small news cooperative with international partners that help boost the professionalism of our journalists by offering training and development opportunities. Our reporters and editors have taken on scores of stories about government accountability, corruption, the deep state, militancy, workers’ rights, women’s issues, minority rights, business, arts, and more. We publish our stories in English as well as local languages - Urdu, Pashto and Sindhi. Our journalists are ready, willing, and able to take on the important stories that will benefit Pakistanis and international audiences.</p>
<p>One thing we do need help with is money. Serious news outlets are under tremendous financial pressures across the board. News Lens is no different in that sense.</p>
<p>We need to raise USD $5000. In Pakistan, a little goes a long way and this small amount of money will allow us to fund five reporters across the country to report on 12 stories. We will look at all parts of Pakistan and focus on stories across the social and class spectrum. The cost will include reporters’ story fees, travel expenses, editing, translation of stories into local languages.</p>
<p>News Lens Pakistan benefits not only journalists and their news outlets but the people of Pakistan. Its aim is to create, publish and distribute high-quality content throughout the country and to the rest of the world. In the process of creating that content, News Lens will improve the skills and raise the standards for Pakistani journalists, wherever they may be. Its members benefit from identification with this professional, nonpartisan, national news outlet, via its professional training opportunities as well as wide distribution of their best content.</p>

While meditation and mindfulness stress acceptance and “taking the path of least resistance,” existentialism on the other hand, asserts that one doesn’t have to (and perhaps shouldn’t) necessarily accept certain conditions of life’s absurdities. Existentialism considers that a person may freely create and shape one’s own authentic existence however one wishes, stomping on conformity, the status quo and social pressures. I felt that both concepts are essential to humanism and peace, yet still tussled with this contradiction.

I am currently running Oneplace Technologies Ltd, an ICT company in Kenya. I have always had passion teaching people how to code, something in which I have great knowledge. I started Brace Kids as a way of expanding my skills and knowledge to kids, who apparently hold the future of our continent.<br/>Brace Kids offers hope for the technology industry of Africa. Many of the most successful software developers started coding while they were kids. However, getting this knowledge is not easy especially for African kids. Brace Kids offers to give this knowledge for free. The aim is to teach One Million Kids across the continent how to code.</span></p>

This hub will be the first in a network of other proposed centers in every country in Africa. The hubs will act as educational centers which will run the kids educational campaigns for the respective country. The funding will also enable us in internal infrastructure installations for the hubs. </span></p>

<h3>The Project's Impact</h3>
<p>This project will help nurture a generation of great young minds in the software world. Programming is the key to a better society. With kids learning how to create software, Brace Kids will have opened a door for a brilliant future of our continent where critical thinkers and problem solvers are young and gifted.</p>
<p>When I started Brace Kids, it was received with very open arms by the people who learnt about it. I got invited to talk about the same on National Television Channel K24. The willingness of parents to have their kids learn programming skills was so great that I hosted several parents and their kids in my office. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough space to host them all, hence the need for space. </p>

Many of the most successful software developers started coding while they were kids. However, getting this knowledge is not easy especially for African kids. Brace Kids offers to give this knowledge for free. The aim is to teach One Million Kids across the continent how to code.

The funding received from this campaign will enable Brace Kids set up four educational hubs for kids in Kenya. This hub will be the first in a network of other proposed centers in every country in Africa. The hubs will act as educational centers which will run the kids educational campaigns for the respective country. The funding will also enable us in internal infrastructure installations for the hubs. 

More Information
The Brace Kids initiative intends to raise $50,000 that will enable us setup a coding education hub for kids in Kenya as mentioned above, setup internal infrastructure, get branded t-shirts for the campaigns and promote the educational campaigns and enroll more and more interested kids. 


The Project's Impact
This project will help nurture a generation of great young minds in the software world. Programming is the key to a better society. With kids learning how to create software, Brace Kids will have opened a door for a brilliant future of our continent where critical thinkers and problem solvers are young and gifted.
When I started Brace Kids, it was received with very open arms by the people who learnt about it. I got invited to talk about the same on National Television Channel K24. The willingness of parents to have their kids learn programming skills was so great that I hosted several parents and their kids in my office. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough space to host them all, hence the need for space.

I appeal to willing donors to help me realize my dream for my continent by helping me reach out to kids who want to learn these skills. Brace Kids will be a great leap for the continent and its technology sector.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>ABOUT THE VIDEO<br/>
</h3>Our upcoming educational video will be about plasma, which is one of the most common states of matter in the visible Universe. In the video we will discuss about the nature of plasma, where it occurs and how we can harness the power of the stars to improve our everyday life. For that purpose we will also visit a physicist, who will create plasma in a laboratory (hopefully in a controlled environment!).<br/>The video will be intense, engaging and about 6 minutes long, filled with lots of animations. Once published in May on Captain Corrosion <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5cWyINMDe4ZyaZcJki76Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube channel</a>, it will be also be shared by us and our partners on various social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, our <a href=""http://captaincorrosion.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>) in order to reach the target audience (students, lecturers, companies). <br/><br/>There are two goals we want to achieve with this video;<br/><br/><b>1. Popularizing science</b><br/>Young people often waste their youth by playing computer games, listening music whole day or even worse - they turn to drugs and alcohol.

What our project aims to do, is to use a low orbit satellite, controlled by us individuals, to study potential objects that emit high energy radiation.
Maybe we'll get data readings and pictures of solar-flare caused auroras.  Maybe we'll capture images of some very interesting meteors.  And maybe we'll actually capture a verifiable craft.  All we can do is try, and by doing this our way, we can open-source the data to you, the individuals.
Perks:
Name (get your name written on the CubeSat): $25
Data (real-time data - visual / radiation): $250
Data (get login benefits and real time data): $500

This is not a theory, but a fact based upon a decade of research into the positive effects of early childhood education programs.</strong></p><p><strong>Children who are involved in contemporary early childhood education programs either in kindergarten, or in their home will acquire extremely large amount of general knowledge, develop their self-confidence, improve their communication skills and build a good basis for overcoming all the demands of formal school education.</strong></p><p><strong>Thanks to the early childhood education and intervention of the society every day, an increasing number of children with neurodevelopmental disorders are enrolled and graduated from the faculties. The phenomenon of the return rate of investment in such children in the long term affects the entire society. Therefore, introducing such children into early childhood education is crucial to their future.</strong></p><p><strong>At this moment there is no early childhood education program in Croatia!</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">UDRUGA HUREKA:</p><p>Udruga  Hureka  osnovana je u Hrvatskoj s ciljem da djeci omogući učenje i napredovanje već od najranije dobi, a djeci s neurorazvojnim  poremećajima  uspješan start i sigurniju budućnost.</p><p>Budući uspjeh svakog djeteta u mnogočemu se određuje u dobi  od rođenja do 7 godine.</p><p>Tijekom tih ranih godina, koliko je dijete učilo, razvijalo se tjelesno,  mentalno,  emocionalno i socijalno je ključno.  To nije teorija, već činjenica na temelju desetljeća istraživanja o pozitivnim učincima programa rane edukacije.</p><p>Djeca koja su uključena u suvremene programe rane edukacije, kroz  vrtić ili u krugu vlastitih obitelji, steći će izuzetno velike količine općeg  znanja, razviti  samopouzdanje, unaprijediti komunikativne vještine i stvoriti podlogu lakšem svladavanju zahtjeva koje će pred njih staviti formalno školsko obrazovanje.</p><p>Zahvaljujući ranoj edukaciji i intervenciji društva svakim danom sve veći broj djece s neurorazvojnim poremećajima se upisuje i završava fakultete.

This is not a theory, but a fact based upon a decade of research into the positive effects of early childhood education programs.Children who are involved in contemporary early childhood education programs either in kindergarten, or in their home will acquire extremely large amount of general knowledge, develop their self-confidence, improve their communication skills and build a good basis for overcoming all the demands of formal school education.Thanks to the early childhood education and intervention of the society every day, an increasing number of children with neurodevelopmental disorders are enrolled and graduated from the faculties. The phenomenon of the return rate of investment in such children in the long term affects the entire society. Therefore, introducing such children into early childhood education is crucial to their future.At this moment there is no early childhood education program in Croatia!  UDRUGA HUREKA:Udruga  Hureka  osnovana je u Hrvatskoj s ciljem da djeci omogući učenje i napredovanje već od najranije dobi, a djeci s neurorazvojnim  poremećajima  uspješan start i sigurniju budućnost.Budući uspjeh svakog djeteta u mnogočemu se određuje u dobi  od rođenja do 7 godine.Tijekom tih ranih godina, koliko je dijete učilo, razvijalo se tjelesno,  mentalno,  emocionalno i socijalno je ključno.  To nije teorija, već činjenica na temelju desetljeća istraživanja o pozitivnim učincima programa rane edukacije.Djeca koja su uključena u suvremene programe rane edukacije, kroz  vrtić ili u krugu vlastitih obitelji, steći će izuzetno velike količine općeg  znanja, razviti  samopouzdanje, unaprijediti komunikativne vještine i stvoriti podlogu lakšem svladavanju zahtjeva koje će pred njih staviti formalno školsko obrazovanje.Zahvaljujući ranoj edukaciji i intervenciji društva svakim danom sve veći broj djece s neurorazvojnim poremećajima se upisuje i završava fakultete. Fenomen stope povrata ulaganja u takvu djecu dugoročno utječe na cjelokupno društvo. Stoga je uvođenje takve djece u program rane edukacije ključno za njihovu budućnost.U ovom trenutku program rane edukacije u Hrvatskoj ne postoji!            OUR OBJECTIVES:
Development of the early childhood education software that will be available to all children in Croatia, and eventually in other countries too.
Providing opportunities for children of Croats living in another country to learn Croatian, in a unique and enjoyable way
 Establishing an institute that would support parents with early home education (through education, seminars, workshops ...)
Establishment of a support group for the introduction of children with neurodevelopmental difficulties into early childhood education system
Development and distribution of educational cards for early childhood learning
The required amount will suffice for all the above and it will enable us to achieve these goals. If we raise less it will take significantly longer time. However, we believe that we will ultimately achieve our goals. The software development is our priority and our first goal. The funds raised will firstly go to achieving this goal.
 NAŠI CILJEVI:
Razvoj softvera rane edukacije koji će biti dostupan svoj djeci u Hrvatskoj, a s vremenom i u drugim zemljama.
Pružanje mogućnosti djeci Hrvata koja žive u nekoj drugoj zemlji da nauče hrvatski jezik, kroz igru i na zabavan način.
Osnivanje centra koji će pružati podršku roditeljima oko provođenja rane edukacije kod kuće (kroz edukacije, seminare, radionice ..)
Osnivanje skupine  za pomoć oko uvođenja djece s neurorazvojnim poteškoćama u sustav rane edukacije
Razvoj i plasman paketa edukacijskih kartica za rano učenje
Traženi iznos pokrio bi sve naše planove i postigao navedene ciljeve. Ukoliko ćemo skupiti manje put će trajati značajno dulje, ali vjerujemo da ćemo u konačnici uspjeti sve ostvariti. Razvoj softvera je prioritet i prvi cilj te će prikupljena sredstva biti plasirana prvo u njega, a kasnije i na ostale aktivnosti.

Miroslav Vrankić, profesor je Tehničkog fakulteta u Rijeci i osoba koja je prošle godine od strane Googla proglašena jednom od 100 najvećih pokretača pozitivnih, globalno važnih promjena u Europi. Pod njegovim  vodstvom će se razviti softver za HIPER program rane edukacije.  Prof. Vrankić sa svojim je timom razvio uređaj Servus koji  korisniku omogućava da pomoću glasovnih naredbi upravlja svojim domom i time promijenio život brojnim osobama s invaliditetom.http://www.eglas.hr/ Sandra Kiš Broz urednica je dječjeg časopisa Baby Mall i mama dva dječaka zbog kojih se i aktivno uključila u rješavanje pitanja rane edukacije u Hrvatskoj.  Kako je u opisu njenog posla praćenje  potreba djece predškolske dobi i kreiranje sadržaja za njih, njena uloga će biti da učenje i predškolski kurikulum  pretvori u najzabavniju igru.www.babymall.hr Milica Damjanović, voditeljica marketinga tvrtke Labud Zagreb i predsjednica HUREKE. Svojim angažmanom i velikom željom da za našu djecu osiguramo stabilniju budućnost, razlog je što smo napredovali do toga gdje smo danas. Sve ono što nam se prije 2 godine činilo gotovo nemogućim danas je još samo jedan korak do stvarnosti. Jelena Šimić, mama četvorice dječaka , živjela je u mnogim svjetskim metropolama te imala priliku pobliže se upoznati  s praksama drugih zemalja i iz prve ruke osjetiti  nedostatke predškolskog obrazovanja u Hrvatskoj. Zbog najmlađeg djeteta i namjere da ostanu živjeti u Hrvatskoj aktivno se uključila u to da se prilike koje se vani pružaju, pruže i našim malim sugrađanima. Petra Maskalan, tajnica udruge HUREKA i mama jednogodišnjeg dječaka  svojim angažmanom doprinosi stvaranju okosnice samoodrživosti  projekta koji će biti od velike koristi djeci vrtićke i predškolske dobi kao i nadolazećim generacijama.  Njena uloga ujedno će biti osigurati prilagodbu HIPER softvera na druge jezike i za druge zemlje. Project partners:Dario Šimić and Mario Jurić, the founders of the ""Football Union"" in Croatia, retired professional footballers, were among the first ones to recognize and support the efforts of HUREKE for the development of early childhood education programs in Croatia. Their wish to draw attention to the fact that professional football is intended for only a small number of people, especially in a small country such as Croatia, thus received a new dimension. With the help of HUREKA association, they will enable all young footballers in Croatia, from the early age on when they start to play football, to parallelly build the educational background for additional career.http://www.huns.hr/             Professional football players: Mateo Kovačić, Luka Modrić, Danijel Subašić and retired professional footballer Mario Stanić also support co-operation with HUREKA and the development of the HIPER early childhood education program in Croatia. Partneri projekta:Dario Šimić i Mario Jurić, osnivači „Nogometnog sindikata“ u Hrvatskoj, umirovljeni profesionalni nogometaši, među prvima su prepoznali važnost i podržali aktivnosti  HUREKE  za razvojem programa rane edukacije u Hrvatskoj.  Njihova nastojanja  da skrenu pažnju na to kako od nogometa može živjeti samo mali broj ljudi, osobito u maloj zemlji kao što je Hrvatska time su dobila i jednu novu dimenziju. Suradnjom s  udrugom HUREKA omogućit će svim mladim nogometašima u Hrvatskoj da od rane dobi kada se počnu baviti nogometom, paralelno grade i obrazovnu podlogu daljnjem školovanju i izgradnji druge karijere kojom će se moći baviti po završetku nogometne.http://www.huns.hr/Profesionalni nogometaši Mateo Kovačić, Luka Modrić, Danijel Subašić i umirovljeni profesionalni nogometaš Mario Stanić također su pružili ruku podršku suradnji  HUNS-a i HUREKE i razvoju HIPER programa rane edukcije u Hrvatskoj.             CONCLUSION:HIPER software is mainly designed for the advancement of the Croatian children but will also be a great tool for those who want to learn Croatian, learn more about the Croatian culture and gain a rich general knowledge. If you are a Croat who has left your homeland and want to teach your children Croatian this is an ideal way to achieve it in less than 10 minutes a day, in a fun and interactive way.Very soon after the completion of the Croatian version of HIPER software, the program will be translated into other languages (English, German, Italian, Slovenian, Serbian, Hungarian etc.)The period required for the software development is 6 months.The period required for the software to be translated into other languages is 12 months. ZAKLJUČAK:HIPER softver, osim za djecu u Hrvatskoj ujedno će biti odličan alat ako želite učiti hrvatski jezik i saznati više o Hrvatskoj kulturi i općenito steći bogatu opću kulturu. Ako ste Hrvat koji je napustio svoju domovinu, a želite da Vam djeca uče i hrvatski jezik ovo je idealan način da to postignete za manje od 10 minuta dnevno, na zabavan i interaktivna način. Veoma brzo nakon završetka  Hrvatske inačice HIPER softvera , program će biti ponuđen i na drugim jezicima (Engleski, Njemački, Talijanski, Slovenski, Srpski, Mađarski itd.)Period potreban za razvoj softvera je 6 mjeseci.Prilagodba na druge jezike u periodu od 12 mjeseci.             Udruga za ranu edukaciju - HUREKAGradiščanska 30, 10000 ZagrebIBAN: HR9024840081135021434SWIFT: RZBHHR2XThank you!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>At the age of 19, I became pregnant with my now 8-year-old son. This was a difficult time because although I was in college, I was unemployed and subsequently dropped out of college. I found part-time work when Shakur was 8 weeks, but learned a tough lesson in child care costs. The harsh reality was that I could not afford to go to work! I had to rely on family and friends to watch my son, but would also have to call in, often. I decided it was time to go back to school. My late father quit his job for some time to watch my son while I completed my first college degree. It was at this time that I had an epiphany: “Hey, this is very difficult! I don’t want other young girls to go through what I am going through.” But what will I do about this? First, I started a website, <a href=""http://www.sherockinspired.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sherockinspired.com</a>, and have been managing the site for 4 years and counting. However, I still felt as if there was more to do. From there, I envisioned the program. </p>
<p>She Rock Inspired is a Leadership and Empowerment program teaching girls about Reproductive/Sexual Health. The organization seeks to empower girls to strive for economic independence, knowledge about their reproductive health with the goal of eradicating teen pregnancy,  thus alleviating the feminization of poverty.</p>
<p>The program is broken down into 4 parts: Reproductive/Sexual Health, Leadership, Self-Esteem, &amp; Slaying. Each program is roughly 2 hours and will include workbooks, special speakers, and collaborations with other organizations that may suit a girl’s needs. Once She Rock Inspired secures a place where we work out of, one Saturday out of the month will be mentoring days from 9am-1pm. Initially, the program will be an after-school program that works with schools or other organizations. In addition, we will host an annual conference that broadens the topics that are discussed with young girls. </p>
<p>FYI: </p>
<p><strong>Did you know that better access to contraceptive information and services can reduce the number of girls becoming pregnant and giving birth at too young an age? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Did you know counseling and behavioral interventions offer primary prevention against STIs, including HIV? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Did you know the rates of teenage motherhood remain highest in states that promote abstinence-only policies?

</div></div>","About This ProjectHello! My name is Jun Sugawara of the Animator Supporters.This project is aimed to set up more dormitory facilities that animators who are new to the industry can use for 30,000JPY(250USD) per month (including utility expenses).The animators who get to use the [Starting Out Animators’ Dormitory] will also get chances for social exchanges beyond the boundaries of companies, and also receive technical support for illustrations and drawing.Currently, we are supporting 6 starting out animators at the dorm. And we are going to expand the dorm facility so that 8 animators can use this dormitory from March 2017.For this project, we aim to raise part of the money to stably maintain the Animators’ Dormitory for startups, which is approximately 3600000JPY(30,000USD).But as we are short in managing funds in order to maintain this dormitory, we would like to ask for your kind support.
Animation content has gained worldwide popularity. Also for Japan, it is an industry where the contents can be exported without importing any resources since Japan is a country which lacks in abundant natural resources.Even now, many animation programs are shown both on TV and in theaters, and there are also many people who say they love watching Anime.But behind that shiny center stage, the average salary of animators in their 20’s is said to be just around 90,000JPY per month.**According to the research on the current situation (answered by 728 people) announced by the Japan Animation Creators Association (JAniCA) in 2009 states that the average monthly income of animators in their 20’s is a bit more than 90,000JPY(750USD).Which makes it around 1,100,000JPY(9,000USD) on an yearly basis.The reason why their salaries are so drastically low despite the hard workload, overtime work, holiday shifts at almost every field of work, is in most cases, animators are hired and paid according to the piece-work system(※2) based on the price per each frame an animator draws, and it takes time to become a skillful animator who can draw quicker and cover more frames within the given time and to have a fair amount of earnings per month.※2For many cases, animators’ salaries are determined based on the number of the sketches they draw.For a typical TV anime series, an animator makes ￥200 (About 2 USD) by drawing ONE picture.If one draws 300 pictures per month,his monthly salary is only: 300 drawings × ￥200 = ￥60,000($500).However, drawing 300 sketches is a really challenging task for a startup animator.In addition, animators generally do not have time to do a part time job, which makes it even harder to make a stable living.In the hope to solve this problem, the NPO Animator Supporters,  opened the first Animator Dormitory that allow new, young animators to live on ￥30,000($250), including the expenses for water, gas, electricity, AC, and Internet and that encourage them to take lessons on drawing and painting.Many animation studios are mostly located in Tokyo (especially in the Suginami and Nerima districts), and the high monthly cost for rent in Tokyo becomes a greater burden for startup animators who have moved to Tokyo from other parts of Japan.Startup animators are in a state where they have to pay high rent in Tokyo to live, despite of their low income.By establishing a dormitory where new animators can work without worrying about making a stable living, we can provide them with an environment in which they can focus on their work, take lessons and get support.[NPO Animator Supporters : Achievements]For the past 5 years, the Animator Supporters has provided the shelters to 12 start-up animators. 
When we first started this housing assistance, we helped startups pay their rents by simply providing a monetary assistance of 600,000 yen per year for the winner(s) of the Grand Prix for starting out animators.

<h3>Help our Children to Build a New World</h3>
<p>Sulma was a very shy <b>12 year old girl</b> who had never left her South Bronx neighborhood. Then she came to The Actors Theatre Workshop, an award-winning non-profit that has changed the lives of thousands of at-risk and homeless youth for over 26 years through drama and education programs.</p>
<p><b>Now 24 years later</b> Sulma is the Director of Operations at the NYC Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. She attributes her successes to the lessons she learned from ATW’s Artistic Director and Founder Thurman E. Scott.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“I came from all the noise to a safe haven. Thurman saw who I really was <br/></i><i style=""background-color: initial;"">and gave me that voice and power to say, ‘Sulma, you can change the world.’ From that moment on my voice mattered.”</i></p>
<p><b>Please Help Save this program . . . so more children can succeed</b></p>
<p>The Actors Theatre Workshop (ATW) guides and teaches some of our most vulnerable young New Yorkers. We created our award-winning <b><i>Builders of the New World</i></b>  program especially for children dealing with the tremendous instability of <b>living in temporary housing facilities.</b></p>
<p><b>Today, our efforts to continue impacting our precious children are in jeopardy. </b>We unexpectedly lost a long-time major funder because of economic pressure, while rent expense for our theatre has increased dramatically. </p>

Help our Children to Build a New World
Sulma was a very shy 12 year old girl who had never left her South Bronx neighborhood. Then she came to The Actors Theatre Workshop, an award-winning non-profit that has changed the lives of thousands of at-risk and homeless youth for over 26 years through drama and education programs.
Now 24 years later Sulma is the Director of Operations at the NYC Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. She attributes her successes to the lessons she learned from ATW’s Artistic Director and Founder Thurman E. Scott.
“I came from all the noise to a safe haven. Thurman saw who I really was and gave me that voice and power to say, ‘Sulma, you can change the world.’ From that moment on my voice mattered.”
Please Help Save this program . . . so more children can succeed
The Actors Theatre Workshop (ATW) guides and teaches some of our most vulnerable young New Yorkers. We created our award-winning Builders of the New World  program especially for children dealing with the tremendous instability of living in temporary housing facilities.
Today, our efforts to continue impacting our precious children are in jeopardy. We unexpectedly lost a long-time major funder because of economic pressure, while rent expense for our theatre has increased dramatically. 
We need your help today. Please make a tax-deductible donation and help us save our children’s program. Join with us to nurture and help our children overcome their present challenges. Save this program that ignites their ambition and helps our children to fulfill their potential as contributing citizens.




How We Change Lives
ATW was founded by Thurman E. Scott, a gifted theatre artist and award-winning actor, writer and director who believes that creativity is the great equalizer. Thurman’s original theatre techniques provide the foundation for our life-changing Builders of The New World  program. The children learn to strengthen their imaginations, develop a vision of their future success and take tangible educational steps today to achieve their dreams for tomorrow.



Today, 23,424 homeless children in New York City and 2.5 million homeless children throughout the United States are dealing with difficult issues of transience and instability. For example, homeless children go hungry twice as often as other children. ATW’s staff and diverse group of volunteer mentors help create a warm, stable, and homelike environment for the children. They love coming to our clean, respectful theatre facility in Chelsea to meet new friends, eat delicious food and grow.
Each program session starts with a family-style dinner of tasty, nutritious meals donated by top NYC restaurants.




Reading, Writing and a Vision for the Future
In the Builders of the New World, we teach the children original theatre and education techniques that improve their reading, writing and presentation skills. They learn to have an intention in life, and draw and write about their visions for the future. 









A young Builder of the New World rehearses her presentation for the program



Making An Impact
The children rehearse their original monologues, and then have the unforgettable experience of presenting their visions to an invited audience of family, friends, and important NYC business government, and educational leaders.
This invaluable experience lets the children see first-hand their power to make an impact in the world. They learn they can be seen — an idea that strikes at the heart of homelessness, which can be an existential struggle of invisibility.





By the time the children graduate, they have fully embraced their new mantle as Builders of the New World. These proud, confident and poised young leaders have developed inspiring visions for the future . . . and most important, gained the tools to make an impact in the world and achieve their dreams.





Sulma . . . One of our many success stories

Like many children in our programs, when Sulma arrived at ATW she didn’t see herself as a leader, and didn’t know the steps to take to improve her life and her community. By the time she graduated from ATW's drama program, Sulma had found her voice and gained a foundation for future success that has served her for her whole life.

 “I wanted my daughters to see where I come from. I’ll never stop talking about ATW and what you did for me.”



Sulma's story is not unique
Many of our graduates have turned their lives around and found success in positions such as fashion designers, social workers, musicians and teachers. Over the years countless young adults have come back to visit our theatre and share their stories of the difference we made in their lives.



BUILDERS OF THE NEW WORLD IS NOW IN DANGER
ATW is currently facing its first major financial crisis in 26 years that can stop our ability to offer this life-changing program to those children who need it most. 
We’ve unexpectedly lost $150,000 in critical funding due to economic hardship . . . while the rent on our facility, which we designed and built with an outpouring of community support in 1990, has increased 60%. 
When our children walk through ATW’s doors, not only do they benefit from life-changing theatre and education classes . . .  they start to feel a sense of ownership of one of NYC’s cultural institutions at a time of great instability in their lives. Please donate and help to preserve this valuable resource for our children.

HOW YOUR DONATIONS WILL BE USED
Please donate to fund the expenses to deliver our children’s program throughout the year, including art, food and office supplies; travel between ATW and the temporary housing facilities, cleaning and videography expenses; and studio rental expenses.  
Your charitable, tax-deductible donation will save the Builders of the New World Program, allow us to serve a larger number of temporary housing facilities and their young residents, and ensure that we can continue to help at-risk and homeless children achieve a better future.

So please take this opportunity to participate in a wonderful celebration of hope, majesty and love that represents the lifting up of our most precious commodity — our children — before it’s too late, and donate today. 

When our children have the right guidance, support and vision... 
When they are taught tangible steps they can take each day...
When they develop the discipline to do those steps and adhere to those philosophies... 
...miracles can happen. 

Help build a better world for our children through theatre and education. 


Please donate and help us to achieve our goal. Our children thank you!

<h3>Is your child a struggling learner? Or child with a disability? Help to give teachers the best technology around to make sure our children's needs are met so they can succeed!</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Interventions On Track was something conceived around 5 years ago. While working as a special education teacher and coordinator I began creating RTI systems. During this process, I came to the conclusion that there really isn't effective RTI tracking systems out there. Teachers have no way of tracking the interventions they are doing and analyzing that data. Special Education goals, ESL goals, none of these vital channels of education are able to be tracked and analyzed effectively. So I teamed up with an RTI team member and a brilliant web designer and we created something that will help close the achievement gap. It's hard currently, without this system, to even analyze where the gaps are occurring. Help us to change this. </p>
<p>-This system will identify and address the needs of struggling learners. </p>

Summary
Interventions On Track was something conceived around 5 years ago. While working as a special education teacher and coordinator I began creating RTI systems. During this process, I came to the conclusion that there really isn't effective RTI tracking systems out there. Teachers have no way of tracking the interventions they are doing and analyzing that data. Special Education goals, ESL goals, none of these vital channels of education are able to be tracked and analyzed effectively. So I teamed up with an RTI team member and a brilliant web designer and we created something that will help close the achievement gap. It's hard currently, without this system, to even analyze where the gaps are occurring. Help us to change this. 
-This system will identify and address the needs of struggling learners. 
-It will track anything, becoming the grade book for things that traditional grade books can't handle. 
-It helps to train new teachers, making recommendations on how to handle students with educational challenges. 
-It's as easy to use and update. We wanted to make is as easy to use as updating social media, knowing that teachers are busy and overwhelmed. We wanted to make the system save time and be enjoyable. (what the short sample of the system in action above)

<p>If Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, not only will minorities, religious freedom, and freedom of the press be in a whole new league of attack, but our country and our political system as we know it will be undermined.</p>
<p>Trump supporters do not seem to care about the facts, and the frustration of attempting to convince low information, angry, and irrational people is both real and troubling. </p>

<p>Using social media platforms, and going to the one group of Trump supporters that are somewhat cohesive and can be swayed by their leadership - Evangelicals.</p>
<p>Our plan is simple - we are using Facebook to target Evangelical voters in order to expose the truth about Trump's character and record, and how that is in direct contradiction with Christian teaching. </p>
<p>Additionally, we are working to draw out and create a PR nightmare for the Evangelical leaders that have supported Trump openly and the institutions they lead - men like Jerry Falwell Jr and Liberty University, Robert Jeffress and First Baptist Dallas, &amp; Franklin Graham and Samaritan's Purse.</p>
<p>Whether you are a person of faith or not, it doesn't matter. We chose this strategy because we have seen it work. Prior to the first Super Tuesday, Trump was polling double digit lead in Virginia. By utilizing this strategy, we pressured the executive leadership of the largest Christian college to publicly condemn their president's open endorsement of Trump in the Washington Post. The result? Trump won by a mere 3 points - down from a 16 point polling average in 3 separate polls  the week before.</p>
<p>Our strategy works, support our campaign, and we will take this strategy to every upcoming primary state and take Trump out of the presidential race.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Please see Faqs for Q&amp;A in regards to the needs for FV2S event and what you will receive. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the last year or two discussions on sexual assault (SA) has become more of an open topic for social issues. SA has always been one of those taboo topics. Ashari found herself discussing the topic with certain individuals.  The more she discusses this topic the more she grows in her purpose, by using her past as a driving force.  She has found that everyone should be educated on SA.  Ashari has a vision to raise awareness, prevention, and educate others in their own physical community/social media community. She really did not know in what capacity or if she was qualified enough, but after making small presentations in classes during her graduate school journey she knew that a workshop would be her goal. So she is doing the work, saving funds for FV2S as a nonprofit, and also asking for help with this specific event presented by FV2S, because she can't do this alone. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is her first event, campaign, and speaking engagement as an independent author/writer, advocate and social worker. </li>
<li>Although this is not a spiritual event. the Spiritual life and God is essential to dream this vision after healing from the sexual assault she faced. FV2S is based around hope...there is hope that a victim will survive, hope that someone will believe them, hope that you won't feel like this forever,  hope that there are people and spaces that support you, hope that this was for a reason and not in vain.</li>
<li>FV2S is rooted Faith, Hope and Love. Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13)</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 13:13 helped Ashari create the name of the luncheon. Her hope is for event attendees to grasp a hold of hope, embrace faith and feel love.  As she interacts with others she also wants to exude these areas to show up in her everyday life. The name of nonprofit (From Victim TOO Survivor aka FV2S) was formed in hope and faith that as she healed and eventually coped with her trauma in a positive way fulfill her purpose. The love that she received from her friends and family and even strangers who embraced her as a survivor has allowed her to thrive. Ashari embodies and stands firm in faith, hope and love that helped her to become a survivor.  <br/><br/>Romans 5:3-5 says, We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.  This verse is the foundation to the mission for FV2S in regards to the three Es (Educate, Empower,&amp; Embrace) and the 1 P (Promote).  Romans 5:3-5 also speaks to why she as the President values integrity, character, compassion, experience, and purpose.  <br/><br/>Lastly, Matthew 5:14 &amp;16 You are the light of the world—like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.  In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.  This verse speaks to the vision of the workshops/luncheon.  People in Ashari's life and people in passing have told her that her vision for this event is confirmation from God. She believes everyone has some light that can rule out some of this darkness in the world as long as they are hopeful, have faith, build character, share love &amp; tap into the light to exuberate/superabound  perpetual radiance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign to help make this event successful as well as to help raise money for survivors to enroll in a yoga class. If she would have known that yoga could have been a way to take back her body she would have had a different view point on yoga as more than just something to help her exercise and learn how to breathe properly. This is a practice used for coping and healing holistically. </li>
<li> Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>If you not able to donateto this event you can also purchase a book from me and those funds will go towards this cause.</li>
<li>Another way to help is to educate yourself and others about sexual assault and rape culture. You can visit rainn.or or nsvrc.org for stats and even get a SAAM kit for April Sexual Assault Awareness Month (One reason why this event is hosted during the month of April)</li>
<li>Please tell people about the event if they would like to attend.

</li>
<li>As of right now donations will simply be seen as family and friends donating. Ashari is in the process of acquiring a 501 (c) (3) status and with positive vibes she hopes to get it setup before the end of 2019. If it is in place before the end of 2019 she will send out contribution letters to all who have donated to the event. </li>

            walks out of the makeshift house made from discarded tin, wood, and plastic
            tarps. It is the only home Bayani has ever known.

        As the sun rises, Bayani
        grabs a sack and hurries off to the garbage dump and to roam the streets around
        his home looking for things he can collect to earn a little money.<span>  </span>
</p>

        He passes a school and
        pauses to watch the children laughing and talking as they enter the school
        grounds in their neat uniforms. The
        school children see Bayani, but ignore him. He is not like them; he is dirty and poor.

<p>
        He wipes tears away from
        his face as he walks away. He wants to
        go to school but he can’t. At the age of
        7, he must help support his family by collecting plastic bottles, cardboard, or
        anything else that can be recycled. If he can collect enough, he will help his
        mom buy another small bag of rice so they will have food to eat for another
        day. Bayani is one of the statistics. He is one out every four children in the
        Philippines who lives in poverty.
    </p>
<p>
        Bayani will walk the
        streets as far as 2 miles from his home. The sun is hot and he knows it is
        noon, not just because the sun is high in the sky, but because his stomach is
        growling and hurts. He continues to pick up plastic bottles as he is going
        through the garbage of a local restaurant. He finds some tasty treasures for
        his lunch, food that the restaurant customers did not fully eat.
    </p>

<p>
        Half-eaten chicken leg,
        pieces of a pork, half-eaten spring rolls, he hit the jackpot and is able to
        feed his hunger until the growling and hurt in his stomach are gone.<span>
              Bayani finds a plastic bag and starts to dig
            in another garbage container from the next restaurant. He finds a chicken
            breast with only a small bite taken out of it, six pieces of shrimp, a piece of
            beef, some boiled potatoes, and some carrots. He will be able to take this home
            to feed his pregnant mom and 4 year old brother. 
        </span>
</p>
<p>
        He finds some plastic
        bottles and other trash that he puts in his sack of items to be recycled. His
        mom will buy some rice with the 47 pesos (about $1) he got from his recyclable
        collection over the last two days.<span>  </span>

<p>
        Bayani is a Filipino name
        that means hero. Today, Bayani is a hero, but only for one evening because he
        has to go out and do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, and the
        next until he is old enough to leave home and go out on his own.
    </p>
<span>Today was a good day for this little 7 year old hero. Bayani’s
        mother loves him and knows that the way out of poverty is for him to go to
        school but she does not know how she can help him to do it. Unless he is provided
        with the opportunity to go to school, Bayani will just stay another statistic.

        Poverty in the Philippines continues to rise despite the recent progress in the country’s economy.

        Mirasol, whose name means sunflower, is a beautiful little girl who lives up to her name. She has jet black hair, straight and dirty, that would be pretty if it were combed and the lice were washed out. Her eyes are coal black and look as if they could command the sun to rise, if they only had the sparkle of a happy eight year old girl. Instead, her eyes are sad and scared. Her face is smudged with dirt, old and worn-out clothes hang from her skinny body She walks barefooted, not seeming to notice the hot asphalt or rocks.

<p>
        She follows her mother carrying her baby sister and her 4 year old brother. It is rush hour and time to beg for whatever coins they can get. It is illegal to beg and illegal to give money to beggars, but that is a law that is seldom enforced.
    </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443072179/nbsoz5psdmtcm7qkaoya.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;margin-bottom:15px;""/>
<p>
        At the intersection, the
        traffic light turns red and Marisol has to go to work tapping on car windows
        and putting on her saddest, hungriest look, hoping someone will give her just a
        coin or two so that her mom will have money to feed them tonight. The window of her first car comes down and a young
        boy hands her a half-eaten hamburger. She thanks the boy and brings it to her
        mother to divide between her brother and sister. She taps on one more window before the light turns
        to green, an elderly man puts his hand out the window and gives our Sunflower
        three coins totaling 16 pesos. Marisol
        manages a smile and a thank you as the man drives away. She runs to her mother and gives her the
        money. A good start for Marisol, a half-eaten hamburger and 16 pesos (about 34
        cents) before breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
        Her mother pushes
        Marisol to go back to the traffic and continue begging until the rush hour is
        over. Another hour of work and she is able to give her mother only 3 pesos.

<p>
        After the morning rush, Mirasol
        sits against a post on the side of the road, exhausted and hungry. She falls
        into a restless sleep until she is shaken awake by her mother and told to get
        back to work. Looking at a passing school service, she knows she will never
        have the opportunity to go to school to be a teacher, or doctor, or just Mirasol
        with a future.
    </p>
<p>
        Mirasol begins to cry as
        she approaches the first car of the lunch break. Mirasol looks at a middle-aged lady who tries to comfort her, but all the kind words will not help our little Sunflower blossom. Mirasol looks at the lady and says, “I cannot go to school.” The lady reaches over and pulls two ten peso coins out of her purse and hands them to Mirasol just as the light turns green and she speeds off. Mirasoljust stares in the direction the car drove. She is brought back to reality, from a daydream of a better life, by a slap on the back of her lice infected head by her mother who quickly grabs the two ten peso
        coins.
    </p>
<p>
        The day will soon
        come to an end with our wilted Sunflower exhausted and barely able to make it
        back to their one room squatter’s shack. Before her mother dishes up a bowl of
        cold rice, Mirasol has already curled up in her filthy blanket and is sound
        asleep, dreaming of a better life, of going to school.

<h1 style=""font-size: 20px;letter-spacing: 0;"">The Problem with Education in the Philippines </h1>
<p>Public education in the Philippines suffers from many other problems including overcrowded classrooms, lack of desks and chairs, lack of books and supplies and a shortage of teachers. We have seen classrooms designed for 20 students holding more than 50 in sweltering hot conditions. Lack of classrooms have lead many schools to try to hold 2 or even 3 class session in a single day, greatly shortening the learning time for the students.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:30px;"">This is why TKTF has teamed up with AILA to provide a complete solution. Our scholarships provide education in a top, international quality environment, with everything a student needs including books, supplies, uniforms and even nourishing meals. Some of these things may seem small but without uniforms, for example, these students would not have adequate school clothes. And without getting good nourishing meals, they will have a hard time to concentrate and to excel. If we are going to break the cycle of poverty, we need to have graduates who are given the opportunity to succeed in life.</p>

        We decided to start this crowdfunding campaign so that we could help even more students get the education they deserve and help take a small step in fighting the cycle of poverty. The scholarships include everything the student needs to attend and be successful in school including tuition, uniforms, books, supplies, school lunches, and health exams.

For only $2,000 per year we can provide a full scholarship for one child including all tuition and fees, school uniforms, shoes, books, book bags, all school supplies, school activities and meals including breakfast and lunch! This campaign will provide 5 of these scholarships to start, but it doesn't stop there. For every $2,000 dollars we raise, we will add an additional scholarship.  All money received goes directly to helping poor children attend school.


Over 13 Million Children Living in Poverty

        The Philippines has over 13 million children who are living in poverty. Millions of these children will have little chance of going to
        school and getting an education. Education is one of the country’s main problems that needs to be addressed in order to reduce the ever growing rate of poverty.
    


        At Teaching Kids to Fish we
        believe in that proverb and have made it our goal to help children get a
        quality education that will allow them to succeed in life.  By doing so we
        are able to change the lives of not only these children but also their families,
        truly feeding them for life!
    


The Story of 7 Year-Old Bayani

        Bayani wakes up before
        the sun rises, gets dressed, and finds a small bowl on the table, half full
        with cold white rice – his breakfast.
              He
            walks out of the makeshift house made from discarded tin, wood, and plastic
            tarps. It is the only home Bayani has ever known.
        



        As the sun rises, Bayani
        grabs a sack and hurries off to the garbage dump and to roam the streets around
        his home looking for things he can collect to earn a little money.  





        He passes a school and
        pauses to watch the children laughing and talking as they enter the school
        grounds in their neat uniforms. The
        school children see Bayani, but ignore him. He is not like them; he is dirty and poor.
    


        He wipes tears away from
        his face as he walks away. He wants to
        go to school but he can’t. At the age of
        7, he must help support his family by collecting plastic bottles, cardboard, or
        anything else that can be recycled. If he can collect enough, he will help his
        mom buy another small bag of rice so they will have food to eat for another
        day. Bayani is one of the statistics. He is one out every four children in the
        Philippines who lives in poverty.
    

        Bayani will walk the
        streets as far as 2 miles from his home. The sun is hot and he knows it is
        noon, not just because the sun is high in the sky, but because his stomach is
        growling and hurts. He continues to pick up plastic bottles as he is going
        through the garbage of a local restaurant. He finds some tasty treasures for
        his lunch, food that the restaurant customers did not fully eat.
    


        Half-eaten chicken leg,
        pieces of a pork, half-eaten spring rolls, he hit the jackpot and is able to
        feed his hunger until the growling and hurt in his stomach are gone.
              Bayani finds a plastic bag and starts to dig
            in another garbage container from the next restaurant. He finds a chicken
            breast with only a small bite taken out of it, six pieces of shrimp, a piece of
            beef, some boiled potatoes, and some carrots. He will be able to take this home
            to feed his pregnant mom and 4 year old brother. 
        


        He finds some plastic
        bottles and other trash that he puts in his sack of items to be recycled. His
        mom will buy some rice with the 47 pesos (about $1) he got from his recyclable
        collection over the last two days.  






        Bayani is a Filipino name
        that means hero. Today, Bayani is a hero, but only for one evening because he
        has to go out and do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, and the
        next until he is old enough to leave home and go out on his own.
    
Today was a good day for this little 7 year old hero. Bayani’s
        mother loves him and knows that the way out of poverty is for him to go to
        school but she does not know how she can help him to do it. Unless he is provided
        with the opportunity to go to school, Bayani will just stay another statistic.
    




38% of the Children in the Philippines will Receive Minimal or No Education in 2015

        Poverty in the Philippines continues to rise despite the recent progress in the country’s economy. More families suffer from lack of income and job opportunities, disabling them to support their children’s education which leads to the increasing percentage of school dropouts. The saddest fact is more children will not have the chance to get basic education.

8 Year-Old Mirasol Wants to be a Teacher


        Mirasol, whose name means sunflower, is a beautiful little girl who lives up to her name. She has jet black hair, straight and dirty, that would be pretty if it were combed and the lice were washed out. Her eyes are coal black and look as if they could command the sun to rise, if they only had the sparkle of a happy eight year old girl. Instead, her eyes are sad and scared. Her face is smudged with dirt, old and worn-out clothes hang from her skinny body She walks barefooted, not seeming to notice the hot asphalt or rocks.
    


        She follows her mother carrying her baby sister and her 4 year old brother. It is rush hour and time to beg for whatever coins they can get. It is illegal to beg and illegal to give money to beggars, but that is a law that is seldom enforced.
    


        At the intersection, the
        traffic light turns red and Marisol has to go to work tapping on car windows
        and putting on her saddest, hungriest look, hoping someone will give her just a
        coin or two so that her mom will have money to feed them tonight. The window of her first car comes down and a young
        boy hands her a half-eaten hamburger. She thanks the boy and brings it to her
        mother to divide between her brother and sister. She taps on one more window before the light turns
        to green, an elderly man puts his hand out the window and gives our Sunflower
        three coins totaling 16 pesos. Marisol
        manages a smile and a thank you as the man drives away. She runs to her mother and gives her the
        money. A good start for Marisol, a half-eaten hamburger and 16 pesos (about 34
        cents) before breakfast.
    

        Her mother pushes
        Marisol to go back to the traffic and continue begging until the rush hour is
        over. Another hour of work and she is able to give her mother only 3 pesos.
    


        There will be no breakfast for our wilting Sunflower this day.  The look in her eyes are sadder and hungrier.
    


        After the morning rush, Mirasol
        sits against a post on the side of the road, exhausted and hungry. She falls
        into a restless sleep until she is shaken awake by her mother and told to get
        back to work. Looking at a passing school service, she knows she will never
        have the opportunity to go to school to be a teacher, or doctor, or just Mirasol
        with a future.
    

        Mirasol begins to cry as
        she approaches the first car of the lunch break. Mirasol looks at a middle-aged lady who tries to comfort her, but all the kind words will not help our little Sunflower blossom. Mirasol looks at the lady and says, “I cannot go to school.” The lady reaches over and pulls two ten peso coins out of her purse and hands them to Mirasol just as the light turns green and she speeds off. Mirasoljust stares in the direction the car drove. She is brought back to reality, from a daydream of a better life, by a slap on the back of her lice infected head by her mother who quickly grabs the two ten peso
        coins.
    

        The day will soon
        come to an end with our wilted Sunflower exhausted and barely able to make it
        back to their one room squatter’s shack. Before her mother dishes up a bowl of
        cold rice, Mirasol has already curled up in her filthy blanket and is sound
        asleep, dreaming of a better life, of going to school.
    


        This evening her dreams are filled with being a teacher and teaching her students how to be kind and to help all the hungry children of the world go to school.
    


The Problem with Education in the Philippines 
Public education in the Philippines suffers from many other problems including overcrowded classrooms, lack of desks and chairs, lack of books and supplies and a shortage of teachers. We have seen classrooms designed for 20 students holding more than 50 in sweltering hot conditions. Lack of classrooms have lead many schools to try to hold 2 or even 3 class session in a single day, greatly shortening the learning time for the students.

Overcrowded classrooms and lack of school desks are the common problems in elementary schools nationwide.

This is why TKTF has teamed up with AILA to provide a complete solution. Our scholarships provide education in a top, international quality environment, with everything a student needs including books, supplies, uniforms and even nourishing meals. Some of these things may seem small but without uniforms, for example, these students would not have adequate school clothes. And without getting good nourishing meals, they will have a hard time to concentrate and to excel. If we are going to break the cycle of poverty, we need to have graduates who are given the opportunity to succeed in life.
Filipino children driven to the streets by crushing poverty






The American International Learning Academy
AILA is a private school located in Pampanga Philippines, just outside the former US Air Force base known as Clark. The school was founded three years ago by several American expats and their families to provide quality education for local students by combining American, Philippine, and other international standards and programs. The school is approved to operate and is licensed by the Philippines Department of Education (DepEd).

        The goal of AILA has always been to be a
        part of the local community and to give back with livelihood programs and
        scholarships to allow anyone to have an opportunity to succeed. The owners and
        board members have funded more than 30 scholarships with their own money. All
        proceeds from the school are reinvested in the school or the local
        community.
    



About the Scholarships

        We decided to start this crowdfunding campaign so that we could help even more students get the education they deserve and help take a small step in fighting the cycle of poverty. The scholarships include everything the student needs to attend and be successful in school including tuition, uniforms, books, supplies, school lunches, and health exams.
    

100% of all money received from this campaign will go directly to support scholarships!
        
        No admin costs, overhead costs or extra expenses are taken from the donations. Your contribution will go directly to a needy student.
    



Our first goal is to raise $10,000 which will provide scholarships to 5 needy children.  This represents 50% of the tuition and the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, school lunches, and health exams. The remainder of the tuition will be covered by AILA as our continued contribution to support this cause.

        Here are the scholars you will be
        supporting:
    


        Once we reach this goal, we will choose another 5 scholars. We hope that we will be able to provide 20 or more additional scholarships this school year.


Stretch Goals
After our initial goal of $10,000, additional funds will be used to provide more scholarships. If we raise:


        Here are few of our additional potential scholars:
    

If your generosity allows to raise more than $100,000, we add to our existing facilities and consider opening another location to support more students. Some of the ideas we have are:





Classroom Expansion/ Technology



School Buses and Transportation



Land for new school









School Building



Provide Technology
                        for Remote Schools




Rest assured, whatever we raise will go directly to supporting education for poor and needy children.


Perks


        100% of your donations will go directly to providing the needs of a scholarship student. With that in mind, we have chosen to provide more meaningful perks that are produced by the children, teachers and faculty to say thank you for your generous contributions.

Your Team in Fighting Poverty Through Education

        Our team of educators and businessmen are involved in different charity works. With collective efforts we have taken small steps to move families out of poverty by providing quality education and with your help, more families will have the chance to improve their lives in the future.

Mike Shane, President TKTF













We are doing this because we want to offer families a better life for the future. As educators we believe that in order to get out of poverty, we need to offer a quality education.
James Franson,  Headmaster - AILA











Each one of us should take the commitment to help in any way we can. We are thankful that we help give a little hope to these deserving children.
Crispin Guintu, Partner - AILA











We are committed to helping children get access to better education. With your donations more children will have a chance to reach for their dreams and provide a better future for their families.

Last year I decided to pursue one of my passion and take a trip to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Rio Janeiro. I trained at several places in Rio but during the time that I spent at Fernando Terere’s Acadmy in Ipanema I felt like I was at home. Everybody was so friendly. It was big family within the community. After so many years training martial arts I’ve never seen an atmosphere like the one at Terere’s academy. Now, after returning to Germany, I think it’s time to give something back to the members of the Cantagalo favela. I decided to create this campaign in order to gain a little financial support for Terere Kids Project. The idea behind the campaign is to raise the funds to sponsor the athletes in competitions for an entire year, as well as help to pay for the snack program. 

Just think, for the cost of one kimono, you could sponsor 5 kids to compete and win a spot at the top of the podium. </p><p><b>What is the Terere Kids Project?</b></p><p>The Terere Kids Project is a social project founded by 5x World Champion Fernando “Terere” Da Silva. The project is located in Mestre Terere’s gym at the base of the Cantagalo Favela in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro. The space for the academy was given to Terere free of rent by the government, and the students built the academy by hand alongside Mestre Terere. Since its inauguration in 2012 the academy has been a second home for children from the community that come to learn the Arte Sauve. Donations from abroad allow the project to buy kimonos, pay for competition fees, and provide snacks after the children’s class. </p>
<p>The mission of the project is to provide kids from the Cantagalo community a safe environment where they can play, grow and learn together. Many favelas in Rio lack the infrastructure and the resources to provide safe alternatives to playing on the street amongst the gangs and drug dealers. Terere himself suffered from drug addiction that halted his career in Jiu Jitsu for close to 10 years. Understanding first hand the perils associated with drug addiction, Terere formed the social project as a means to introduce more kids to Gracie Jiu Jitsu, a sport that he attributes to saving his life. Although he is back on the Jiu Jitsu scene, Terere has stepped away from the competition fervor and instead has opted to use his experiences, both on and off the mats, to help form a new generation of athletes. </p>
<p>Everyday more kids join the project and start training and competing thanks to the kimono donations and money sent for competition fees. The athletes that are more dedicated to competing have started developing their own curriculums and are learning to market themselves as athletes.</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Details about the Project</b><br/></p><p>

</span>Snack Program</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>The project provides a small
snack everyday after the kid’s 6pm class. Many of the students from the project
do not receive proper education on nutrition and maintaining a healthy diet.
One of the goals of the project is to teach our athletes how to maintain a
healthy diet in order to excel in the sport. </p>

</span>Cost: R400 (Euro 123)</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Children Kimonos</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>The project relies heavily on
kimono donations. It is easy to acquire used A1 kimonos for our older athletes;
however, the project has about 15 students under the age of 9 that require kids
kimonos. We have a deal with Cascagrossa kimonos were we can acquire kids
kimonos at the discounted prices of R100. </p>

</span>Cost: R100 (32 Euros)</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>Tournament Registration Fees. </p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>Students use donations from
abroad to pay for the tournament registration fees. Tournaments allow athletes
to gain experience and build a jiu jitsu curriculum. The project has a
competition team of 10-15 athletes from ages 6-18. </p>

<p>4.<span> 
</span>Transportation Fees</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>Transportation fees are used to
pay for metro or bus costs to and from competitions. While we generally do not
have enough funds to pay for every athlete’s transportation, we try to
reimburse the professors and chaperones. </p>

<p>a.<span> 
</span>The project offers and English
program to our instructors and our older students. The program is centered on vocabulary
for Jiu Jitsu. This has been an extremely effective method since students can
practice with international visitors that come to train at the academy. The

I decided to create this campaign in order to gain a little financial support for Terere Kids Project. The idea behind the campaign is to raise the funds to sponsor the athletes in competitions for an entire year, as well as help to pay for the snack program. 

Just think, for the cost of one kimono, you could sponsor 5 kids to compete and win a spot at the top of the podium. What is the Terere Kids Project?The Terere Kids Project is a social project founded by 5x World Champion Fernando “Terere” Da Silva. The project is located in Mestre Terere’s gym at the base of the Cantagalo Favela in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro. The space for the academy was given to Terere free of rent by the government, and the students built the academy by hand alongside Mestre Terere. Since its inauguration in 2012 the academy has been a second home for children from the community that come to learn the Arte Sauve. Donations from abroad allow the project to buy kimonos, pay for competition fees, and provide snacks after the children’s class. 
The mission of the project is to provide kids from the Cantagalo community a safe environment where they can play, grow and learn together. Many favelas in Rio lack the infrastructure and the resources to provide safe alternatives to playing on the street amongst the gangs and drug dealers. Terere himself suffered from drug addiction that halted his career in Jiu Jitsu for close to 10 years. Understanding first hand the perils associated with drug addiction, Terere formed the social project as a means to introduce more kids to Gracie Jiu Jitsu, a sport that he attributes to saving his life. Although he is back on the Jiu Jitsu scene, Terere has stepped away from the competition fervor and instead has opted to use his experiences, both on and off the mats, to help form a new generation of athletes. 
Everyday more kids join the project and start training and competing thanks to the kimono donations and money sent for competition fees. The athletes that are more dedicated to competing have started developing their own curriculums and are learning to market themselves as athletes.Details about the Project
Terere Kids Projects serves 30-40 kids
ranging from ages 3-18. The project expenses include: 
1. 
Snack Program 
2. 
Children’s kimonos
3. 
Tournament Registration fees
4. 
Transportation fees (for
chaperons) 
5. 
English program/ art supplies
1. 
Snack Program
a. 
The project provides a small
snack everyday after the kid’s 6pm class. Many of the students from the project
do not receive proper education on nutrition and maintaining a healthy diet.
One of the goals of the project is to teach our athletes how to maintain a
healthy diet in order to excel in the sport. 
b. 
Cost: R400 (Euro 123)
2. 
Children Kimonos
a. 
The project relies heavily on
kimono donations. It is easy to acquire used A1 kimonos for our older athletes;
however, the project has about 15 students under the age of 9 that require kids
kimonos. We have a deal with Cascagrossa kimonos were we can acquire kids
kimonos at the discounted prices of R100. 
b. 
Cost: R100 (32 Euros)
3. 
Tournament Registration Fees. 
a. 
Students use donations from
abroad to pay for the tournament registration fees. Tournaments allow athletes
to gain experience and build a jiu jitsu curriculum. The project has a
competition team of 10-15 athletes from ages 6-18. 
b. 
Cost (10 athletes)
 
i.  Monthly: 2,620 (394 Euros)
 
ii.  Yearly: 19,855 (10,121 Euro)
4. 
Transportation Fees
a. 
Transportation fees are used to
pay for metro or bus costs to and from competitions. While we generally do not
have enough funds to pay for every athlete’s transportation, we try to
reimburse the professors and chaperones. 
b. 
Cost: R7 per athlete (3 Euros)
c. 
Cost: R70 10 athletes (22
Euros)
5. 
English Program 
a. 
The project offers and English
program to our instructors and our older students. The program is centered on vocabulary
for Jiu Jitsu. This has been an extremely effective method since students can
practice with international visitors that come to train at the academy. The
program requires donations to supply pencils, papers, markers, and other class
materials. 
b. 
Cost: R500  (153 Euros)""No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.""Thank you all for supporting my Project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p>To compare Columbus Preparatory Academy to a children’s book, they are most certainly <i>The Little Engine That Could.  </i>In 2007, CPA was on the brink of closure.  In a state of academic emergency,  the school was plagued by dangerous student behavior, absentee parents and uninspired students.  A change in leadership in 2007 changed everything.  Principal Chad Carr took a gamble and left his home state of Kentucky to accept a new challenge: Show a school what success looks like and show the world that high behavioral and academic expectations can still breed success.   </p>
<p>Mr. Carr created an <b>academic fortress</b> and designed a unique educational program called The Blitz© which is an exciting way to inspire students to learn, to create, to motivate and above all be responsible for their own success in academics.  With The Blitz©, school is not only challenging but fun! Children are motivated to succeed with programs called <i><b>The Excellent Zone </b></i>and <b><i>The Ring of Honor</i> </b>which highlights and publicly honors achievement.  School assemblies have turned into academic pep rallies with rock concert level production and the Blitz pep rallies are instrumental in motivating the students to academic success.  Each year since Mr. Carr's arrival, CPA has climbed higher and higher in pursuit of academic excellence. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2014, the hard work paid off and Columbus Preparatory Academy was ranked the <a href=""http://www.schooldigger.com/go/OH/districtrank.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#1 school in the state of Ohio. </a>  Also in 2014, the U.S. Department of Education recognized CPA’s successes and named it a <a href=""http://nationalblueribbonschools.ed.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Blue Ribbon School</a>.  CPA has received the state of Ohio’s highest honor <a href=""http://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/Pages/School-Report.aspx?SchoolIRN=000558"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Excellent with Distinction”</a> 4 years in a row.  With a performance index score of 115.3 out of a possible 120, CPA is the best academically performing school in the state, but it has not met its ultimate goal of scoring a 120.  We need your help to finish the fight and complete the school's mission to be the best school in America-- No Excuses!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The teachers and students at CPA have achieved these amazing feats with fewer resources than most.  In an age when some schools are offering tablets and computers to every single student, CPA still must stretch every dollar.  We have given our students a strong foundation and shown them what it looks like to succeed; now we need extra help in order to stay strong at the next level.    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a charter school, CPA does not have access to the same level of revenue as traditional schools.  We receive 40% less funding than traditional public schools. CPA has become the highest academically performing school in the state of Ohio with only a fraction of the money received by traditional public schools.  <b>The Fund the Fortress Campaign </b>is an ongoing effort to obtain the funds needed to create a rich learning environment for grades K-12 with the most advanced technologies, amenities and extracurricular and sports programming.  </p>

<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the 2015- 2016 school year, it is imperative that we upgrade and increase access to technology.  Next year, the PARCC assessments are requiring our students, as young as 3rd grade, to take multiple assessments on computers.  As the costliest educational tool, we are only currently able to provide the availability of one computer lab and two classroom iPad carts to serve grades K-9.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through this campaign, we are asking for your assistance to obtain two additional classroom iPad Mini carts.  The <a href=""https://www.apple.com/education/docs/l501324g_ipad_learning_lab.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">two iPad carts </a>and small administrative costs (less than 10%) for this campaign will cost approximately $35,000.  CPA is able to use an educational discount at Apple and obtain more iPads for less cost.  Our goal of $35,000 reflects this discount. Of course, every donation beyond our goal of $35,000 will be used toward our ultimate goal that every CPA student —from kindergarten to high school—has a personal iPad to enhance their educational experience.  If we are unable to meet our goal, any money raised will go to the purchasing of iPads, as many as we can obtain with the amount received through your generous donations. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>iPad tablet technology is the future of education and is desperately needed to be academically competitive and on par with other districts in central Ohio. CPA students will be able to use this technology to access unlimited digital content including online libraries.  For example, <a href=""http://www.mackin.com/eServices/MACKIN-VIA.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MackinVia </a>is an online platform where teachers can manage eResources and access digital content simultaneously on all students' iPads.  This technology is required for our high school students. High schoolers will access online digital content from the University of Toledo in order to graduate from CPA with not only a high school diploma, but also with an associate’s degree from the University of Toledo at no additional cost.  We have chosen iPads over traditional desktop computers because CPA is lacking space to add computer labs at this time.  Also, iPads minis are less expensive and provide classroom versatility. </p>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p><b>Creativity impacts our way of seeing the world and our ability to find creative solutions</b>.<b> Unfortunately, schools tend to easily overlook the importance of creativity</b>. We believe it is the best form of self-expression and we want to encourage children to express themselves openly and without judgement.</p>
<p>Creative experiences can<b> help children express and cope with their feelings</b>. They also foster <b>personal growth</b> in children by providing opportunities for trying out new ideas, and new ways of thinking and problem-solving. <b>Children become adults who will make a difference in our world with their creative problem-solving skills.</b></p>
<p>Discovering our creative side shaped our lives and gave us courage to pursue our dreams. Now,<b> we want to create this opportunity for children around the world</b>.</p>
<h3>What</h3>

</div></div>","We are 2 creative spirits, enthusiastic about people and traveling, with the desire to explore the world. Creative Seed is our way of sharing our passion and our way of bringing our contribution to the world.










Why
Creativity impacts our way of seeing the world and our ability to find creative solutions. Unfortunately, schools tend to easily overlook the importance of creativity. We believe it is the best form of self-expression and we want to encourage children to express themselves openly and without judgement.
Creative experiences can help children express and cope with their feelings. They also foster personal growth in children by providing opportunities for trying out new ideas, and new ways of thinking and problem-solving. Children become adults who will make a difference in our world with their creative problem-solving skills.
Discovering our creative side shaped our lives and gave us courage to pursue our dreams. Now, we want to create this opportunity for children around the world.
What
The goal of the project is to reach children with difficult backgrounds from 3 different continents and create the right setting for them to explore their creativity and discover other cultures.
How

The Global Citizen programme in AIESEC has helped us find volunteering opportunities and partners for our project.  We want to reach children in Tanzania, Mexico and Romania and spend six weeks in each country organizing creative workshops.
One of us will be going in Tanzania (Andra) and one in Mexico (Mădălina) where we will work with children aged 6-14, adjusting our workshops to the specifics of the local culture. We also wish to explore the local crafting traditions. After completing our six weeks of planting seeds of creativity in Tanzania and Mexico, we’ll come back to Romania. Together we’ll have another six amazing weeks of creative workshops for children in Iaşi adding new cultural elements from our previous experience.
During the workshops we will talk about dreams, friendship, creativity and culture. Together with the children we will experiment with different crafting techniques, learn more about ourselves, explore and share our cultures. Our purpose is to open a door to positive and creative thinking that will lead to stronger individuals and eventually  to a better community.


To sum up the experience we will organize a Craft Gallery with pictures and handcrafts from the project. The purpose of the Gallery will be to show people that creativity has the power to bring change and the potential to connect people and cultures. It is also a nice way to show our appreciation to all of our donors and supporters.

   
We are committed to make the best out of this experience but for this we need your support. We need 3000 euros to cover the expenses of the project:


300 € materials for the creative workshops
2500 € travel expenses in Tanzania and Mexico
200 € living expenses in Tanzania and Mexico
We have a lot to give to show our appreciation! Except that fact that you will make us happy and bring a lot of smiles to the children that we will work with, you will also be the lucky owners of some really creative handcrafts. Check out our artistic skills.

<h3>Hola! Bienvenidos a Mamemi!</h3> <p>Soy mamá y expatriada. Me encanta leer o inventar cuentos para mis peques, y vivir en un entorno donde se hablan diferentes idiomas es enriquecedor. Por estos dos motivos creé Mamemi.com, una web para escuchar cuentos en muchos idiomas. En Mamemi encontrareis cuentos clásicos y otros inventados por mi, con la inestimable ayuda de la imaginación de mis hijos. Actualmente la web tiene muchos cuentos en 11 idiomas, pero... Sabéis una cosa? ¡Caperucita Roja, el cuento más famoso del mundo, no está en nuestra lista! Es por este motivo por el cual necesito vuestra ayuda, para que me ayudéis a poder publicar ""La Caperucita Roja"" en muchos idiomas, para que niños de todo el mundo puedan escucharlo, en su idioma y en otros, para que todos nos sintamos iguales dentro de nuestras diferencias. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesito y lo que se obtiene</h3> <p>¿Qué necesito? traductores, leedores, contratar un estudio de sonido, que la ilustradora con la que colaboro dibuje una maravillosa Caperucita...

</div></div>","Hola! Bienvenidos a Mamemi! Soy mamá y expatriada. Me encanta leer o inventar cuentos para mis peques, y vivir en un entorno donde se hablan diferentes idiomas es enriquecedor. Por estos dos motivos creé Mamemi.com, una web para escuchar cuentos en muchos idiomas. En Mamemi encontrareis cuentos clásicos y otros inventados por mi, con la inestimable ayuda de la imaginación de mis hijos. Actualmente la web tiene muchos cuentos en 11 idiomas, pero... Sabéis una cosa? ¡Caperucita Roja, el cuento más famoso del mundo, no está en nuestra lista! Es por este motivo por el cual necesito vuestra ayuda, para que me ayudéis a poder publicar ""La Caperucita Roja"" en muchos idiomas, para que niños de todo el mundo puedan escucharlo, en su idioma y en otros, para que todos nos sintamos iguales dentro de nuestras diferencias.    Lo que necesito y lo que se obtiene ¿Qué necesito? traductores, leedores, contratar un estudio de sonido, que la ilustradora con la que colaboro dibuje una maravillosa Caperucita... Por eso calculo que el coste de 11 traducciones, contratar 11 leedores, el estudio de sonido que los grabe y monte los archivos y finalmente la ilustración, costaría todo junto 1500 $ .
¿Qué obtendréis a cambio? Suscripciones gratuitas para tener acceso ilimitado a www.mamemi.com, para que podáis guardar vuestros cuentos favoritos en vuestra propia carpeta, para que podáis participar en sorteos especiales... a un precio muy inferior al de la suscripción. Recibir en formato PdF una ilustración de Caperucita personalizada, para que vuestro pequeño compruebe que Caperucita le ha dedicado su ""foto"".

But we will always thank those who help contribute to our cause. Every single dollar counts and helps us get one step closer to reaching our total goal.If we don't reach our goal, we will use as much of our funding towards the competition and be forced to find some other way in order to pay the bill for going to Arkansas. <h3>The Impact</h3>Our project can improve the lives of teens all over the world. It was designed to help teens improve their school-life balance. Teen years are some of the hardest years for a person. This is because they are starting to become independent from their parents but aren't quite there yet. As teenagers ourselves, we believed that teens need help in order to maintain a good balance and order in their lives. <br/>Our project is already proven to work. We first started small and pilot tested it on ourselves. We maintained a log of us using it for over two months. After advice from our experts, we began to spread the project and gave it to kids ranging throughout the teenager years as well as teens of both genders. This is so we don't see one-sided results and so we can try with a varied group of people and receive as best results as possible. <br/>You can see the first, basic version of our project at : <a href=""http://green-bots.com/KeenTeen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://green-bots.com/KeenTeen/</a> <div>Learn more about our product in a simple video here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxqyOkT5cQQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxqyOkT5cQQ</a>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Doing a project like this and funding needed for a trip, well more of a journey for us, there is basically nothing that can go wrong. We organized everything such as the trip, project, robot, etc.  The only problem was the money. And with the proper funding, our dream will be fulfilled. We want the nation to be talking about KeenTeen and FLL, and we won't be able to do it without YOUR help!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<h3>There are other ways to help besides donating. You could create and awareness of having a school-life balance and sharing KeenTeen with your friends and family. We would also like to inspire children with FLL, just like we did. <br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>  How Can Our ACADEMY Help Increase Women Empowerment in India</b></h2>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<div>The Impact of our project is massive. This project is divided into two Phases. The contribution we are asking today is just for Phase I of this project. The Phase I involves establishing a <b>SKILLS DEVELOPMENT ACADEMY for <b>WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</b>  (SDAWE) for the Tribal Girls of North East India in Kolkata</b>. These girls are over the age of 18, haven't completed schooling and are unemployed. These girls want to be liberated and want to learn and achieve something in life, but due to the financial constraints, improper training and lack of opportunities they have not been able to do so. Some of these girls have never been outside of their tribal villages. These girls will be relocated from their villages to the closest metropolitan city, Kolkata, so that we can provide them with the best training facilities. Our goal is to start with an enrolment of 150 girls.</div>
<blockquote><i style=""text-align: center;"">""Our team strongly believes that educating women and providing them with the right skills will benefit them, and will also benefit the whole community, and possibly the whole world. You never know, which one of these women might have a baby that grows to become a scientist who cures extreme diseases or solves humanity's grand challenges""</i></blockquote>
<h2><span style=""text-align: center;""><b>                     OUR MISSION</b></span></h2>
<div>
<span style=""text-align: center;""><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Our MISSION</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is to provide the </span><b>Best Quality International Standard Skills Development and Training</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> to these girls, so that they can work in both India and overseas. We are an </span><b>energetic, experienced, dedicated, strong and committed team</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> which strives to provide these girls with the knowledge and skills that will transform their lives, the life they would have only dreamt of. Our philosophy can be described by the words of Zig Ziglar, one of the best personal development mentors the world has ever witnessed. </span><b><i>""You will get all you want in life, if you help enough other people get what they want""</i></b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. If you look at our team, our Advisors are highly respectable, committed pioneers in their field related to solving humanity's greatest challenges. Our founders are experts in their area of skills development, training, teaching and mentoring. Your generous help can create endless possibilities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The gap between women and men in India is still severe. According to the statistics by the census of India, 82.14% of adult men are educated, only 65.46% of adult women are known to be literate in India. Not only is an illiterate women at the mercy of her husband or father, she also does not know that this is not the way of life for women across the world. Additionally, the norms of culture that state that the man of the family is the be-all and end-all of family decisions is slowly spoiling the society of the country.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>WHAT ARE WE PROVIDING IN OUR ACADEMY </b></h2>
<p>Our Skills Development Academy will provide these tribal girls skills training and we are also <b>committed for their employment.</b> <b>We are providing 100% guarantee for their jobs.</b> We have a <b>strong team</b> of founders with International experience and expertise in recruitment, training, development, coaching and mentoring. You can see this further in our team section below. We have personally developed the skills training program in coordination with the current and future demands of the industry. Executives within the various industries will be regularly visiting as guest speakers to encourage and motivate the girls.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>WHAT SETS US APART</b></h2>

They </span>will be provided with <b>clean accommodation facilities and a good catering facility</b>. Every girl that gets trained with us will be <b>trained in self development</b> and they will be provided self development books such as ""Take Me Home: The Inspiring Stories of 20 Entrepreneurs from Small Town India with Big time Dreams"" <b>(Rashmi Bansal)</b>, ""Poor Little Rich Slum: What We Saw in Dharavi and Why it Matters"" <b>(Rashmi Bansal &amp; Deepak Gandhi)</b>, ""Think and Grow Rich for Women: Using Your Power to Create Success and Significance"" <b>(Sharon Lechter)</b>,  ""You Can Trust Yourself"" <b>(Louise Hay &amp; Cheryl Richardson)</b>, ""Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder"" <b>(Arianna Huffington)</b>, ""You Can Create An Exceptional Life"" <b>(Louise Hay &amp; Cheryl Richardson)</b>, ""The Secret"" <b>(Rhonda Byrne)</b>, ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead"" <b>(Sheryl Sandberg)</b>, ""Rich Women"" <b>(Kim Kiyosaki)</b>, ""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unleash the Power Within"" <b>(Anthony Robbins)</b>, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" <b>(Dale Carnegie)</b>, ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" <b>(Stephen Covey)</b>, ""The Alchemist"" <b>(Paulo Coelho)</b>, ""The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari"" <b>(Robin Sharma)</b> and more.</span></p>
<p>These girls will also learn the basic and necessary skills of <b>professional communication, professional grooming, computer skills and using the internet, skills to work in call centres, work as housekeepers, waitresses, flight stewardesses, and receptionists.</b> Furthermore, these girls will be assisted in developing their resumes and organising interviews with major Hotels and Airlines in India to get the placements in the <b>hotel, tourism and aviation sectors</b>. Our Co-Founder has been in this industry for 8 years and has expertise and contacts with all the major industry leaders in India.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first major step for us is to relocate the tribal girls to a metropolitan city closest to their home town. The relocation is <b>necessary because of a lack of resources available in tribal regions</b> for giving them the best training and employment opportunities. Further, my mentor, Jim Rohn said <b><i>""you are the average of five people you spend the most time with""</i>.</b> Hence, it is very important for the girls to spend more time out of their tribal community during their development stage. The <b>girls are very happy to be relocated</b> as they understand that to achieve bigger goals in life, sometimes small sacrifices have to be made. </p>

Major Concerns Around Lack of Women Education & Skills Around the Globe (UNESCO)
Women and girls often have very low status in developing countries and empowerment and education are central to enabling them to make their own decisions and allowing them to access maternal health and family planning services.



Educating girls can save millions of lives 

Educated women are less likely to die giving birth to newborns


Girls with higher levels of education are less likely to have children at an early age 

Girls with higher levels of education are less likely to get married at an early age


Educated women are more likely to find work

  How Can Our ACADEMY Help Increase Women Empowerment in India


The Impact of our project is massive. This project is divided into two Phases. The contribution we are asking today is just for Phase I of this project. The Phase I involves establishing a SKILLS DEVELOPMENT ACADEMY for WOMEN EMPOWERMENT  (SDAWE) for the Tribal Girls of North East India in Kolkata. These girls are over the age of 18, haven't completed schooling and are unemployed. These girls want to be liberated and want to learn and achieve something in life, but due to the financial constraints, improper training and lack of opportunities they have not been able to do so. Some of these girls have never been outside of their tribal villages. These girls will be relocated from their villages to the closest metropolitan city, Kolkata, so that we can provide them with the best training facilities. Our goal is to start with an enrolment of 150 girls.
""Our team strongly believes that educating women and providing them with the right skills will benefit them, and will also benefit the whole community, and possibly the whole world. You never know, which one of these women might have a baby that grows to become a scientist who cures extreme diseases or solves humanity's grand challenges""
                     OUR MISSION

Our MISSION is to provide the Best Quality International Standard Skills Development and Training to these girls, so that they can work in both India and overseas. We are an energetic, experienced, dedicated, strong and committed team which strives to provide these girls with the knowledge and skills that will transform their lives, the life they would have only dreamt of. Our philosophy can be described by the words of Zig Ziglar, one of the best personal development mentors the world has ever witnessed. ""You will get all you want in life, if you help enough other people get what they want"". If you look at our team, our Advisors are highly respectable, committed pioneers in their field related to solving humanity's greatest challenges. Our founders are experts in their area of skills development, training, teaching and mentoring. Your generous help can create endless possibilities. 
The gap between women and men in India is still severe. According to the statistics by the census of India, 82.14% of adult men are educated, only 65.46% of adult women are known to be literate in India. Not only is an illiterate women at the mercy of her husband or father, she also does not know that this is not the way of life for women across the world. Additionally, the norms of culture that state that the man of the family is the be-all and end-all of family decisions is slowly spoiling the society of the country.

WHAT ARE WE PROVIDING IN OUR ACADEMY 
Our Skills Development Academy will provide these tribal girls skills training and we are also committed for their employment. We are providing 100% guarantee for their jobs. We have a strong team of founders with International experience and expertise in recruitment, training, development, coaching and mentoring. You can see this further in our team section below. We have personally developed the skills training program in coordination with the current and future demands of the industry. Executives within the various industries will be regularly visiting as guest speakers to encourage and motivate the girls.
                      
WHAT SETS US APART
Apart from the Skills Development Training, our training program includes work life balance training, such as yoga classes for health and karate classes for self protection. They will be provided with clean accommodation facilities and a good catering facility. Every girl that gets trained with us will be trained in self development and they will be provided self development books such as ""Take Me Home: The Inspiring Stories of 20 Entrepreneurs from Small Town India with Big time Dreams"" (Rashmi Bansal), ""Poor Little Rich Slum: What We Saw in Dharavi and Why it Matters"" (Rashmi Bansal & Deepak Gandhi), ""Think and Grow Rich for Women: Using Your Power to Create Success and Significance"" (Sharon Lechter),  ""You Can Trust Yourself"" (Louise Hay & Cheryl Richardson), ""Thrive: The Third Metric to Redefining Success and Creating a Life of Well-Being, Wisdom, and Wonder"" (Arianna Huffington), ""You Can Create An Exceptional Life"" (Louise Hay & Cheryl Richardson), ""The Secret"" (Rhonda Byrne), ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead"" (Sheryl Sandberg), ""Rich Women"" (Kim Kiyosaki), ""Unleash the Power Within"" (Anthony Robbins), ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" (Dale Carnegie), ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" (Stephen Covey), ""The Alchemist"" (Paulo Coelho), ""The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari"" (Robin Sharma) and more.
These girls will also learn the basic and necessary skills of professional communication, professional grooming, computer skills and using the internet, skills to work in call centres, work as housekeepers, waitresses, flight stewardesses, and receptionists. Furthermore, these girls will be assisted in developing their resumes and organising interviews with major Hotels and Airlines in India to get the placements in the hotel, tourism and aviation sectors. Our Co-Founder has been in this industry for 8 years and has expertise and contacts with all the major industry leaders in India.

                                           

Our training school will be set up as BENEFIT CORPORATION which is a type of for-profit corporate entity that includes positive impact on society and the environment as stated in its legally defined goals. The purpose of a benefit corporation includes creating general public benefit, which is defined as a material positive impact on society and the environment. Some of the operational costs such as teaching and boarding fees will be reimbursed in quarterly instalments by the government of North East India after the first 3 months of   the Academy's operations. The final funding by government will be released on successful employment of the girls in the industry. As we suggested  before that we a Phase II to this project. Whatever profits made from Phase I of the project will then be invested into further expansion of the Academy to create space for more equipment and better training facilities for the girls. 


                                                                        Source
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

Despite having support from the Indian Government, we must show that the Academy will actually make a difference to these girls in the region.  We want this to be a ‘public’ endeavour relying on socially responsible start-up funding from the global community rather than private investment funds who primarily focus on their own personal financial return-on-investment.

Subscribe at the top of the page to be alerted via email when they have been posted. http://michaeltgately.blogspot.comPlease help me reach my goal of giving 20 Nepali families (or more!) a months income to help them rebuild their lives. God Bless and please send prayers for Nepal! Note: In the case some unexpected even occurs (again) and prevents the trip, the money raised will be donated to the RedCross.If the target goal is reached and surpassed families will begin receiving a pro-rated 2nd, 3rd and so on months income until all donations have been used.Finally, if you feel uncomfortable donating to this specific cause please do not let that stop you from helping those in need. Below is a link to the RedCross's donation for Nepal Relief, thank you and God Bless Nepal.RedCross Nepal Earthquake Relief",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Like many who have close ties with Nepal, I have been in shock and despair since the earthquakes, but am compelled to help in any way I can.  In an attempt to make a difference I have decided to do my own fundraising - I have joined the local Park Run group and will be doing their weekly 5K run for 3 weeks. My first one is on 16th May and I am joining #RunforNepal - a group of people all running to raise money for Nepal, or to show solidarity and support.  </div>
<div>100% of the funds raised will be donated to organisations and people who are working tirelessly on the ground, day and night, trying to reach everyone who are in dire need of shelter, food and medicines. They need the money for access to helicopters to be able to deliver relief to villages not easily reachable by road. They need the money to buy foods and shelter for people who have gone without for many days. I will also donate the money to organisations who are working on regeneration of the country - through rebuilding better, more suitable houses, rebuilding better roads and networks.</div>
<div>The process of rebuilding will be a very long one and Nepal needs all the help we can give.</div>

<p>I love learning about diseases! I love learning about the
things that cause diseases and how we can recognise and hopefully stop them.</p>
<p>After finishing my degree in Biology with geology in 2010 I
had the choice to do a Masters but couldn’t afford it. Instead I went to
complete a PGCE in post-compulsory education, after that I moved to Birmingham
to work at a college. I’d never really
come across microbiology and infectious diseases in great detail before as they
weren’t a major part of my degree. However, when I began teaching I was given
the entire disease and infection unit. I really enjoyed learning about the
different diseases so that I could teach my students, and they responded to my
enthusiasm as we discussed things from dysentery to the difference between HIV
and AIDS. The next year I was given responsibility for Microbiology as well.
Although I enjoyed the practicals and the theoretical side, I felt there was
something missing. A desire to know more grabbed me and I began looking into Masters near where I lived but I knew I would never be able to afford it.</p>
<p>After becoming deeply unhappy at work, battling stress and
depression due to working conditions and the knowledge that I would no longer
have a job after August I began to have therapy and get help.</p>
<p>My therapist encouraged me to accept a long term supply post
and they also pointed out that, after we did some calculations, I would just
be able to afford the Masters fee – especially if I worked part time whilst studying so I didn’t have to dip into my savings.</p>
<p>So, I went to open evenings and open days, I badgered course
leaders about my suitability and the fees for their courses and now have recieved and accepted an offer! I’m feeling pretty confident! I’d be one of the first
people in my family to get a Masters. I’m also looking at different groups and
charities to see if I can qualify for any extra funding. </p>
<p>Why, I hear you ask, if you’re saving so much and should
have saved enough for the Masters fee are you doing a project on Indigigo?</p>
<p>Several reasons:</p>
<p><span>1)<span> 
</span></span>I’m currently working as a supply teacher, this
means over the summer holidays I won’t get paid, and September is a very slow
month for work. I will do exam marking but it wouldn’t be enough to support me
over the summer unless I manage to get a part time job (I’m working on it but
can’t guarantee it!) The money, depending how much raised would help me not dip
into my savings.</p>
<p><span>2)<span> 
</span></span>Fuel to get to university, a parking permit, car
expenses. I would need to catch at least 2 buses to get to either of the universities
I want to go to, keeping my car would mean I could carry more books, stay later on
campus doing work, be able to drive from campus to work (when I get work!)</p>
<p><span>3)<span> 
</span></span>Textbooks, stationary, printing – Textbooks are
expensive, I’m hoping to get disabled student allowance (on account of my
dyslexia) but if I don’t, I won’t be able to claim back for any textbooks I
buy. I require my own copies of textbooks as because of my dyslexia I find it
hard to absorb information from a written format, this means I usually have to
highlight in books. If push comes to shove I can always photocopy, but even
that will cost extra money.</p>
<p><span>4)<span> 
</span></span>Things not-covered in my Masters course that are
required, I keep hearing words along the lines of ‘lab bench fees’ ‘they’ll be
listed in your offer letter’ This worries me!</p>
<p>What’s in it for you? I was trying to think of something I could
offer you that you might like and wouldn’t be too dull, I know some people
offer copies of their Masters dissertations but I didn’t want to make you wait
2 or three years for your reward! I don’t claim to be a brilliant artist... or
a fantastic poet but I will try my best! I’m open to sensible suggestions as
well.<span></span> </p>

<h3>How did this all start?</h3>
<p>Operation Spark was started in September 2013 when John began teaching young adults in community centers how to build simple video games with the aim of igniting the pursuit of an employable passion.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2014 Operation Spark was accepted into one of the premier ed tech incubators in the U.S. called <a href=""http://www.4pt0.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4.0 Schools</a>. At that time we ran our first Bootcamp where students were immersed in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In August 2014, the program culminated in a pitch event where Operation Spark <a href=""http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2014/08/education_entrepreneurship_con.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">received both the Judges' Prize and the Audience-Choice Award</a>. That same month we received our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status from the IRS!</p>

New Orleans has over 25,000 youth aged 16 - 24 who are neither in school nor part of the workforce. Because of the lost opportunity they represent, this demographic of youth are described as Opportunity Youth. 
Opportunity Youth represent a vast amount of potential but lack options due to lack of education and job skills. We're helping them bulldoze a path to careers in tech.
On the workforce side, the outlook for jobs in the software industry is
twice that of the national average (22%) but only one in ten New Orleans schools teach any
software curriculum. 



You can help change the lives of low-income youth by supporting Operation Spark's Prototype Program that will enable 10 of our students to find employment in the software industry this year.


Prototype is a program where our students work on real client projects alongside professional developers and get the experience needed to become truly employable. The program provides a buffered environment between the challenges students face in their lives and the anticipated demands of the workforce.  
At-a-glance, Prototype is a:





6-month apprenticeship with real client projects
Practical application of software skills with professional guidance
Mentorship program
Try-out to get hired



What your donation will do
Operation Spark needs a third employee to head up the Prototype program. We've raised half of that money already and need another $25K to bring someone on. The Prototype program is already up and running with our first student, Melvin, working on two paying client projects. We want to scale up to 10 students and that means bringing someone else on board.  


Goals for 2015





Teach 50 young adults how to code 
Help 10 young adults get real software jobs
Train 50 K-12 teachers who will teach Computer Science curriculum in 30 local schools directly impacting at least 1000 students
Give away 50 laptops to qualified students 
Work with state legislators to make Computer Science required curriculum in Louisiana's schools




Operation Spark: What we doSTUDENT BOOTCAMPS
Operation Spark runs coding Bootcamps where students are
immersed in the daily workflow of a professional developer. Teams of four professional software engineers volunteer their time to teach our Bootcamps.


8 weeks; 1.5 hour sessions twice a week
Learn proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Learn commandline, node.js, git, Github

At the end of Bootcamp students are empowered with an invaluable new skill-set and can either continue learning on their own or enter into Prototype, our next level of programming.

TEACHER TRAINING BOOTCAMPS

Only 1 in 10 K-12 schools across the U.S. teach any computer science courses. We’re working with teachers from a number schools to bring our curriculum into their classrooms. Teacher Training focuses on best practices for teaching software skills in a K-12 classroom setting.


CONNECT

Connect is Operation Spark’s coordinated effort to address the ‘digital divide’- lack of access to computers, internet connection, or digital literacy- by offering hardware and internet access to low-income families across New Orleans. 
The 'digital divide' prevents students from coding at home.  Operation Spark students who don't own laptops can sign up to receive a free Acer C720 Chromebook that comes loaded with the Ubuntu operating system - an ideal digital environment for coding.  








What we've done so far



Taught over 100 young adults the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through immersive coding Bootcamps
Trained 12 K-12 teachers on bringing software curriculum into their classrooms
Gave 10 free Chromebooks to students (with many more on the way!)



What we're working on now




We're currently running two Student Bootcamps

Starting up another Teacher Training Bootcamp 
Starting up a class for incarcerated youth (more info below)

Operation Spark is working with the City of New Orleans to pilot a program at the youth detention center (Youth Study Center) to teach JavaScript to incarcerated youth so they will be workforce ready upon release. The superintendent of the facility is hopeful that this will become a model program for other detention centers in Louisiana and the rest of the country. 

Consider hiring Operation Spark to build your minimum viable product!


How did this all start?
Operation Spark was started in September 2013 when John began teaching young adults in community centers how to build simple video games with the aim of igniting the pursuit of an employable passion.
During the summer of 2014 Operation Spark was accepted into one of the premier ed tech incubators in the U.S. called 4.0 Schools. At that time we ran our first Bootcamp where students were immersed in the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In August 2014, the program culminated in a pitch event where Operation Spark received both the Judges' Prize and the Audience-Choice Award. That same month we received our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status from the IRS!

We're a group of university students seeking for a meaningful change in Guatemala. We believe that the best way to change our country is through education. That's the main reason why we are starting a movement to fund a college student through a scholarship. 
We study at Universidad Francisco Marroquín (UFM), a private university in Guatemala
City and one of Latin America’s most prestigious institutes of higher learning. This university has created an undergraduate scholarship program known as ITA. In Spanish, the acronym
stands for promoting academic talent. ITA was founded to attract the country’s most talented students and
those most likely to become leaders. The program seeks out passionate
and committed students who cannot afford to attend university. 
Guatemala's current situation
For children living in the poorest rural areas, getting
an education is almost impossible. Usually, children have to work to help their family’s income. Although some of them are lucky enough to get a high school education, the probabilities of getting a university
education are almost null.
Why we need your help
The stories of many of the ITA students are
dramatic: parents murdered, families abandoned,
children whose parents refuse to let them go to school (especially girls),
villages with no schooling beyond sixth grade, parents who can’t read or write,
malnutrition, dirt floor huts, no running water or electricity.
What sets ITA students apart from the hundreds of thousands
of poor students with similar stories is attitude and character.  And by the time they finally achieve that dream (say,
graduating from UFM), they have already set themselves another much bigger one.

Challenge for the ITA programIn the last few years, due to lack of funding UFM has not been able to offer scholarships to everyone who qualifies. Up to 80 students have applied and qualified for the program but sadly the program has only been able to award a scholarship to 4% of these students. 




Since 1996 ITA Scholarships Program has helped 172 students from 19 Guatemalan provinces 
81% of these students have been honor students

The impact of ITA scholars
After graduating from UFM, their impact ripples through
families, villages, and the business community as they assume new
responsibilities as role models, project leaders, and professionals. 
Each ITA graduate takes a different path. Many jump right
into social and development projects that have an immediate impact on their
communities, others take up professional careers, some teach, become
entrepreneurs, create jobs, and earn scholarships to pursue graduate
studies abroad.
