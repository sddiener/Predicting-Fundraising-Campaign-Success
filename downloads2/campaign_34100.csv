<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span><span>On April 25th a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal 50 miles to the west of the bustling city of Kathmandu where over one million people call home.  So far its estimated that there are over 8,000 deaths and another 14,000 casualties.  With lack of power, many collapsed or unsafe homes, and dwindling resources over half a million people are estimated to have been displaced and are in need of immediate attention.  Western regions have been the hardest hit.  Entire villages have been destroyed and access roads cut off.  The ancient city of Bhaktapur, home to over 80,000 people has had a majority of its buildings collapse.  </span></p>

<h3><span>Fundrasing</span></h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Kevin Lanuk and I'm the founder of a Himalayan start-up called <a href=""http://www.mountkarma.com/#!nepalearthquakerelief/c1owo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mountkarma</a>.  Nepal is a place close to my heart filled with some of the most grounded, kind and generous people I've ever known.  My friends and colleagues live and work in Kathmandu and while our team is safe and sound a great deal of people haven't been as fortunate.</p>
<p>Mountkarma in coordination with our partner organization J.M. Trading are creating a 100% volunteer based relief effort in Nepal to help bring 1st and 2nd level help to villages in need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the moment what people need most are tents, rice, salt, oil, pulses and medicine.  Monsoon season is also on its way and more than anything people will need shelter. The entirety of the proceeds will be used for purchasing these goods which will be transported to the assessed villages in need.  Because we're doing this on a volunteer basis we have no administrative costs which will insure all of the donations go to helping the victims.  Please join me in bringing relief to some of the areas and people that need it the most.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We're seeking to raise as much as we can with the goal of reaching $10,000 USD so we can use the funds to purchase and distribute materials that Nepali people in rural villages will need during the next few months.</p>
<p>All contributions are welcome under the big CONTRIBUTE button and you also have the choice of receiving one of our  Tibetan prayer flag shirt which is handmade by our artisans in Nepal.  </p>
<p>As we collectively strive to reach our donation goal of $10,000, I will be trying to personally raise funds to travel to Nepal and help efforts in person.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>While a great deal of charities and organizations are raising funds for providing relief services around Nepal many smaller local NGO’s are not receiving the same amount of attention.  These organizations can make big differences in their communities  given the financial resources.  By working hands-on with smaller local organizations we will have the ability to more easily manage the impact and transparency of our crowdfunding campaign. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Opening Books to Open Doors is the brain child of Oscar Azameti, a recent graduate of the University of Ghana at Legon. Having struggled to afford education as a child, by the time I met Oscar at age 27 and a junior in University, he was already brainstorming ways to provide scholarships to children in his community. </p>
<p>My name is Morgan Bober, and I have been working with Oscar for the last three years to send seven children from Klikor, Ghana to school. These are children who are passionate about education, who want to use an education to help their community, but whose families cannot afford the fees associated with schooling without outside financial assistance. </p>

<p>Oscar and Morgan, in Ghana</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having grown up in the United States with access to free education and very few impediments to learning, it is heartbreaking for me to know that these children in Ghana are so motivated by and so dedicated to an education that they cannot afford. </p>
<p>The fees associated with an education in Ghana, from a uniform to exam fees to lunch and transportation, are financial barriers to many children and their families. These barriers are too often correlated with an individual’s ability to obtain a well paying job or to help lift their family out of poverty. </p>

</ul>
<p>These fees can vary marginally from term to term, and year to year depending on the student’s class year and additional resources needed. There is also variation due to fluctuations in currency exchange, as these numbers are converted from the Ghanaian cedi. </p>

I returned to Iowa State University after being away for 6 years and worked hard to achieve a double degree in Psychology and Sociology and to build my GPA back up to graduate with Honors. </p>
<p>However, that time away has come back now to haunt me, as the loans I consolidated in order to achieve this goal have now come to collect. I've already been accepted at Iowa State University for the Fall of 2013, but my loans are preventing me from making an attempt to earn a Master's Degree even possible. </p>
<p>So, here is what I need. For a semester at Iowa State University, it will cost me a total of $4440 after fees are added in. In this semester's time, I can work with the loans that are preventing me from granting my financial assistantship to release my financial package and place me back on track to achieving the degree I'm seeking.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice that I'm only asking for part of the amount that I need. The reason for this is that I'm currently seeking other means of helping me get back into school and so I won't need to campaign for the full amount. The funds that are raised through Indiegogo will be put towards my college tuition, with any extra amount being used to help pay off the outstanding loans.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't reach its goal, that isn't going to be the end of my own campaign to return to Iowa State, and any money raised will go towards this endeavor.  </p>
<p>This is my first time trying something like this, but if you contribute even a dollar towards this campaign, I will personally send you a thank you note in response to your donation. This project is very personal to me, as it'll be the first step in my eventual goal of earning my Ph.D, and you could have a hand in making this happen. </p>
<p>And if you can't donate a dollar towards this campaign, please share this with your friends and explain what it's for. I'm not asking for much, but every dollar helps. Please help this campaign be a success.</p>

<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>Hello!
 We're Rebecca Jones and Norina Beck, the directors of Rising Song Preschool,
For the past five years our little school has provided quality, affordable
childcare to families in Portland Oregon.  We believe in the importance of
small class size, play based learning, and connecting children to the natural
world. Our tuition is sliding scale, and supports families of all income
levels.    </p>
<p>Our school is currently located in a rented house.
 For the last year we've been looking for a permanent home for our school.
 We're excited to be in the process of purchasing a residential house on a
1/2 acre of land, so we can relocate and expand our school.  With your
help we plan to turn the land into a beautiful garden, orchard and play area as
well put the finishing touches on renovating the existing building.  This
move will allow our school double in size, impacting twice as many families and
children.  </p><p><b>To find out more about our school, please visit us at:</b></p><p><a href=""http://www.risingsongpreschool.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.risingsongpreschool.org</a></p>

<p>We
have raised 90% of the downpayment for the property.  Our loan includes a construction budget of $21,785, which will help us get
most of the work done but cannot include landscaping work for the school garden  and a few other necessary renovations.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My Name is Charles Miles, and I come from a large family. Two weeks ago, my mom called me and asked me to start contributing to a college education account she set up for my four little brothers.</p>
<p>She contributes a little here and there, but she can't put much away since her full-time $12 an hour job barely covers the bills. She sounded a little sad at how much she's been able to save, and it made me want to be able to do something greater than my own salary allows me to contribute to the account--I want to surprise her and put a big smile on her face by putting a lump sum of $4000 into the college savings account for my little brothers.</p>
<p>A little background, she's a widow of almost 2 years and regularly works 14 hour shifts to provide for my little brothers (we lost my dad to cancer after a long two year battle). She's an amazing person and always thinks of her kids before herself. She's been worrying a lot lately because she doesn't want my brothers to have to go into debt like I did to get a college education. The impact this will have on how she feels about how much is saved for their education and on my little brothers' future education will be huge!</p>
<p>I've set a fundraising $4,000 goal because I think that, given the number of amazing people out there, it is a reachable goal. I also think it would make an amazing late birthday present for her.</p>
<p>If you can't afford a donation, you can still help me by posting it on someone's wall, sharing it on a blog, or blasting it on your status! Indiegogo has all sorts of ways to share the information. Please help me reach my goal, and thanks for supporting my family! </p>

This project also includes a teacher training center that will allow for other schools to have their teachers trained by Education Africa.  In this way, the benefit of our school is not limited to only the students attending the school.



What We Need & What You Get
The schoolhouse will cost ultimately around $150,000.  We are looking to reach a minimum of $50,000 here on indiegogo.com within the next two months.  This money covers only materials and permits.  The labor to build the crèche is all volunteer (30 eager students and 10 local African laborers), and the travel cost will all be covered by the volunteers as well.  We are very fortunate to also have the support of alumni of the CUSD program, the school, and family and friends.

<p>We are the York University Rover Team (YURT), a group of enthusiastic York students from a wide range of disciplines all working towards a common goal: to build and develop a prototypical rover platform to compete in <strong>NASA's Lunabotics Mining Competition, Mars Society's University Rover Challenge (URC)</strong>, and <strong>CSii's Robotics Competition</strong>. So what's a rover? Well, it's basically a robot that you send to outer space for exploration purposes. Cool, right?</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, this is our fifth year competing in the University Rover Challenge. We have made our mark at this competition by placing on the podium every year we've competed against other remarkable teams from around the world. At URC, the idea is to build a Mars rover that can one day work alongside human explorers in space. The rover has to complete a series of simulated tasks in the Utah desert such as delivering rescue packages to lost astronauts, fixing a broken equipment panel, finding signs of life and site surveying. On the other hand, this is our very first try at NASA's Lunabotics competition which focuses on building a Lunar rover capable of mining soil on the moon, and our second time at CSii's Robotics Competition which showcases young innovators of today. URC will be held May 31-June 2 at the Mars Desert Research Station, NASA's Lunabotics Competition will be held on May 21-26 at the Kennedy Space Centre, Florida; and CSii's Robotics Competition will be held July 9-10 at the Deerhurst Resort, Ontario.</p>
<p>We are a fully student-ran project and during the school year, our team dedicates countless time, effort, and sweat outside of the classroom into researching, building, and programming our rover in addition to fundraising and public outreach projects. Being part of the team provides us with a very unique hands-on experience unlike any other. It helps us appreciate more of what we learned at the university and even learn skills that are not taught in the classroom. Many of us who went on the trip to Utah last year agreed that it was definitely one of the best experiences of our lifetime and we hope to go again this year for a championship title at all three competitions!</p>
<p>So far, through the generous support of our university and the hard work of our team members, we have been able to build a competitive rover that's versatile enough for the three competitions. However, the biggest problem is: in order to travel from Toronto to Florida, then to Utah and back to Toronto again, it will cost us an estimated $15 000. We are not far from our goal, but we need your help to make this last step! Ideally, we would like to attend the three competitions and take about 15 members but if we cannot raise the sufficient funds, we will have to drop out of one of the competitions or take fewer members. This would be very painful for our team as a lot of time, energy, and money has been invested in this project and all that would be for nothing! :( So please help us in making our dream a reality! :)</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>When we are not busy with the rover, we have been actively participating in public outreach projects such as Robots Rule and Go Eng Girl at the Ontario Science Center, Science Rendezvous at York University, weekly presentations to local high schools, and many more! We want to let the world know what is out there for students interested in science and engineering, to inspire, and to show youth of today what students are capable of with passion and a love for learning.</p>
<p>So besides donating money, you can also help by spreading the word about our team and help us inspire others:) ""Like"" us on facebook, follow us on twitter, visit our website, or tell a friend or two!</p>

So far, through the generous support of our university and the hard work of our team members, we have been able to build a competitive rover that's versatile enough for the three competitions. However, the biggest problem is: in order to travel from Toronto to Florida, then to Utah and back to Toronto again, it will cost us an estimated $15 000. We are not far from our goal, but we need your help to make this last step! Ideally, we would like to attend the three competitions and take about 15 members but if we cannot raise the sufficient funds, we will have to drop out of one of the competitions or take fewer members. This would be very painful for our team as a lot of time, energy, and money has been invested in this project and all that would be for nothing! :( So please help us in making our dream a reality! :)
Other Ways You Can Help
When we are not busy with the rover, we have been actively participating in public outreach projects such as Robots Rule and Go Eng Girl at the Ontario Science Center, Science Rendezvous at York University, weekly presentations to local high schools, and many more! We want to let the world know what is out there for students interested in science and engineering, to inspire, and to show youth of today what students are capable of with passion and a love for learning.
So besides donating money, you can also help by spreading the word about our team and help us inspire others:) ""Like"" us on facebook, follow us on twitter, visit our website, or tell a friend or two!
 
Thank you for taking the time to read up about us. We really appreciate your support!

farmer and a scientist. Some of you may remember me from my 2011 <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/marcin_jakubowski?language=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ted Talk</a> where
I expressed my frustration with my newly earned Ph.D. in fusion physics from Princeton
University and its lack of relevance in solving real world issues. I also spoke about how shortly after my Ph.D. epiphany, I started a farm and set out to create a series of open source blueprints to create a civilization from scratch.</span></p><p>For those who don’t know me,
I am the founder and director of Open Source Ecology (OSE), a non-profit organization
dedicated to creating open source solutions for the advancement of humanity. We are also a creative lab and learning institute. By using open source protocols we have been developing The Global Village Construction Set  or (GVCS). GVCS is an
open sourced hardware project that consists of the 50 machines required to
build a civilization from the ground up. Machines that are a fraction of the cost of the major brand versions which are built to last for a lifetime of use unlike the models that have planned obsolescence incorporated in their design.   </p>
<p>We have been busy at OSE over the past 5 years since that Ted Talk and
have made excellent progress with the GVCS. One of the things we have learned along the way is that we can create the maximum disruption and help the most amount of people if we applied our open source hardware tools and principles to housing. So we did, and we achieved amazing results in the process. So much so, that my wife, Catarina Mota started The Open Building Institute, which is an open source, sustainable and ecological approach towards home construction. </p><p>In the last few years we have developed a high quality, robust, eco-friendly, sustainable, extremely affordable home that can be built just about anywhere in the world using locally sourced materials. Our current prototype is a 700 sq ft starter seed home with greenhouse which is modular by design and could be increased in size as the homeowners need for space or budget grows. </p><p>The base cost of the home including materials and labor is around $35,000 (not including land). To put these figures in perspective, the <a href=""http://www.fixr.com/costs/build-single-family-house"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">national average</a> cost for new construction is $125 per sq ft and our average construction cost comes in at well under half that at $50 per sq ft. <br/></p><p>Because our validation process was so successful with open source home construction, we are inviting the world to continue to help us further develop this exciting concept. Our goal is to improve upon our designs through trial and error – organize the information – and then make it available to the world as a free resource for anyone to use. <br/></p><h4>Open Source Eco-Toolkit </h4><p>Our <a href=""http://openbuildinginstitute.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>open source eco-building toolkit</b></a>  is designed to make the construction of ecological housing easier, cheaper, faster, higher quality—and put it within the reach of everyone. </p><p>The OBI toolkit is entirely open source—free to use and modify—and will enable anyone to:</p><ul>
<li>Design a house and/or greenhouse—that respects the planet and can be
 expanded as your needs and family grow—using a library of modules that 
fit together like building blocks</li>
<li>Learn how to build with instructionals and training programs</li>
<li>Organize the rapid-build of a house loaded with ecological features</li>
</ul><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472556561/OSE_4_pic_ijbfai.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Through a series of experimental builds over the past few years, we 
learned that it is possible to construct a modular starter home—with an 
attached aquaponic greenhouse and loaded with ecological features—for 
under $25k in materials and in as little as 5 days.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472556684/OSE_igg_image_prpw8c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We already have a lot of work in place, but there is much more to do.

<p><b>The process in a nutshell:</b></p>
<p>1) We started by creating an <b><a href=""http://openbuildinginstitute.org/library-modules/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open source library of modules</a></b>—construction
 parts that can be put together like building blocks—along with guides 
for design, building and development. You can download a collection of 
walls, roofs, doors and windows and design a complete, buildable 
structure. Imagine having all the tools you need to design your own 
house and/or greenhouse easily and for free! You can also choose from a 
variety of house models contributed by designers around the world.</p>

<blockquote><i>Aquaponic Greenhouse at the Factor E Farm in Maysville, Mo</i></blockquote>
<p><i>Our attached aquaponic greenhouse provides passive solar heating and year-round food production.  Our greenhouse is quite unique and supports a diverse range of food sources, not just leafy vegetables.  It is also designed to produce super-foods such as spirulina, mushrooms, small fruit, and proteins like fish, chickens and eggs, which all tie into a unique symbiotic ecosystem. We have even integrated an ecological pest management system that serves many other purposes too. To learn more about our aquaponic greenhouse design and features <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35S5BNvRCqE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></i></p>
<p><i>The quality and durability of our homes is an area of focus as well. By using our compressed earth block construction our homes walls are 1 foot thick solid block which creates a high R value keeping heating and cooling costs down to a minimum. Our compressed earth blocks are also fire proof, insect resistant, mold proof, bullet proof , hurricane &amp; tornado proof, sound resistant, and will stand for 1000 years if left uninterupted.  All the material needed to make the CEB  for construction is already on the property.  For more on the benefits of CEB construction  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuQB3x4ZNeA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></i></p>

<blockquote>Compressed Earth Blocks at the Factor E Farm in Maysville, Mo</blockquote>5) Given that not everyone wants to build their own house, we’re also developing a <b>training</b>
 program for builders—who will then be able to kick off their own

<h3>A Modular Building System</h3>
<p>The library is entirely open source, which means that not only you 
can use it for free, but also that the designs themselves are 
contributed by volunteer designers. We’re also crowdsourcing building 
designs so you can have a wide variety of complete structures to choose 
from if you don’t want to design your own. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472592885/OSE_vid_1_wyczbu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Contributions by designers around the world also mean that the library 
will be capable of addressing a variety of location-specific 
requirements (such as climate, availability of materials, and cultural 
specificities). That’s why we love open source!</div><div>

<p>A 700 sq ft starter home costs approximately US$25k in materials. An 
expandable 225 sq ft home (what we call a seed home), loaded with 
ecological features, costs approximately $12k in materials, and each 225
 square foot addition—with an additional 600 Watt of photovoltaics—costs
 about $5k in materials. This assumes materials are bought readily from a
 big box store.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472593355/OSE_IGG_costs_yrsttk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This cost assumes a DIY build, but our build model—for taking this to a 
much larger audience beyond the 10% of owner builders—involves hiring a 
trained OBI builder who can organize a build party for a 5 day build of a
 700 square foot home. We are expecting to develop and deliver a price 
structure such that turnkey service will cost the owner $10k on top of 
the materials cost. The labor is included in the apprentice training of 
people participating in the build.<br/>

<h3>Rapid Builds, Social Production</h3>
<p>Through our building experiences—and based on OSE’s extreme 
manufacturing methodology—we developed a formula for rapid builds. It’s 
deceptively simple: a large group of people build a large number of 
modules, in parallel, and then assembles them rapidly into a building. 
Using these techniques, we were able to build—from raw materials—an 
entire 800 sq ft greenhouse in just 5 days.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472593566/OSE_greenhouse_towers_gyrkpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This process can be replicated by a contracted crew or a group of family
 and friends. But, to date, our preferred method has been social 
production. In our particular application, this means that we use builds
 as training opportunities by treating the builds as immersion 
workshops. During these workshops, participants become familiar with the
 building system and acquire hands-on experience—while building a 
structure.<br/>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472593678/OSE_ceb_walls_2_esp97g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Revenue from workshop tuition helps offset the cost of building 
materials for the hosts. In turn, all workshop participants are 
encouraged to host their own build-workshops. Like the library, all 
workshop organization materials are open source and freely available—so 
everyone can replicate this model if they want to.<br/><p></p><h3>Who We Are</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472593825/OSE_M_C_ej23wk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We are Marcin Jakubowski (founder of Open Source Ecology), Catarina Mota

<h3>Why Housing?</h3>
<p>We started Open Building Institute to address the issues surrounding housing for several reasons. Housing is a basic human need and is something that everyone can relate with because we all need a roof over our head. Housing costs also tend to make up a persons largest fiduciary responsibility. We wanted to apply open source methods and protocols to change this dynamic. Housing costs are only one of the issues we are trying to address with our initiative because there are other challenges depending on what part of the world we look at.</p>
<p>For people in less developed countries, there is a lack of access to technology, knowledge and resources required to build an affordable eco-friendly quality home. In addition to that, global population growth is exploding in these same countries causing billions of people to need shelter in the coming years and it's important that we approach this challenge in a smart sustainable way. </p>
<p>For people in developed countries, owning a home is expensive, and requires most homeowners to encumber a life of debt, debt that is rarely ever paid off while living in home because interest payments are front loaded through the banks amortization schedules. This perpetual debt is like a a ball and chain that follow us through life and only serves to keep homeowners away from their home, (and family) busy at work trying to satisfy one of their largest monthly obligations which is their mortgage. It is our mission to offer high quality alternative solutions to this dilemma.</p>
<h3>Why Food?</h3>
<p>Another issue we wanted to address with our initiative was self sufficiency. Although we have addressed this in many ways with the homes numerous eco features, we felt that food production was such an important fundamental aspect of self sustainability that we needed to integrate food production into our modules. As with housing, food is a basic human need and makes up a significant portion of our yearly expenditures. Lack of access to healthy and nutritional food affects people in many different ways as well.</p>
<p>People in under-developed countries are frequently confronted with a daily battle of caloric intake, and in many cases, those are the lucky ones. There are over <a href=""https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">700 million people</a> in the world that suffer from undernourishment  and over <a href=""https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3 million children</a> die every year due to poor nutrition. </p>
<p>There are also millions of people in developed countries who have no other option but to eat cheap, processed, low nutrition food because they are  unable to afford quality food sources. This is one of the reasons we conduct our aquaponics workshops and have added this life sustaining component to our library of modules. Our aquaponic system can provide enough vegetables and protein to feed a family of six year round.  </p>
<h3>A New Paradigm Is Within Reach</h3>
<p>Imagine a life with little to no mortgage payments. utility costs or food bills. The average person spends almost 60% of their income on those three items alone. What if you could cut those numbers in half? What would you do with your time if you didn't have to spend it all working to keep these exorbitant costs satisfied every month? Or what would you do with the savings? This is not some far off pipe dream but a real possibility – right now. More people are coming to the realization that time is their most valuable asset and although we have an abundance of technology, is it really being properly utilized to create a better quality of life for us? One could argue that the introduction of more technology has only complicated our lives. Our housing initiative was created to be directly applied towards creating a better quality of life. We want to offer a way for people to have more time to do what they want to. Simply put, our model is designed to circumvent traditional housings constraining ways and provide a new housing paradigm (and lifestyle) for all who want it. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<h3>How It Began</h3>
<p>For several years now, Open Source Ecology (OSE) has been working on 
the Global Village Construction Set—a set of 50 industrial machines for 
building civilization from scratch. A lot has happened since OSE's 
successful Kickstarter in 2011. More recently, OSE established a 
partnership with a new open source project—the Open Building Institute 
(OBI)—to apply its GVCS machines to modular housing. The goal of this 
partnership is to make ecological housing accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>The project began when we—Marcin and Catarina—got married and 
realized our Missouri farmhouse was too small for two people. We had a 
very specific idea of what we wanted our home to be: comfortable and 
affordable, rapidly built from local materials, expandable (so we can 
add new rooms as the need arises), off-grid, and capable of generating 
its own energy and food.</p>
<p>We realized that this house didn’t exist yet—so we set out to design 
and build it ourselves. The process began in late 2013 with a 
microhouse—a 144 sq ft tiny house. To this we then added a bedroom, a 
mud room, a porch, a library/work space, an office, another bathroom, a 
utility room, and an aquaponic greenhouse. Together, these structures 
form a 2100 sq ft living and working space at Factor e Farm (Missouri, 
USA).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472644846/OSE_library_1b_rfbgen.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Throughout this process, and after much trial and error, we arrived at 
formula that makes building a house easier, faster and cheaper. On our 
latest build—an aquaponic greenhouse—a team of 35 (mostly inexperienced)
 participants built an entire 800 sq ft greenhouse from raw materials—in
 5 days—for $6,000 in materials. This build included not only the 
structure itself, but also two 1500 gallons fish ponds, 1 chicken coop, 
85 aquaponic towers, 2 compost grow beds, 6 mushroom grow towers, 1 
aquatic worm system, 1 BSF breeding system, and 3 hydronic radiators.<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472644931/OSE_greenhouse_vephp7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We realized that this approach—a combination of modular designs with 
rapid build techniques, social production, local materials, and open 
source machines—has the potential to make eco-house building widely 
accessible. But it was not easy. We have to make it easier. That’s what 
this campaign is about: turning our experiment into something everyone 
else can benefit from and participate in.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>We recognize that not everybody wants to build their own house. To 
address that, we’re creating an intensive training program—so you have 
an option to hire an OBI builder, if you want. </p>
<p>This program will be a real deep dive into construction: from design 
and materials production to rapid-build organization and 
business—including building the construction machines themselves, which 
we can do in a single day.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the program, these trainees are expected to start 
their own building enterprises to provide building services to those who
 don’t want to build themselves.</p>
<p>The goal is to not only help train a growing number of open source, 
regenerative builders, but also to encourage entrepreneurship and seed 
the replication of many similar facilities worldwide. Like everything 
else in this project, all training materials are open source. Everyone 
is free—in fact, encouraged—to use those materials to launch their own 
training program and enterprise.</p>
<p>The initial training program is set to launch in 2017 with 2 to 4 
trainees. And then double this number annually until we reach an 
enrollment of 24 students—from which point we intend to scale operations
 to other locations. </p>
<p>We need your help to spread our initiative to the broader world. We are seeking builders for collaboration and participation in our initiative. <br/></p>
<h3>Materials Production</h3>
<p>And it gets even better. Imagine being able to source most of your 
building materials from 50 miles around your build site. This is exactly
 what we’re aiming for with a solar-powered Materials Production 
Facility capable of producing compressed earth blocks, lumber, 
insulation, paint, glazing, and lime concrete—from local soil, 
limestone, hay and trees—using open source machines.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472645187/OSE_materials_facility_fv8utw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This facility will be open to the public, so that anyone who is 
interested in using local building materials has an option to produce 
their own materials. In our usual fashion of re-skilling and educating, 
we will provide people with both theoretical training and practice. This
 allows people to provide sweat equity in producing their own building 
materials, while gaining an appreciation of nature through the 
stewardship of natural resources. We will also provide turnkey materials
 for those who do not have the time or interest in sweat equity.</p>
<p>The Materials Facility highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>20kW of solar electricity powers the brick press, sawmill, mixers, lime burner, hammermill, 3D printer, and pelletizer.</li>
<li>Stabilized CEB block production—which has about 8x less embodied energy than fired brick.</li>
<li>Lumber production, with byproducts of sawdust and wood pellets.</li>
<li>Production of pelletized biochar from pellets to produce soil 
amendment and machine fuel (with gasifier engines), while co-generating 
burned lime in the process.</li>
<li>Large format 3D printer for producing multi-wall polycarbonate greenhouse glazing from scrap plastic.</li>
<li>Burning of lime to make carbon-neutral concrete from local limestone.</li>
<li>Production of bio-fiber insulation from recycled newspaper and biomass feedstocks.</li>
<li>Production of heating and feed pellets from biomass feedstocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our unique approach is that of ecology—combining as many features 
into a whole as possible—to arrive at harmonious existence of humans and
 nature.</p>
<p>The initial operation of this facility is scheduled for late 2017 
with further expansion planned for 2018. The goal is to provide detailed
 open source documentation for all aspects of this facility (all the 
machines, building, layout and processes) so it can be replicated and 
adapted all over the world—make local building materials available 
everywhere.</p>
<h3>Challenges + Collaborative Development</h3>
<p>By now, you’re probably thinking “These people are crazy! How are 
they going to do all this?” Well, we have a secret sauce: it’s called 
open source. It simply wouldn't be possible for our little core team to 
undertake this project without any additional help. But we’re not alone.
 Just like Linux is developed by thousands of programmers around the 
world, we believe we can all get together to fix housing.</p>
<p>All the work we did in the past years—both on machinery and housing—has relied heavily on hundreds of contributions from <a href=""http://openbuildinginstitute.org/about-who-we-are/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">advisors and volunteers</a> who
 believe, like we do, that we should join efforts to make things better 
for everyone. And now we’re taking this collaborative approach to the 
next level. One of the core goals of this Kickstarter is to develop a 
common platform for submitting new designs and improvements to the 
system. We will host Design Challenges as well. </p>
<p>That’s why we’re inviting everyone to join this common platform by 
submitting new designs and improvements to the system. In addition to a 
standing-invitation to contribute to the library, we’re also hosting 
design contests—starting with a callout to design the 700 sq ft 
expandable home that we’ll build at our headquarters this November.</p>
<p>Given the scope of the project, we’re also gathering an amazing group
 of advisors—from world-renowned architects and high-tech engineers to 
business and organizational experts—who have committed to providing 
expertise on all areas of the project. Check out our <a href=""http://openbuildinginstitute.org/about-who-we-are/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Advisory Team</a>.</p>
<p><b>Building Codes and Regulations </b></p>
<p>Compliance with regulations is one of the requirements of the 
project, just as it is for any standard house. That’s why we’re working 
with experienced architects to: 1) ensure that all our modules comply 
with the International Building Code; and 2) produce sufficient 
documentation (calculations, plans, construction details drawings, 
design rationale, etc.) to enable builders to apply for the necessary 
permits in their area of residence. We also intend to have each module 
design stamped by a licensed engineer, as well as provide several 
complete house models with all regulatory aspects worked out in detail. 
To get there, we are recruiting an army of advisors on all the technical
 details—one of them being compliance, and other being real estate law -
 to help people navigate legal hurdles surrounding land acquisition and 
tenure. </p>
<p>Further, since code compliance is a complicated and scary issue for 
most people, we are preparing a special webinar on Code Compliance. The 
key to successful code negotiation starts with a first-principles 
literacy of general concepts, and then moves to specific quantitative 
requirements. Codes are our friends if we understand them—and as such, 
our goal for this Webinar is to foster basic Building Code Literacy—so 
that seemingly inane regulations are converted into a human 
understandable form. </p>
<p>Given that regulations and procedures vary from region to region, we 
will also crowd-source a database of regulation-related documents that 
can support the construction of select OBI house models in many 
different areas around the world. </p>
<p>The autonomous and modular nature of the system also allows for a large level of flexibility towards meeting codes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Because our system is modular, it is highly flexible in the 
implementation that it can take. For example: “So, the separating toilet
 with biodigester doesn’t meet code?” The solution is simple: we swap 
out the toilet module, which is designed as a swappable platform, and 
replace it with a regular one. Or, the flattish roof does not meet snow 
load requirements in Northern Canada? Ok, we add another roof module 
(which is stackable like a sandwich), and we have now doubled snow load 
capacity. And so on. </li>
<li>This modularity applies to parts of modules as well: if some part is
 inadequate—such as a structural member not being strong enough—we can 
replace it with one that is. The system allows this in general. </li>
<li>Modularity applies clearly to wall sections, which are typically 4x8
 panels. These may be CEB and weigh over one ton, or standard stick 
framing and weigh 100 lb. You can stack these in multiples—or you can 
modify the materials used to scale their thickness. You can make larger 
wall cavities for insulation to meet the requirements of northern 
climates. You can substitute the materials and, for example, build 
panels out of bamboo, strawboard, or hempcrete. </li>
<li>The modularity of the OBI system also allows for full control over 
room and house dimensions—to meet size, ceiling height, or any other 
constraints related to geometry. House too small to meet zoning 
minimums? Add a module and the house now meets this part of the 
regulations. House too large to meet code? Downsize by removing a number
 of modules. </li>
<li>Off-grid design provides great flexibility. As long as you are not 
connected to water, electricity, or gas—essentially by living in an 
autonomous house—many options open up as far as where you can build or 
stay. In some places, code jurisdiction works on the basis of, for 
example, “Sewer system requirements” or “electrical hookup 
requirements.” If you are not hooked up to a sewer or electricity, the 
rules may not apply to you. </li>
<li>For multiple house developments, special use cases may be obtained 
as Planned Unit Developments. Variances to ordinances may also be 
sought. </li>
<li>You don’t like regulations at all? You can build a structure that is
 small enough to escape code jurisdiction all together. Or, in later 
phases of the project (2018 and later), when we design mobile 
structures, put the house on wheels and you are no longer under housing 
code jurisdiction, but vehicle code jurisdiction. </li>
<li>Can’t afford the size required to meet zoning regulations? Build a shell structure, like <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/incrementalhousing/WUF-Rio/pdfs/CHILE-Greene.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alejandro Aravena’s incremental housing</a>
 and add to it as resources allow.
Really, really hate dealing with regulatory institutions? You may be 
glad to know that there are no building regulations—not even a building 
department—in parts of Missouri (US) and Chad, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put: the system modularity allows immediate substitution of 
different parts to address compliance, making the regulations issue no 
different than for any other type of more standard house. And, due to 
the flexibility of modular construction, you as the builder have a great
 amount of code negotiating power. </p>
<p><b>Land Access </b></p>
<p>We have learned that while codes may be negotiated, there’s only a 
finite supply of land. In the USA, the situation is good as land is 
widely available —with farmland going for $2-8k per acre, and building 
lots as low as $10k in many cities. In Europe and elsewhere, farmland is
 $2-25k per acre. In India, prices are exploding. The question of land 
tenure, and the unequal access to land and resources is beyond the scope
 of this project. However, our work aims to increase individuals’ 
ability to convert abundant natural resources into lifestuff that frees 
people from material constraints—our fundamental formula for freedom. We
 believe that only by balancing human activity with regenerative 
resource use can prosperity happen for all—hence our quest for 
regenerative housing integrated with natural life support systems. </p>
<h3><b>Current State, Funding, and Roadmap </b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The current state of the project is: <br/>We have built a number of 
modular home prototypes and additions between 2013-2015 - as well as the
 800 square foot aquaponic greenhouse. We are testing these now. </li>
<li>In 2016, we will build building an expandable, replicable Starter 
Home with an aquaponic greenhouse addition  - based on learnings from 
the 2013-2015 builds. This design is not done. </li>
<li>House and other building designs will be crowdsourced via Design 
Challenges - to be launched after this Kickstarter campaign achieves its
 funding goal. The design work involves: (1) working out some module 
interface details, (2) designing new utility/appliance modules, and (3) 
designing the overall composition of the house. </li>
</ul>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will fund the necessary steps to make our building system widely replicable: </p>
<ul>
<li>Further development of all the system components, so that each is a 
fully engineered and documented module - usable in any model of a 
Starter Home. The goal by July 2018 is to develop all the modules 
necessary to build a Living Building Challenge compliant home, at a 
reasonable cost. </li>
<li>Next iteration build and testing of the Starter Home with aquaponic greenhouse. Our next build is November, 2016. </li>
<li>Creation of an immersion training program for builders. </li>
<li>Development of open source enterprise curriculum for designing and 
building modular housing as a service, including how to produce local 
materials using open source machines. </li>
<li>Development of a robust crowd design platform for submitting new designs and developments to the building system. </li>
<li>Build of the solar powered materials production facility—so that 
most of the house building materials can be sourced from within 50 miles
 of the build site. This facility will be open to the public for 
production and training. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these funds do not cover the various supporting machines for 
construction and materials production -  nor does it cover numerous 
other structure builds that are in our timeline below but not in the 
funding scope above. These will be funded by proceeds from our immersion
 workshops - a funding model that we have used to fund various machine 
builds for the last 2 years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472645512/OSE_2_yr_roadmap_huidpv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>While the development is high risk in general because of the level of
 innovation, the rewards have been selected first and foremost based on 
things that we can deliver.</p>
<p>Making things is hard. We realize that.</p>
<p>We've spent the past years developing the technology and process for 
building things rapidly and efficiently. We have established a network 
of advisors - where we have learned that subject matter experts are the 
strongest point of an open development process. Such expertise allows us
 to download information in hours - which would otherwise take months or
 years to develop. So while we have ambitious goals on the product level
 - none of the technology we are putting into practice is new. The 
challenge revolves around the rapid learning and integration that is 
required - which is a question of operations and management. </p>
<p>We understand the huge difference between vision and execution. We 
have world class business advisors on our team - as we know that the 
difference between an idea and global impact is that of enterprise 
development. All of our work relies on business innovation using 
inovative social production processes - so naturally, there is a 
tremendous amount of risk involved </p>
<p>At the same time, we have been building heavy machines on a day 
timescale, and building structures on 5 day time scales. We are well 
versed in Extreme Manufacturing - and the next challenge is whether we 
can teach others how to do the same. We know that we can build crazy 
things on rapid timescales - but the question of impact means (1) how 
effectively we can teach; and (2) how quickly we attain and exceed 
industry standard metrics of quality.</p>
<p>Our training program will be a crash course indeed. Curriculum 
development and a pilot training program are a way to learn what parts 
of our training program work. We will accept 2-4 students in 2017, and 
we aim to double our enrollment yearly until we reach 24 students. This 
means that access to a turnkey OBI building service - relies on the 
success of our teaching program - as otherwise the barriers to entry 
appear too high. </p>
<p>We have work to do on the quality aspect - which is the core of the 
technical development that we are seeking to fund. We have already shown
 that average people can participate in complex builds - without needing
 trade skills. We have also been developing quality control protocols - 
starting with design-for-manufacturing - and standards quality control 
checklists throughout the build process.</p>
<p>Because this work is an integration of features not found in any 
other single project - we live at the bleeding edge of integration - 
which has inherent risks. While it is commonly understood that you can 
have only two of the three product features: quality, cost, and speed - 
we are challenging this assumption. We are breaking through the quality 
barrier by tapping top subject matter expertise, incentivized as a 
contribution to the common good. </p>
<p>Modular Design: The challenge of any modular system is interface 
design - and we respect this point. We have had several years of 
experience in building modular machines, and are now applying the same 
principles to modular housing. The interface details in the current 
system need work, as they are difficult: we are breaking large builds 
into small parts - thereby introducing a number of interfaces that need 
to be sealed. Our insight on this point is careful navigation of Depth 
of Modularity. This means that if a certain interface does not work, we 
make specialized parts - or move the modularity either up or down in the
 design hierarchy. We have learned to be flexible with interfaces - or 
if an interface does not work well - we are comfortable getting rid of 
that interface or otherwise changing. Our result is a hybrid and 
flexible system - where we are not afraid to eliminate modularity when 
it simply does not work. At the same time, we have build modular 
electrical and plumbing sections - and we think that we have only 
scratched the surface of what is possible.</p>
<p>Development Time and Scope: We have promised ambitious products over 
an ambitious 2 year time scale, and a major risk is the mere scope of 
the technologies. While all of the technologies are proven, our 
innovation is the opensourcing or publishing of the technologies to make
 them accessible at cost - sidestepping the cost of expensive expertise.
 The Starter Home that we will build in November, 2016 - contains a 
large number of proven technological features - which we are promising 
at breakthrough cost - by publishing the technical expertise required to
 accomplish the build of  - availing otherwise expensive expertise for 
free to the world. So far we have been quite successful in attracting 
the necessary subject matter experts to provide the supporting technical
 information. The key to success is finding several more experts who are
 willing to share cutting edge know-how. The time of 4 months from the 
start of the campaign to the first build - is short, though we have a 
large base of prior modular build experience that we are building upon. 
And 15 months to the more ambitious Living Building Challenge build - 
and the 1 year time scale to the Materials Production Facility -means 
that we are compressing the documentation of just about all human 
knowledge related to construction - into making it fully accessible in 2
 years. That is extremely ambitious - but the idea is that a proper 
world-class expert can bring us up to speed to the most cutting edge 
practice in a matter of months. We will continue to ask our supporters 
and collaborators to feed us suggestions on who are the best people to 
ask - meaning people who are not only world-class experts - but who are 
willing to share their most precious knowledge openly. That is a rare 
combination - and while we have been successful at this to date - this 
is still a major risk.</p>
<p>Immersion Training: Our training program is essentially a 6 month 
crash course - and it is not for the light-hearted. We are seeking 
exceptional individuals. It is yet to be determined whether 6 months is 
sufficient time for people to learn the required organizational, design,
 build, and enterprise skills. Our pilot project will determine the 
feasibility.</p>
<p>Immersion Training Curriculum: The training curriculum requires the 
input from many diverse areas, and collecting all this knowledge will be
 done by inviting subject matter experts to contribute to the 
curriculum, focusing on open source product design and engineering. 
Managing this curriculum development is a large task, and will require 
significant organizational learning on OBI's side. We have run short 
courses and summer programs before, and our background is in education -
 so we feel  qualified to execute.</p>
<p>Business Development - We are still experimenting with an innovative 
and sound economic model. There isn't a good precedent for the 
education/production hybrid model that we are developing. We are relying
 on top business growth advisors, such as Cameron Herold, to help us 
refine and solidify this approach.</p>
<p>Living Building Challenge (LBC) Certification - This is the world's 
most stringent regenerative design certification, and it will no doubt 
be a challenge to deliver. Not in terms of features - but cost - for 
which our answer is developing the required technology (building 
materials and functional modules) in house. Further,  Bob Berkebile, LBC
 co-founder,  joined our team of advisors.</p>
<p>We're in this for the long run. This means that we may not get 
immediate results - but also - that we will not give up trying. It is 
well known that success is attained in just about all cases where 
perseverance is present. The downside may be that it may take longer 
than expected. From our track record - we have in just about all cases 
attained results better than expected when it comes to new techniques 
and technologies - though the speed with which we get there was 
typically nonlinear (unpredictable). We commit to be forthright and very
 transparent - with ongoing reporting, vlogging and updates about 
results - both the things that work and which don't.</p>

</div></div>","The Open Building Institute (OBI)Hello Indiegogo, my name is Marcin Jakubowski and I am a
farmer and a scientist. Some of you may remember me from my 2011 Ted Talk where
I expressed my frustration with my newly earned Ph.D. in fusion physics from Princeton
University and its lack of relevance in solving real world issues. I also spoke about how shortly after my Ph.D. epiphany, I started a farm and set out to create a series of open source blueprints to create a civilization from scratch.For those who don’t know me,
I am the founder and director of Open Source Ecology (OSE), a non-profit organization
dedicated to creating open source solutions for the advancement of humanity. We are also a creative lab and learning institute. By using open source protocols we have been developing The Global Village Construction Set  or (GVCS). GVCS is an
open sourced hardware project that consists of the 50 machines required to
build a civilization from the ground up. Machines that are a fraction of the cost of the major brand versions which are built to last for a lifetime of use unlike the models that have planned obsolescence incorporated in their design.   
We have been busy at OSE over the past 5 years since that Ted Talk and
have made excellent progress with the GVCS. One of the things we have learned along the way is that we can create the maximum disruption and help the most amount of people if we applied our open source hardware tools and principles to housing. So we did, and we achieved amazing results in the process. So much so, that my wife, Catarina Mota started The Open Building Institute, which is an open source, sustainable and ecological approach towards home construction. In the last few years we have developed a high quality, robust, eco-friendly, sustainable, extremely affordable home that can be built just about anywhere in the world using locally sourced materials. Our current prototype is a 700 sq ft starter seed home with greenhouse which is modular by design and could be increased in size as the homeowners need for space or budget grows. The base cost of the home including materials and labor is around $35,000 (not including land). To put these figures in perspective, the national average cost for new construction is $125 per sq ft and our average construction cost comes in at well under half that at $50 per sq ft. Because our validation process was so successful with open source home construction, we are inviting the world to continue to help us further develop this exciting concept. Our goal is to improve upon our designs through trial and error – organize the information – and then make it available to the world as a free resource for anyone to use. Open Source Eco-Toolkit Our open source eco-building toolkit  is designed to make the construction of ecological housing easier, cheaper, faster, higher quality—and put it within the reach of everyone. The OBI toolkit is entirely open source—free to use and modify—and will enable anyone to:
Design a house and/or greenhouse—that respects the planet and can be
 expanded as your needs and family grow—using a library of modules that 
fit together like building blocks
Learn how to build with instructionals and training programs
Organize the rapid-build of a house loaded with ecological features


Through a series of experimental builds over the past few years, we 
learned that it is possible to construct a modular starter home—with an 
attached aquaponic greenhouse and loaded with ecological features—for 
under $25k in materials and in as little as 5 days.We already have a lot of work in place, but there is much more to do. We
 are coming to you for help to further refine this toolkit and make it 
(more) accessible to everyone.
How it Works


The process in a nutshell:
1) We started by creating an open source library of modules—construction
 parts that can be put together like building blocks—along with guides 
for design, building and development. You can download a collection of 
walls, roofs, doors and windows and design a complete, buildable 
structure. Imagine having all the tools you need to design your own 
house and/or greenhouse easily and for free! You can also choose from a 
variety of house models contributed by designers around the world.



Just an example: a simple studio designed with OBI's modules library.
2) The modular system, combined with a formula for rapid builds, makes it possible for a large group of (mostly inexperienced) people to then build this house in as little as 5 days.

3) Builds can be executed by a contracted crew, a group of friends and relatives, or using a social production model. In this social production model, builds are structured as educational experiences and take place in the context of training workshops.

4) The library also includes designs and instructionals for a number of eco-features—from solar power, water catchment and compressed earth blocks to biogas, hydronic heating, and bio-insulation.

Aquaponic Greenhouse at the Factor E Farm in Maysville, Mo
Our attached aquaponic greenhouse provides passive solar heating and year-round food production.  Our greenhouse is quite unique and supports a diverse range of food sources, not just leafy vegetables.  It is also designed to produce super-foods such as spirulina, mushrooms, small fruit, and proteins like fish, chickens and eggs, which all tie into a unique symbiotic ecosystem. We have even integrated an ecological pest management system that serves many other purposes too. To learn more about our aquaponic greenhouse design and features click here.
The quality and durability of our homes is an area of focus as well. By using our compressed earth block construction our homes walls are 1 foot thick solid block which creates a high R value keeping heating and cooling costs down to a minimum. Our compressed earth blocks are also fire proof, insect resistant, mold proof, bullet proof , hurricane & tornado proof, sound resistant, and will stand for 1000 years if left uninterupted.  All the material needed to make the CEB  for construction is already on the property.  For more on the benefits of CEB construction  click here.

 program for builders—who will then be able to kick off their own 
enterprises providing construction services to those who don’t want to 
build themselves.

A Modular Building System
The library is entirely open source, which means that not only you 
can use it for free, but also that the designs themselves are 
contributed by volunteer designers. We’re also crowdsourcing building 
designs so you can have a wide variety of complete structures to choose 
from if you don’t want to design your own. 

Contributions by designers around the world also mean that the library 
will be capable of addressing a variety of location-specific 
requirements (such as climate, availability of materials, and cultural 
specificities). That’s why we love open source!




Cost
A 700 sq ft starter home costs approximately US$25k in materials. An 
expandable 225 sq ft home (what we call a seed home), loaded with 
ecological features, costs approximately $12k in materials, and each 225
 square foot addition—with an additional 600 Watt of photovoltaics—costs
 about $5k in materials. This assumes materials are bought readily from a
 big box store.
This cost assumes a DIY build, but our build model—for taking this to a 
much larger audience beyond the 10% of owner builders—involves hiring a 
trained OBI builder who can organize a build party for a 5 day build of a
 700 square foot home. We are expecting to develop and deliver a price 
structure such that turnkey service will cost the owner $10k on top of 
the materials cost. The labor is included in the apprentice training of 
people participating in the build.
Utilities & Appliances
A house is not just made of walls, roof and floor. It also needs 
power, water, sanitation, etc. That’s why we’re developing a collection 
of off-grid, sustainable utilities and appliances.  Features included in the 2016 Starter Home build:

3000W Photovoltaics for off-grid energy
Biogas Digester
Grid-Tie Inverter
Open Source Thermoelectric Generator
Super-efficient LED Lights (3W Each)
Super-efficient Refrigerator (8W average)
Pellet Burner for House and Water Heating
In-Floor Hydronic Heating
CEB Floor
2 CEB Wall Modules
Modular Plumbing Fixtures
Modular Electric Panel
Passive Solar Design
Biofiber Insulation
Rainwater Collection
Super-efficient Shower Head
Water purification: sand, charcoal, ozonator
Separating Toilet
Greywater Garden

For a more complete description of these features, see Features Narrative.
Rapid Builds, Social Production
Through our building experiences—and based on OSE’s extreme 
manufacturing methodology—we developed a formula for rapid builds. It’s 
deceptively simple: a large group of people build a large number of 
modules, in parallel, and then assembles them rapidly into a building. 
Using these techniques, we were able to build—from raw materials—an 
entire 800 sq ft greenhouse in just 5 days.This process can be replicated by a contracted crew or a group of family
 and friends. But, to date, our preferred method has been social 
production. In our particular application, this means that we use builds
 as training opportunities by treating the builds as immersion 
workshops. During these workshops, participants become familiar with the
 building system and acquire hands-on experience—while building a 
structure.
Revenue from workshop tuition helps offset the cost of building 
materials for the hosts. In turn, all workshop participants are 
encouraged to host their own build-workshops. Like the library, all 
workshop organization materials are open source and freely available—so 
everyone can replicate this model if they want to.Who We AreWe are Marcin Jakubowski (founder of Open Source Ecology), Catarina Mota
 (founder of the Open Building Institute), and an amazing group of advisors and contributors—from
 world-renowned architects and scientists to business and organizational
 experts—who are committed to providing expertise on all areas of the 
project.

Catarina Mota is an open source advocate. She founded the Open Building Institute, co-founded Open Materials (do-it-yourself smart materials) and AltLab (Lisbon's hackerspace). Previously, she co-chaired the Open Hardware Summit 2012, served on the board of directors of the Open Source Hardware Association,
 taught as an adjunct faculty member at ITP-NYU, and was a fellow of the
 National Science and Technology Foundation of Portugal. Catarina holds a
 Ph.D. in communication sciences and her research work focuses on the 
social impact of open and collaborative practices for the development of
 technologies. She is a founding member of the Open Source Hardware 
Association and a TED Fellow.


Marcin Jakubowski is a Polish-American who came to the U.S. 
from Poland as a child. He graduated with honors from Princeton and 
earned his Ph.D. in fusion physics from the University of Wisconsin. 
Frustrated with the lack of relevance to pressing world issues in his 
education, he founded Open Source Ecology in 2003 in order to make closed-loop manufacturing a reality. He began development of the Global Village Construction Set (GVCS)—an
 open source tool set of 50 industrial machines necessary to create a 
small civilization with modern comforts. His work has recently been 
recognized as a 2012 TED Senior Fellow, in Time Magazine's Best 
Inventions of 2012, as a 2013 Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow, and a 
White House Champion of Change in 2013.

Why Housing?
We started Open Building Institute to address the issues surrounding housing for several reasons. Housing is a basic human need and is something that everyone can relate with because we all need a roof over our head. Housing costs also tend to make up a persons largest fiduciary responsibility. We wanted to apply open source methods and protocols to change this dynamic. Housing costs are only one of the issues we are trying to address with our initiative because there are other challenges depending on what part of the world we look at.
For people in less developed countries, there is a lack of access to technology, knowledge and resources required to build an affordable eco-friendly quality home. In addition to that, global population growth is exploding in these same countries causing billions of people to need shelter in the coming years and it's important that we approach this challenge in a smart sustainable way. 
For people in developed countries, owning a home is expensive, and requires most homeowners to encumber a life of debt, debt that is rarely ever paid off while living in home because interest payments are front loaded through the banks amortization schedules. This perpetual debt is like a a ball and chain that follow us through life and only serves to keep homeowners away from their home, (and family) busy at work trying to satisfy one of their largest monthly obligations which is their mortgage. It is our mission to offer high quality alternative solutions to this dilemma.
Why Food?
Another issue we wanted to address with our initiative was self sufficiency. Although we have addressed this in many ways with the homes numerous eco features, we felt that food production was such an important fundamental aspect of self sustainability that we needed to integrate food production into our modules. As with housing, food is a basic human need and makes up a significant portion of our yearly expenditures. Lack of access to healthy and nutritional food affects people in many different ways as well.
People in under-developed countries are frequently confronted with a daily battle of caloric intake, and in many cases, those are the lucky ones. There are over 700 million people in the world that suffer from undernourishment  and over 3 million children die every year due to poor nutrition. 
There are also millions of people in developed countries who have no other option but to eat cheap, processed, low nutrition food because they are  unable to afford quality food sources. This is one of the reasons we conduct our aquaponics workshops and have added this life sustaining component to our library of modules. Our aquaponic system can provide enough vegetables and protein to feed a family of six year round.  
A New Paradigm Is Within Reach
Imagine a life with little to no mortgage payments. utility costs or food bills. The average person spends almost 60% of their income on those three items alone. What if you could cut those numbers in half? What would you do with your time if you didn't have to spend it all working to keep these exorbitant costs satisfied every month? Or what would you do with the savings? This is not some far off pipe dream but a real possibility – right now. More people are coming to the realization that time is their most valuable asset and although we have an abundance of technology, is it really being properly utilized to create a better quality of life for us? One could argue that the introduction of more technology has only complicated our lives. Our housing initiative was created to be directly applied towards creating a better quality of life. We want to offer a way for people to have more time to do what they want to. Simply put, our model is designed to circumvent traditional housings constraining ways and provide a new housing paradigm (and lifestyle) for all who want it.  
How It Began
For several years now, Open Source Ecology (OSE) has been working on 
the Global Village Construction Set—a set of 50 industrial machines for 
building civilization from scratch. A lot has happened since OSE's 
successful Kickstarter in 2011. More recently, OSE established a 
partnership with a new open source project—the Open Building Institute 
(OBI)—to apply its GVCS machines to modular housing. The goal of this 
partnership is to make ecological housing accessible to everyone.
The project began when we—Marcin and Catarina—got married and 
realized our Missouri farmhouse was too small for two people. We had a 
very specific idea of what we wanted our home to be: comfortable and 
affordable, rapidly built from local materials, expandable (so we can 
add new rooms as the need arises), off-grid, and capable of generating 
its own energy and food.
We realized that this house didn’t exist yet—so we set out to design 
and build it ourselves. The process began in late 2013 with a 
microhouse—a 144 sq ft tiny house. To this we then added a bedroom, a 
mud room, a porch, a library/work space, an office, another bathroom, a 
utility room, and an aquaponic greenhouse. Together, these structures 
form a 2100 sq ft living and working space at Factor e Farm (Missouri, 
USA).
Throughout this process, and after much trial and error, we arrived at 
formula that makes building a house easier, faster and cheaper. On our 
latest build—an aquaponic greenhouse—a team of 35 (mostly inexperienced)
 participants built an entire 800 sq ft greenhouse from raw materials—in
 5 days—for $6,000 in materials. This build included not only the 
structure itself, but also two 1500 gallons fish ponds, 1 chicken coop, 
85 aquaponic towers, 2 compost grow beds, 6 mushroom grow towers, 1 
aquatic worm system, 1 BSF breeding system, and 3 hydronic radiators.

We realized that this approach—a combination of modular designs with 
rapid build techniques, social production, local materials, and open 
source machines—has the potential to make eco-house building widely 
accessible. But it was not easy. We have to make it easier. That’s what 
this campaign is about: turning our experiment into something everyone 
else can benefit from and participate in.
Training
We recognize that not everybody wants to build their own house. To 
address that, we’re creating an intensive training program—so you have 
an option to hire an OBI builder, if you want. 
This program will be a real deep dive into construction: from design 
and materials production to rapid-build organization and 
business—including building the construction machines themselves, which 
we can do in a single day.
Upon completion of the program, these trainees are expected to start 
their own building enterprises to provide building services to those who
 don’t want to build themselves.
The goal is to not only help train a growing number of open source, 
regenerative builders, but also to encourage entrepreneurship and seed 
the replication of many similar facilities worldwide. Like everything 
else in this project, all training materials are open source. Everyone 
is free—in fact, encouraged—to use those materials to launch their own 
training program and enterprise.
The initial training program is set to launch in 2017 with 2 to 4 
trainees. And then double this number annually until we reach an 
enrollment of 24 students—from which point we intend to scale operations
 to other locations. 
We need your help to spread our initiative to the broader world. We are seeking builders for collaboration and participation in our initiative. 
Materials Production
And it gets even better. Imagine being able to source most of your 
building materials from 50 miles around your build site. This is exactly
 what we’re aiming for with a solar-powered Materials Production 
Facility capable of producing compressed earth blocks, lumber, 
insulation, paint, glazing, and lime concrete—from local soil, 
limestone, hay and trees—using open source machines.

This facility will be open to the public, so that anyone who is 
interested in using local building materials has an option to produce 
their own materials. In our usual fashion of re-skilling and educating, 
we will provide people with both theoretical training and practice. This
 allows people to provide sweat equity in producing their own building 
materials, while gaining an appreciation of nature through the 
stewardship of natural resources. We will also provide turnkey materials
 for those who do not have the time or interest in sweat equity.
The Materials Facility highlights include:

20kW of solar electricity powers the brick press, sawmill, mixers, lime burner, hammermill, 3D printer, and pelletizer.
Stabilized CEB block production—which has about 8x less embodied energy than fired brick.
Lumber production, with byproducts of sawdust and wood pellets.
Production of pelletized biochar from pellets to produce soil 
amendment and machine fuel (with gasifier engines), while co-generating 
burned lime in the process.
Large format 3D printer for producing multi-wall polycarbonate greenhouse glazing from scrap plastic.
Burning of lime to make carbon-neutral concrete from local limestone.
Production of bio-fiber insulation from recycled newspaper and biomass feedstocks.
Production of heating and feed pellets from biomass feedstocks.

Our unique approach is that of ecology—combining as many features 
into a whole as possible—to arrive at harmonious existence of humans and
 nature.
The initial operation of this facility is scheduled for late 2017 
with further expansion planned for 2018. The goal is to provide detailed
 open source documentation for all aspects of this facility (all the 
machines, building, layout and processes) so it can be replicated and 
adapted all over the world—make local building materials available 
everywhere.
Challenges + Collaborative Development
By now, you’re probably thinking “These people are crazy! How are 
they going to do all this?” Well, we have a secret sauce: it’s called 
open source. It simply wouldn't be possible for our little core team to 
undertake this project without any additional help. But we’re not alone.
 Just like Linux is developed by thousands of programmers around the 
world, we believe we can all get together to fix housing.
All the work we did in the past years—both on machinery and housing—has relied heavily on hundreds of contributions from advisors and volunteers who
 believe, like we do, that we should join efforts to make things better 
for everyone. And now we’re taking this collaborative approach to the 
next level. One of the core goals of this Kickstarter is to develop a 
common platform for submitting new designs and improvements to the 
system. We will host Design Challenges as well. 
That’s why we’re inviting everyone to join this common platform by 
submitting new designs and improvements to the system. In addition to a 
standing-invitation to contribute to the library, we’re also hosting 
design contests—starting with a callout to design the 700 sq ft 
expandable home that we’ll build at our headquarters this November.
Given the scope of the project, we’re also gathering an amazing group
 of advisors—from world-renowned architects and high-tech engineers to 
business and organizational experts—who have committed to providing 
expertise on all areas of the project. Check out our Advisory Team.
Building Codes and Regulations 
Compliance with regulations is one of the requirements of the 
project, just as it is for any standard house. That’s why we’re working 
with experienced architects to: 1) ensure that all our modules comply 
with the International Building Code; and 2) produce sufficient 
documentation (calculations, plans, construction details drawings, 
design rationale, etc.) to enable builders to apply for the necessary 
permits in their area of residence. We also intend to have each module 
design stamped by a licensed engineer, as well as provide several 
complete house models with all regulatory aspects worked out in detail. 
To get there, we are recruiting an army of advisors on all the technical
 details—one of them being compliance, and other being real estate law -
 to help people navigate legal hurdles surrounding land acquisition and 
tenure. 
Further, since code compliance is a complicated and scary issue for 
most people, we are preparing a special webinar on Code Compliance. The 
key to successful code negotiation starts with a first-principles 
literacy of general concepts, and then moves to specific quantitative 
requirements. Codes are our friends if we understand them—and as such, 
our goal for this Webinar is to foster basic Building Code Literacy—so 
that seemingly inane regulations are converted into a human 
understandable form. 
Given that regulations and procedures vary from region to region, we 
will also crowd-source a database of regulation-related documents that 
can support the construction of select OBI house models in many 
different areas around the world. 
The autonomous and modular nature of the system also allows for a large level of flexibility towards meeting codes: 

Because our system is modular, it is highly flexible in the 
implementation that it can take. For example: “So, the separating toilet
 with biodigester doesn’t meet code?” The solution is simple: we swap 
out the toilet module, which is designed as a swappable platform, and 
replace it with a regular one. Or, the flattish roof does not meet snow 
load requirements in Northern Canada? Ok, we add another roof module 
(which is stackable like a sandwich), and we have now doubled snow load 
capacity. And so on. 
This modularity applies to parts of modules as well: if some part is
 inadequate—such as a structural member not being strong enough—we can 
replace it with one that is. The system allows this in general. 
Modularity applies clearly to wall sections, which are typically 4x8
 panels. These may be CEB and weigh over one ton, or standard stick 
framing and weigh 100 lb. You can stack these in multiples—or you can 
modify the materials used to scale their thickness. You can make larger 
wall cavities for insulation to meet the requirements of northern 
climates. You can substitute the materials and, for example, build 
panels out of bamboo, strawboard, or hempcrete. 
The modularity of the OBI system also allows for full control over 
room and house dimensions—to meet size, ceiling height, or any other 
constraints related to geometry. House too small to meet zoning 
minimums? Add a module and the house now meets this part of the 
regulations. House too large to meet code? Downsize by removing a number
 of modules. 
Off-grid design provides great flexibility. As long as you are not 
connected to water, electricity, or gas—essentially by living in an 
autonomous house—many options open up as far as where you can build or 
stay. In some places, code jurisdiction works on the basis of, for 
example, “Sewer system requirements” or “electrical hookup 
requirements.” If you are not hooked up to a sewer or electricity, the 
rules may not apply to you. 
For multiple house developments, special use cases may be obtained 
as Planned Unit Developments. Variances to ordinances may also be 
sought. 
You don’t like regulations at all? You can build a structure that is
 small enough to escape code jurisdiction all together. Or, in later 
phases of the project (2018 and later), when we design mobile 
structures, put the house on wheels and you are no longer under housing 
code jurisdiction, but vehicle code jurisdiction. 
Can’t afford the size required to meet zoning regulations? Build a shell structure, like Alejandro Aravena’s incremental housing
 and add to it as resources allow.
Really, really hate dealing with regulatory institutions? You may be 
glad to know that there are no building regulations—not even a building 
department—in parts of Missouri (US) and Chad, etc. 

Simply put: the system modularity allows immediate substitution of 
different parts to address compliance, making the regulations issue no 
different than for any other type of more standard house. And, due to 
the flexibility of modular construction, you as the builder have a great
 amount of code negotiating power. 
Land Access 
We have learned that while codes may be negotiated, there’s only a 
finite supply of land. In the USA, the situation is good as land is 
widely available —with farmland going for $2-8k per acre, and building 
lots as low as $10k in many cities. In Europe and elsewhere, farmland is
 $2-25k per acre. In India, prices are exploding. The question of land 
tenure, and the unequal access to land and resources is beyond the scope
 of this project. However, our work aims to increase individuals’ 
ability to convert abundant natural resources into lifestuff that frees 
people from material constraints—our fundamental formula for freedom. We
 believe that only by balancing human activity with regenerative 
resource use can prosperity happen for all—hence our quest for 
regenerative housing integrated with natural life support systems. 
Current State, Funding, and Roadmap 

The current state of the project is: We have built a number of 
modular home prototypes and additions between 2013-2015 - as well as the
 800 square foot aquaponic greenhouse. We are testing these now. 
In 2016, we will build building an expandable, replicable Starter 
Home with an aquaponic greenhouse addition  - based on learnings from 
the 2013-2015 builds. This design is not done. 
House and other building designs will be crowdsourced via Design 
Challenges - to be launched after this Kickstarter campaign achieves its
 funding goal. The design work involves: (1) working out some module 
interface details, (2) designing new utility/appliance modules, and (3) 
designing the overall composition of the house. 

This Indiegogo campaign will fund the necessary steps to make our building system widely replicable: 

Further development of all the system components, so that each is a 
fully engineered and documented module - usable in any model of a 
Starter Home. The goal by July 2018 is to develop all the modules 
necessary to build a Living Building Challenge compliant home, at a 
reasonable cost. 
Next iteration build and testing of the Starter Home with aquaponic greenhouse. Our next build is November, 2016. 
Creation of an immersion training program for builders. 
Development of open source enterprise curriculum for designing and 
building modular housing as a service, including how to produce local 
materials using open source machines. 
Development of a robust crowd design platform for submitting new designs and developments to the building system. 
Build of the solar powered materials production facility—so that 
most of the house building materials can be sourced from within 50 miles
 of the build site. This facility will be open to the public for 
production and training. 

Note that these funds do not cover the various supporting machines for 
construction and materials production -  nor does it cover numerous 
other structure builds that are in our timeline below but not in the 
funding scope above. These will be funded by proceeds from our immersion
 workshops - a funding model that we have used to fund various machine 
builds for the last 2 years.

Risks and challenges
While the development is high risk in general because of the level of
 innovation, the rewards have been selected first and foremost based on 
things that we can deliver.
Making things is hard. We realize that.
We've spent the past years developing the technology and process for 
building things rapidly and efficiently. We have established a network 
of advisors - where we have learned that subject matter experts are the 
strongest point of an open development process. Such expertise allows us
 to download information in hours - which would otherwise take months or
 years to develop. So while we have ambitious goals on the product level
 - none of the technology we are putting into practice is new. The 
challenge revolves around the rapid learning and integration that is 
required - which is a question of operations and management. 
We understand the huge difference between vision and execution. We 
have world class business advisors on our team - as we know that the 
difference between an idea and global impact is that of enterprise 
development. All of our work relies on business innovation using 
inovative social production processes - so naturally, there is a 
tremendous amount of risk involved 
At the same time, we have been building heavy machines on a day 
timescale, and building structures on 5 day time scales. We are well 
versed in Extreme Manufacturing - and the next challenge is whether we 
can teach others how to do the same. We know that we can build crazy 
things on rapid timescales - but the question of impact means (1) how 
effectively we can teach; and (2) how quickly we attain and exceed 
industry standard metrics of quality.
Our training program will be a crash course indeed. Curriculum 
development and a pilot training program are a way to learn what parts 
of our training program work. We will accept 2-4 students in 2017, and 
we aim to double our enrollment yearly until we reach 24 students. This 
means that access to a turnkey OBI building service - relies on the 
success of our teaching program - as otherwise the barriers to entry 
appear too high. 
We have work to do on the quality aspect - which is the core of the 
technical development that we are seeking to fund. We have already shown
 that average people can participate in complex builds - without needing
 trade skills. We have also been developing quality control protocols - 
starting with design-for-manufacturing - and standards quality control 
checklists throughout the build process.
Because this work is an integration of features not found in any 
other single project - we live at the bleeding edge of integration - 
which has inherent risks. While it is commonly understood that you can 
have only two of the three product features: quality, cost, and speed - 
we are challenging this assumption. We are breaking through the quality 
barrier by tapping top subject matter expertise, incentivized as a 
contribution to the common good. 
Modular Design: The challenge of any modular system is interface 
design - and we respect this point. We have had several years of 
experience in building modular machines, and are now applying the same 
principles to modular housing. The interface details in the current 
system need work, as they are difficult: we are breaking large builds 
into small parts - thereby introducing a number of interfaces that need 
to be sealed. Our insight on this point is careful navigation of Depth 
of Modularity. This means that if a certain interface does not work, we 
make specialized parts - or move the modularity either up or down in the
 design hierarchy. We have learned to be flexible with interfaces - or 
if an interface does not work well - we are comfortable getting rid of 
that interface or otherwise changing. Our result is a hybrid and 
flexible system - where we are not afraid to eliminate modularity when 
it simply does not work. At the same time, we have build modular 
electrical and plumbing sections - and we think that we have only 
scratched the surface of what is possible.
Development Time and Scope: We have promised ambitious products over 
an ambitious 2 year time scale, and a major risk is the mere scope of 
the technologies. While all of the technologies are proven, our 
innovation is the opensourcing or publishing of the technologies to make
 them accessible at cost - sidestepping the cost of expensive expertise.
 The Starter Home that we will build in November, 2016 - contains a 
large number of proven technological features - which we are promising 
at breakthrough cost - by publishing the technical expertise required to
 accomplish the build of  - availing otherwise expensive expertise for 
free to the world. So far we have been quite successful in attracting 
the necessary subject matter experts to provide the supporting technical
 information. The key to success is finding several more experts who are
 willing to share cutting edge know-how. The time of 4 months from the 
start of the campaign to the first build - is short, though we have a 
large base of prior modular build experience that we are building upon. 
And 15 months to the more ambitious Living Building Challenge build - 
and the 1 year time scale to the Materials Production Facility -means 
that we are compressing the documentation of just about all human 
knowledge related to construction - into making it fully accessible in 2
 years. That is extremely ambitious - but the idea is that a proper 
world-class expert can bring us up to speed to the most cutting edge 
practice in a matter of months. We will continue to ask our supporters 
and collaborators to feed us suggestions on who are the best people to 
ask - meaning people who are not only world-class experts - but who are 
willing to share their most precious knowledge openly. That is a rare 
combination - and while we have been successful at this to date - this 
is still a major risk.
Immersion Training: Our training program is essentially a 6 month 
crash course - and it is not for the light-hearted. We are seeking 
exceptional individuals. It is yet to be determined whether 6 months is 
sufficient time for people to learn the required organizational, design,
 build, and enterprise skills. Our pilot project will determine the 
feasibility.
Immersion Training Curriculum: The training curriculum requires the 
input from many diverse areas, and collecting all this knowledge will be
 done by inviting subject matter experts to contribute to the 
curriculum, focusing on open source product design and engineering. 
Managing this curriculum development is a large task, and will require 
significant organizational learning on OBI's side. We have run short 
courses and summer programs before, and our background is in education -
 so we feel  qualified to execute.
Business Development - We are still experimenting with an innovative 
and sound economic model. There isn't a good precedent for the 
education/production hybrid model that we are developing. We are relying
 on top business growth advisors, such as Cameron Herold, to help us 
refine and solidify this approach.
Living Building Challenge (LBC) Certification - This is the world's 
most stringent regenerative design certification, and it will no doubt 
be a challenge to deliver. Not in terms of features - but cost - for 
which our answer is developing the required technology (building 
materials and functional modules) in house. Further,  Bob Berkebile, LBC
 co-founder,  joined our team of advisors.
We're in this for the long run. This means that we may not get 
immediate results - but also - that we will not give up trying. It is 
well known that success is attained in just about all cases where 
perseverance is present. The downside may be that it may take longer 
than expected. From our track record - we have in just about all cases 
attained results better than expected when it comes to new techniques 
and technologies - though the speed with which we get there was 
typically nonlinear (unpredictable). We commit to be forthright and very
 transparent - with ongoing reporting, vlogging and updates about 
results - both the things that work and which don't.",20.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<p>A kit like this has always been on our roadmap.  Now, due to the incredible number of educators who have told us that they have been looking for something like Creation Crate to use in the classroom, we decided to accelerate its development.   </p>

<p>Educators, whether in the classroom, starting an after-school program, or in a makerspace or library, can bring the hands-on experience of building electronic circuits and learning to code to students with this turn-key program.  </p>
<p>We provide all the materials and background information so, even if you are an educator with no experience in these subjects, you can get started immediately.</p>
<p>A re-useable and re-stockable, tight-locking container will house all of the parts. (Recommended for middle-school - young professionals)</p>

Now you can learn how to build and program electronics in under 12 months using Augmented Reality, Facebook Messenger Tokens, and our Online Classroom! Creation Crate launched in early 2016 and took the tech-education space by storm with a beta of their teacher-designed monthly subscription box curriculum.  Users follow a 12-month curriculum and learn through hands-on programming and hardware-building tasks. The projects become more difficult each month, so users are continuously challenged and get better at building electronics. Inside the box, users find an instruction booklet, an UNO R3 (Arduino-compatible), and components. Learning how to build electronics is easy with our step-by-step process.  Customers over the past 2 years include homeschoolers, charter schools, maker spaces, parents, programmers, and tech-enthusiasts from around the world.  In response to feedback from nearly 3000 subscribers, Creation Crate is finishing designing an entirely new experience for learning how to make!  We're introducing 4 new features to our entire newly designed project curriculum! Augmented Reality will change the experience in how you learn. Facebook Messenger Tokens will change how you access information. The online classroom will be free to anyone! And the Ultimate Maker Kit makes it all accessible to large groups and classrooms!  Using a phone/device camera, users will be able to download the creation crate reality app through the app store and instantly interact with a digital teacher.  Our digital teacher will personally guide you through your entire learning experience!With our digital teacher ""Hal"", you can explore as little or in-depth as you want to on any given topic.     Don't know what a component does? Don't spend your time googling it, use the Facebook Messenger Token to bring tutorial videos directly to your Facebook Messenger App. Each component comes with a scannable token. Simply open Facebook messenger app, go to ""scan code"", and scan the code of the component you are working on in your project.  In Facebook Messenger, engage with our chatbot menu to explore what you can learn in electronics.  Ask questions, explore tutorials, and see what other projects you can create with these components.    
Whether you’re a software engineer wanting to learn more about hardware or a novice that doesn’t know what a breadboard is, we are creating a FREE CLASS taking you step-by-step through your first lessons with Arduino.
 
 

    
The ""Ultimate Maker Kit, Classroom Edition"" is our entire 12-month curriculum inside ONE KIT.
A kit like this has always been on our roadmap.  Now, due to the incredible number of educators who have told us that they have been looking for something like Creation Crate to use in the classroom, we decided to accelerate its development.   
 

 
Educators, whether in the classroom, starting an after-school program, or in a makerspace or library, can bring the hands-on experience of building electronic circuits and learning to code to students with this turn-key program.  
We provide all the materials and background information so, even if you are an educator with no experience in these subjects, you can get started immediately.
A re-useable and re-stockable, tight-locking container will house all of the parts. (Recommended for middle-school - young professionals)
        During the 12-month curriculum, you’ll be faced with 40+ individual key concepts to be learned and applied in your projects. These concepts cover a wide variety of subjects including computer science, electronics, engineering, physics, mathematics, and more.  You’ll be introduced to electronic components such as resistors, potentiometers, and infrared sensors; programming concepts ranging from defining variables, using arrays, and comparison operators.  The major component of our program is learning to use the Arduino microcontroller and many other electronics pieces. This will involve programming and using many different parts to create electronics!    Creation Crate is proud to announce that our curriculum is designed certified to meet the standards set up by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) standards as a recognized curriculum for learning how to program electronics.We know educators have a lot on their plate and any program or project that they take time to do in the class needs to help them meet their objectives.  One of those is teaching to the standards set forth for each grade level.  We are designing each project with this in mind so it can be used to reinforce these concepts. This not only helps students to learn new information but retain it longer and ultimately demonstrate mastery when tested.With each project, we will define the learning goals, provide step-by-step instruction, and outline which standards can be met and specifically how the project can meet them.  Check out the sample below.Sample ISTE Standards Matrix Example ISTE Standards 1 - Empowered LearnerStudents leverage technology to take an active role in choosing, achieving and demonstrating competency in their learning goals, informed by the learning sciences.1d - Students understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies. 5 - Computational Thinker5c - Students break problems into component parts, extract key information, and develop descriptive models to understand complex systems or facilitate problem-solving.5d - Students understand how automation works and use algorithmic thinking to develop a sequence of steps to create and test automated solutions. How the Creation Crate project helps to meet the standard:  We have thousands of maker's feedback on what their favorite projects were from the projects in our past 12-month curriculum. Our curriculum always changes to keep up with the newest technologies and project ideas in Arduino. We will be creating a new curriculum of projects so subscribers from the past can experience new projects and all our new features!
         What is Creation Crate?Creation Crate is tech education-in-a-box! With Creation Crate, you can learn how to build electronics without any prior experience.Creation Crate projects are a combination of building hardware and programming software with a focus on helping you understand how it works. Each month, you'll be given a new project that's slightly harder than the last. Where is Creation Crate located?Creation Crate is based in Toronto, ON, Canada.Yes, we're Canadian, eh! What's in the box?Every box is going to be different depending on the project, but the 3 main components are: the UNO R3 (Arduino-compatible), which is like a pocket-sized computer, various components, and the instruction booklet.The core sections of the instruction booklet are: Hardware, Programming, Common Errors, and Exercises. Each section contains detailed explanations of the steps. You'll also be given a password to access a project support page on this site! What else do I need?Everything you need is in the box!The only other thing you'll need is access to a computer with internet and a USB port. Who is it for?Creation Crate is for everyone! (Well, almost)The recommended age is 12+. The projects may be doable at a younger age with parental guidance.But remember, it's not just for kids. Creation Crate is for anyone with an interest in building electronics! Are there any shipping fees?There is a flat rate of $5 per box for shipping to Canada, US, and rest of the world. What countries do you ship to?We ship all over the world!Please allow up to 2 business days for processing. Once the item is ready, we will send out a confirmation email when the item is shipped.Orders are shipped on business days only.

<p>The Genocide Film Library’s primary focus is to provide a platform for survivors to have their voices heard; empowering them as educators and messengers of hope for a better future because no one can recount more accurately what happened in Srebrenica, but those who were there during the war.</p>
<p>The Genocide Film Library is a positive, emotional and inspiring story of survivors who want to share their personal narratives. The survivors want the world to know what it means to be forgotten, and what it means to be saved by your former neighbors who were on the opposite side. </p>
<p><strong>So far...</strong></p>
<p>To date, over <strong>1.175 narratives</strong> have been filmed since January 15, 2012. Over 2% of the narratives have been translated and subtitled in English and available on our web site &lt;<a href=""http://cinemaforpeace.ba/en/testimonies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cinemaforpeace.ba/en/testimonies</a>&gt;, while the rest of the testimonies will be archived on servers and accessible worldwide to educational institutions.</p>
<p>The Genocide Film Library plans to continue filming in Sarajevo and Tuzla, and in Srebrenica during the summer time. We are currently developing a concept for the first regional conference about oral history as a tool for dealing with the past. We are also developing a script in order to produce the first documentary based on personal narratives of Srebrenica genocide survivors.</p>
<p><strong>To continue with our efforts, we need your support!</strong></p>
<p>The majority of  survivors never had an opportunity to speak about what they and their family members have experienced in Srebrenica between 1992 and 1995. There is a mutual feeling among <strong>survivors</strong> that they have been <strong>bypassed</strong> and that their <strong>experiences</strong> of survival have been <strong>ignored and forgotten</strong>. It is for this reason that the  Genocide Film Library has broken the silence and fear of talking about  Srebrenica genocide because the <strong>survivors have spoken</strong>. As such, their personal narratives will be preserved which will transcend the limits of our present lives; narratives of individuals depicting real issues, real conflict, real people and real emotions. </p>
<p><strong>We</strong> need to take <strong>inspiration</strong> from these ordinary people who took extraordinary steps to defend human dignity. As Thomas King wrote in his book <em>The Truth About Stories, once you’ve heard a story</em>, <em><strong>it </strong></em><strong><em>becomes your story</em></strong>: “Do with it as you will.

<p>Hello! My name is Ali Maanum, and I'm a graphic designer in Madison, WI. I grew up very artistic and creative throughout grade school, high school, and then eventually college - where I graduated with a degree in Graphic Design and Illustration. I'm very fortunate to do what I do with such amazing people ... but, there was something I just couldn't stop thinking about.</p>
<p>I put myself through college working at a licensed in-home daycare, and those experiences really changed my perspective on what I value and find most important and rewarding in a career path. I didn’t know at the time how much of an impact those kids made on me, but a few years away from teaching gave it time to sink in. I know and believe now that I am meant to work with children - so, I'm taking the knowledge and experiences I have from working with kids and turning it into my own daycare. I am proud to present an educational environment full of creativity and fun, coming to Madison, WI this May, 2013. </p>
<p>What makes Little Sprouts special? We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>All snacks and meals will be organic and all natural.</li>
<li>All natural cleaning products - safe for little hands and feet!</li>
<li>Educational, engaging activities, such as fieldtrips to children’s museums.</li>
<li>Holistic learning, from painting to gardening to recycling and beyond.</li>
<li>An energetic approach – playtimes are dedicated to activities like, recycling, gardening, yoga and games that engage the large motor skills – no sitting around the TV for our Little Sprouts!</li>
<li>Highly regarded Mother Goose Time curriculum.</li>
<li>A nurturing, healthy, socially positive environment for all children.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently finalizing my certifications/licensing procedures, preparing to rent a home in my neighborhood for the site of Little Sprouts Daycare, and budgeting for all the new expenses as I transition from my career in graphic design to full-time childcare. </p>
<p>This daycare has turned from a fleeting thought to a quickly impending reality in only a matter of months. Funding everything to stock the daycare, and pay for unexpected bills will solidify my dream into reality!</p>
<p><em><strong>A note from a dear friend:  </strong></em></p>
<p><em>"" Ali's holistic approach to childcare is noteworthy and donation-worthy! She believes in a healthy, open, and educational environment for children to grow and learn in. Her daycare is going to take a step forward for health, education, mindfulness, and cross-curricular approaches to caring for children."" </em></p>
<p><em>- Janessa Doucette, MA Candidate, Smithsonian Institution Center for Education</em></p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I am asking for a minimum of $7,000 - this funding will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$2,500</strong> - One month of bills (Personal &amp; daycare bills, for the month that I am transitioning from my full-time job to childcare, and setting up the daycare space.) </li>
<li>
<strong>$1,500</strong> - Swing-set for big kids, and for young kids.</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000</strong> - Furniture (bookcases, tables, chairs, shelving, locker-cubbies, bigger toys/loft)</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000</strong> – Misc. (Renters/liability insurance, books, toys)</li>
<li>
<strong> ** Extra</strong> - (If I make more than my minimum goal, all proceeds will go towards a van down payment to transport the kids!)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>$25</strong> - A thank you card! I appreciate all donations!</li>
<li>
<strong>$100</strong> - A framed picture with my first group and me!</li>
<li>
<strong>$500</strong> - All of the above, PLUS - A tote filled with goodies!</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000</strong> - All of the above, PLUS - Ceramic tile artwork from my mother's business!</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,500</strong> - All of the above, PLUS - One month tuition for a child! What an awesome gift!</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, I've been lucky enough to have a lot of great friends donate lots of toys so far, but I still need to get these really big items in the daycare! <strong>Please help!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>I have tried other routes to find funding, but unfortunately, because of the economy I was rejected a small business loan.</p>
<p>I have also tried a ChipIn fundraiser (which a friend set up for me), and unfortunately I just couldn't get it in front of the right people, and I couldn't spread the word enough for it to make a major impact.</p>
<p>This money from YOU will create a new creative daycare that will impact the children in my neighborhood, as well as create local, community-based jobs. Long term goals for the daycare is to create another location and maybe even more as its popularity grows!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm looking to break into the Children's Publishing world and need some help from the awesome community that is IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>For years I've wanted to become a full-time artist and now that I'm out of the IT world I'm giving it my best. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The class is going to be $345 at PNCA, but as a starving artist, this is a large chunk of change I simply cannot yet afford on my own.</p>
<ul>
<li>$345 for Tuition and Class Fee</li>
<li>The other $155 is for whatever supplies I may need for the class and to produce a mockup of my first proposal to publisher</li>
<li>Anything beyond the $500 will go towards saving for an Wacom Graphics tablet so that I can create my works digitally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount you can give will get you a signed thank you card and a print of your choosing from my works.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Raising this money through IndieGoGo will really help me in my chosen path as an Illustrator and keep me from incurring any more debt.</p>
<p>Fixing computers for over 13 years has left me feeling unfulfilled and has never allowed me to flex my creativity. Now that I've have the chance to be independent of the ""IT World"", I can pursue a lifelong goal of being an artist.</p>
<p>In the past, I've been involved in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inking comic pages for an indie-comic ""Deadly Breed""</li>

<h2>OSEP at a glance</h2>
<p><strong>OSEP</strong> (<strong><em>Open Source Education Project</em></strong>) is a project created and maintained by <a href=""http://www.thedigitalcraft.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Offical Site for The Digital Craft"">thedigitalcraft.com</a>.</p>
<h3>The Digital Craft:</h3>
<p><strong>The Digital Craft</strong> (<strong>TDC</strong>) is an organization that produces free computer and web technology learning series.</p>
<h2>OSEP:</h2>
<p><strong>OSEP</strong> was created to allow individuals to not only educate themselves by watching video series hosted on (<strong>TDC/<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/thedigicraft"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Digital Craft on YouTube"">YouTube</a></strong>) but learn how to build a professional level product by the end of each <strong>OSEP</strong> series.</p>
<p>Because our viewers (<em>many of which call themselves <strong>our students</strong></em>) are building these projects along with us, from the ground up - they will have the knowledge it takes to enhance, and modify the product once they complete the series. </p>
<h3>The Goal:</h3>
<p>The overall goal of each <strong>OSEP</strong> project is to grow a community of web programmers and designers who can feel like they had a part in <strong>creating something ""real""</strong> (because they did!). </p>
<h3>Some Strategy Never Hurts:</h3>
<p>Our strategy comes from watching how other organizations build, host, and maintain their open source products. Many of the other open source orgs out there have to build a product and then promote it in order to attempt to gain a community that will receive the product, need it, and have the willingness to take the time to learn how the product was built and how it works. Only then can the orgs development community grow.</p>
<p>Our attempt is to eliminate the waiting and hoping period from the equation. We already have the (ever growing) community that wants to learn a new skill (or hone an old one). So we launch the product with a support base of all the viewers who have followed along with the series in which we build the product from the ground up.</p>
<p>Now, we cannot be pompous enough to think that we can pick any type of product, create a video series and build a loyal community to help support it. Nor do we want to. To the contrary, we have chosen this first <strong>OSEP</strong> product from the overwhelming request we have had from viewers (publically and privately) to teach them how to build a CMS. In fact, this is where the idea for <strong>OSEP</strong> was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As with this first product, the future products will be chosen based off input from our viewers.</p>
<h2>Why do you need funding and who all is involved in this org?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Digital Craft</strong>, <strong>OSEP</strong>, and the ideas have all been the original work of myself, <strong><em>Alan Quandt</em></strong>. I have been a graphic designer, web designer, web developer (lead), and even had a stint directing a network late night comedy show. I have been doing all this (and more) for almost 17 years (12 professionally). </p>
<h3>Why give up the big bucks in order to become a fulltime educator?</h3>
<p>I have always wanted to be an educator. However. I paid (or am still paying) enough for my current education that I wont be signing up for a teaching degree anytime soon! So during a lull in freelance work, I started videos for what would soon become <strong>The Digital Craft</strong>. <strong>TDC</strong> has a history all its own (can be read on our website). However the videos fit right in on the website and I kept on producing video after video until the ""lull"" ended. I then continued to make videos whenever I had free time.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now. I have a ton of loyal subscribers/viewers and more than a ton of views. In fact, at the moment of writing this we have close to <em><strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/thedigicraft"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Digital Craft on YouTube"">3500 subscribers and over 716,000 views</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>I am at a turning point in my career. I have seen the popularity of <strong>TDC</strong> and overall acclaim from our viewers grow beyond my expectations over the last several months. I have a choice to</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue freelance work and do <strong>TDC</strong> videos on the side</li>
<li>Stop freelance work and join another development firm</li>
<li><em>Take this once in a lifetime opportunity to do something awesome and follow my actual dream... aka: Manage the <strong>TDC</strong> and <strong>OSEP</strong> fulltime</em></li>
</ol>
<h3>I have chosen <strong>option 3</strong>. </h3>
<p>However I am a husband and father to 3 young girls in elementary school. I still have a responsibility to put a roof over their heads and food on our table. I have been generating some income from advertising via Google ads on the <strong>YouTube</strong> videos and <strong>thedigitalcraft.com</strong>. At this point however, that is only generating enough to pick up a month's worth of groceries.</p>
<p>So we need funding until I have enough content and viewers in order to build income through advertising, affiliate programs, and other opportunities that will allow me to keep the videos and project free. At which time I will hault the fundraising until its needed again.</p>
<p>The video above is explaining the first project that we are attempting with <strong>OSEP</strong>. The funding amount is enough to keep me working on the site for several months and keep current with my own research and tools needed to produce the videos. </p>
<p>I will admit, this is the first (well unofficially the 2nd) of many future fund raising attempts. We will need to keep funding the project until other means make up for the loss of income I will incur. We will also need to bring on more industry professionals who are willing to devote their efforts fulltime to continue to expand our reach and topics.</p>
<p>Every donation counts! $5- $500 it is about the numbers of people who support the cause.</p>

The end goal should be to empower individuals to educate themselves.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>By building upon the unique skills of the individual members of the community, the community is shaped and fortified, thereby generating further aptitudes and resources.</strong></p><strong>
<p>Thousands of Nicaraguans have thus been mentored through the establishment of the Learning Centers. With each center being coordinated by local women, they are able to cater to the individual needs of each learning center's community.</p>
<br/></strong><p></p>
<h2>""Lifting up through Learning""</h2>
<p>A goal of the Learning Centers is to help people help themselves. Nicaraguan people receive training to provide direct support to themselves, their families, and their communities. Community education is more than the act of teaching people practice skills. It is a process of bringing citizens together to solve local problems. No development project can be successful without active involvement of citizens shaping their future.</p>
<p>At Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners of the Americas (WNP), volunteers have developed and coordinated a network of thriving at the Learning Centers. There are currently over 100 established Learning Centers throughout Nicaragua. Each Learning center is autonomous with organization and management by the people and their communities. Current Learning Center 
activities include sewing, handcrafts, jewelry, baking, gardening, lending libraries, and much more.</p>
<p>Although these Centers are established, students need supplies and teachers need to be paid. With each year, more Centers are established and more students want to learn. Supplies are in great need. All proceeds generated in this campaign will go towards running and funding the Learning Centers.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<h4>$5 - Thanks</h4>
<p><em>Any contribution will help support a Learning Center in Nicaragua.</em></p>
<p>All donations are welcome and any way of spreading awareness will greatly help.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners of the Americas is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Cash and in-kind donations are fully tax-deductible to the extend allowed by the law.</em></strong></p>
<h4></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">$10 - Jewelry</span></p>
<p><em>Unique hand-crafted jewelry made by Nicaraguans</em></p>
<p>Women and families who visit a Learning Center learn many different skills, such as jewelry-making. By teaching people these skills, they can make a living by selling their crafts. Each piece is differnt and varies in shapes, colors, and sizes.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/343423/files/20140201142019-jewlery.png?1391293219"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<h4>$25 - Coffee</h4>
<p><em>Colectivo Coffee, Nicaraguan fair-trade coffee</em></p>
<p>Starting your day with a delicious cup of Nicaraguan coffee not only makes your day, but helps out the farmers who work hard making a dignified living selling their coffee. In Esteli, coffee is grown by 2,300 small farmers with 30% of them women.</p>
<p>If you don't drink coffee, Nicaraguan fair-trade coffee is a great gift for coffee-drinking friends!</p>

<h4>$100 - Baskets</h4>
<p><em>Pine needle baskets created by Nicaraguan women</em></p>
<p>These baskets are created from the hands of indigenous Nicaraguan women in the northern region of Nicaragua, Cusmapa. Cusmapa's landscape is filled with pine trees. A traditional art from in the northern Atlantic Coast of the country has always been basket weaving using the long pine needles gathered from the forest floor.</p>

It must create its own momentum to continue indefinitely once it is put into motion. The end goal should be to empower individuals to educate themselves.By building upon the unique skills of the individual members of the community, the community is shaped and fortified, thereby generating further aptitudes and resources.
Thousands of Nicaraguans have thus been mentored through the establishment of the Learning Centers. With each center being coordinated by local women, they are able to cater to the individual needs of each learning center's community.

""Lifting up through Learning""
A goal of the Learning Centers is to help people help themselves. Nicaraguan people receive training to provide direct support to themselves, their families, and their communities. Community education is more than the act of teaching people practice skills. It is a process of bringing citizens together to solve local problems. No development project can be successful without active involvement of citizens shaping their future.
At Wisconsin/Nicaragua Partners of the Americas (WNP), volunteers have developed and coordinated a network of thriving at the Learning Centers. There are currently over 100 established Learning Centers throughout Nicaragua. Each Learning center is autonomous with organization and management by the people and their communities. Current Learning Center 
activities include sewing, handcrafts, jewelry, baking, gardening, lending libraries, and much more.
Although these Centers are established, students need supplies and teachers need to be paid. With each year, more Centers are established and more students want to learn. Supplies are in great need. All proceeds generated in this campaign will go towards running and funding the Learning Centers.

<p>$20,000 – Build 2 glory holes, two benches and buy new pipes and hand tools.</p>
<p>$50,000 – Build a new furnace.</p>
<p>$75,000 – Build a new annealer and convert our others to electricity. </p>
<p>$100,000 – Will give us enough to buy a larger electric furnace and convert the whole shop to electricity which will be more energy efficient. Right now we operate on bottled gas. </p>
<p>$125,000 - We can buy a backup generator and build our cold working shop. </p>
<p>$150,000 – We can fully fit out the hot shop, build our metal working shop, finish our shop office, second bathroom and buy enough tools to serve 12 students. </p>

<h4>Campaign Summary</h4>
<p>At Horizon Glassworks we are developing an International Glass Art School that has the ability to dramatically affect the lives of artistic individuals both locally and worldwide. Southeast Asia, and more specifically, Ubud Bali, is the perfect place for Horizon’s learning facility. Horizon Glassworks is now becoming a community of creative energy for glass artists.  </p>
<p>This campaign is about developing part of Horizon Glassworks into a teaching facility that is dedicated to teaching students from all walks of life, ages, and life styles the world over who seek new and exciting ways to express their creative and artistic passion and talents. The skills, lessons, and sense of community learned here will carry on for generations to come.</p>
<p>We have instructors from all over the world that are waiting to come teach, and we’ve got students wanting to learn.</p>
<p>Located in Bali, on the 'Island of the Gods,' we are developing this glass art community in preparation for a glass art movement to be born in Indonesia and throughout South East Asia. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>What We Need</h4>
<p>Ron and his wife Indah have spent just about every penny they have securing the property and building the facility where Horizon Glassworks currently resides. It’s a huge operation with over a dozen full time staff, 4,000 square meters of property, and 4 buildings - all in pursuit of the dream to build this into a World Class International Glass Art School. </p>
<p>Ron and Indah will continue to operate the facility with or without the school. However, they simply can’t afford to complete the necessary upgrades and improvements to the facility in the capacity required for teaching without your help. Please support us, contribute to our campaign, and help turn this dream into reality...  </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p></span><p></p><h4>Overfunding</h4><p>If we are overfunded, we will create a scholarship fund for underprivileged persons to attend. We will also continue to upgrade our facilities to high efficiency recuperating systems and equipment to reduce overall operating costs.  <br/></p><p>We will also add a program to teach others how to build and operate a fully functional studio of their own to work with hot glass and other glass art forms. This will help promote glass art and begin to stimulate a glass art society and collector's movement throughout Southeast Asia. </p><p>It is a devotion of ours to develop this program to help less fortunate creative and artistic individuals become self sufficient by opening their own hot glass art studio. With your help, we can make a huge difference in the lives of countless people, and continue the modern age of glass art. </p><h4><br/></h4><h2>What You Get In Return</h2><p>Besides helping to make a huge difference for thousands of people, we have implemented an exciting and generous lottery program for those who donate $50 or more to our campaign. We have hand selected 50 pieces of beautiful pieces of various styles from figurines to vases, bowls, platters, paperweights and the like. If we reach our goal, 50 recipients will be drawn at random to receive one of these collectable pieces in appreciation of your support.</p><p>We also have perks that include your name engraved in stone in our courtyard, and even a perk where one of the studios is dedicated to you with your name proudly displayed at the entrance along with the name of the studio - i.e. The John Q. Smith HOT SHOP. Teachers, students, and visitors will all recognize your support for years to come. </p><p>Alternatively, Ron will be creating beautiful custom one-off pieces of art for those individuals who donate at the $1,000 level. These will be highly collectable pieces and are available on a very limited basis. </p><p><b>Here are some of our Other Perk Highlights:</b></p><p>Pendant Necklace: $50 Level</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637419/files/20140609193410-Gold.JPG?1402367650"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637420/files/20140609193446-Green.JPG?1402367686"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637421/files/20140609193510-Purple.JPG?1402367710"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Name Engraved in Stone: $100 Level</p><p></p>This is very special to us as we want our entire courtyard filled with the names of our valuable supporters and where they are from -  a constant reminder of who made this International Glass Art School happen - YOU!

Your contribution can make a huge difference not only in their lives, but the lives of future generations - elder artisans here traditionally pass art skills to their children. We truly have the ability to bring a new form of expressive creativity to people here and around the globe who would otherwise never have the opportunity to experience the wonders of glass art. The result is beautiful pieces of glass art that give people the purpose and resources to support themselves and future generations. </p><h4><br/></h4><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Are you fascinated by glass art? If you can’t contribute, please pass this on to someone who can by posting us up on your social media network or simply telling friends and family who might want to help about this campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools for your convenience. We appreciate every contribution, large or small.</p><p>If you are planning a trip to Bali, please stop in and enjoy our facility. Take a course, volunteer as an intern, become an Artist in Residence, or even join us as a Teacher's Aid (TA). In any way you can, we invite you to join us on this fantastic journey. We are open from 9-5pm Monday through Saturday and welcome visitors who can sit and watch the art of making hot glass in action. Come see for yourself why Horizon truly is the place where “Glass Comes Alive.”</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2 style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif !important; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px !important; font-size: 30px !important; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">Founder's Bio  </h2><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; font-weight: normal;""><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ron Seivertson (1961, United States), Horizon Glassworks<br style=""""/>  </b>Ron Seivertson is a hot glass artist who lives on the edge with an intense devotion to his craft.

<p></p></div>","A note from Ron Seivertson."" Human sincerity is impossible to disguise"" (c) Ron Seivertson 2014I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has participated in this campaign, especially the funders.  You have stated to the world that you believe in this vision we have for Horizon and that you are firm believers and supporters in our ability to create the school, no matter what it takes. The team that came together of their own accord and circumstance are indeed some of the most giving and loving persons I have met in my entire life.  This was not my idea nor did i have the capacity to conceive that a crowd fund was even possible for us.  Mr Lars Flikkeid. Is the architect of not only this campaign, but also our new website and the website of Tiari's Treasures.Without Lars very simply this campaign would not exist.  I asked no one to join the team yet they arrived one by one expressing interest and asking how they could help.   During this discovery, this learning experience  about community funding, we have all learned a great deal more about each other and the world at large.  Everyone has been  so gracious with their time, sincerity and energy and I am forever grateful.Thank You,Ron Seivertson  Aug. 8th 2014 7:43 PMCounting Down with 50% Discounted Perks!Only a few days left and believe it or not, your contributions do make a difference even if we don't reach our goal. We'll continue to raise money for the school even after the campaign is over so keep your contributions coming. We've decided to offer 50% off on all our perks too, so just contribute with no perk selected, then write a comment and let us know what perk you want. We'll take care of the rest! Thanks again for your support!IntroductionThis crowd funding campaign is about updating tools, equipment, and facilities so that students can learn the art of Glassblowing in Bali, Indonesia with International World-Renowned Master Glass Artists.MilestonesAll funds if we don’t reach our goal will go towards tools and equipment necessary for teaching the art of hot glass in a more limited capacity. 
We need many things, big and small, to help make the Horizon facility functional for our students. 
We appreciate your generosity and the goal does not have to be fully met for your money to be effective.  Here are our milestones of where your money goes:
$5,000 - Finish our shop floor and finish 1 bathroom for our students.
$10,000 – Build 1 glory Hole. Our aim is to buy recuperating glory holes for maximum life and fuel efficiency. These are very expensive and must be imported. But we can build our own standard glory holes for less. 
$20,000 – Build 2 glory holes, two benches and buy new pipes and hand tools.
$50,000 – Build a new furnace.
$75,000 – Build a new annealer and convert our others to electricity. 
$100,000 – Will give us enough to buy a larger electric furnace and convert the whole shop to electricity which will be more energy efficient. Right now we operate on bottled gas. 
$125,000 - We can buy a backup generator and build our cold working shop. 
$150,000 – We can fully fit out the hot shop, build our metal working shop, finish our shop office, second bathroom and buy enough tools to serve 12 students. 




Campaign Summary
At Horizon Glassworks we are developing an International Glass Art School that has the ability to dramatically affect the lives of artistic individuals both locally and worldwide. Southeast Asia, and more specifically, Ubud Bali, is the perfect place for Horizon’s learning facility. Horizon Glassworks is now becoming a community of creative energy for glass artists.  
This campaign is about developing part of Horizon Glassworks into a teaching facility that is dedicated to teaching students from all walks of life, ages, and life styles the world over who seek new and exciting ways to express their creative and artistic passion and talents. The skills, lessons, and sense of community learned here will carry on for generations to come.
We have instructors from all over the world that are waiting to come teach, and we’ve got students wanting to learn.
Located in Bali, on the 'Island of the Gods,' we are developing this glass art community in preparation for a glass art movement to be born in Indonesia and throughout South East Asia. 

What We Need
Ron and his wife Indah have spent just about every penny they have securing the property and building the facility where Horizon Glassworks currently resides. It’s a huge operation with over a dozen full time staff, 4,000 square meters of property, and 4 buildings - all in pursuit of the dream to build this into a World Class International Glass Art School. 
Ron and Indah will continue to operate the facility with or without the school. However, they simply can’t afford to complete the necessary upgrades and improvements to the facility in the capacity required for teaching without your help. Please support us, contribute to our campaign, and help turn this dream into reality...  

 



OverfundingIf we are overfunded, we will create a scholarship fund for underprivileged persons to attend. We will also continue to upgrade our facilities to high efficiency recuperating systems and equipment to reduce overall operating costs.  We will also add a program to teach others how to build and operate a fully functional studio of their own to work with hot glass and other glass art forms. This will help promote glass art and begin to stimulate a glass art society and collector's movement throughout Southeast Asia. It is a devotion of ours to develop this program to help less fortunate creative and artistic individuals become self sufficient by opening their own hot glass art studio. With your help, we can make a huge difference in the lives of countless people, and continue the modern age of glass art. What You Get In ReturnBesides helping to make a huge difference for thousands of people, we have implemented an exciting and generous lottery program for those who donate $50 or more to our campaign. We have hand selected 50 pieces of beautiful pieces of various styles from figurines to vases, bowls, platters, paperweights and the like. If we reach our goal, 50 recipients will be drawn at random to receive one of these collectable pieces in appreciation of your support.We also have perks that include your name engraved in stone in our courtyard, and even a perk where one of the studios is dedicated to you with your name proudly displayed at the entrance along with the name of the studio - i.e. The John Q. Smith HOT SHOP. Teachers, students, and visitors will all recognize your support for years to come. Alternatively, Ron will be creating beautiful custom one-off pieces of art for those individuals who donate at the $1,000 level. These will be highly collectable pieces and are available on a very limited basis. Here are some of our Other Perk Highlights:Pendant Necklace: $50 LevelName Engraved in Stone: $100 LevelThis is very special to us as we want our entire courtyard filled with the names of our valuable supporters and where they are from -  a constant reminder of who made this International Glass Art School happen - YOU! The Horizon Glass Property is surrounded by Balinese Stone Carvers making this perk an incredible value. Please come join us, our community, and other supporters... The Impact You Can Help MakeWe foresee the style and message of the local’s work reflecting their rich history and tradition with beautiful glass art pieces. As we develop international visitors and local individuals in the art of hot glass, we are creating a cross cultural and cross generational exchange. Your contribution can make a huge difference not only in their lives, but the lives of future generations - elder artisans here traditionally pass art skills to their children. We truly have the ability to bring a new form of expressive creativity to people here and around the globe who would otherwise never have the opportunity to experience the wonders of glass art. The result is beautiful pieces of glass art that give people the purpose and resources to support themselves and future generations. Other Ways You Can HelpAre you fascinated by glass art? If you can’t contribute, please pass this on to someone who can by posting us up on your social media network or simply telling friends and family who might want to help about this campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools for your convenience. We appreciate every contribution, large or small.If you are planning a trip to Bali, please stop in and enjoy our facility. Take a course, volunteer as an intern, become an Artist in Residence, or even join us as a Teacher's Aid (TA). In any way you can, we invite you to join us on this fantastic journey. We are open from 9-5pm Monday through Saturday and welcome visitors who can sit and watch the art of making hot glass in action.

<h2>Who we are:</h2>
<p>Founded in 1955, Young Musicians Foundation (YMF) promotes the classical music tradition of Southern California by nurturing the personal, academic, and artistic development of youth ages 4-25 through performance opportunities, financial assistance, and community outreach.</p>

</div></div>","Let's keep music in LA’s inner-city schools.
In
five Los Angeles schools, with students who otherwise would have no access to music education,
the Young Musicians Foundation (YMF) Music Mentors Program fills a critical need by providing free
music classes to underserved elementary and middle school students.  Now in its third year, our program has
doubled for 2013-2014, with 22 Mentors teaching 300 students in their own schools.  And more students want to sign up every week!
We
know that students learn best in a caring, mutually beneficial environment that
strengthens individual resiliency and the capacity for lifelong learning.  Our extraordinary Mentors are current members
and alumni of YMF’s Debut Orchestra, one of the top pre-professional training orchestras in the nation.  Mentors participate in training sessions
throughout the year with Lisa Schaeffer, Director of Pedagogy, to develop the
skills to engage and inspire their students’ curiosity about music and the
world.In the 2013-2014 school year, the Music Mentors Program is at five school sites:
Lennox Middle School (Lennox, CA)
Hobart Boulevard Elementary School (Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA)
Para Los Niños Eisner Foundation Child Development Center (Skid Row, Los Angeles, CA)
Para Los Niños Charter Elementary (Skid Row, Los Angeles, CA)
Para Los Niños Charter Middle School (Skid Row, Los Angeles, CA)


As
we enter the spring 2014 semester with our strongest impact ever, we’re asking for
your help.
It
all starts with just $30 per student.
$9,000
will fund an entire semester of


New instrument purchases ($3,500).  We just had 21 new students at Lennox Middle School sign up to learn double bass and cello, which means we need to purchase instruments and music stands for two new classes.

Instrument
     maintenance and repairs ($2,500), including necessary supplies such as reeds,
     strings, etc.;

Sheet music
     and materials ($2,000) for our classrooms, including music notebooks, worksheets,
     and display boards;

Performance
     costs ($1,000) of the culminating end-of-year concerts for the parents and families
     of the students (up to 600 per concert).
With 300 students, that comes out to just $30
each for an entire semester of music instruction.  Any money raised beyond the $9,000 goal will
go to support audio and visual recording of the final concerts, year-end
evaluations, and indirect costs.
And it makes a lasting impact.
The
Music Mentors Program isn’t just about teaching fundamentals or regurgitating

<p>In 2000 I took my first yoga class at Velocity dance studio out of curiosity
to explore a new movement form. I immediately loved the practice. </p>
<p>For years I dabbled in classes here and there, and even did some home
practice to balance out hours of dancing and working in landscaping. It wasn’t
until 2006, when I was recovering from a torn ligament in my foot, that I took
to the yoga mat in a dedicated fashion—going to class 3 to 4 times a week. It was the
best physical therapy I could have given myself, to regain strength and trust in
my foot again in my own timing.</p>
<p>Coming from a structured dance background where I was challenged to push my body, I felt comforted in the space where I was encouraged to listen to what my body wanted and needed. I loved how relaxed I felt after
every class, and I began to notice how the days were better when I did yoga
versus when I didn’t. I loved how focusing on my breath and my body calmed my
busy mind and slowly but surely, my body became stronger and more flexible. My
ability to deal with stress improved as well and I started to listen more and more
to the quiet voice within. </p>
<p>Since then, I have explored many yoga styles— Vinyasa flow, Bikram, Iyengar,
Ashtanga, YogaWorks, Baptiste….</p>
<p>Now, arriving at Forrest Yoga, I feel that this is the practice I have been seeking. The practice has everything I need—the relaxation, the strength-building, <i>and</i> the experience of coming home to myself. The Forrest
yoga practice encourages me to be authentic with myself, tune into and
stay connected to feeling, honor what is and breathe into what I feel. <br/></p>I want to help pass on this
healing work of Forrest Yoga. To hold space and encourage others to stay
connected to and listen to themselves, to the feelings that arise and honestly
give their body what it needs. I want to teach.<br/><br/><h3>The Details...</h3>
<p>I have applied and have been accepted to the Foundation Forrest Yoga
Teacher Training taking place in Houston this October. I need your help to make this next
step of my journey a reality. </p>
<p>This training is 28-full days and non-residential, so in addition to the tuition,
I need to cover expenses for the flight, food, and rent (both in Houston and my home back in
Seattle). I hope to stay within walking distance to the training site
and plan to cook when I can to save costs. </p>

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy quickly, and was immediately rushed to the hospital where they performed a CT scan; during this scan they concluded that I had sustained a concussion, had frontal lobe brain swelling, and had sprained my neck (cervical sprain).

<p>Pathways
Community School started as a program in a traditional high school in South Los
Angeles.  We built a college-going
culture and a pride in our community that many of our graduates still have
today.  But since as teachers we had no
control over the budget, schedule, staffing or even what classes we taught – we
were powerless to take Pathways to the next level to provide the supports our struggling students needed. </p>
<p>For the past 3
years Dr. Erica Hamilton, the founding lead teacher of the Pathways program and
the founding Executive Director of Pathways Community School has been working
with researchers, teachers, Pathways graduates and their families to design a
school <i>specifically</i> for the students
of South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The result is
the Pathways PATH Plan, a unique combination of specialized inputs designed to
prepare the Pathways graduate for college, career, and life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/149214/files/20131022214803-PATH_program.jpg?1382503683"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are at the
ground floor of starting something amazing and we need you to be a part of
it!  The first $6000 raised for the
Pathways Community School will provide the foundations that we need to build a
school that the students in South LA need. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When we speak
with parents and middle school students about Pathways, they have so many
questions and as we answer them you can see the excitement building within
them… about this new and unique opportunity that will be in <i>their</i> community.  But the challenge we face is in creating
those opportunities to speak directly with parents and students.  In Los Angeles, charter schools are not
allowed to “recruit” new students on traditional school campuses.  This means that in order to reach out to our
future Pathways students, we are making <i>tons</i>
of copies of our informational flyers and distributing them in stores, parking
lots, in neighborhood walks, and in front of middle schools at release
time.  We are throwing small house
parties at the homes of our Pathways graduates and holding community and parent
meetings at the local park.  As the word
spreads, more and more parents and students are joining our events, but we need
to continue them through the new year in order to continue the face to face
engagement that is at the heart of our work. </p>
<p><b>Contribution Levels</b></p>
<p>Thanks to all
the hard work, Pathways is slated to open in the coming school year and we need
your help to keep going strong!</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to
the satisfaction of knowing that you are contributing to the education of
students in South Los Angeles, you will receive a gift from the school to show
our appreciation for your contribution!</p>
<p>At Pathways, our
belief is that students will be successful if we hold high expectations,
communicate and support students to meet those expectations, and celebrate when
those expectations are met.  The
categories of perks match the awards that we celebrate at the end of each
grading period (at which time we also have a parent night). </p>

About us



Pathways
Community School started as a program in a traditional high school in South Los
Angeles.  We built a college-going
culture and a pride in our community that many of our graduates still have
today.  But since as teachers we had no
control over the budget, schedule, staffing or even what classes we taught – we
were powerless to take Pathways to the next level to provide the supports our struggling students needed. 
For the past 3
years Dr. Erica Hamilton, the founding lead teacher of the Pathways program and
the founding Executive Director of Pathways Community School has been working
with researchers, teachers, Pathways graduates and their families to design a
school specifically for the students
of South Los Angeles.
The result is
the Pathways PATH Plan, a unique combination of specialized inputs designed to
prepare the Pathways graduate for college, career, and life.



What we need

We are at the
ground floor of starting something amazing and we need you to be a part of
it!  The first $6000 raised for the
Pathways Community School will provide the foundations that we need to build a
school that the students in South LA need. 

When we speak
with parents and middle school students about Pathways, they have so many
questions and as we answer them you can see the excitement building within
them… about this new and unique opportunity that will be in their community.  But the challenge we face is in creating
those opportunities to speak directly with parents and students.  In Los Angeles, charter schools are not
allowed to “recruit” new students on traditional school campuses.  This means that in order to reach out to our
future Pathways students, we are making tons
of copies of our informational flyers and distributing them in stores, parking
lots, in neighborhood walks, and in front of middle schools at release
time.  We are throwing small house
parties at the homes of our Pathways graduates and holding community and parent
meetings at the local park.  As the word
spreads, more and more parents and students are joining our events, but we need
to continue them through the new year in order to continue the face to face
engagement that is at the heart of our work. 
Contribution Levels
Thanks to all
the hard work, Pathways is slated to open in the coming school year and we need
your help to keep going strong!

In addition to
the satisfaction of knowing that you are contributing to the education of
students in South Los Angeles, you will receive a gift from the school to show
our appreciation for your contribution!
At Pathways, our
belief is that students will be successful if we hold high expectations,
communicate and support students to meet those expectations, and celebrate when
those expectations are met.  The
categories of perks match the awards that we celebrate at the end of each
grading period (at which time we also have a parent night).

their class four years later (CDE, 2012).

</h3><p>Mi Casita Montessori is a project at its inception. We need to raise $4,000 in 40 days to buy Montessori materials to prepare Xela's first authentic Montessori classroom environment. Any amount you can contribute can help so please donate today.<br/></p><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Longer Version:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Located in Quetzaltenango (""Xela""), the second largest city in Guatemala, the Mi Casita Montessori (MCM) will offer an exemplary, authentic<a href=""http://amiusa.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""> </a>Montessori education for children between the ages of three and six. Montessori is a method of education designed to meet each child's developmental needs, to follow each child's unique interests and support each child in developing their human potential. You can read more about what AMI Montessori is <a href=""http://mariamontessori.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">here.</a><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>MCM is directed by Shirley Yancor, an AMI trained Montessori teacher living and working in Xela. In January 2011, after completing her AMI training in Argentina and her practicum in Mexico, Shirley returned to Xela to establish the city's first authentic Montessori program. Committed to AMI Montessori methods, Shirley offers a program supporting the physical, psychological and social development of the whole child. If you're curious about her story, you can find out more about how Shirley became a Montessori teacher <a href=""http://shirleygoesmontessori.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">here</a>. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mi Casita Montessori is located on the boundary between a low-income 
rural community and a middle-class urban community. MCM is dedicated to 
bringing children from diverse backgrounds together to foster 
collaboration and address the educational disparities evidenced in these
 communities. Guided by Dr. Montessori’s methods, Mi Casita Montessori 
will be an environment that follows student’s interests and guides each 
individual towards developing a deep and lasting love for learning, and 
respect for himself and his peers.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>In Xela, where 
access to quality early childhood education is limited, the need for 
this program is great. By building a collaborative and respectful 
community for young learners, united in a caring and nurturing<br/>Montessori learning environment, Mi Casita Montessori endeavors to meet this need.<br/><br/><br/>Montessori materials are precise, scientifically-based and beautiful. A properly prepared Montessori environment engages the child's hand and mind to help them develop their full human potential. By supporting our campaign, you can help us jumpstart a Montessori classroom, providing the children of Xela with the materials needed to become independent, motivated, curious, purposeful, concentrated and peaceful learners.<br/><br/><p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are currently working to fund the purchase of a set of Montessori classroom materials. Montessori materials are precise, carefully crafted and unique to the Montessori method. They support children in developing independence, cultivating their mathematical minds, inspiring curiosity, and emboldening their artistic natures. Moreover, they help young children learn to read, write, count, and more while feeling really good about themselves.<br/><br/><br/>$4,000 will allow us to purchase and ship a classroom's worth of Montessori primary materials critical to the opening of an AMI Montessori classroom. We are using the U.S. distributor, Montessori Outlet as they provide quality, low cost Montessori materials based on the Nienhaus blueprint.<br/><br/><br/>When you donate you can receive some great goodies, and moreover, you can feel good knowing that these kickbacks will help support other amazing non-profits in Xela too!<br/><br/>***Update on kickbacks: We're excited to get these out to you. We anticipate shipping them in August.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about our school! We need all the buzz we can get, so if you're unable to donate at this time, please take the time to forward this to 5, 10, 50, or 1,000 of your friends. The more exposure we get, the more likely it is we will be funded.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Help us become a non-profit organization! Buying materials is just the beginning of starting a school. As the school becomes more established it will need support to fund its potential growth. Current fundraising efforts are being led by a U.S. team of Montessori teachers and assistants.

</div></div>","The Short Version:
Mi Casita Montessori is a project at its inception. We need to raise $4,000 in 40 days to buy Montessori materials to prepare Xela's first authentic Montessori classroom environment. Any amount you can contribute can help so please donate today.

The Longer Version:

Located in Quetzaltenango (""Xela""), the second largest city in Guatemala, the Mi Casita Montessori (MCM) will offer an exemplary, authentic Montessori education for children between the ages of three and six. Montessori is a method of education designed to meet each child's developmental needs, to follow each child's unique interests and support each child in developing their human potential. You can read more about what AMI Montessori is here.

MCM is directed by Shirley Yancor, an AMI trained Montessori teacher living and working in Xela. In January 2011, after completing her AMI training in Argentina and her practicum in Mexico, Shirley returned to Xela to establish the city's first authentic Montessori program. Committed to AMI Montessori methods, Shirley offers a program supporting the physical, psychological and social development of the whole child. If you're curious about her story, you can find out more about how Shirley became a Montessori teacher here.

The Impact

Mi Casita Montessori is located on the boundary between a low-income 
rural community and a middle-class urban community. MCM is dedicated to 
bringing children from diverse backgrounds together to foster 
collaboration and address the educational disparities evidenced in these
 communities. Guided by Dr. Montessori’s methods, Mi Casita Montessori 
will be an environment that follows student’s interests and guides each 
individual towards developing a deep and lasting love for learning, and 
respect for himself and his peers.
In Xela, where 
access to quality early childhood education is limited, the need for 
this program is great. By building a collaborative and respectful 
community for young learners, united in a caring and nurturingMontessori learning environment, Mi Casita Montessori endeavors to meet this need.Montessori materials are precise, scientifically-based and beautiful. A properly prepared Montessori environment engages the child's hand and mind to help them develop their full human potential. By supporting our campaign, you can help us jumpstart a Montessori classroom, providing the children of Xela with the materials needed to become independent, motivated, curious, purposeful, concentrated and peaceful learners.

What We Need & What You GetWe are currently working to fund the purchase of a set of Montessori classroom materials. Montessori materials are precise, carefully crafted and unique to the Montessori method. They support children in developing independence, cultivating their mathematical minds, inspiring curiosity, and emboldening their artistic natures. Moreover, they help young children learn to read, write, count, and more while feeling really good about themselves.$4,000 will allow us to purchase and ship a classroom's worth of Montessori primary materials critical to the opening of an AMI Montessori classroom. We are using the U.S. distributor, Montessori Outlet as they provide quality, low cost Montessori materials based on the Nienhaus blueprint.When you donate you can receive some great goodies, and moreover, you can feel good knowing that these kickbacks will help support other amazing non-profits in Xela too!***Update on kickbacks: We're excited to get these out to you. We anticipate shipping them in August.

Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word about our school! We need all the buzz we can get, so if you're unable to donate at this time, please take the time to forward this to 5, 10, 50, or 1,000 of your friends. The more exposure we get, the more likely it is we will be funded.

Help us become a non-profit organization! Buying materials is just the beginning of starting a school. As the school becomes more established it will need support to fund its potential growth. Current fundraising efforts are being led by a U.S. team of Montessori teachers and assistants. If you can offer your services as a lawyer or are familiar with getting non-profits off the ground, please feel free to get in touch with us.

<h2>CURRENT SITUATION IN JAPAN</h2>
<p><strong></strong>It's been a little bit more than a year since the tsunami hit the northeastern coast of Japan. More than 15,000 people have died, and thousands are still missing. The nuclear leakage from the Fukushima power plant has forced thousands of people, many of them farmers, to abandon their homes and fields. One year later, still too contaminated with radiation for reentry, the area is a no-man's land. Across the country, no one knows for certain how safe their water and food are. It is a tremendous source of anxiety, especially for mothers of small children. Powerful aftershocks continue to shake the entire country, further aggravating people’s fear and stress. The media, moreover, compound those fears by announcing with certainty that another large earthquake and tsunami is due at any moment.</p>

We don't hear so much about the darkness that continues to prey on this country that already for many years has had the highest rates of suicide in the world. That rate has greatly increased since the disaster. Many are elderly people left with no place to live and no one taking care of them. Having lived all their life in a remote area of Japan, it is unthinkable for many of them to suddenly start up a new life in a strange new place. People who lost their businesses or even their entire families feel hopeless. It has become almost the norm to experience depression, despair, and anxiety, and there is not enough spiritual and moral support to help those who suffer from post-traumatic stress.

<h2><strong>BRINGING MINDFULNESS PRACTICE TO JAPAN<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Although Japan is nominally a Buddhist country, most Japanese will tell you they only go to temples for funeral ceremonies. Mindfulness is a form of mind training taught by the Buddha in which the practitioner comes back to abide peacefully in the present moment and embrace all aspects of the present-moment experience.

<p>In May 2012, Buddhist monks and nuns from the Plum Village Meditation Center in France will be visiting to offer introductory workshops on mindfulness. <strong>They are students of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, one of the most renowned Buddhist teachers in the world and a pioneer of teaching mindfulness in the West.</strong> <strong>They will offer practical exercises in mindfulness of breath, body and mind, and share ways to cope with stress, release tension, and handle strong emotions including anger, loneliness and despair.

<p>CBF will build a computer system with custom installed education tools based on needs, location, local requirements, etc.  We will start with different education tracks that they can choose from, both online and locally installed, starting with ESL (English as a Second Language), math, science, and computer programming as possible options for them to use.  We will then look at what local needs they may have, and work with them on more custom options.</p>
<p>These systems will be installed in impoverished locations around the world, with an emphasis on helping children supplement their current education.  Each location will be given e-mail access, a portal to check for education updates, and access to talk to other network members to ask questions or pass ideas along to.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On Decemeber 14, 2012 the lives of the students of Sandy Hook Elementary were changed forever. </p>
<p>There's been a lot of coverage of the shooter but not enough of the children. </p>
<p>These kids are going to be scared to go back to school, and a child should NEVER be afraid of the place where they are supposed to be the safest. It's up to us as a community to reach out. It could have been OUR children, brothers, sisters, grandchildren, nephews, or nieces.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, money isn't going to help these kids. It's HEALING that will. So let's drum a little something up to help the school begin that process.</p>
<p>Let's start a fund for an after school art program that is going to help these kids express the emotions they are feeling and really begin the recovery process. It's not going to happen overnight, but we can absolutely make a difference.</p>
<p>My Heart goes out to the families. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is $2,700. That's a $100 for every victim in the shooting.</p>
<p>Donate whatever you can, every little bit matters. These kids are worth it.</p>
<p>****UPDATE**** </p>
<p>We've reached our goal! But the more we raise the longer we can keep this running! So let's keep it going!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Art is one of the most valuable outlets for emotion, relief, and healing.</p>
<p>Unfourtunately, it's also the first program that being cut in most elementary schools. Let's reverse that for these kids, they really need it. We don't want these children feeling like they are alone... and if they can't find the words to tell us how they feel, let them show us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A child's artwork can be incredibly telling and I foresee this doing 3 things.</p>
<p>1. Giving kids an outlet to show us how they feel.</p>
<p>2. Allowing the kids to take their mind off it for a bit.</p>
<p>3. Alerting the right people which kids are having a more difficult time dealing with it, so they can get the help they need.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There's always a million ways to help and show you care. Let's flood the school with support. Send letters, drawings, photos... anything you can to help them feel our support as a community. </p>

<h3>Moira Johnston is an advocate for a woman's right to go topless in public.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Moira Johnston graduated with a BA in Sociology from Temple University. She now teaches yoga and participates in independent topless activism in public and private spheres.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Topless activism promotes breast health, positive self body image, and equality between the sexes. Going topless can increase a person's feeling of comfort, and increases Vitamin D absorption through exposure to the sun. The activism encourages freedom of expression and empowers women to define for themselves when and for what reasons to bare their breasts.</p>
<p><br/>Topless activism supports the case for breastfeeding and helps people to overcome prejudice and cultivate tolerance for cultural diversity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contributing funds increases the availability of time Moira Johnston will be able to invest in the activism, rather than spending time generating income through work. Funds will be placed towards various travel costs around areas of demonstration and throughout the country and will help to cover cost of supplies, such as pasties, yoga mats, sunscreen, and any other necessary materials for Moira and others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yoga mats will be provided for participants in outdoor yoga classes for topless women and their advocates, which Moira will instruct and implement free of charge to participants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please feel free to contribute in proportion to your preference or level of support to the cause. Your contribution will be greatly appreciated, and used with care. This opportunity was made available due to several inquiries from people interested in making a contribution to this cause. Thank you!</p>

The kids lit up when they were presented with the gifts (they were a HUGE success) and I would love to do something similiar again this year. We are getting a really late start (life has gotten in the way), so the surprise will be a bit dependent on the funds we are able to raise. I would ideally like to present each kid with a digital album (there are reasonably priced portable ones that the kids would love). I plan to spend every healthly moment I have on-site again to capture photos and video.</p>

<p>We are hoping to raise funds beyond the goal you see listed, but I am keeping it conservative because last year we didn't quite make goal and were hit with significant fees. We have 125 campers this year, so we ideally need to raise $5,000 to pull this off ($40 per camper - after all the fees, we receive closer to $30). I know times are still really hard for many...but each and every dollar counts...so even if you have just $1 to donate, please consider doing so. If each person I knew on Facebook alone donated just $1, we would be 1/3 of our way to our true goal.</p>

An investment in me is an investment in a vision for a thriving, grounded, self-aware generation of young people - the very young people poised to take over leading & evolving our planet! It's easy to see our systems are on life-support, and some would argue that if we don't transform our lifestyle in this lifetime, the human species will perish. Young people hold the key to this transformation - but we cannot do it without wisdom, leadership, self-love, and DANCE! By investing in me, you will bring us just a little bit closer. Other Ways You Can HelpNot able to contribute financially? No problem! Just help me spread the word! And when the time comes, send me your friends, children, relatives, and students to DANCE DANCE DANCE. In love & gratitude.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is the Animation is Art experience?</h3>
<p>What we want to do is bring the community aspects of a convention to a retail experience! This means that we are raising money to improve our equipment and to add stability to the store for events! These are the kinds of events we want to be able to run at the store.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Educational Panels and showings. We will also video tape some of these events and make them available online or even stream them online! We have the space for up to 30+ people in the store at once.<br/>
</li>
<li>We have the space, the connections, and the equipment to do events like Guest Autograph Sessions, cultural parties, fun panels, an artist's alley weekend, charity events, meet ups, Streetpass Aurora events, Disney Pin Swaps, and so forth.<br/>
</li>
<li>Coloradoanime.info is a resource we also hope to launch. The idea behind Coloradoanime.info is to collect all the information for the dozens of anime conventions, meet up groups, high school groups, college groups, and events into one all encompassing ""wiki"" of the amazing Anime Community, here in Colorado. We will also have pages in it with profiles for local artists, cosplayers, and so forth.</li>
<li>This will also benefit and help launch the Suki Nihon Society for cultural appreciation. This will be a group that meets twice a month to discuss -via a round table- the anime community at large and the issues that affect it. These events will be taped in both audio and video. We are hoping to get some of the most prominent and opinionated people for each round table. We may even be able to Skype in industry professionals!</li>
<li>We will also be able to hold art shows and have interesting memorabilia. When we started, we wanted to make sure we had something amazing at the store, every month. This fell a bit to the way side because of the issues and problems we have had to face.<br/>
</li>
<li>The Animation community in Colorado is amazing and also a bit ""fractured."" We hope to make our store, and the experience of our store, a neutral force that brings people together.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are building a community center out of a retail store and we need your help!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will we be spending this money on?</h3>
<p>Let me break down a bit of what we need and why we need it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we started up, we were not able to secure enough funding from the banking system. We wanted $50,000 or -at least- $30,000. We got $15,000 and they (Chase) changed the nature of the loan from an SBA to an ABA loan during that process. The same banking system that got over $7,000,000,000,000 from our government. So, we ended up with an extremely slim chance at life. It's a miracle we lived a year and we have everyone in the community to thank for that. Which is why it's time for us to start becoming more stable and start giving back even more to the community! This money will go toward stability, and more equipment for events. Some of the events will involve funds of their own; but those will be to get certain guests like voice actors, animators, or musicians into the store for events! Not everyone can afford to go to the amazing conventions we have in the Denver/Aurora area. Sometimes those sell out to capacity as well and people miss out. That is sad and part of the reason we want to get healthy and stable enough to bring those kinds of amazing events to our community. We also want to work with many of the other groups in the area for events. In order to do that, we need to be stable.<br/>
</li>
<li>We hope to meet or even exceed our funding goal. But if we do not meet that goal, everything that is sent to us will still go toward stability. We are working on as much as we can to build up a foundation and fix our current situation..</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will my donation mean?<br/>
</h3>
<p>The first and foremost reason for Animation is Art to exist is to give back to the community that we love by providing product and events that we hope the community will love:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our stability as a community center means that we will be here for the students of the high schools in our neighborhood. We are a safe, non-judgmental store where we treat animation as a brilliant medium. Our name is not the name of a store; but a statement of truth. Our purpose is to spread that message. Animation IS art and is a significant part of our culture, history, and lives. Sometimes, people visit us just to talk and hang out while discussing the shows, manga, and other products they like. We are not a huge, corporate store like Toys R Us or Barnes &amp; Noble, where the experience is a lot less personal. We want to share the joy and pride that animation brings to us in a personal way. In a way that respects the art and welcomes new appreciation for the greatest of crafts.<br/>
</li>
<li>Animation is Art will work with DMG Ice, Area DMG, and Radio DMG when it comes to the release of original content on the internet. We will tape many of the events and be able to make that experience available for everyone on the internet. You will be able to join us at Animation is Art at any time and from any where!<br/>
</li>
<li>Through our Green Cross Commission Program, we are able to highlight and celebrate the local artists of our area of Colorado. Colorado is an amazing place and the community here will be highlighted and shared with the rest of the world.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What other ways can I help?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Sigh. Times are tough. However, there are many ways to help us out:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign and make some noise! Post it on Reddit, on Facebook, on whatever social networks you use. Let people know about us!</li>
<li>If you live in the area and you have never been by the store, stop on by and say hello! Even if you never buy anything or put a penny toward us, just being there and talking with us is reward enough. Come on in and argue over which Studio Ghibli film is the best. Discuss that cray-cray episode of Gravity Falls. Why not come in and tell me all about your Bubbleine fan fiction. A community needs everyone and accepts everyone. Join our Facebook and talk with us. Just make some noise!</li>

<p><span>Hello My name is Corrie Ayers. I would like to invite you into my world and share about some amazing kids that I have met!</span></p>
<p><span> Over the past 5 years I have been privileged to work with children and youth that live all over the world. These kids are referred to as Third Culture Kids. As a result of working with these kids, I have created a non-profit education business called Club 4th. The goal of Club 4th is to provide these kids a safe place to meet, make friends and go deep in their walk with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span>Club 4th has been created to come alongside them and their parents, helping them to understand more about who they are, embrace where God has them and to go deep in their relationship with God.  We do that by using the club model - drawing people with similar interests and background together to help learn from each other, share stories and life together. We use the platform of spiritual life conferences to do this. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>Club 4th is at a crossroads. The teams that have been sent out through  Club 4th have done their jobs well and as a result, I have more requests for teams than I can fill.  The organization of Club 4th provides the needed infrastructure to share the vision, but what is lacking is resources - to use with the kids as well as to train the teams well before they leave. </span></p>
<p><span>The money will go towards the following projects:</span></p>
<h3><span>Curriculum Development:</span></h3>
<p><span> Because I am a teacher, I love to bring resources to the kids that engages them, that helps them to learn in a fun way and that includes physical activities to illustrate the point of the lesson. Since I am the only business that will provide programming for children birth -18, I also look for ways to teach across the spectrum of ages. Sadly there is not much written in the western world that will work with these kids. They don’t have the same background. They don’t share the same humor and don’t have the same points of reference. I have some teachers and trainers who are ready to go to work on writing curriculum to use at the camps that will be specifically targeted to TCK”s  - their needs and their experiences. </span></p>
<h3><span>Website development: </span></h3>
<p><span>The also need a safe place to share pictures and stay connected with their mentors.  I have a team of people ready to go who can build a web site just for them - where they can share pictures and their lives with their mentors from the camp. It will also serve to educate others about TCK’s, who they are and how Club 4th meets their needs.</span></p>
<h3><span>Other projects/needs: </span></h3>
<p><span>There are also other projects that need funding as well - Any money that comes in over and above the $3,500, will be applied to purchasing other resources needed for the program. Items like toys for the preschool age children, books for giving out to the children and pea pods (little tents) to use to nap the babies in. </span></p>
<p>Because this is an Olympic year, I am looking for poeple to come alongside and join the support team. There are various rewards for joining the team - Consider joining the Club 4th ""Olympic"" team by supporting Club 4th financially! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I have worked with these kids, they are so excited that I keep coming back and am working on designing curricululm and programs just for them - to meet their needs. The kids love that someone out there sees their needs and is willing to travel half way around the world to meet their needs. The impact will have lasting and eternal impact on their lives. Here are some of the comments from those who have attended a Club 4th Camp:</p>
<p>""Thank you for loving our children by taking the time to learn about them and to help them understand who they are. It means so much to us."" - Parent of 3 teenagers</p>
<p>""Thak you for leading this program for us. It has been an amazing week and I really benefitted from this week and have grown spiritually."" - 18 year old Male</p>
<p>""You have the perfect balance between everything while you are teaching. I was never bored and enjoyed the lessons a lot. I learned a lot - more here than at any other camp I have been at. Thank you so much for coming and encouraging me so much. "" - 16 year old female</p>
<p>These programs mean a great deal to the kids and their parents. The impact will be felt for generations to come! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can also help Club 4th by becoming a faithful prayer warrior or by joining a team and going on a trip. I would love to see you on a trip! You will be changed forever and will recieve more than you give! </p>

<h3>Hello everyone my name is Selina and I live in Howard County Md. I am doing a cut a thon to support the Howard County Autism Society. </h3>
<p>Your donation will support families in Howard County who are living with a loved one with autism.  There is no known cause of autism, and no cure.  Autism affects individuals without regard to race, ethnicity, social boundaries, family income, lifestyle, or educational level.  Autism affects each individual differently.  Some individuals are deeply affected and require constant supervision, some are non-verbal and extremely anti-social, and others may have limited understanding of what is being said. Still others, characterized as high functioning, have excellent verbal and communication skills and may have an extremely high intellect.  </p>
<p>Notably, the prevalence of autism eclipses every other childhood disease. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) adjusted the prevalance of autism from 1 in 110, to 1 in 88.  Howard County itself has become a destination for families of children with autism spectrum disorders.  Consequently the county has the highest incidence of autism in the state at 1 in 73 (vs. 1 in 88 nationally).  </p>
<p> I am a mom of a three year old daughter and we live in Howard County. The Howard County Autism Society has helped us so much and I would like to help them raise more funds so that they can help others as much as they have helped us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Hair Salon event will take place on October 13th at Absolute Hair Design located at 2470 Longstone Lane, Suite D, Marriottsville, MD.  I have recruited 13 stylists who will, FOR FREE, cut the hair of children with autism, from 10:00 am to 12:00pm.  Then at noon it’s time to turn the salon over to the adults for two hours.  Adults may elect to procure a number of services at a reduced rate, including: Cuts with blow dry, Shampoo &amp; blow dry, Seated 30 minute massage, Manicures, Eyebrow wax, and Cuts for Men and children.<br/>

<ul>
<li>We are a Mexican non-profit established in 2004.  In just under a decade, with our invisible wand and the heart and hands of many people, La Catalina has performed educational miracles that have changed the lives of young and old alike in La Manzanilla, Jalisco---a village nestled on the beautiful Pacific Coast.</li>
<li>We provide a wide range of free educational opportunities for our underprivileged residents, in a town where only 1/3 of the teens finishing middle school went on to high school and only 1 in 25 youth went to university.  Now those stats are changing quickly, with the development of our Educational Center and over 30 youth a year that receive scholarships from our foundation!</li>
<li>With the Educational Center we built in 2006, where classes and training are totally free of charge, residents now have a place they can go and improve their skills in a wide range of areas, including learning English, developing artistic skills, receiving tutoring and more!   </li>
<li>The latest project at our Center is setting up a computer literacy lab and that’s where WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this dream come to its fruition!!!  With a generous donation of $10,000 that the Foundation already received in April of 2013, we are currently reconditioning a classroom to set it up as a computer lab and will be able to buy an estimated first 5 computers for the lab.  But this is not enough computers to serve our community. We still need an additional 10 computers, software and other equipment for the lab to make it fully functional. </li>
<li>Your donation will help our disadvantaged Mexican youth be able to enter the wider universe of technology and adults that are just as eager to learn, too!</li>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming to raise $5500US in just 30-days to be able to finish setting up the computer literacy lab.  This $5500US will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 desktop computers @ $450US each=$4500US</li>
<li>$1000US software and computer set up costs</li>
</ul><p>You can be a part of this project, by making a donation to our Foundation! </p>
<p>Even if we don’t make $5500 in 30-days, every dollar you donate will go towards buying as many computers as we can!  This is a sure-fire project, as the lab is scheduled to open in mid June of 2013, but in order to serve the community and be able to start classes and training there, we NEED to complete the project by raising the funds for the additional computers.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>La Catalina Foundation currently has 32 students who receive a scholarship to attend high school and college and many of these kids would have already dropped out of school without this critical support.  Scholarships to high school are needed, as there is currently no high school in our town, so it is costly and difficult for teens to go to one of the neighboring high schools, 30 minutes away. </p>
<p>These students are now required to do their school work on computers, but most don’t have access to computers and can’t afford to be paying an hourly rental fee to use them. Many get discouraged, as you will see in our video, and even drop out because they feel they can’t keep up with their homework without a computer.</p>
<p>So you can change lives and keep the youth in school by helping complete our computer literacy lab.  The lab will also give adults who have minimal education a chance to chance to develop computer literacy skills and opening their world to wider horizons and more employment opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!</li>
<li>You can use Indiegogo share tools!</li>

The latest project at our Center is setting up a computer literacy lab and that’s where WE NEED YOUR HELP to make this dream come to its fruition!!!  With a generous donation of $10,000 that the Foundation already received in April of 2013, we are currently reconditioning a classroom to set it up as a computer lab and will be able to buy an estimated first 5 computers for the lab.  But this is not enough computers to serve our community. We still need an additional 10 computers, software and other equipment for the lab to make it fully functional. 
Your donation will help our disadvantaged Mexican youth be able to enter the wider universe of technology and adults that are just as eager to learn, too!
What We Need & What You Get
We are aiming to raise $5500US in just 30-days to be able to finish setting up the computer literacy lab.  This $5500US will pay for:

10 desktop computers @ $450US each=$4500US
$1000US software and computer set up costs
You can be a part of this project, by making a donation to our Foundation! 
Even if we don’t make $5500 in 30-days, every dollar you donate will go towards buying as many computers as we can!  This is a sure-fire project, as the lab is scheduled to open in mid June of 2013, but in order to serve the community and be able to start classes and training there, we NEED to complete the project by raising the funds for the additional computers.
The Impact
La Catalina Foundation currently has 32 students who receive a scholarship to attend high school and college and many of these kids would have already dropped out of school without this critical support.  Scholarships to high school are needed, as there is currently no high school in our town, so it is costly and difficult for teens to go to one of the neighboring high schools, 30 minutes away. 
These students are now required to do their school work on computers, but most don’t have access to computers and can’t afford to be paying an hourly rental fee to use them. Many get discouraged, as you will see in our video, and even drop out because they feel they can’t keep up with their homework without a computer.
So you can change lives and keep the youth in school by helping complete our computer literacy lab.  The lab will also give adults who have minimal education a chance to chance to develop computer literacy skills and opening their world to wider horizons and more employment opportunities.

<p>Mercury Astronaut Scott Carpenter imagined living under the sea long before Spongebob Squarepants.  So he did (but never in a pineapple.)  Instead, his first time under the sea (in Sealab) was in 1965, where he proved he had the right stuff (again) and broke the record of human underwater habitation for an entire 30 days.  (There's a funny tale about the President of the United States calling him thereafter and Carpenter sounding like Donald Duck from the decompression chamber he was hanging out in at the time, but that's another story.  Google it.)</p>
<p>Flash forward a few years, and imagine an important space-related artifact named after Carpenter languishing in a warehouse.  That's what we discovered a few months ago when we found the Scott Carpenter Station.  ""You want it, you can have it"" said NASA to us (we're the Space Foundation, an international non-profit headquartered in Colorado Springs.)</p>
<ul>
<li>We've been around since 1983. </li>
<li>Our Space Foundation Discovery Center just opened in October 2012 and is already out of room!</li>
<li>We're in the process of doubling our physical footprint so we can show even more space artifacts and educational exhibits.</li>
<li>Support this and you'll be part of something big, actually preserving history for kids to see and learn from. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The Station is in pretty rough shape right now.  The two floation/viewing tubes are a mess -- one was hacksawed off of the Station, the other is partially broken.</p>
<p>Good news!  The interior is in pretty darned good shape and won't need a lot of work.</p>
<p>The exterior needs to be repaired where it's rusted, and the whole thing needs a good professional paint job to restore it to how it looked back in the day.</p>
<p>We also need to have an exhibit fabricated where the Station will be displayed.</p>
<h3>What You Get!</h3>
<p>Research says that giving stimulates the brain's production of oxytocin, a feel-good hormone.  So first of all, you'll feel great!</p>
<p>Seriously, though, check out the perks (below) and know that EVERBODY who participates in this effort will be listed in our annual report and on-line (unless you tell us otherwise.)  And because the Space Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, your donation is tax deductable to the extent allowed by law.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
Our goal is to inspire kids -- especially girls and underserved kids -- to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) -- this is where innovation STEMs from.  It's good for the economy, it's good for our country, and it's just plain good. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the Discovery Center opened in October 2012, we've had nearly 10,000 visitors (and we've only been open two days a week.)  This summer, we'll be open five days a week (Tuesdays through Saturdays). Once Phase II is completed (late this year) we anticipate even more visitors.  </div>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Crystal, I am 33 years old and I am looking for funding to help me work with ME sufferers, a subject that is very close to my heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ME, also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, is an illness that I suffered from for 6 years from the age of 19 to 25. Those of you who know of the illness will understand how debilitating this illness is, those of you who don’t…well this is my story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was a bright, energetic, happy and passionate young woman full of dreams and goals for my future as a budding singer and dancer that had even had interest from Polydor record label. Sadly at the age of 19 I was struck down by a very sudden and extreme illness…ME. At first I didn’t understand what was happening to me and with little help from the doctors, who prescribed anti-depressants, I gradually deteriorated. It started with panic attacks, light sensitivity, body aches and coldness and numbness of the limbs to the extent of even tripping over my own feet. This then lead to extreme and relentless exhaustion that couldn’t be relieved by sleep, I would wake up in the morning and at best would walk down the stairs to lie on the sofa all day before returning to my bed again that night. At this stage I would refer to myself as the living dead, alive, but unable to take part in any kind of life, this was the worst stage it got to for me, but some sufferers end up in wheelchairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1999, when I fell ill, ME was little known and often scoffed at and referred to as Yuppie Flu (an ignorant term originating in the US Media). I remember people asking what was wrong with me, was I depressed and perhaps I needed more sleep. At this stage I decided to withdraw myself from the life I had known and go into hiding so that I didn’t have to constantly try and explain something I didn’t really understand myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through living a gentle and healthy life and being cared for by my mum and boyfriend I managed to make a very slow recovery and by the age of 25 I found myself able to be back in full time employment and living in London with the idea of resuming my dream of following my passion for singing. This was short lived and I found myself 3 years down the line at 28 years old with full blown ME again. I couldn’t believe it, my whole life was being ripped away again, I was back living with my mum and unable to work. I felt that I couldn’t do this again and if I had to I would rather be dead. Thankfully My mum came across a flyer advertising something called the ‘Lightning Process’ it claimed that by using this process you could become ME free in as little as 3 days. This sounded very radical to me, but there was a testimonial by Esther Ranson (a British talk show host), that this process had helped her daughter recover, so I thought, hey I’ve got nothing to lose, and gave them a call. After having completed the process I was back in London within 1 month, working full time and living the life I loved again. I couldn’t believe my luck!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through discovering this process and having this life tool available to me I have reclaimed my life and I want other sufferers to be able to do the same. I would like to study this programme to become a Practitioner of this process, so that I can dedicate my life to helping sufferers regain theirs</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ME strikes people of all ages (including very young children and very old people) from all social classes. There seems to be more women than men with ME and the reasons for this are not known. One thing is true of the vast majority of people with ME - they want to get better. The idea that people with this illness somehow ‘want to be ill’ or that they are ‘malingering’ is absolute nonsense. Most of them had an active enjoyable lifestyle before becoming ill and would like nothing more than to return to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ME patients suffer in silence and withdrawing from society, never living a full and happy life. It isn’t uncommon for people to suffer this debilitating illness for 10 years or more, some never recover at all, this truly is a wasted life. After having lived through this myself and knowing how to recover quickly, I feel I have to share this knowledge and want so much to be part of spreading the word of this amazing training that is being offered. My life’s mission now is to help others recover as I have done and regain the life they loved and lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to study a diploma in NLP and Hypnotherapy, complete a master Practitioner certificate in NLP and then go on to train in the ‘Lightning Process’ (aptly named due to the speed of recovery) at the Phil Parker Training Institute. This process will take a year and will cost me £5,000. On completion of the course, I plan to set myself up as a practitioner and help spread the word of this amazing life tool, by helping ME sufferers to recover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help me fund this course, it is an extremely worthy cause and will help so many people reclaim the lives they lost…I know at least 7 sufferers, how many do you know?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is an interesting article printed in the Guardian, it just shows how unsupported ME sufferers really are <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/08/me-misunderstood-health-welfare"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/a...</a><br/></p></span></div>","Hi,

NCLI is raising funds that will be given to the participating children as seed capital to start their lemonade stands.  As we all know, it takes money to make money.  The youth will need to obtain materials to build their lemonade stands and signs, as well as supplies to make and serve the lemonade.  Youth Lemonade Day is important because it gives the participating youth access to a fun and educational summer activity that can teach them life-long lessons about entrepreneurship.  The Youth Lemonade Day Seed Capital Campaign is important because many of the youth in Franklin County are in low to moderate income households and may not have access to the modest amount of funds needed to start a lemonade stand.  It is important that we reach and provide this valuable educational experience to as many children as we can.What We Need & What You GetHere is what we need and what you get:
We need $5,000 that will be divided among the participating youth. We expect at approximately 250 youth to participate in the seed capital program by submitting a short video explaining their lemonade stand idea and what they will do with the seed capital.  

Your support is very important to us and the children.
The rewards ranging from a ""Lemonade Shout Out"" to ""Youth Lemonade Day T-Shirts"" to ""Customized Sponsorship Packages"" that you will receive for your contributions.  So, in addition to some good lemonade, our goal is to make this a sweet deal for everyone!    

The funds we raise fund the seed capital pool and gets distributed to the children.  If we do not reach our goal, the funds are still distributed to the children, however, the amount available to each child will be reduced.   

Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute to the seed capital campaign right now, you can still help us out:
You can get the word out and make some noise about Youth Lemonade Day and the Youth Lemonade Day Seed Capital Campaign.
Share it with your family and friends via email, on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and other social media.  

You can also tell people about it and ask them to look us up on Indiegogo.com.  

We thank you for all that you do to support Youth Lemonade Day Seed Capital Campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><span><strong>With your contribution </strong></span></h2>
<h3>I will complete the OneTaste Coaching and Orgasmic Meditation (OM) Trainer program. This will allow me to supporting my clients to:</h3>
<p>• Experience more intimacy and aliveness in sex</p>
<p>• Feel viscerally connected to others</p>
<p>• Understand and express their desire</p>
<p>• Identify and integrate their shadow </p>
<p>• Engage and move through confronting situations</p>
<p>• Approach relationships with greater curiosity, creativity, and depth</p>
<p>• Communicate powerfully in and outside of the bedroom</p>
<p>• Cultivate energy and responsiveness that inspires every area of their lives</p>
<p>• Move through the fear, shame and taboo that arise with sex</p>
<p>• Learn the OM practice step-by-step</p>
<p>• Understand sexual anatomy and clitoral mapping</p>
<p>• Troubleshoot OM problem areas, including posture, stroking and finding the spot</p>
<p>• Develop an OM practice routine that works</p>
<p>• Understand and integrate key OM exercises</p>
<p>• Communicate effectively during the practice</p>
<p>• Expand their capacity to feel and pay attention in OM and life</p>
<h2><span><strong>What Turns Me On?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>I dream of a world filled with more intimacy &amp; personal connection. A time where everyone is comfortable living from a place of desire...</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I teach a coupled sensuality practice called Orgasmic Meditation (OM). It is a daily sexual meditation where two people intensely put their attention on each other for 15 minutes in a very specific way. This practice teaches women to come more into their sexuality and men to begin to identify and name their visceral sensations. By balancing these polls men and women can move forward together, more powerfully.</span></p>
<p><span>I found Orgasmic Meditation about a year ago and before I even experienced my first OM I signed up to take the training course! After reading just the basic information about this practice I quickly understood how it could transform my life, to fill the void that I had been longing to fill with a lover. I also immediately knew I wanted to share this with the world because there's not one person I know that doesn't want more intimacy and connection!</span></p>
<p><span>After taking the OM Training course I began teaching the practice. It was around the holidays last year that I began training sessions with friends to fulfill my hours for certification - and what a blast I was having! I got to witness people turn on to the possibilities of Orgasmic Meditation. As I explained the philosophy and tenets of OM and brought them through the steps of OM, I could see them begin to apply a regular practice to their lives (in their minds) and light up with delight. After just an hour of training, my clients were already turned on!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>But that's just not enough!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I quickly realized that teaching the Orgasmic Meditation Practice is not enough for me to truly hold space, a large enough container, for my clients. My clients want more from me and I really want to deliver! This is why I'm heading back down to OneTaste in San Francisco to take the Coaching Program. It is a 10 month program that will give me the tools to guide my clients through the unique maze of sexuality, intimacy, connection, and living from a completely turned on place of existence!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>What has Orgasmic Meditation opened up for me?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>I used to think I was a turned on woman, completely powerful in my sexuality. I stood, unwavering, if anyone wanted to speak about sex. I was righteous in my beliefs about what good sex and sexual relations were. I gave very sage advise to anyone (and there were many) who would ask me sexual questions. I innately knew what great sex/relation was supposed to look like, I just wasn't experiencing it! I was in a place of lack &amp; frustration, but hopeful...</span></p>
<p><strong>After just 9 months of consistent OMing</strong></p>
<p><span>I was finally able to stop blaming others for my lack of satisfaction, lack of communication skills that I needed to express my desires, and my lack of intimacy. I've taken responsibility of my ability to receive pleasure. I stopped looking for love in all the wrong places and began filling myself up by OMing. Now that I'm filled up to running over, I can say that I am truly a Turned On woman! My ability to experience pleasure has increased and continues to do so. The expansive orgasm that is created within the OM feeds and energizes me throughout the day. I live my life using my desire as a compass.</span></p>
<p><span>I solve problems in a new and exciting way... one can apply anything that they would like to work on or practice or get better at to an OM. OM is an opportunity to work on it in the safe container, get good at it, and then take it out to the real world with confidence!</span></p>
<p><span>There is a communication skill set that is used in Orgasmic Meditation that is priceless. It's simple and effective, clean and concise, easy to understand and interpret. I practice it in my daily OMs and use it in all ares of my life, with the greatest of ease! (well, I'm getting there!)</span></p>
<p><span>Now that I'm full I don't feel needy, graspy, or desperate. When I stopped feeling those ways a personal relationship dropped into my life that is wonderful. We have an OM practice and it has been a great foundation for connection and intimacy, sexual exploration and communication. It has opened so many conversations that may not have ever been discussed, but by digging into our desires, fears, resistance and willingness we have gone really deep in a short period of time.

</div></div>","With your contribution 
I will complete the OneTaste Coaching and Orgasmic Meditation (OM) Trainer program. This will allow me to supporting my clients to:
• Experience more intimacy and aliveness in sex
• Feel viscerally connected to others
• Understand and express their desire
• Identify and integrate their shadow 
• Engage and move through confronting situations
• Approach relationships with greater curiosity, creativity, and depth
• Communicate powerfully in and outside of the bedroom
• Cultivate energy and responsiveness that inspires every area of their lives
• Move through the fear, shame and taboo that arise with sex
• Learn the OM practice step-by-step
• Understand sexual anatomy and clitoral mapping
• Troubleshoot OM problem areas, including posture, stroking and finding the spot
• Develop an OM practice routine that works
• Understand and integrate key OM exercises
• Communicate effectively during the practice
• Expand their capacity to feel and pay attention in OM and life
What Turns Me On?
I dream of a world filled with more intimacy & personal connection. A time where everyone is comfortable living from a place of desire...
I teach a coupled sensuality practice called Orgasmic Meditation (OM). It is a daily sexual meditation where two people intensely put their attention on each other for 15 minutes in a very specific way. This practice teaches women to come more into their sexuality and men to begin to identify and name their visceral sensations. By balancing these polls men and women can move forward together, more powerfully.
I found Orgasmic Meditation about a year ago and before I even experienced my first OM I signed up to take the training course! After reading just the basic information about this practice I quickly understood how it could transform my life, to fill the void that I had been longing to fill with a lover. I also immediately knew I wanted to share this with the world because there's not one person I know that doesn't want more intimacy and connection!
After taking the OM Training course I began teaching the practice. It was around the holidays last year that I began training sessions with friends to fulfill my hours for certification - and what a blast I was having! I got to witness people turn on to the possibilities of Orgasmic Meditation. As I explained the philosophy and tenets of OM and brought them through the steps of OM, I could see them begin to apply a regular practice to their lives (in their minds) and light up with delight. After just an hour of training, my clients were already turned on!
But that's just not enough!
I quickly realized that teaching the Orgasmic Meditation Practice is not enough for me to truly hold space, a large enough container, for my clients. My clients want more from me and I really want to deliver! This is why I'm heading back down to OneTaste in San Francisco to take the Coaching Program. It is a 10 month program that will give me the tools to guide my clients through the unique maze of sexuality, intimacy, connection, and living from a completely turned on place of existence!
 
What has Orgasmic Meditation opened up for me?
I used to think I was a turned on woman, completely powerful in my sexuality. I stood, unwavering, if anyone wanted to speak about sex. I was righteous in my beliefs about what good sex and sexual relations were. I gave very sage advise to anyone (and there were many) who would ask me sexual questions. I innately knew what great sex/relation was supposed to look like, I just wasn't experiencing it! I was in a place of lack & frustration, but hopeful...
After just 9 months of consistent OMing
I was finally able to stop blaming others for my lack of satisfaction, lack of communication skills that I needed to express my desires, and my lack of intimacy. I've taken responsibility of my ability to receive pleasure. I stopped looking for love in all the wrong places and began filling myself up by OMing. Now that I'm filled up to running over, I can say that I am truly a Turned On woman! My ability to experience pleasure has increased and continues to do so. The expansive orgasm that is created within the OM feeds and energizes me throughout the day. I live my life using my desire as a compass.
I solve problems in a new and exciting way... one can apply anything that they would like to work on or practice or get better at to an OM. OM is an opportunity to work on it in the safe container, get good at it, and then take it out to the real world with confidence!
There is a communication skill set that is used in Orgasmic Meditation that is priceless. It's simple and effective, clean and concise, easy to understand and interpret. I practice it in my daily OMs and use it in all ares of my life, with the greatest of ease! (well, I'm getting there!)
Now that I'm full I don't feel needy, graspy, or desperate. When I stopped feeling those ways a personal relationship dropped into my life that is wonderful. We have an OM practice and it has been a great foundation for connection and intimacy, sexual exploration and communication. It has opened so many conversations that may not have ever been discussed, but by digging into our desires, fears, resistance and willingness we have gone really deep in a short period of time. It's beautiful and I'm so grateful.
How Much and Why?
I need $10,000. I've already placed a large deposit. I'm committed! Most of the money will go towards the rest of my tuition. I will also need gas, food and lodging while I'm attending the program. I need to make up for some lost time from work. It is a ten month program in which I will be spending one long weekend in San Francisco per month at an intensive and I will participate in a couple tele courses per month from home. There will be people from all over the globe joining us in San Francisco in person and via satellite.
Anything will help!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I was recently accepted into the Harvard <a href=""http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/academic-programs/career-discovery/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Career Discovery</a> program. There, I will be introduced design-based graduate school programs. For six-weeks I would study architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and urban design.</p>
<p>If I can make it there, I will be able to see if studies in these fields or other design fields is for me. Or, I'll see if it is just a hobby. Either way, my future studies will be based on this experience.</p>
<p>But before I can become enlightened by the minds at Harvard, I need to <em>get there</em>. That is what you can help me with. And really, any assistance is helpful, monetary or otherwise.</p>
<h3>What I Need, The Breakdown, &amp; What You Get</h3>

<div><em>So what do you get in return?</em></div>
<div><em><br/></em></div>
<div>You get a grateful student, friend, family member, or just plain human. Not the best return on investment, I know. But, it certainly makes a difference in my life. Also, you will get a perk depending on the level of your donation (you can see the levels on the side).</div>

Conference</a>), the sustainable living-learning community there (EcoHouse), and a bike sharing initiative. After my time in the undergraduate world, I might go to graduate school or I might go off and do my own thing. If grad school, I could study anything from urban design, to philosophy, to designing systems (and that could be anything), to computer science, to neuroscience, to information systems, to I don't know what. That is why this summer program will help me.</div>

<p>As part of my goal to teach, I want to be come a better teacher by learning how to bridge gaps, to understand more about learning disabilities and learning barriers that student’s encounter while in their school career.   I also want to learn how to better understand how I can make a difference in those student’s lives.</p>
<p>As part of my studies at Portland State, I have applied and been accepted to this study abroad program and by going on this 2 and a half week trip with the university, I am going to be fully immersed in another culture.  I will be volunteering my time at a service site of either my choosing or of their need.  The options we have currently are working in an orphanage, a school, or on a farm.   However once we arrive, the needs of the community may be different. </p>

<p>What I need is the funding to cover the cost of tuition, program fee, the flight, transportation to and from the service site, immunizations, airport exit fee, non-program meals, and some money to bring things with me for the students and for use in the area.</p>

<p>Tuition Fees:  Up to $514.00 (covers 6 credits)</p>
<p>Program Fees: $2033</p>
<p>(Covers housing in country, medical insurance, group meals, study abroad $200 fee)</p>

<p>Our nation is facing a crisis in Art education. To satisfy budget cuts, art classes are being eliminated from our schools at an alarming rate. In Churchill County, our elementary schools now have NO art classes. To allow this to happen is to seriously inhibit the development of our children and our future. To remove Art from our communities is to stifle imagination and suppress quality of life. At Rising Sun we believe a community art center can play a vital role in stimulating our citizens, young and old, and in revitalizing our community.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Rising Sun Gallery and Art Studios has been created to mitigate the impact of the growing void in Art education. Our primary goal is to keep Art and Art education alive by offering studio workshops where Art instruction is provided in an inclusive, creative and stimulating environment. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p>
<p>We offer instruction in a wide variety of Art disciplines to bring people together in shared expression, creativity and fellowship. By reaching out to seniors, our local military base, school children, and all others, we aspire to bridge the divide between generations and societal strata, and to re-establish a true sense of community. A gallery space adjoins the studio workshop to display the work of students and promote the work of many talented artists in Nevada and other western states.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration for and the founder of this enterprise is Patricia Kupferer Sammons, who manages the gallery and workshop activities. Patricia is a working artist and a experienced gallery manager. Our studio instructors are five very talented artists that includes the head of the art department at our Jr. High School. These wonderful individuals are dedicated to providing quality, personalized instruction.</p>
<p>Rising Sun Gallery and Art Studios is a licensed Nevada company that opened on March 6th of this year. We are centrally located in downtown Fallon, Nevada, at 203 South Maine Street. During the past eight months we have received a positive reaction from the community that is demonstrated by increasing enrollment in our classes and gallery Art sales are steadily increasing.</p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>Our opening was achieved with a lot of volunteerism, donations and borrowing of essential furnishings, supplies and equipment. Our campaign goal of $50,000 will enable us to replace all the borrowed items, expand the studio workshop area to accomodate community gatherings as well larger classroom space, and make a number of basic interior improvements. We also need to bolster our operating budget so we can engage in proper advertising and promotion campaigns; pay for legal, accounting and grant writing assistance, and be able to pay our key volunteers. If successful this campaign will allow us to expand our classes and strengthen our revenue streams. It will also enable us to continue to keep the cost of our classes at an affordable level for the majority of our community and increase our ability to offer some free classes.</p>
<p>Supporting Art Education here in Fallon will bring lasting benefits to society at large. Each person enriched by the creative experience will likely influence others they meet in a positive way.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for taking your time to view our campaign.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays and God Bless. </p></div>","WHY THIS CAMPAIGN
Our nation is facing a crisis in Art education. To satisfy budget cuts, art classes are being eliminated from our schools at an alarming rate. In Churchill County, our elementary schools now have NO art classes. To allow this to happen is to seriously inhibit the development of our children and our future. To remove Art from our communities is to stifle imagination and suppress quality of life. At Rising Sun we believe a community art center can play a vital role in stimulating our citizens, young and old, and in revitalizing our community.
MISSION
Rising Sun Gallery and Art Studios has been created to mitigate the impact of the growing void in Art education. Our primary goal is to keep Art and Art education alive by offering studio workshops where Art instruction is provided in an inclusive, creative and stimulating environment. 
WHAT WE DO
We offer instruction in a wide variety of Art disciplines to bring people together in shared expression, creativity and fellowship. By reaching out to seniors, our local military base, school children, and all others, we aspire to bridge the divide between generations and societal strata, and to re-establish a true sense of community. A gallery space adjoins the studio workshop to display the work of students and promote the work of many talented artists in Nevada and other western states.
WHO WE ARE
The inspiration for and the founder of this enterprise is Patricia Kupferer Sammons, who manages the gallery and workshop activities. Patricia is a working artist and a experienced gallery manager. Our studio instructors are five very talented artists that includes the head of the art department at our Jr. High School. These wonderful individuals are dedicated to providing quality, personalized instruction.
Rising Sun Gallery and Art Studios is a licensed Nevada company that opened on March 6th of this year. We are centrally located in downtown Fallon, Nevada, at 203 South Maine Street. During the past eight months we have received a positive reaction from the community that is demonstrated by increasing enrollment in our classes and gallery Art sales are steadily increasing.
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Our opening was achieved with a lot of volunteerism, donations and borrowing of essential furnishings, supplies and equipment. Our campaign goal of $50,000 will enable us to replace all the borrowed items, expand the studio workshop area to accomodate community gatherings as well larger classroom space, and make a number of basic interior improvements. We also need to bolster our operating budget so we can engage in proper advertising and promotion campaigns; pay for legal, accounting and grant writing assistance, and be able to pay our key volunteers. If successful this campaign will allow us to expand our classes and strengthen our revenue streams. It will also enable us to continue to keep the cost of our classes at an affordable level for the majority of our community and increase our ability to offer some free classes.
Supporting Art Education here in Fallon will bring lasting benefits to society at large. Each person enriched by the creative experience will likely influence others they meet in a positive way.
Every dollar received will bring us closer to reaching our goals and allows us to maintain our momentum. You can also help by spreading the word. Tell your friends about us and ask them to tell their friends. You can keep in touch with us on Facebook and Gmail at risingsunartgallery@gmail.com

<h3>HELP International: Peru</h3>
Hello all! My name is Heather Raftery and I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in <strong>International Development </strong>at the<strong> University of Denver </strong>in Colorado. The reason I’m pursuing this degree is because I want to dedicate my career, and indeed my life, to the <strong>fight against world poverty</strong>. As part of my academic growth, I decided to apply for an internship in a developing country doing grassroots development work. Excitingly, I was recently given the opportunity to intern with <strong>HELP International</strong> (<a href=""http://www.help-international.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.help-international.org</a>) in <strong>Peru</strong> this summer to help local indigenous communities! Through this organization I will be able to help implement sustainable development projects and programs that will increase the level of living and well-being among the people I will serve. It is really a tremendous opportunity… but I need your help!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>HELP International is a <strong>non-profit organization</strong> that works across the globe, empowering local community members by implementing projects that meet basic health, education, and livelihood <strong>needs</strong> that are not currently being met, and by teaching important <strong>skills</strong> that can be passed on to others, thereby increasing the <strong>sustainability</strong> of these projects and programs. Currently HELP International is working with <strong>impoverished communities</strong> in eight locations around the world—Belize, El Salvador, Fiji, India, Thailand, Uganda, Tanzania, and Peru.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Projects vary tremendously and are based on each individual community's assessed need. The projects primarily focus around three major areas of development work: <strong>education</strong>, <strong>health</strong> and <strong>business development</strong>. Last year's projects included: dispersing microloans to local women to start or expand businesses; installing ""natural light bulbs"" made out of water, bleach and recycled bottles; working with a local orphanage and rehabilitation center; and starting a small-scale reforestation project with ""neem"" trees, which have a tremendous number of uses. This year we plan on continuing these projects as well as many others, including implementing a ""soilet"" project to address sanitation needs and improve water quality!</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help!</h3>
</div>
<div>The population of Peru is about 29.2 million and 34.8% of Peruvians live below the poverty line. <strong>Indigenous populations are especially susceptible</strong> to impoverishment due to <strong>deep-rooted discrimination and marginalization</strong>. Often they live at the bare minimum of subsistence levels... which isn't living at all, but rather merely surviving. The projects we implement will help them meet their basic needs and empower them to build better and more secure lives for themselves and their children. If you can imagine how difficult it would be to live on a couple hundred dollars a month... many of these <strong>families</strong> live on <strong>mere dollars a day</strong>! </div>
<div>
<h3>How Can You Help??</h3>
<strong>The total cost for the trip will be close to $4,500</strong>. This will cover the cost of my transportation to and from Peru, the cost of my housing and food while I am there, transportation to and from project sites, as well as (and most importantly!) the cost of the projects I will help establish and implement. My Indiegogo goal is to raise at least <strong>$1,000 by the end of May</strong>. There is no minimum to the amount you can donate... <strong>any little bit helps!</strong> And if you just can't contribute, no problem... you can help simply by spreading the word and sending good vibes our direction! :)</div></div>","HELP International: Peru

<p>The mission of Oregon Outreach is to provide an accredited academic program and support system which assists the at-risk student in succeeding in the classroom, at home, and in the community.</p>
<p>Executive Director Rebecca Black founded Oregon Outreach (OOI) in 1988, as a response to gang violence in North/Northeast Portland; in conjunction with the Mayor’s Youth Gang Task Force, OOI offered job training and placement. This employment program was subsequently funded by the City of Portland, Multnomah County, the Northeast Police Precinct and the Urban League, and continues today as an accredited alternative school serving high-need youth who have dropped out of school, who are behind academically and/or who are not on track to graduation and post-secondary success. OOI helps to close the achievement gap by offering at-risk students the opportunity for individualized instruction and, by requiring a commitment to educational excellence and attendance requirements in return, instills discipline and self-motivation so students may aspire to on-time graduation and success in their communities.         </p>
<p>Approximately 90 students enroll at Oregon Outreach each year. Prospective students have been identified by high school counselors as being at risk for dropping out of school for reasons which include, but are not limited to, academic credit-deficiency, pregnancy, adjudication, substance abuse, being learning-disabled and/or behaviorally disordered.  Youth served by OOI are from families that are in frequent transition, are low-income, in foster care, and/or have been adjudicated, 95% live below federal poverty guidelines, and are two to five years behind their peers academically. OOI also serves homeless youth (defined as a youth without a family, from a family without a home, or from a family living with multiple families in one home).</p>
<p>Oregon Outreach operates schools in three locations (inner North/Northeast Portland, outerSoutheast Portland, and Mollala). Two of these sites are located in communities which have some of the highest crime rates and the largest scholastic achievement gaps in the state. The goal for OOI students is a high school diploma, whether earned at OOI or at their “home” schools, for students who have successfully re-entered them.</p>
<p>            The funds we are requesting is for an Arts program at our Rosi Hinton High School location in SE Portland.  The program was started in February of 2012 through a small grant provided by the Coen Gilbert Family Foundation.  The Students at Rosi Hinton have great difficulty with their academic work.  A majority of our students receive special education services for various disabilities. For most of our students, they have experienced little school success. Oregon Outreach at the Rosi Hinton School believes that the arts can be of immense benefit to our students. In our proposed visual arts program, students can work with a licensed, experienced artist and teacher with a great deal of experience helping students with depression, anxiety, anger and abuse issues, and oppositional defiance. Students can exorcise emotions therapeutically, collaborate on group art projects such as murals, learn about their culturally positive artistic role models, develop hands on skills, achieve successful outcomes, learn about various cultural art forms, develop creative and critical thinking skills, and learn history, economics, language arts, philosophy, science and how to be a better citizen and community member through the arts.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the Arts Program is to assist our at risk students in gaining success in projects, creating projects through critical thinking, addressing their deeply rooted psychological issues through visual arts, helping them develop self confidence in personal creative, academic and personal areas. The Arts Program has been implemented in a portion of a classroom. Periods during the school day are art periods for our middle and high school students. Through this program arts integration into academic subjects will be demonstrated by the art teacher to staff so that students can use what they learn in art class in their academic classes.</p>

<h3>The Reason</h3>
<p>My name is Nathan Diekman. I am a teacher and founding member of the Oklahoma Education Project.  Our project focuses on using science as a backbone to all other forms of education; from math and literacy, to social studies and the arts.   Our approach to education uses a project based learning model that is mixed with high intensity science labs and as much technology as we can fit in.  The heart of the equation is the student.  Most of our projects, including this one, are student led, designed and carried out.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This particular project will use weather balloons and huge amounts of helium to send data recorders into low orbit altitudes (80,000 - 100,000 ft) in a launch rig.  These recorders, usually referred to as loggers, will be equipped with different sensors designed to record specific sets of data.  For example, some of the sensors will be able to measure and record changes in UVA, UVB, barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide concentration,  global position and altitude.  Obviously there will be weight restrictions on each launch, so students will need to decide how, when and where certain sensors will be launched.  Each launch rig will also be equipped with a photo/video recorder that will be synced with the logger.  This will allow the students to visually see the the atmosphere where a specific measurement was recorded.  For example, what is the relative humidity and temperature while inside a cloud versus above or below that same cloud?  Lastly each lunch rig will have to have a way for us to find it again.  The logger is not a transmitter.  We will have no way to recover any data until we lay our hands onto the rig.  To accomplish this we use SPOT locators that let us track the coordinates of the rig.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once back on the ground the data will be analyzed and the students will be tasked with finding creative ways to present it in modern and relevant forms.  Perhaps they will perform a one-act play describing the ascension rate of a helium balloon.  Maybe they will be able to predict weather patterns based on temperature and humidity levels and make a YouTube video about it.  Only the students can know exactly what will be produced.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Payoff</h3>
<div>This project, and future ones like it, will remind students that creativity and learning go hand in hand.  While that may sound warm and squishy, the true meaning goes much deeper.  In today's education system, students are encouraged to recreate and improve.  Rarely are they asked to create.  It is our mission to develop an excitement in students that will drive them to search for knowledge around them.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>However, competition for brains is very stiff.  Science like ours is competing against Xbox, YouTube, and iPhones.  If we can't excite kids, we will never win them over.  We need this.  You need this.  </div>

<h3>The Hook</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, in this country, high school science doesn't get funded.  Projects like this are expensive.  The staff of the Oklahoma Education Project did a preliminary launch of a similar rig and it was valued at over $500.00.  This basic rig only contained a camera, and the SPOT locator. Each balloon cost about $100.00 with another $100.00 of helium in it.The loggers, sensors, and cameras are not cheap either.  While they are not a consumable expense, like the balloon and helium, they must be purchased up front and possibly replaced if something goes terribly wrong.  Lastly, fuel is important.  Our last launch few approximately 90 miles away, as the crow flies.  In driving miles, round trip, it equaled well over 200 miles. Keeping in mind that we have absolutely no idea where this thing COULD land, we have to use our more rugged and less fuel efficient vehicles.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to have enough equipment to launch at least 2 separate balloon rigs with different equipment. This will allow 10-12 students to actively participate in the design and launch, in groups of 5-6. A smaller budget will obviously limit either how many launches we can do or what we can attach to each one.  </p>

<h3>The Story Behind KIP Education &amp; Prevention Programs</h3>
<p>Kay Alexander and I (Cendrine Marrouat) met last year, during her book launch in Winnipeg. I wrote an article on the event and we started emailing each other back and forth. At first, we discussed the topics in our books (I am also an author) and realized that we shared the same views on the world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I had always wanted to make a real difference in this world. So when Kay shared her vision -- an organization that would cater to both those in need and those who serve them through all-inclusive programs -- I felt instantly drawn to the idea. We met, and KIP started to take shape. </p>

</div></div>","The Story Behind KIP Education & Prevention Programs
Kay Alexander and I (Cendrine Marrouat) met last year, during her book launch in Winnipeg. I wrote an article on the event and we started emailing each other back and forth. At first, we discussed the topics in our books (I am also an author) and realized that we shared the same views on the world. 

I had always wanted to make a real difference in this world. So when Kay shared her vision -- an organization that would cater to both those in need and those who serve them through all-inclusive programs -- I felt instantly drawn to the idea. We met, and KIP started to take shape. 

Who We Are: The Founders

Kay Alexander:



Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, Kay Alexander migrated to Canada where she graduated with a degree in Psychology from the
University of Manitoba. She spent most of her adult life working with children,
including youth in crisis and has also counselled abused women. As a teenager
she volunteered in orphanages, worked as a camp counsellor and an assistant
camp director during her summers, and also worked with the elderly in a Senior
citizens’ home. 


Cendrine Marrouat

I was born in Toulouse, southern France, and moved to Canada in 2003. I hold a bachelor’s degree in English-to-French translation. In my eight years in Winnipeg, I have worked as a translator, teacher, freelance journalist, reviewer and writer, and have had the opportunity to meet some extraordinary people who have opened my heart and mind to the beauties of this world.    


What is KIP Education & Prevention Programs?

KIP (Knowledge Is Power) Education & Prevention Programs will offer all-inclusive programs tailored to the specific needs of at-risk youth, newcomers and low-income people in Winnipeg. KIP will work with existing agencies and organizations to provide the necessary tools and equal opportunities allowing participants to become valuable individuals, employees and members of the community.

The Impact


Kay and I are experienced professionals in our fields. We know that our programs are unique and will address the specific needs of our participants. We will never follow a linear pattern. We will adjust to make sure that our participants receive individual attention, while providing a safe, stable and nurturing environment where they can thrive and grow as individuals. 

As a result, we believe that the impact on the community will be huge.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jackie (my wife) and I sold everything we owned in 2011 to open a non profit 501c3  organization, Epic Missions, Inc. in Florida that encourages people from around the USA and Canada to donate a week of their life to community work and missions. No one at Epic Missions takes a salary and this is our life's work. We used all of our personal savings and proceeds from the sale of our home and cars to restore the missions base that houses and feeds the volunteers that travel here to do community work. Epic Missions then purchased the property in 2012.</p>
<p>We stepped out in faith to do this and in our first year alone we brought in over 300 people from around the USA and Canada to volunteer for a week at a time. This year we expect to house over 450 volunteers and contribute 18,000 hours to help save at risk children and teens, feed the hungry and help broken families.</p>
<p>We intend to duplicate this model in America with your financial help.</p>
<p>Every team member returns home with a desire to help make a positive change in their own community as a result of their missions trip with Epic Missions. Our volunteers may come from your own community so it helps you as they return home determined to make a positive difference in their own communities. We do all of our work in the USA - we think missions starts here at home.</p>
<p>But we need to reach more people to make a difference in the USA to stamp out hunger, homelessness, at risk kids and families that are in crisis. Our vounteers directly work with these need groups to help stop the cycle and start them on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>We are attempting to get 2,000 people to give $299 (the cost to feed and house each team member for a week) so that we can bring in more people to train, volunteer and send back to their communities in the USA and Canada. </p>
<p>Your gift will offset our costs in training and bringing in these volunteers, we will be able to reach more people and will pay off the debt on the Epic Missions Property and base. Doing this will allow us to expand and make a greater impact across our country and Canada.Your gifts are tax deductible!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 2,000 people to donate $299 to offset the cost of a volunteer for one full week. The funding will then allow us to bring in more voluntters across America and return more of them home to your community to make a positive change.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to feed and house the volunteer while they spend a week doing community work with at risk teens (Gifford Youth Center and Hibiscus House) and working with the hungry and homeless at the Source as well as many other community organizations.</p>
<p>It will free up funds for us to pay down or eliminate the $475,000 of debt we have in a mortgage for Epic Missions which was used to purchase the missions base where Epic Missions is located.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are real people volunteering to deal with real problems in our communities across the USA. We use Vero Beach as a training ground for our teams of volunteers. They return home to your community  - changed - ready to make a positive difference in their hometown to end hunger, homelessness and protect kids at risk.</p>
<p>Over 27,000 hours of real volunteer time will have been poured into our communities by Epic Missions volunteers by the end of 2013. If we reach our goal - we will increase that number in subsequent years by over 700%.</p>
<p>Throwing money at the issues of hunger and homelessness without building relationships between the homeless, hungry, or at risk kids will not work. Volunteers make a difference. They can assist in finding out the CAUSE of what got the hurting person in their current situation. Knowing the STORY will help us find a solution to break the cycle. That is what we do. We get involved directly with the kids, teens, homeless persons or hungry family. We intervene and help find lasting solutions.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are poet Roderick Borisade and cartoonist Aaron Hazouri, and we're here to ask you for help to spread the word of Buddy and Bird.</p>
<p>Roderick ""Odd Rod"" Borisade is a poet and public speaker based in the Jacksonville, Florida area. He has published several books; spoken to groups ranging in age from preschool to senior citizens, and in size from small gatherings to convention centers; and has recently released his second album of music and poetry. Raised in poverty by a drug addicted mother with no father present, the death of his older brother at a young age led Rod to discover poetry. Rod worked tirelessly to better himself and beat the odds stacked against him, attending the University of North Florida on a full scholarship. Currently, Rod tours on the college circuit, speaking to groups of students about his life experiences and sharing inspirational and motivational pieces of poetry.</p>
<p>Illustrator Aaron Hazouri, also from the Jacksonville area, is a cartoonist and puppeteer. He is responsible for designing the characters and settings, and for designing, building and performing the Buddy and Bird puppets. He spent ten years working in the corporate world; earlier this year, he left his day job to concentrate solely on his artistic career. Currently, in addition to his work with Buddy and Bird, Aaron is the writer and artist behind the young adult comic book The Strange Adventures of Toaster Guy.</p>
<p>Rod and Aaron each bring unique talents to this project that will help ensure its success. They're only missing one thing: you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About Buddy and Bird</h3>
<p>The team spent years developing the characters and story of Buddy and Bird, loosely based on their lives. The first story features Buddy and Bird's initial meeting and a look into their different worlds, showcasing both their differences and the things they have in common. Sobsequent stories will feature a wide range of diverse characters, facing different emotional issues common to young, lower middle class children.</p>
<p>Looking at the landscape of children's programming, there are a wealth of programs offering lessons in spelling, counting, and other educational areas of focus. However, there are few programs addressing the emotional needs of inner city kids - from bullying, to poverty, divorce, to death, to peer pressure. Buddy and Bird is designed to speak to those needs.</p>
<p>Rod and Aaron have taken Buddy and Bird to local schools, daycare centers, and Head Start programs. They've met with success locally, but are ready to take Buddy and Bird to the next level.</p>
<h3>Buddy and Bird!</h3>
<p>Buddy and Bird are the main characters - the stars of the show. </p>
<p><img alt=""Buddy and Bird"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://home.comcast.net/~cartoonistaaron/buddyandbird.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Buddy and Bird""/></p>
<p>Buddy is based on Rod, and Bird on Aaron. Their lives reflect the realities of Rod and Aaron's childhoods.

</div></div>","Who We Are
We are poet Roderick Borisade and cartoonist Aaron Hazouri, and we're here to ask you for help to spread the word of Buddy and Bird.
Roderick ""Odd Rod"" Borisade is a poet and public speaker based in the Jacksonville, Florida area. He has published several books; spoken to groups ranging in age from preschool to senior citizens, and in size from small gatherings to convention centers; and has recently released his second album of music and poetry. Raised in poverty by a drug addicted mother with no father present, the death of his older brother at a young age led Rod to discover poetry. Rod worked tirelessly to better himself and beat the odds stacked against him, attending the University of North Florida on a full scholarship. Currently, Rod tours on the college circuit, speaking to groups of students about his life experiences and sharing inspirational and motivational pieces of poetry.
Illustrator Aaron Hazouri, also from the Jacksonville area, is a cartoonist and puppeteer. He is responsible for designing the characters and settings, and for designing, building and performing the Buddy and Bird puppets. He spent ten years working in the corporate world; earlier this year, he left his day job to concentrate solely on his artistic career. Currently, in addition to his work with Buddy and Bird, Aaron is the writer and artist behind the young adult comic book The Strange Adventures of Toaster Guy.
Rod and Aaron each bring unique talents to this project that will help ensure its success. They're only missing one thing: you!


About Buddy and Bird
The team spent years developing the characters and story of Buddy and Bird, loosely based on their lives. The first story features Buddy and Bird's initial meeting and a look into their different worlds, showcasing both their differences and the things they have in common. Sobsequent stories will feature a wide range of diverse characters, facing different emotional issues common to young, lower middle class children.
Looking at the landscape of children's programming, there are a wealth of programs offering lessons in spelling, counting, and other educational areas of focus. However, there are few programs addressing the emotional needs of inner city kids - from bullying, to poverty, divorce, to death, to peer pressure. Buddy and Bird is designed to speak to those needs.
Rod and Aaron have taken Buddy and Bird to local schools, daycare centers, and Head Start programs. They've met with success locally, but are ready to take Buddy and Bird to the next level.
Buddy and Bird!
Buddy and Bird are the main characters - the stars of the show. 

Buddy is based on Rod, and Bird on Aaron. Their lives reflect the realities of Rod and Aaron's childhoods. Aaron designed the characters to appeal to young children, to be easily animated, and to be adaptable to different formats - book illustration, cartoon animation, web animation, and puppets.

The puppets are a big part of the Buddy and Bird ""package."" They're important for live-action interactions with kids. Children almost universally respond well to puppets, and the Buddy and Bird team has had great success working with groups of inner city kids using the puppets.

The supporting cast of characters features kids from different backgrounds, of different body types, different personalities and a wide range of abilities. 
What is ""the next level?""
As mentioned earlier, there's been some measure of success locally, but to take Buddy and Bird further, we need your contributions. 
We think Buddy and Bird would be a great fit for educational television - ideally, PBS, but we're open to anyplace on television (or the internet). We'd like to put together a pilot film, with professional videography and animation; for that, we need money. 
Producing a pilot animated short film, seven to ten minutes of animation, will cost in the neighborhood of ten to twelve thousand dollars (Flash animation costs are right around $1,000 per minute). Hiring professional videographers, renting equipment, and filing permits to film the live-action segment of the pilot will also cost several thousand dollars. Finally, money is needed to produce a package, including high-quality copies of the pilot; character designs; and sample scripts. This will enable us to shop the project around to producers, agents, conventions, conferences, etc.

<h3>About Sharon School</h3>
<p>Sharon School (see footage of the school in video above from 0:30 - 0:55) is located in a large slum in Nairobi, Kenya, in a community where people struggle to attain even the most basic necessities. The slum is very large and yet there are no public schools in the area, which means most children can't go to school because their parents cannot afford any school fees. Infant mortality is high and for most parents and children there is little to no access to any sort of health care.</p>
<p>When we first encountered Sharon, we found 60 children and their teachers working and playing in a single, dirt-floored room. They had minimal school supplies and lacked access to basic sources of food and clean water.</p>
<p>But with the help of ICRI staff we were able to initiate important changes at Sharon School. Over the next few years, we were able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build and install a 3000 gallon water tank so that children would no longer have to share a bucket and single cup for drinking water.</li>
<li>Set up a food program to provide warm meals and snacks to the children.</li>
<li>Provide basic school and learning supplies for the children.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Sharon School provides crucial resources for its students, and while we have been able to take many steps to improve the <span class=""il"">care</span> of children there, we still have a long way to go. Right now our priority is finding a new location for the school, which is currently located inside a church. In the community, church meetings and activities take precedent over school time, and the 50+ children who attend the school are often interrupted and displaced during their school <span class=""il"">day</span>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>ICRI plans to purchase a building and a small plot of land for the school. With their own space, teachers will be able to develop a nurturing environment, safely store their toys and learning tools, and most importantly, provide a stable and consistent school space for the children.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>After a long and careful search, we have found a potential new school site in Nairobi for a price of $10,000.</span> Thanks to some very generous families, we've already raised $6,000, but we still need $4,000 more to reach our goal. Any money raised will go towards purchasing the new site for the school.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sharon School delivers a unique childcare and development program to vulnerable children, providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Food</em> - The children, mostly coming from poor and struggling families, receive a balanced meal everyday at school.</li>
<li>
<em>Quality Education</em> - Sharon and her teachers are equipped with the latest in early childhood development (ECD) practices through the elaborate ECD Capacity building programs offered by ICRI Africa.</li>
<li>
<em>Healthcare</em> - ICRI provides a medical check up once a month and prescriptions for children at Sharon School. The nurse also often gives community talks to the parents of the children who come to school on the medical service day. </li>
</ul>
<p>With a new building Sharon School will be able to continue offering these services to children in need. Please help us keep Sharon School alive, and help support the education, health, and well-being of these children.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Achieng HIV/AIDS International Project is the result of passion and hard work by Christine Himbury, a native of Bar Sauri Village, Kenya. Christine grew up in Bar Sauri, a village in Western Kenya with one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world. Poverty stricken children, many of them who cannot afford to eat or stay in school, are destined to repeat the cycle of poverty and disease if not given an education and mentorship support.</p>
<p><strong>Christine's dream</strong> is to support girls in Bar Sauri, specifically in elementary school programs who would not otherwise have an opportunity to succeed through education.  </p>

</div></div>","Hi, we are STUDIO Mada.
We are a group of architects and engineers that are currently engaged in a building project at Madangombe Primary School in Zimbabwe.
Our strategy is to develop Madangombe Primary School one block at a time. The first action is to invest in a manual brick press that can produce Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) on site. These blocks will be the main construction material used for building new classrooms. For this we need your support.


Madangombe Primary School is an existing school in the Chivi-region and it has about 850 pupils. Due to its rapid growth they are short of several educational infrastructures. Their current priority is to build a kindergarten to house their 120 pupils in the Early Child Development program (ECD), from 3-5 years old. Today they have only one classroom for this purpose. According to the Zimbabwe Ministry of Education, the teacher/student ratio should be 1/20. At least six classrooms are in need in this case.  

 
The entire project of six ECD classrooms has an estimated budget of 35000 USD. We are already sponsored with 14000 USD from Chivi Foundation, another non-profit organization that has supported and developed Madangombe Primary School over the past several years. http://www.chivikids.no/ 
This campaign aims to raise 5000 USD to buy a manual brick press and the tools needed to set up a local CSEB production line for constructing the classrooms. A manual brick press and two moulds cost 4000 USD plus shipment to Madangombe. In addition we need to invest in a set of tools such as shovels, wheelbarrows and sieves that will be given to the school. 
If we exceed our goal of 5000 USD, the money will be spent on building materials and certified professionals (plumbers, electricians etc. ) to complete the ECD classrooms. 
Classrooms units will be built in stages to make sure that we are not dependent on raising the entire sum at once. 
After the project is completed the remaining funds will be transferred to Chivi Foundation and their volunteer work at Madangombe Primary School. 

Compressed Stabilized Earth Block
 
The Compressed Stabilized Earth Block is a cheap and sustainable building material because it uses local soil, and very little cement compared to the regular bricks. About 3-5 % cement is added to the soil, depending on the quality of soil, which increases its compressive strength and durability.

Buying a brick press is an investment that will benefit the whole community. It is easy to handle and will provide the community with an extra way of income. 
By choosing a manual press rather than an electrical one we avoid more serious maintenance issues, in case of a breakdown. 


Less cement = less cost
Local soil = Local production
Low-tech solution = Less maintenance
Extra skills = more income

<p>Phra Daniel Nagasiri grew up in Belgium and France, but in 1998, at the age of 45, he left his previous life behind and was ordained a Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition.  He has dedicated his life to caring for poor, sick and oppressed people, teaching the message of the Buddha.  He spent his first 2 years as a monk in an AIDS hospice in Thailand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He moved to India in 2002 where he met a young boy, Ashoka, who was working in a Burmese temple.  Ashoka was denied an education and living under virtual slave-labor conditions.  Phra Daniel learned that Ashoka wanted to be a doctor, and he decided to help him realize his goal.  That was the beginning of the Koruna Dana Budhha  Mission.  Later, Buddhist monks from impoverished and oppressed Myanmar (Burma) asked him to receive more children. Soon, Phra Daniel had created a loving home for 8 to 15 children and registered them into Indian schools.  Ashoka went on to graduate high-school and entered medical school in 2012, where he is doing well.  </p>

<br/><br/>
<p>Since the Nepal earthquake of 2015, Phra Nagasiri lost almost everything and furthermore had to leave his very successful mission in Nepal due to visa troubles.  We are now looking to restore and expand the mission in Ghaziabat, just North of Delhi.  Historicaly, the mission has been a happy family, with laughter and compassion, 
hard work, and love. Everybody pitches in to help. The children come from many 
places but mostly from  Myanmar, and not in every case are they orphans, but in 
every case they have been rescued and adopted.  Almost all the children did well  in school despite having missed out on several years of school, and yet they have shown that desire is a great equalizer. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/>
<br/><p><b>THE REQUEST</b><br/></p>Currently about 8 children live in the Ghaziabat mission.  These are partially funded by Burmese monks in Bodhgaya.  The living conditions there are not optimal, the main advantage being that it is close to schools.<br/><br/>We are looking for relocate the mission to a more healthy and natural environment (such as when the Nepal mission was operating) and also to expand to 20 or more students.  <br/><br/>Our target funding of $3000 would accomplish the following: <br/><ul>
<li>Relocate the mission to a larger house, ideally in a healthier environment with garden, close to schools, etc; and to afford the lease on such a house (normally 6 months in advance @ 25,000 - 30,000 Rs per month, total of around $2400-$2600) </li>
<li>Travel expenses for the current children, and to bring about 12 new students from Myanmar<br/>
</li>
</ul>
The next batch of orphan is supposed to come end of February 2016.  Securing the initial funding will provide lead time to develop other income sources: either<br/>
other donors or else cottage-industry, such as supported the prior mission.<br/><br/><b>ABOUT PHRA DANIEL NAGASIRI</b><br/>Prior to becoming a monk, Phra Daniel had many careers from translator, hotel owner and shop-keeper, tourist guide, and language teacher at the college level.  He speaks 8 languages: French, English, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Inonesian.<br/>  <br/>In 2013 he wrote a book, in French: <u>Sur La Route du Nirvana: Le Journal d'un Moine Buddhiste Theravada</u> (later in English: <u>On The Road to Nirvana: The Diary of a Theravada Buddhist Monk)</u>, available on Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sur-route-Nirvana-Boudhiste-Theravada-ebook/dp/B013ZRN92U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452057801&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sur+la+route+du+nirvana"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/ROAD-NIRVANA-Theravada-Buddhist-ENGLAIS-ebook/dp/B0142T0E1E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452057744&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+the+road+to+nirvana"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>, recounting his experiences at the AIDS hospice in Thailand where he worked for 2 years.  It is a fast-paced, moving, and sometimes funny story.  <br/><br/>Some of the children he adopted have now graduated high-school.  They include a medical school student, an engineer, and a mountain guide.  Others are still in school and doing well.  Phra Daniel is also working on his second book in which he gives the incredible story of the Indian and Nepal missions.<br/> <br/>On the 8 of January 2016 was Daniel Nagasiri birhthday here some comment from the boys from the mission :<br/>Happy birthday Dad.... Yes i was small n nt may be innocent.... The most
 important person...of whome i was allyz in need left me when i was

every case they have been rescued and adopted.  Almost all the children did well  in school despite having missed out on several years of school, and yet they have shown that desire is a great equalizer. 




THE REQUESTCurrently about 8 children live in the Ghaziabat mission.  These are partially funded by Burmese monks in Bodhgaya.  The living conditions there are not optimal, the main advantage being that it is close to schools.We are looking for relocate the mission to a more healthy and natural environment (such as when the Nepal mission was operating) and also to expand to 20 or more students.  Our target funding of $3000 would accomplish the following: 
Relocate the mission to a larger house, ideally in a healthier environment with garden, close to schools, etc; and to afford the lease on such a house (normally 6 months in advance @ 25,000 - 30,000 Rs per month, total of around $2400-$2600) 
Travel expenses for the current children, and to bring about 12 new students from Myanmar


The next batch of orphan is supposed to come end of February 2016.  Securing the initial funding will provide lead time to develop other income sources: either
other donors or else cottage-industry, such as supported the prior mission.ABOUT PHRA DANIEL NAGASIRIPrior to becoming a monk, Phra Daniel had many careers from translator, hotel owner and shop-keeper, tourist guide, and language teacher at the college level.  He speaks 8 languages: French, English, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Inonesian.  In 2013 he wrote a book, in French: Sur La Route du Nirvana: Le Journal d'un Moine Buddhiste Theravada (later in English: On The Road to Nirvana: The Diary of a Theravada Buddhist Monk), available on Amazon here and here, recounting his experiences at the AIDS hospice in Thailand where he worked for 2 years.  It is a fast-paced, moving, and sometimes funny story.  Some of the children he adopted have now graduated high-school.  They include a medical school student, an engineer, and a mountain guide.  Others are still in school and doing well.  Phra Daniel is also working on his second book in which he gives the incredible story of the Indian and Nepal missions. On the 8 of January 2016 was Daniel Nagasiri birhthday here some comment from the boys from the mission :Happy birthday Dad.... Yes i was small n nt may be innocent.... The most
 important person...of whome i was allyz in need left me when i was

death of a parent or family member, divorce,  broken
intimate relationships, child abuse, molestation and homelessness.  There are those who have to combat attention deficit disorders, autism spectrum disorders and certain other learning difficulties.  What about the day to day stressors of school life like detention and suspension. <br/></p><p>The problem is this; children have to find ways to handle their emotional pain of hurt or loss and they do not have the right tools to help cope. </p><p><b>Urgent Need</b><br/></p><p>There is a desperate need for more teachers to be trained to deliver the work of transformation.  This is fundraising effort is urgent because the YES!

This fundraiser is to help us get the training so we can bring the techniques to more children.  The sooner we become trained the sooner we are able to bring this technique to the school and the better chance we have to save these children's lives.<br/></p><p><span><b>Our commitment</b>:</span><br/></p>

<p><i>Dominique</i>: <i><br/></i></p><p><i>I’m

addition, being the parent of a teenage boy, I feel I have the experience and
the knowledge to be able to connect with them.</span></i>  <i>I’ve

<p><b>Fundraiser Financial Goal</b><br/></p><p>Our goal is
to raise $4500.00 by July 15, 2015.<span> <br/></span></p><p><span>Your investment in
our training will put us at the forefront of the global mission to bring the art of meditation to all children-NOW!  Your contribution would make it possible for us to do the program immediately so we can bring the techniques to the schools as soon as possible.<br/></span></p><p><span>Imagine for a moment, a world where all young people and teens are able to think clearly, are able to focus, are confident, responsible and feel good about themselves despite their hardships?  What would life be like, for them , for parents and for teachers?  <br/></span></p><p><span><b>How your money will be spent</b>:<br/></span></p><ol>
<li><span>The airfare will cost between $550.00 -$600.00 each via Jet Blue airlines.</span></li>

<span></span><span>The course discount is $1500.00 each for the entire ten day course food and board included</span><span></span><span>  </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p><p>We figured we can do it if, 90 people were to give at least $50.00,
we’ll definitely meet this goal.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>We both have many years of training and 
experience in the work of transformation.   Recently, we completed the Happiness Program, Sahaj Samadhi Meditation 
and Dominique completed the advanced level, Silence Course.  We both 
assisted in the ART Excel course for youth and the YES!  for teens 
courses.  In addition, we completed the Landmark Education Curriculum for Living and we have assisted many times around the
Landmark Forum for young people and teens.    It was during these courses 
that we got to see the world from children's point of view.  <br/></p><p><i></i></p>

<li><i> Created an after-school  technology program for adults in the the community </i></li>
<li><i> Acknowledged for significant improvement in State Standardized Math test  Richland One School district Columbia South Carolina </i></li>
<li><i>Organized annual career day event for five

<p><i>Wendy: <br/></i></p><ul>
<li><i>Organized a Career day event with many distinguished guest including the Honorable Cory Booker <br/></i></li>
<li><i>Organized a Sports, Health/Fitness
fair <br/></i></li>
<li><i>Promoted and enrolled  guest speaker and 4-time Olympic track and field star Joetta Clark-Diggs to speak at the school <br/></i></li>
<li><i>I wrote a grant for a dental program which was awarded $3000.00 from Deltal Dental it served about 100 third grade students<br/></i></li>
</ul><p>We are proud 
of our accomplishments and though we are very clear that our work 
inspired many over the years.  We do recognize however that there is something missing 
in the transformation of the school environment.  We finally 
discovered the missing piece and that is -meditation.  </p><p>
</p><p>We recognize that this concept of maintaining a peaceful mind is the
training that is missing in the school environment. Further, having
recently assisted during a YES! Course we are confident that if children have access to the techniques of the program such
as; rhythmic breathing, meditation and yoga, it will improve their ability to
focus, maintain concentration, control negative emotions and develop their
leadership skills.  </p>
<p>On June 23, 2015, Dominique and
I had the honor of meeting the world-renown philantropist and spiritual leader, Sri Sri Ravi 
Shankar (Guruji).  We were humbled by his presence and admire his 
compassionate and joyful nature.  We shared our interest and enthusiasm about
participating in the upcoming YES! TTC, he smiled and gave us his 
blessings.  We then applied and we were accepted!  <br/></p>
<br/><p>Thank you so
much for your support and patronage!<br/></p>

to raise $4500.00 by July 15, 2015. Your investment in
our training will put us at the forefront of the global mission to bring the art of meditation to all children-NOW!  Your contribution would make it possible for us to do the program immediately so we can bring the techniques to the schools as soon as possible.Imagine for a moment, a world where all young people and teens are able to think clearly, are able to focus, are confident, responsible and feel good about themselves despite their hardships?  What would life be like, for them , for parents and for teachers?  How your money will be spent:
The airfare will cost between $550.00 -$600.00 each via Jet Blue airlines.

The course discount is $1500.00 each for the entire ten day course food and board included  


 We figured we can do it if, 90 people were to give at least $50.00,
we’ll definitely meet this goal.BackgroundWe both have many years of training and 
experience in the work of transformation.   Recently, we completed the Happiness Program, Sahaj Samadhi Meditation 
and Dominique completed the advanced level, Silence Course.  We both 
assisted in the ART Excel course for youth and the YES!  for teens 
courses.  In addition, we completed the Landmark Education Curriculum for Living and we have assisted many times around the
Landmark Forum for young people and teens.    It was during these courses 
that we got to see the world from children's point of view.  
Dominique:  
 Created an after-school  technology program for adults in the the community 
 Acknowledged for significant improvement in State Standardized Math test  Richland One School district Columbia South Carolina 
Organized annual career day event for five
consecutive years in Irvington, NJ 
Developed and enrolled four hundred students in American Tutor After-School Tutoring Program

Wendy: 
Organized a Career day event with many distinguished guest including the Honorable Cory Booker 
Organized a Sports, Health/Fitness
fair 
Promoted and enrolled  guest speaker and 4-time Olympic track and field star Joetta Clark-Diggs to speak at the school 
I wrote a grant for a dental program which was awarded $3000.00 from Deltal Dental it served about 100 third grade students
We are proud 
of our accomplishments and though we are very clear that our work 
inspired many over the years.  We do recognize however that there is something missing 
in the transformation of the school environment.  We finally 
discovered the missing piece and that is -meditation.  
We recognize that this concept of maintaining a peaceful mind is the
training that is missing in the school environment. Further, having
recently assisted during a YES! Course we are confident that if children have access to the techniques of the program such
as; rhythmic breathing, meditation and yoga, it will improve their ability to
focus, maintain concentration, control negative emotions and develop their
leadership skills.  
On June 23, 2015, Dominique and
I had the honor of meeting the world-renown philantropist and spiritual leader, Sri Sri Ravi 
Shankar (Guruji).  We were humbled by his presence and admire his 
compassionate and joyful nature.  We shared our interest and enthusiasm about
participating in the upcoming YES! TTC, he smiled and gave us his 
blessings.  We then applied and we were accepted!  
Thank you so
much for your support and patronage!

Wendy & Dominique",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Paul Raso and I am the Executive Director of a Non Profit organization in Toronto Ontario Called <i>Education Involved Advocacy Group</i>. Our mandate is to advocate for parents in Toronto's Jane and Finch community in respects to navigating the very scary and confusing world of education as well as to create engaging after school learning opportunities for youth aged 15-29.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All with the aim of reducing the number of lives lost to gun violence in the community each year.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Prior to this I worked  as a teacher for 10 years and a vice principal for 2 in the Jane and Finch community.  I also worked as a vice principal for 1 year in Rexdale before resigning my job as VP to start Education Involved.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Throughout my tenure as a secondary school educator I taught, coached, facilitated international educational experiences for students (Kenya, Mexico, Japan), developed award winning experiential curriculum (program still running), and worked on a steering committee for the Ministry of Education's Urban Priority High School Grant program.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Throughout my tenure I also saw two communities plagued with violence (I have been to almost 2 funerals for every years I was teaching I do not use the word plague lightly) and marginalized in two very important areas of education; Parent engagement and experiential learning/differentiated instruction. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes every board in the province has a mandated parent advisory committee that meets on a regular basis. (some more than others).  But the needs of the Jane and Finch community of parents require a presence, a voice, and an involvement that is simply not there.  The families I encounter, the stories I hear (and witnessed while working as a teacher/VP), the people we help are all representatives of how the 'one size fits all' or token programs are simply not enough for some of the communities.  It is even to the extent where you could make an argument public education has become inequitable. (I don't have enough room in this pitch to articulate this but if you would like to discuss feel free to contact me directly. paul@educationinvolved.org)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Every board also has designated 'alternative education' programs. However, the  learning environments that provide all types of learners and intelligences an opportunity to not only be smart, but relevant, and included, are often just that; 'ALTERNATIVE.  Kids who participate in some of these programs can be made to feel stupid, delinquent, or like they don't belong.  I mean how would you feel if your perfectly relevant skill set or learning style was labelled 'alternative' or as some face; only fostered in an after school capacity, like achievements in such warrant nothing more than congratulations for getting involved. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What brought this about was a chance meeting between a WWE superstar and teachers college graduate Santino Marella (Anthony Carelli) and myself.  We discussed education and our connection to it as well as what we both felt it could and should be. Anthony already runs a pro wrestling course at Battle Arts Academy in Mississauga, but it is for members only.  So I told him what we were doing and he stepped up to the challenge of offering something for all kids to have an opportunity to participate in while maintaining the priority of providing opportunity to those who would otherwise not be able to participate. Mr. Carelli has been instrumental in helping us offset costs and raise money.  This includes having the poster designed, and made as well as dedicating time at each show for Education Involved to connect with parents.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Too often charitable efforts yield a mindset of substandard products or services, after all they are free right?  Well we disagree.  If our learning experiences are not good enough to pay for than they are not good enough for charity.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is our goal to be able to one day sponsor at least 20% of our spots in courses via our own revenue streams.  However we are only a year old as an organization so we are asking for some help in the meantime.  </span></li>

All with the aim of reducing the number of lives lost to gun violence in the community each year.
Prior to this I worked  as a teacher for 10 years and a vice principal for 2 in the Jane and Finch community.  I also worked as a vice principal for 1 year in Rexdale before resigning my job as VP to start Education Involved.
Throughout my tenure as a secondary school educator I taught, coached, facilitated international educational experiences for students (Kenya, Mexico, Japan), developed award winning experiential curriculum (program still running), and worked on a steering committee for the Ministry of Education's Urban Priority High School Grant program.
Throughout my tenure I also saw two communities plagued with violence (I have been to almost 2 funerals for every years I was teaching I do not use the word plague lightly) and marginalized in two very important areas of education; Parent engagement and experiential learning/differentiated instruction. 
Yes every board in the province has a mandated parent advisory committee that meets on a regular basis.

Too often charitable efforts yield a mindset of substandard products or services, after all they are free right?  Well we disagree.  If our learning experiences are not good enough to pay for than they are not good enough for charity.  
It is our goal to be able to one day sponsor at least 20% of our spots in courses via our own revenue streams.  However we are only a year old as an organization so we are asking for some help in the meantime.  



What We Need And What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

We need $1871.48  This will provide registration and transportation for 4 students.  Each student represents a fee of $467.87. ($299+hst =337.87 for course + $10/ week for 13 weeks of transportation.)  Total per student is $467.87.)
We have perks and givebacks at many levels of donation. 
If we do not reach the entire goal the funds will remain untouched until we can afford to send an additional student.  Education Involved Advocacy Group takes very seriously your ability to put your money towards any of our programs.  
If we surpass goals money will be directed towards future spots in the course for needy youth, work to support parents in the Jane and Finch community in their ability to navigate the world of their child's education, or be directed appropriately in conjunction with the donor. 



The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:

You will provide 4 youth the opportunity to participate to learn from a WWE superstar while supporting their education.  You also help reinforce a message for 4 young women or men that their passions, learning capacities, and intelligences are valued, important, and relevant.
You will also provide 4 young men or women the opportunity to represent their community (wherever that is) in a fun, exciting and charitable event.  A wrestling show where participants will sell tickets, bolster support, and show off the character and superstar they have created.  All in the context of not only fun and service to others but also through the scope of a very real and thriving industry that has been a part of Canadian culture since before the first Wrestlemania.
By providing an opportunity for students to train and learn at one of the province's top facilities we are sending a message to kids that they deserve the best.  Not a generic knock off, not a second rate venue just because it is coming from a non-profit organization but he very best. Not that this happens with every non-profit or charity but it does happen in the 'industry'. I have seen it from breakfast clubs to motivational speakers. I have also seen the amazing work that charities in and out of the Jane and Finch community do that literally save lives on a daily basis and give people the integrity and respect they deserve and need in their lives.  These are the organizations we aspire to be like.  To us this ability to provide the best quality has a profound impact on the way students view and internalize themselves and their own capability.
This is our first program as an organization so not only are you helping 4 kids specifically, but you are contributing to the effort to advocate for the equity of education in a community that needs after school programs that are rooted in the viability of education to play an integral role in saving lives.  It is sad to say but right now it is not.  
Most importantly everything we do at Education Involved Advocacy Group is geared towards helping parents get involved, and kids re-engage in education as a means of reducing the senseless number of lives lost to gun violence in the community.


Risks and Challenges
Right now our biggest obstacle is our ability to subsidize members of our community.  Education Involved Advocacy group is a brand new organization.  We are adopting the model of a 'social enterprise' in that we will use a business model to raise money for our social goal of equity in education.  One of our paid services will be experiential learning opportunities such as this one.

What qualifies us to over come this hurdle is 13 years experience educating in the Jane and Finch community.
A director with administrative experience in education as well as having sat on steering committee for a Ministry of Education Urban Priority High School Grant team.
Our plan for solving these issues is simple, work with and listen to a community so that we can offer advocacy where it is needed and support where it is asked.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read about my
crowdfunding campaign! <br/></p>
<p>I am Dr. Terrance E.
Dillard, the founder of Digital Countermeasures, Inc.  Digital Countermeasures is an Information Technology,
Information Security Company that specializes in Information Assurance and
Privacy Awareness Education. </p>
<p>Our mission is to provide a comprehensive array of
information security principles and best practices to our customers that are based on a
globally recognized body of knowledge, which raises awareness surrounding
information, and how to protect information assets from hacking incidents or unauthorized
access.  Our company not only provides information security solutions and
resources to our clients, but we also provide certification training in various high-demand,
high-reward Information Technology areas, such as <b>CISSP®, CompTIA
Network+</b>, <b>CompTIA Security+</b>, <b>Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</b>, <b>Project Management Professional (PMP)</b>, as well as several
<b>Microsoft specialties</b>.</p>
<p>As a Computer Science Professor, with more than 35 years of
experience in both technology and information systems, I have observed the low
number of African American youth pursuing careers in information science.  As a
mentor, engineer, native of Detroit, and proud alum of Detroit Public Education, I have observed numerous barriers that have contributed to the lack of African
American participation in science, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. </p>
<p>As a graduate of Detroit Public Schools (DPS), and observer of the myriad challenges that have befallen the district over the past forty-plus years,  I can appreciate how difficult it must be for any student within DPS to break through these barriers.  I
have made it my new mission to provide a unique set of opportunities to students within Detroit Public Schools, and to provide a pathway for learners to enter into the highly rewarding fields of
Information Technology and Cyber Security.  I am convinced that this program
will help young African American students and their families stem the tide of
poverty, despair, under-education, and high unemployment. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The plight of African American youth is thoroughly documented and well
known across the United States; and the problem is particularly acute within the City of Detroit.  In a May 2015 U.S.
News &amp; World Report article, it was reported that African American men were
one of the few groups within the nation that had not made significant
strides in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  This is surprising,
considering the amount of focus that many schools have placed on
science and technology programs in recent years.  However, the less funding a school district has at its disposal, the less commitment schools have demonstrated to underwriting such high opportunity curricula [2]. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447691861/trvi6vuooitecn2zwnht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A report from the National Science Foundation discovered
that the number of African American men, who earned doctoral degrees in science
and technology disciplines, grew by more than 25% over ten years, which may sound impressive on the surface.  However, when delving more deeply into the data, we find
that, despite an overall increase in a ten year period, the <i><b>ACTUAL</b></i> total percentage of the
overall population of Ph.D. recipients was <i><b>less than 6.5%</b></i> [2].</p>
<p>Clearly, more must be done to provide quality educational
opportunities for African American youth if they are to take their rightful
place within the science and technology community.  <i><b>Exposure</b></i>, <i><b>Guidance</b></i>, and <i><b>Mentoring</b></i> have been proven as  critical success factors in the overall acquisition and educational attainment of African American students [3].  If public schools fail
to gain the necessary funding to underwrite such crucial programs for learners
within the African American community, someone must step up and lead the way.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Solution</h3> <p></p>
<p>Schools and public education programs that have adopted Science,
Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math (STEM), as well as Project-Based Learning
(PBL) into their curriculum have discovered that, in addition to enhancing a
student’s potential for competitive economic advantage, it also helps to
increase SAT and achievement test scores.  With a focus on critical thinking and
higher-level thinking skills these programs expose students to patterns of
logical deduction, recognizing logical fallacies in reasoning, and engaging in
problem solving and critical analysis [4; 5].</p>
To expand African American participation in a
highly technical, global marketplace, students will be exposed to programs that
promote critical thinking skills within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math; as well as incorporate real-world experience through labs and simulations.  With my vast background as an
Information Technology professional, and Professor, students will become highly
skilled as I.T. professionals, and will be able to secure a position as interns
and co-op students, beginning at the high school level.<span>  This opportunity will also bring much needed income
into their families and communities, and start making a difference for the
city of Detroit</span>!<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Need<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Although Digital Countermeasures is an incredibly successful
company, we need additional capital to expand our training programs to meet the
needs of this underserved community. With your help, we can make this possible!</p>
<p>Through this campaign, I am seeking to raise $125,000 dollars
to fund the I.T. Certification Training of 192 African American high school students (grades
10 through 12).  Each student will be provided approximately 62 hours of training in Computer Networking, and education in the fundamentals of Information Security.  Our curriculum will expose each learner to a broad array of hands-on activities and principles, which will culminate in each student being certified in an industry
recognized and respected credential in Information Systems.  My team and I will guide each student along a path, which will be informed by real-world experience and background as Information Technologists.  Students will be mentored and nurtured into the community of information science.  I have provided a short list of curriculum topics that will be covered in this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking Basics<br/>
</li>
<li>Cables &amp; Connectors</li>
<li>Networking Devices</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
There are numerous <i><b>internships</b></i> and <i><b>co-operative job
opportunities</b></i> available with various Fortune 100, Fortune 500, Healthcare, Retail,
Higher Ed., Public, and Private firms around our region.  Each of our students will be given access to available opportunities to hone in, and further develop their newly acquired skills in Information Technology.  Your generous donation will
help us bridge a significant gap for African American students who
may desire a career in Information Technology or Cyber Security.  By providing
these students the opportunity to become highly skilled I.T. professionals, we
are helping them pursue high-paying, high-growth careers in Information Science, and enabling them to chart a
rewarding path for their future.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447905548/fmrplszwhgreptoud40w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I grew up thinking that I will make a difference and do something to help the system, which ultimately led me to create this fundraiser. In this effort, I will raise the funds and distribute to known organizations who are genuinely working to have free schools and higher educations in the remote areas of such countries.

Educated women are more likely to seek medical care for themselves and their families and provide proper nutrition and sanitation at home. These practices can ensure healthier and well-nourished families and communities.
Donations
My goal currently is to raise $1500 and I will increase the amount as this progresses.
One of the organizations I’m going to be donating the money to is the Imran Khan Foundation (please refer to link below)

</div></div>","Who Are We?
 Thank you for taking the time to look into this project. We are two final year BA (Hons) Media Production students at Bournemouth University and aspiring media producers. We both have a love for live performance and how new media forms can be used in live performance. We have worked in multiple projects together including our first projection mapped piece ""Breaking Free"". This project is highly ambitious and we need your help to succeed!

The Project
The project is an immersive, projection mapped narrative, held within a space and involving live performers interacting with projection.

In a world where self-expression is prohibited, the idea of the individual simply does not exist: art has been destroyed; song has been forgotten; dance has been forbidden. A world with no expression is a world of peace.
One young dancer is forced to perform in secret, trying to escape The Dictator's soul-destroying 'Shadow Army' from draining her personality  She cannot contain her expression and as she performs, her light is released - catching the attention of a fellow rebellion. Together they relish in their common ability and dance together, forgetting the austerity of the world - if only for a moment. 
In their fight for freedom, their differing personalities tear the two apart. The only way they can fight the shadows is to unite the rebels light and rid the world of the darkness. 


What We Need & What You Get
 For this project to really make an impact we need help to bring the production to life with funding needed in several areas:



Xylobands - One major part of this project is to make the audience feel as if they are fully immersed in the story. For this we will be hiring Xylobands that we can control to light up in areas of the story. Some lucky funders will even be able to keep one!

Event Location - We may not have to spend a huge amount in this area thanks to free to book spaces for students. Any money left over in this area however will go towards providing food and drink for the event to ensure our audience has the best time possible!

Equipment - Although we are lucky enough to have access to a wide array of kit, this is an entirely new project for our course. Therefore we will be needing extra bits of kit such as midi controllers to make the live experience even more spectacular. 

Costumes and Props - To really create our dystopian narrative we will need to dress our performers and set to make it feel authentic.

By contributing to our funding, we will be offering a variety of perks. Take a look on the side-bar to see if there is anything you wanted to claim!

    The Impact
As students working towards our final ever university project, we want to make this more spectacular than any other project we have worked on. Not only is this project the largest percentage of our final degree, but it is also the work that we will carry with us when searching for a job after university, so therefore we want to be incredibly proud of the final outcome.

to achieving their dreams. Through our high school's mock trial program,

fund-raise quickly and easily in the community. Instead our students are

</p><p>All I have ever wanted to do was teach, write and research.</p>
<p>I spend hours of my free time reading and writing for the
betterment of myself, hoping to one day be in a position to spread what I read
to others.  So, I am deciding to pursue
graduate school at Florida International University for a combined MA in
African &amp; African Diaspora (AADS)\PhD in International Relations.</p>
<p>To be considered for this program, I must receive a score of
1120 in the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and present a term paper that demonstrates
that I have exceptional research abilities. </p>
<p>To ensure that I increase my candidacy for the program, I plan
to enroll in a GRE prep course and an introductory African American History
course at a nearby community college, which is why I have decided to crowd
fund.</p>
<p>If you or anyone you know would like to contribute to my
next academic venture, I would be more than appreciative as this has been a
dream that I have been afraid to pursue for quite some time. 100% of your
contributions will be used to enroll in both courses earlier stated. </p>
<p>All donators please e-mail me your current address at
kandice1.hill@gmail.com. I would love to send you a thank you card as a
physical, personable token of my gratitude. </p>
