(Oxford English Dictionary)</strong></p><p>The purpose of the foot is to provide a stable base of support to control the direction of the body weight during the stance phase of locomotion [1-3]. Newtonian physics dictates that a wider base of support is more stable than a narrow base. Width and stability of the forefoot is crucial in this regard as the highest forces during mid stance occur at the forefoot [4, 5]. A greater spread of the toes, the great toe in particular, reduces forefoot peak pressures, distributes force more evenly, and stabilises the foot and ankle [6-8]. Toes squashed together by years of wearing narrow shoes that do not respect the natural fan shape of the human foot [9] are common [10] and are linked to instability and movement-related pain [11, 12]. Natural function can be restored by regular loading of the feet in footwear that respect natural design of the foot [13] and permit freedom for the toes to spread and stabilise the foot.</p><p><strong>Pain-free movement begins with a stable base of support. A stable foot requires Toe freedom, only functional footwear provides toe freedom.

Approximately 60% of RRIs are caused by <u>training errors</u> which result from doing <u>TOO much, TOO soon with TOO little rest</u> in between training sessions (2,3). The remaining 40% of RRIs are caused by <u>anatomical factors, running shoes and training surfaces</u> which independentlyand in combination affect the biomechanical behavior of the foot and the loading of the ankle, knee, hip and lumbopelvis (2,3,4). The interaction of the foot-shoe-surface and it’s effect on running biomechanics can therefore be considered to bethe most important influence on RRIs after ‘training errors’ and the selection of the most appropriate shoe based on the runner’s level of foot function, age, weight and chosen running surface should be considered fundamental to the prevention of injury and pain-free running (2,3,5,6).</p><p>For more information and to see a full list of common running related pain and injuries please see the sources attached:</p><p>1.

The rest of the body can relax, move efficiently and avoid overuse and unnatural stresses on joints and muscles.In conventional footwear, the toes (especially the big toe) are squished and cannot perform their natural function to anchor and stabilize the foot. As a result you stand, walk and run on an unstable base which leads not only to discomfort but is also the most common denominator for pain and injury.*References below__________________________________________________________________________________________The nimbleToes Trail Addict __________________________________________________________________________________________Why toefreedom®?We at Joe Nimble believe, that a tree is only as strong as its roots; just as the roots of a tree adapt to the shape of a container, the shape of the foot adapts to the shoes you are wearing.  Conventional shoes with a shoe-shaped toebox create unnatural, shoe-shaped feet. From the assessment of thousands of feet worldwide, we have learned that just as weak and twisted tree roots affect the stability of the trunk and branches above, so do weak and twisted toes affect the stability of the runner above.*References below____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________We made sure you will love this shoe! __________________________________________________________________________________________The skill of trailrunningCommon injuries in trail running like  knee-, metatarsal- and lower back-pain are due to a lack of skill in switching between gears. The combined benefits of the toefreedom® concept and the flexitec insole have never been offered before in a trail running shoe and we believe this unique combination can be an essential part of the solution to pain-free trail running.*References below BIOMECHANIST, RUNNING COACH AND CREATOR​ OF THE FUNCTIONAL FOOTMAP.Lee is one of the most recognised coaches for running technique on an international level.  His knowledge and experience in running biomechanics and foot function has benefited injured runners, both recreational and elite around the globe and led him to develop the Functional FootMap assessment system.  __________________________________________________________________________________________ProtectionProtective FLEXITEC® insoleThe 4mm thin spring-steel insole is modelled on the anatomy of the foot. Its unique construction promotes an even weight and pressure distribution throughout the foot and ads an extra layer of protection from sharp, irregular objects on the trail.  Experience a new level of confidence and performance during your run, after inserting this simple but brilliant piece of innovation. 

 

SHOE PIONEER AND INVENTOR OF THE FUNCTIONAL FOOTWEAR DESIGN CONCEPT
Sebastian´s family has been making shoes with toefreedom® for over three decades.  His experience of helping people all around the world to improve their foot function through the benefits of toefreedom® and his passion for running has led him to create the Functional Footwear Design Concept.
 __________________________________________________________________________________________Stability__________________________________________________________________________________________TractionSoles by Michelin TechnologyMichelin has been forging a better way forward for over 100 years. They have spanned millions of miles on the mission to develop groundbreaking multi-surface contact for vehicles operating in the most challenging environments all over the world. We decided to partner with Soles by Michelin because of their unrivalled expertise in rubber and tread design to equip our nimbleToes Trail Addict with the perfect outsole for Functional Footwear to meet the unique demands of trailrunning. __________________________________________________________________________________________InspirationBadwater Ultra - the world´s toughest footraceWhen crewing at the worlds toughest footrace, the Badwater Ultramarathon, a few years ago, Sebastian observed that a lot of the elite athletes cut open the front of their running shoe to have more freedom for their toes and reduce the risk of injury.  His unique know-how in making casual shoes with toefreedom® inspired him to introduce this design philosophy to the running shoe industry.__________________________________________________________________________________________""Function""nounan activity that is natural to or the purpose of a person or thing. (Oxford English Dictionary)The purpose of the foot is to provide a stable base of support to control the direction of the body weight during the stance phase of locomotion [1-3]. Newtonian physics dictates that a wider base of support is more stable than a narrow base. Width and stability of the forefoot is crucial in this regard as the highest forces during mid stance occur at the forefoot [4, 5]. A greater spread of the toes, the great toe in particular, reduces forefoot peak pressures, distributes force more evenly, and stabilises the foot and ankle [6-8]. Toes squashed together by years of wearing narrow shoes that do not respect the natural fan shape of the human foot [9] are common [10] and are linked to instability and movement-related pain [11, 12]. Natural function can be restored by regular loading of the feet in footwear that respect natural design of the foot [13] and permit freedom for the toes to spread and stabilise the foot.Pain-free movement begins with a stable base of support. A stable foot requires Toe freedom, only functional footwear provides toe freedom. Joe Nimble ‘functional footwear’ is based on this science. *References below 


DR WILKINSONDr Wilkinson´s research area is the biology of human health and performance. His work has included the biomechanics and performance determinants of distance running and the link between plantar sensation and regulation of bipedal gait.  He has a particular interest in the influence of footwear on foot structure, function and joint loading during running.__________________________________________________________________________________________Ambassadors__________________________________________________________________________________________The History of toefreedom®__________________________________________________________________________________________Testimonials__________________________________________________________________________________________If you’re new to Joe Nimble Functional Footwear you might be wondering what the right shoe size is you should buy. Well, the good news is: You just need to order your regular shoe size.MEASURE YOUR FEETIf you are not sure about your right shoe size, here are some simple instructions for measuring your feet. You only need:
a sheet of paper
a pencil
a ruler or measuring tape
This is how it works: Stand on the paper with both feet while you are wearing socks. Simply trace around the outline of your feet with a pencil one after the other.Important: Always hold the pencil upright on the paper, not leaning tot he inside or outside in order to get an accurate result.Now simply measure the length of your drawing. Measure from the tip oft he longest toe tot he bottom (at the center) of your heel. If your feet are different sizes, then the bigger foot determines the correct shoe size. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Perks __________________________________________________________________________________________Social MediaYou can find more information about Joe Nimble here:Joe Nimble on the web: https://joe-nimble.com/intJoe Nimble on Facebook: www.facebook.com/joenimbleDEJoe Nimble on Instagram: www.instagram.com/joenimbleJoe Nimble on YouTube: https://bit.ly/2Q1EJVVJoe Nimble Blog: https://www.joe-nimble.com/int/explore/the-scie...myFoot education: http://myFoot.com____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________*** Free shipping wordwide (except Russian Federation)***** Campaign ends 09.

Approximately 60% of RRIs are caused by training errors which result from doing TOO much, TOO soon with TOO little rest in between training sessions (2,3). The remaining 40% of RRIs are caused by anatomical factors, running shoes and training surfaces which independentlyand in combination affect the biomechanical behavior of the foot and the loading of the ankle, knee, hip and lumbopelvis (2,3,4). The interaction of the foot-shoe-surface and it’s effect on running biomechanics can therefore be considered to bethe most important influence on RRIs after ‘training errors’ and the selection of the most appropriate shoe based on the runner’s level of foot function, age, weight and chosen running surface should be considered fundamental to the prevention of injury and pain-free running (2,3,5,6).For more information and to see a full list of common running related pain and injuries please see the sources attached:1.

<h3>Introducing Pelotan: <strong>high-performance sun protection designed for cyclists</strong>
</h3>
<p>We created Pelotan as a sun protection brand that recognised the needs of cyclists from professional athletes to weekend club riders. The product has been designed from the ground up specifically for cyclists as ‘once a day’, water and sweat resistant sun protection, allowing you to stay in the saddle longer, perfecting those ultra-sharp tan lines from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526753203/i5k4hzo6ri4m8wpj2vpv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Razor sharp tan lines across one’s thighs and biceps can elicit a simple nod of mutual respect from fellow riders (<a href=""http://www.velominati.com/the-rules"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Velominati rule #7…</a>) but can quickly lead to a hunt for a bottle of aloe vera to soothe dangerous and painful sunburn which, aside from affecting short term performance in the saddle, can have very negative long term consequences.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526753673/ezjimbxa5ocufui9jwre.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>High profile cases of professional riders being seriously burnt after stage events (everyone from Chris Froome to Louis Meintjes and Rudi Selig) and countless examples of riders burning from even shorter training or social rides highlighted the necessity for a specialist product.</p>
<p>Working alongside professional teams and cosmetic experts our formula has been subject to a testing and refinement process, culminating in Pelotan -  the world's first sun protection designed specifically to improve performance, maximise comfort and allow cyclists to ride longer, tan sharper.</p>
</div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s7.postimg.cc/q2wkhis57/Pelotan-_GIF.gif"" src=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Manufactured in the UK, the finished product conforms to EU regulations on UVA and UVB  protection, is photostable, dermatologically tested, contains no preservatives and isn’t tested on animals.</p>
<p>Pelotan SPF30 protects your skin from harmful sun radiation 30 times longer than natural protection and a single application, if done correctly, will last up to 8 hours – meaning you can ride from sunrise to sunset.   </p>

<h3>Pelotan x Isadore</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are delighted to be working with one of the world's leading manufacturers of high-performance cycling clothing, <a href=""https://isadore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Isadore</a>, to create a unique Pelotan x Isadore jersey. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526741491/nr8ohiqyunpzha14cwn0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Isadore is the vision of Martin Velits (former professional cyclist for Etixx-Quickstep) and his twin brother Peter (who rode for BMC). Racking up tens of thousands of kilometres per year training and racing across the globe lends a pretty unbeatable sense of what works well in cycling clothing and what doesn’t - Isadore is a culmination of a lifetime dedicated to the road.</p>
<p>We have teamed up to create a limited edition Climber's Jersey specifically made for intensive workouts and riding uphill - the Climber's Jersey will keep the body temperature balanced when it’s hot outside. Merino fibres naturally absorb UV radiation, protecting the skin from the damage caused by direct sunlight.<strong> See lots more of Isadore's kit in action in our launch video!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Introducing Pelotan: high-performance sun protection designed for cyclists

We created Pelotan as a sun protection brand that recognised the needs of cyclists from professional athletes to weekend club riders. The product has been designed from the ground up specifically for cyclists as ‘once a day’, water and sweat resistant sun protection, allowing you to stay in the saddle longer, perfecting those ultra-sharp tan lines from sunrise to sunset.

Razor sharp tan lines across one’s thighs and biceps can elicit a simple nod of mutual respect from fellow riders (Velominati rule #7…) but can quickly lead to a hunt for a bottle of aloe vera to soothe dangerous and painful sunburn which, aside from affecting short term performance in the saddle, can have very negative long term consequences.


High profile cases of professional riders being seriously burnt after stage events (everyone from Chris Froome to Louis Meintjes and Rudi Selig) and countless examples of riders burning from even shorter training or social rides highlighted the necessity for a specialist product.
Working alongside professional teams and cosmetic experts our formula has been subject to a testing and refinement process, culminating in Pelotan -  the world's first sun protection designed specifically to improve performance, maximise comfort and allow cyclists to ride longer, tan sharper.


 
Manufactured in the UK, the finished product conforms to EU regulations on UVA and UVB  protection, is photostable, dermatologically tested, contains no preservatives and isn’t tested on animals.
Pelotan SPF30 protects your skin from harmful sun radiation 30 times longer than natural protection and a single application, if done correctly, will last up to 8 hours – meaning you can ride from sunrise to sunset.   


 
Our Campaign
We have already invested significant time and resource developing Pelotan, working closely with professional teams and cosmetic experts to produce a sun protection product that performs at the highest level. We are launching the brand across Europe in Summer 2018 and have plans to enter the Australian, Asian and Middle Eastern markets later this year - before arriving in the USA in 2019. 

Your support will help us:

Expand into international markets, creating a global sun protection brand made by cyclists, for cyclists
Work with more professional teams and sponsored athletes to improve comfort and performance in races from UCI Level down to regional comps - giving marginal gains that could make the difference between a place on the podium and the Yellow Jersey
Continue our product development as we push the boundaries of performance
Introduce new sizes and specifications into our product range
Continue to support grass-roots cycling events, sportives and charity rides - ensuring rider safety and comfort

All campaign backers will receive exclusive early bird offers and discounts on future products.


 
Order now and Pelotan will be delivered in June (EU) 
Our flagship product - Pelotan SPF 30 (200ml) is available for immediate dispatch to EU countries.
Our range of exclusive Pelotan accessories including Pelotan x Isadore Jersey and Bidons are available for dispatch worldwide throughout June. Our professional training plans are available for delivery via email and our incredible experiential 'Yellow Jersey Bundle' including a ride in a team car in a professional race will be arranged with supporters privately.

 
Pro Team Support

As part of a commitment to high performance, Pelotan are working with the UK’s #1 domestic team Ribble Pro Cycling for the 2018 season.

We are proud to support incredible cycling teams throughout their seasons, from training camps to races. We have developed premium sun protection products with the performance cyclist in mind as we firmly believe that in a world of marginal gains, comfortable riders race harder. Our long-lasting formula enables our riders and teams to train, race and recover in the sunshine for longer - from sunrise to sunset.

Pelotan x Isadore


We are delighted to be working with one of the world's leading manufacturers of high-performance cycling clothing, Isadore, to create a unique Pelotan x Isadore jersey. 

Isadore is the vision of Martin Velits (former professional cyclist for Etixx-Quickstep) and his twin brother Peter (who rode for BMC). Racking up tens of thousands of kilometres per year training and racing across the globe lends a pretty unbeatable sense of what works well in cycling clothing and what doesn’t - Isadore is a culmination of a lifetime dedicated to the road.
We have teamed up to create a limited edition Climber's Jersey specifically made for intensive workouts and riding uphill - the Climber's Jersey will keep the body temperature balanced when it’s hot outside. Merino fibres naturally absorb UV radiation, protecting the skin from the damage caused by direct sunlight. See lots more of Isadore's kit in action in our launch video!

 
Pelotan x Rouleur


Rouleur magazine is the world’s finest road cycling journal, read by a global group of dedicated road cycling fans, pro riders and the most influential bike riders in the world.

The Rouleur Emporium offers the very best cycling products, exclusively curated for on the bike, off the bike and for your home. Rouleur have notoriously high standards and work hard to create the finest range of exclusive items - including Pelotan.
For the Summer 2018 Season, Rouleur Emporium will be the exclusive online retailer of Pelotan products, sitting alongside many of the most well-respected brands in the market.

The lab sounds fancy and it is...and because of it we have the scientific data to explain the unique performance of our compression wrap.Enter the clinician...Dr. Kris Edwards. An entrepreneurial chiropractor and owner operator of a multidisciplinary health care clinic in Oshawa. He may not love research and crunching data points the way Dr. Mike does but he has a passion for helping his patients. The symbiotic relationship between the researcher and the clinician is strongly present and it has driven a lot of the research and development behind this new and innovative medical device. The Opus gel™  Compression Wrap has been field tested with rave reviews.Our CEO Bob Macmillan is the youngest old person of the group. He really wants to be fishing, but his hands are full keeping the crew reigned in. Most recently, Bob was VP Admin of a national public affairs/public relations firm, prior to that he was assistant director of an adult training company. Realizing the Opus gel™  Wrap will have significant impact on the health and wellness segment. Bob has additional product launches on the drawing board...fishing is on hold for now!Peter Davidson, our Chief Marketing Officer, is a seasoned strategic marketer that questions EVERYTHING! He even has an MBA that he earned before the guy who created the internet was even born. That's right...he had to wear pants while learning. Peter's diverse work background includes engineering, Group VP of Marketing and Sales, small business owner/operator, start-up consultant...and more recently he has been concerned with medical device innovation and development focusing on issues affecting a person’s wellness.Our Chief Operations Officer, Jason Thomson, is also an entrepreneur who runs his own business. Jason's experience in manufacturing, production planning and logistics has made him the ""how to make it happen"" guy. As a sports enthusiast, he has already reaped the benefits of the Opus gel™ Wrap. The Wrap has soothed many minor injuries...now goalie Jason just needs something to help stop the pucks!CFO Ross Libbey is a chartered accountant who brings to the team not only smart finance decisions but also years of experience in the business world. As the current president of an accounting firm, Ross is dedicated to making smart business decisions and obtaining successful results. Through his years of experience as a CPA, Ross is confident that the Opus gel™  Wrap is headed for success. Our team is passionate about health and wellness.

</div><h3>Overview</h3><p>Hi, my name is Jeanne Hahne and I'm a registered nurse in San Francisco. I would like to introduce a new surgical face mask that can lift the barrier between patient and caregiver. That's really important for communication, seeing the entire facial expression, especially a reassuring smile. A clear mask means reading lips for the deaf and the elderly. For a scared child, a clear mask allows them to connect with their caregiver or family. The difference between an opaque and the FaceView Mask™ is CLEAR and can make a huge difference in patient care.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""person wearing the clear mask"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.clearvisionfacemask.com/images/jennifer100DSC_5532.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-right: 10px;""/><img align=""right"" alt=""person wearing an opaque mask"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.clearvisionfacemask.com/images/jennifer100DSC_5536.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px;""/>The number one cause of medical errors is communication, and the FaceView Mask™ has the potential to reduce errors and promote better patient outcomes.</p><p>The benefits are clear, and we need your help to bring this next generation of face masks to the medical and hearing-impaired communities, as well as to the non-medical industries. Masks are also worn in dental offices, clean rooms in high tech, environmental services, disaster relief, nail salons, military uses and on the street!</p><p>We need help for production tooling, user and focus group studies, designing for mass production, medical design and testing. These are some of the areas involved to introduce a new medical device that is affordable.</p><p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""drawing of the mask"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.clearvisionfacemask.com/images/maskdrawing600.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Our goal is to produce three models of the FaceView Mask™. A non-medical model for personal use as a dust mask, a tested medical/surgical model, and a respirator model with N95 certification. Initial prototypes of the personal model are available now, but we still want to perfect this prototype.</p><p>This is so important! We need this mask because communication is enhanced by seeing an individual's entire face. As you check out the videos and visit the rest of the campaign page, let me say ""Thank you"" in advance for helping us make a difference!</p><h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3><p>The Indiegogo funds raised will enable us to complete the design, tooling, and testing that are needed to make an affordable mask for use in our hospitals and communities. We have to plan for its efficacy, durability and user-friendliness.</p>
<p>It is more complicated to manufacture a mask with a clear portion in terms of materials, labor, and processes. We also need to have FDA approval and go through regulatory processes.</p>
<p>Our initial mask is the personal dust mask version, not yet qualified for medical or occupational use.  If we exceed our goal, we can look forward to additional models, such as smaller sizes for children!</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p><img align=""left"" alt=""Jeanne wearing the clear mask"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.clearvisionfacemask.com/images/jeanneclear.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-right: 10px;""/>The FaceView Mask™ will improve communication, connection and compassion.

She had a point. We need to be looking to make new things better, and the FaceView Mask™ has the potential to transform the medical/dental/occupational professions on a global scale. With your support, we can revolutionize the mask industry!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>The other way you can help us is to spread the word and let others know about our Indiegogo campaign. Talk about us on Facebook or tweet about it! </p><p>Especially let others know who might benefit from FaceView masks.

With our new studio, we can offer classes and courses to a wider range of ages and fitness levels. These future students are just like people in your life wherever you are. It may be your Grandmother who has severe arthritis. It may be one of your children who has too much energy.

Tai Chi University offers a longevity program through the internal arts of Tai Chi, Meditation, and Acupressure Message Therapy.  How often are we too busy to stop and consider our life path and how far it will go? Google defines longevity as “long life”, long existence or service”The founder of Taiji, Zhang Sanfeng is reported to have lived 170 Years.

Li Ching Yuen is reported to have lived for 256 years.



For those of you who believe that this matters, let me ask:



What price would you put on being able to extend your lifespan?


What price would you put on the life span of someone you know?


 how much would you give help someone you don't know?







Our programs are specifically designed to not only extend life but to also to do so in a very positive and meaningful way. For five years, we have shared the teachings in various venues. Now it is time to take the program to the next level by sharing them in a dedicated Tai Chi  and Meditation Studio.

As I was looking for a solution, I got to experience VR for the first time. I then asked, “What if I can make my wife feel like she is riding outside while she is at home using a VR system?” This is how I began developing Blync.With my background in hardware and software systems design, together with a team of engineers and designers, we are committed to make Blync a reality with the highest quality possible. Thank you for your support! Introducing BlyncVR has opened up various ways for us to experience reality. Imagine biking through different virtual environments from the comfort of your living room. With a quick setup, Blync lets you venture across various terrains as if you were outdoors!  CYCLE THROUGH CHALLENGING TERRAIN SAFELY. While biking can be a refreshing fitness activity, it also comes with safety risks. Blync lets you get the thrill of biking on dangerous terrains from the safety of your home. MAINTAIN HEALTHY FITNESS LEVELS. Finally, you don't have to cancel cycling rides during winter. Blync helps you have consistent fitness activity for improved physical well-being. Ride your bike at any time of the day or any season of the year. REALISTIC CYCLING EXPERIENCE. Blync is made up of a path sensor and speed sensor. While other virtual bikes mainly control where you go on the virtual world while you pedal, Blync's path sensor allows you to turn and control where you want to go. Feel free to do stunts or explore the world in VR! Blync also records your fitness activities like calories burnt, average riding power and average speed. COMFORTABLE RIDING EXPERIENCE. One of the main issues people experience (especially for newcomers to VR) is feeling dizzy during motion.

Lauren saw firsthand the powerful positive benefits her clients received from bilateral stimulation, a technique that naturally calms the nervous system by introducing vibrations to the right and left sides of the body in an alternating rhythm.  The app can control the speed, length of the pause between pulses, the duration of the pulse and the intensity. But she wanted a product that her young clients could easily use during play therapy without being inhibited by wires—something durable enough for kids, convenient enough for parents and compact enough for anyone wanting to try bilateral stimulation at home, work or school. Lauren set out to create this product, combining her insights as a therapist with leading-edge technology and decades of neuroscience research. Whether you are an EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapist, a play therapist, the parent of a child who struggles emotionally or someone looking to manage stress, Bumble BLS products are here to help.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Buzzies for EMDR:</strong> Designed with EMDR therapists in mind, Bumble BLS products offer durable construction, wireless performance and both manual and Bluetooth control. EMDR clients can wear Buzzies on the included wristbands, or remove them for handheld bilateral stimulation. Buzzies are easy to sanitize,  and can be operated at a distance during in-person sessions.  Clients can also use them at home—along with Bumble BLS in-app visuals—during teletherapy. If this project exceeds its goal times eight, it will unlock a “stretch goal” for an upgraded model that therapists can control remotely (if this perk is ""unlocked"" you will be given the option to pay extra to upgrade to the remote-operated version).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Buzzies for Therapy &amp; Play Therapy:</strong> In non-EMDR sessions, Buzzies can  help clients regulate their emotions as they explore their windows of tolerance. Clients can also use Buzzies at home for resourcing or to help regulate the nervous system as a coping tool. With their wireless design, sand- and water-proof construction, and easy-to-clean material, Bumble BLS Buzzies are especially great for play therapists. Children can keep them in their pockets during play therapy sessions to help them stay grounded as they process, or use them with our fun ladybug-shaped plush cases.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Buzzies at Home:</strong> Whether you are managing your own stress, or using them with your children during tantrums, bilateral stimulation with Buzzies  promote emotional regulation. Buzzies offer unmatched convenience and versatility. Wear them on the included wristbands, or detach and stash them in your pockets or socks. Plus, Buzzies can mount to any universal 18mm watch band. However you use them, Buzzies will be you and your family’s new go-to solution for natural calming.</p><p>Bilateral stimulation is a powerful and 100 percent natural way to calm the nervous system and slow the release of the stress hormone cortisol. Tactile bilateral stimulation is done by introducing gentle vibrations to the left and right sides of the body in an alternating rhythm, which soothes the body’s fight or flight response, lessening the symptoms of anxiety and opening the brain to enhanced focus and therapeutic progress. This concept forms the basis of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), the world’s leading trauma therapy, which utilizes bilateral stimulation to help clients reprocess traumatic memories.</p><p>You don’t need to be in a therapy session to benefit from bilateral stimulation. Whether you are managing your own stress, or using them with your children during tantrums or other emotional struggles, bilateral stimulation with Buzzies is an effective way to promote a natural sense of calm. Buzzies can be used preventatively, in response to anxiety, or to help kids manage their feelings. The bilateral stimulation offered by Buzzies has also been shown to support emotional regulation and mitigate sensory sensitivity in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whether you plan to use bilateral stimulation with your children or on your own, Buzzies offer unmatched convenience and versatility. Wear them on the included wristbands, or detach and stash them in your pockets or socks. Plus, Buzzies can mount to any universal 18mm watch band.

<br/>So we are looking for any help we can get!</div></div>","All the money raised here will be to cover legal fees involved with defending the rights to make basic computer-controlled sex toys.Check out this Gizmodo Article for a quick update: gizmodo: http://gizmodo.com/sorry-you-cant-have-any-more...BackgroundWithout warning, on July 20th, Comingle, and several other sex and tech companies (including Kickstarter and Vibease) unexpectedly had a suit filed against them.This is all public knowledge and is listed here: https://search.rpxcorp.com/ent/955039-tzu-technologies-llc  .   Please peruse this for more information about the case and all the defendants involved. If I have incorrectly stated any facts from this case, it is my own fault, and Comingle should not be to blame. Here's what I have been able to discern.The people bringing the suit are classified as a ""Non-Practicing Entity"" meaning they hold patents, but do not make anything themselves. These are the companies sometimes heard of pejoratively referred to as ""patent trolls.""It seems that, according to them they have a patent (this one:  http://www.google.com/patents/US6368268 )  which they think applies to ANY sort of teledildonics operation. For instance, they argue that we are in violation by having a ""browser based platform for controlling the devices."" They have claims against a person remotely operating a toy with another person.Unfortunately we are just a very small company just starting, and thus need as much help as we can get to try to defend ourselves from such attacks. So we are requesting your assistance to help save our open-technology.More details in these articles:Ars Technica: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/tele...Boingboing: http://bbs.boingboing.net/t/patent-troll-is-kil...Metafetish: http://www.metafetish.com/2015/07/22/patent-troll-versus-everyone-teledildonics-patent-lawsuit/

How You Can HelpHere's the best way to help us right now:
 Share some money to our legal defense fund
 Help us find a pro-bono patent lawyer who would be willing to help us out with this case.
  Help find prior art for computer, network, or internet controlled (sexual) stimulation devices. It needs to be items that
A) Existed and were publicly availableB) Are dated before August 1997.
 Send findings to info@comingle.io and put ""Prior-Art"" in the subject.

(More details on prior art: 35 USC 102 (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102) defines novelty as invalid if ""the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.”)

Here's a nice example:  CyberSM, The 2nd Experiment, 1993-94 from Kirk Woolford on Vimeo.
A patent suit requires TONS of money. Our lawyer friends said that it will be probably around $10,000 just to show up in court in California, and that patent suits typically require 300-500K of legal fees. We are getting quotes of 1 million plus! WHAT!!/??

<h4>Women and Children</h4>
<p>In Africa alone, people spend 40 billion hours every year walking for water. Women and children usually bear the burden of water collection, where they are forced to walk miles to the nearest water source, which is too often unprotected and contaminated. Time spent walking to collect water alongside illness from waterborne diseases keeps children from school and women from work.

<h4>Food Supply</h4>
<p>Feeding the world uses up nearly 90% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals. When a well is built in a community, members can often use the new water source to grow small gardens near their homes and secure their own food supply.</p>

Yenso Solar purchases lamps from manufacturers at wholesale price and distributes them through an innovative, 3-pronged sales strategy: direct sales to households and small businesses, partnerships with traveling salesmen who already travel to hard to reach areas, wholesale to credit unions who can provide financing.

Once begun, Yenso Solar will be self-sustaining and will not rely on donations. Profits from the lamps will be reinvested into helping a larger audience and employing more Ghanaians. As a business venture, we are forced to constantly evaluate our performance and innovate to most efficiently create social good. Our current business model has been validated by in-country testing and by the experiences of our partners in other regions. Yenso Solar purchases lamps from manufacturers at wholesale price and distributes them through an innovative, 3-pronged sales strategy: direct sales to households and small businesses, partnerships with traveling salesmen who already travel to hard to reach areas, wholesale to credit unions who can provide financing. We also capitalize on the unique culture of remittances--richer city dwellers sending support back to their home villages. We are planning a targeted advertising campaign to market the Sun King Pro 2 as the gift every good son sends to his mother in the village. Your ImpactEvery dollar donated will help bring light to a family in Ghana. Your support will provide opportunity for the future entrepreneurs, scientists and leaders of Africa. The money will be used to purchase a larger inventory of lamps, hire and train sales representatives, and offset the initial costs of starting an official business in Ghana.

<p>My name is Dena Goldberg and I am working on
my Master's at UC Irvine in Genetic Counseling. Now, what is genetic
counseling? Chances are you have never heard of this career. If you have, you
probably think it has something to do with making designer babies. This
misconception is very far from the truth, and is one of the reasons I am doing
this project. </p>
<p>The problem is that many people going through
medical odysseys trying to find a diagnosis and seeing doctor after doctor to
find out what is wrong with them have never been referred to genetics, and most
doctors have little to no training in genetics. So many people with genetic
disorders have never been diagnosed because no one ever sent them to a genetics
clinic. The only way to change this is to raise AWARENESS and EDUCATE people
about genetics in their own medical care.</p>
<p>This project will capture the current
knowledge and opinions of the general public towards genetic counseling and
find ways to increase awareness through education initiatives.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for
     funding to cover all of the materials needed for this project including:</li>
<ul>
<li>Booth space at events and expos <br/>
</li>
<li>Event Rentals (table, chair, wi-fi, electric)</li>
<li>2 Posters</li>
<li>Flyers/pamphlets</li>
<li>Giveaways to promote participation<br/>
</li>
<li>URL for survey<br/>
</li>
<li>Analysis software</li>
<li>Travel Expenses</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>This type of
     study has never been done in the United States, and I believe it will be
     useful to show how genetics can be brought to the public eye. </li>
<li>I am a graduate
     student and have no source of income. I applied for a few grants, but did not
     receive any so I decided to try crowd-funding.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>As genetic counselors, we see patients for a
variety of reasons in multiple settings. We may see pregnant women with an
increased risk for a birth defect or genetic disorder such as Down syndrome. We
may see a child with autism that has never been explained, or a person with
multiple medical problems that don't make sense. We may see patients at risk for
one of the rare types of cancer that run in families, or a patient deciding
whether to get early testing for an adult-onset form of disease. Technically, every
person could benefit from seeing a genetic counselor at some point in his or
her life, but most people don't know we exist.</p>
<p>By increasing awareness</p>
<ul>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary 
My name is Dena Goldberg and I am working on
my Master's at UC Irvine in Genetic Counseling. Now, what is genetic
counseling? Chances are you have never heard of this career. If you have, you
probably think it has something to do with making designer babies. This
misconception is very far from the truth, and is one of the reasons I am doing
this project. 
The problem is that many people going through
medical odysseys trying to find a diagnosis and seeing doctor after doctor to
find out what is wrong with them have never been referred to genetics, and most
doctors have little to no training in genetics. So many people with genetic
disorders have never been diagnosed because no one ever sent them to a genetics
clinic. The only way to change this is to raise AWARENESS and EDUCATE people
about genetics in their own medical care.
This project will capture the current
knowledge and opinions of the general public towards genetic counseling and
find ways to increase awareness through education initiatives.
   What We Need & What You Get 

I am asking for
     funding to cover all of the materials needed for this project including:

Booth space at events and expos 

Event Rentals (table, chair, wi-fi, electric)
2 Posters
Flyers/pamphlets
Giveaways to promote participation

URL for survey

Analysis software
Travel Expenses
Etc.

This type of
     study has never been done in the United States, and I believe it will be
     useful to show how genetics can be brought to the public eye. 
I am a graduate
     student and have no source of income. I applied for a few grants, but did not
     receive any so I decided to try crowd-funding.

  The Impact 
As genetic counselors, we see patients for a
variety of reasons in multiple settings. We may see pregnant women with an
increased risk for a birth defect or genetic disorder such as Down syndrome. We
may see a child with autism that has never been explained, or a person with
multiple medical problems that don't make sense. We may see patients at risk for
one of the rare types of cancer that run in families, or a patient deciding
whether to get early testing for an adult-onset form of disease. Technically, every
person could benefit from seeing a genetic counselor at some point in his or
her life, but most people don't know we exist.
By increasing awareness


More people would
know to ask about seeing a genetic counselor or to self-refer

More people would
have a diagnosis, and therefore a better medical plan

A person with a
known genetic change could learn about his or her options before having
children

A person with a
specific diagnosis would know what other medical problems to look for at
different stages in lifeOne of the
     educational interventions I’m currently making is a comic strip I created starring
     a cartoon genetic counselor. (denadna.com)
    Risks & Challenges 

The biggest
     challenge with this project will be getting a representative population sample.
     I plan to conduct my research at various public events, but most of them
     cost money, which is where you come in. 
A higher budget
     means a higher number of participants I will be able to survey, and the
     more useful my results will be. 

  Other Ways You Can Help

</p><p><b>Who is Khensani
Mokhari?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Khensani Mokhari is a thoughtful,
respectful and responsible young woman who lives with her parents and 2 sisters
in Diepsloot, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg. In Grade 8, Khensani
was awarded a scholarship to a private girls’ boarding school outside of
Johannesburg. From the time of her arrival, Khensani worked consistently,
involved herself in a wide range of activities and was an active participant in
all her classes. In 2013, Khensani’s quiet leadership style was recognized and
she was elected to represent her grade on the Student Representative Council. </p>
<p><b>An incident that
would change her life forever.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Khensani started her Grade 10 year with the
same energy and commitment and she looked set to have another good year.
However, in June 2014, she reported to the nurses on campus that she was
struggling with headaches and some visual problems. She was referred to an
ophthalmologist who found that something was pushing on the optic nerve. An MRI
revealed that she had a very large tumour (7.75 x 6 x 4.5 cm) in the left
ventricle of her brain that was pushing on her optic nerve. The neurosurgeon
who was called in to consult was very clear she would have to have the tumour
removed despite the risks of surgery. The alternative was that Khensani would
live for approximately 6 more months during which time she would go blind and
gradually become paralysed.</p>
<p>Khensani was referred to the Paediatric
Oncology Unit at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH)
where she was diagnosed with a rare, multi-system genetic condition called
tuberous sclerosis which causes benign tumours to grow in the brain and other
organs. </p>
<p>Khensani was started on treatment for her
underlying condition and she was booked for surgery to remove the tumour. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Complications of her
operations.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Khensani’s condition deteriorated rapidly and
she started having seizures after 5 days on the treatment. She was taken immediately
to the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre in Johannesburg where a CT scan
revealed that the tumour had continued to grow very quickly and was almost
completely obstructing the cerebrospinal fluid. </p>
<p>On 20 June 2014, Khensani underwent
emergency surgery to insert an external drain in order to relieve the pressure
and stop the seizures.  The next day, she
went into theatre again; this time for a 7 hour surgery to remove the tumour.
Khensani was recovering well in the Intensive Care unit, until, 3 days after
the surgery, she developed an infection and developing swelling in the brain.
She had 2 more surgeries; to relieve the pressure and then to have an internal
catheter inserted. </p>
<p>Khensani’s recovery after the final surgery
was much slower. While this could be expected after four brain surgeries in 10
days, it also emerged that Khensani had lost most of her vision in both eyes as
a result of the invasive nature of the surgeries. She also had some facial
nerve palsy and did not have full use of her arms and legs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Khensani’s Recovery.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>She underwent intensive rehabilitation to
regain her gross and fine motor control and to monitor her progress in terms of
regaining her vision. She and her family also received counselling to assist
them to manage through this time. Unfortunately, her vision has not improved at
all. Assessments by the staff at the rehab centre have been confirmed by a
specialist optometrist and Khensani is now considered to be functionally blind.
</p>
<p>This meant that, in addition to the many other
losses and adjustments Khensani has had to manage, she was unable to return to
the mainstream school to which she had won a scholarship. Instead it was
necessary to find her a school that could assist her with developing the kinds
of skills that she will need in order to function effectively in the world as a
person with a visual impairment. Fortunately, Khensani was admitted as a weekly
boarder into Prinshof School for the Visually Impaired in Pretoria. </p>
<p>Khensani has adapted incredibly well to her
new environment where she has endeared herself to the staff with her
willingness to adapt, her sense of humour and her determination to achieve her
goals in spite of her disability. In an email about Khensani’s transition, the Prinshof

<p></p></div>","Who is Khensani
Mokhari?

Khensani Mokhari is a thoughtful,
respectful and responsible young woman who lives with her parents and 2 sisters
in Diepsloot, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg. In Grade 8, Khensani
was awarded a scholarship to a private girls’ boarding school outside of
Johannesburg. From the time of her arrival, Khensani worked consistently,
involved herself in a wide range of activities and was an active participant in
all her classes. In 2013, Khensani’s quiet leadership style was recognized and
she was elected to represent her grade on the Student Representative Council. 
An incident that
would change her life forever.

Khensani started her Grade 10 year with the
same energy and commitment and she looked set to have another good year.
However, in June 2014, she reported to the nurses on campus that she was
struggling with headaches and some visual problems. She was referred to an
ophthalmologist who found that something was pushing on the optic nerve. An MRI
revealed that she had a very large tumour (7.75 x 6 x 4.5 cm) in the left
ventricle of her brain that was pushing on her optic nerve. The neurosurgeon
who was called in to consult was very clear she would have to have the tumour
removed despite the risks of surgery. The alternative was that Khensani would
live for approximately 6 more months during which time she would go blind and
gradually become paralysed.
Khensani was referred to the Paediatric
Oncology Unit at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH)
where she was diagnosed with a rare, multi-system genetic condition called
tuberous sclerosis which causes benign tumours to grow in the brain and other
organs. 
Khensani was started on treatment for her
underlying condition and she was booked for surgery to remove the tumour. 

Complications of her
operations.

Khensani’s condition deteriorated rapidly and
she started having seizures after 5 days on the treatment. She was taken immediately
to the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre in Johannesburg where a CT scan
revealed that the tumour had continued to grow very quickly and was almost
completely obstructing the cerebrospinal fluid. 
On 20 June 2014, Khensani underwent
emergency surgery to insert an external drain in order to relieve the pressure
and stop the seizures.  The next day, she
went into theatre again; this time for a 7 hour surgery to remove the tumour.
Khensani was recovering well in the Intensive Care unit, until, 3 days after
the surgery, she developed an infection and developing swelling in the brain.
She had 2 more surgeries; to relieve the pressure and then to have an internal
catheter inserted. 
Khensani’s recovery after the final surgery
was much slower. While this could be expected after four brain surgeries in 10
days, it also emerged that Khensani had lost most of her vision in both eyes as
a result of the invasive nature of the surgeries. She also had some facial
nerve palsy and did not have full use of her arms and legs. 
 
Khensani’s Recovery.

She underwent intensive rehabilitation to
regain her gross and fine motor control and to monitor her progress in terms of
regaining her vision. She and her family also received counselling to assist
them to manage through this time. Unfortunately, her vision has not improved at
all. Assessments by the staff at the rehab centre have been confirmed by a
specialist optometrist and Khensani is now considered to be functionally blind.

This meant that, in addition to the many other
losses and adjustments Khensani has had to manage, she was unable to return to
the mainstream school to which she had won a scholarship. Instead it was
necessary to find her a school that could assist her with developing the kinds
of skills that she will need in order to function effectively in the world as a
person with a visual impairment. Fortunately, Khensani was admitted as a weekly
boarder into Prinshof School for the Visually Impaired in Pretoria. 
Khensani has adapted incredibly well to her
new environment where she has endeared herself to the staff with her
willingness to adapt, her sense of humour and her determination to achieve her
goals in spite of her disability. In an email about Khensani’s transition, the Prinshof
Head of Occupational Therapy noted:
Khensani misses her old school and
everyone there very much, but she seems to have adapted well to Prinshof School
and hostel. She still gets lost at times, but her wonderful sense of humour
helps her to overcome her loss of vision. She says that she had to accept her
visual impairment quickly because life was not going to stop and wait for her
to do so and she does not want to miss out on anything at all. 
This really captures something about
Khensani’s spirit!

Khensani a better future.

With prayers and positivity reaching her from around the world, I've no doubt she will bounce back from this with the holistic beauty and grace for which she's known and so very loved.</b><br/>
</blockquote>
<p>Meet Norma. She's a 67-year-old all-around amazing woman - my mother, my best friend, the reason I'm in this country today living out her American Dream, and now, a colon cancer survivor. She has been in the ICU at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach since Sept. 23, 2013, following an extremely unexpected colon resection after detection of a tumor, a surgery that sadly ended with her body going into <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sepsis-septic-shock-topic-overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">septic shock</a>, sending five her of systems into acute failure. She has fought for every single function since, making admirable progress day after day thanks to formidable baby steps. The first time she opened her eyes and told me she loved me after being on a ventilator for 10 days is a moment I will never forget. </p>
<p>Prior to this incident, my mom's prior hospitalizations had been to birth my brother and me, and the only pills she took were the occasional Aleve or Advil to ease a headache or knee pain. Undoubtedly, going through this alongside my mom has opened my eyes to all that we too often take for granted. Certainly, I never expected to see my mom in such conditions and most certainly, not so suddenly.</p>
<p>Her resilience, her strength and her determination have made me prouder than I've ever been to be her daughter. While I have always known her to be brave, I could've never imagined her in the face of this type of adversity. Yet, every morning, she welcomes me with a smile; she's sweet and kind to her medical team; and she stays focused despite feeling the pains she feels on a daily basis, which include intensive physical therapy and continuous dialysis. </p>
<p>Her attitude is not surprising, however. My mom has always been the most beautiful of people. In her late 40s, she backed my dad's decision to come to the U.S. in search for a better future for my brother and me, leaving behind not only her beloved Buenos Aires but also her entire family. Since, she has worked every single day to ensure our happiness her, motivating us to live out <a href=""http://www.ahamoment.com/moments/4671?page=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our American Dream</a>, to be better, to aim higher, to be happier. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the time, effort and money my parents spent on ensuring their children's future didn't go far ensuring theirs. They don't own a home or a car and live modestly on my mom's nannying wages. As my dad's mental health deteriorated over the past couple of years, he has remained unemployed, making my mom the breadwinner and the backbone of their home.</p>
<p>That backbone has now been resting on a hospital bed for more than a month, and the more aware she becomes of time, the more she realizes its financial impact. While she is covered, to a certain extent, by Medicaid, everyday life has been adding up quickly, with insufficient funds for rent and utilities. While I have been able to offer some assistance, spending the entire month with my dad and her, I fall short in providing for them, particularly as I await my husband's homecoming after a 10-month deployment with the U.S. Navy.</p>

<h3>We are ready to help you right now!</h3>
<p>When was the last time you did something for yourself or someone you care about?  Get a hair mineral analysis test!  The hair test will provide information on ways to improve your vitality and energy levels.  The spin-off effects of your improved health will make you a more enjoyable person to be around, your increased energy will make you more productive, and simple health solutions and suggestions from our experienced practitioners will allow your body to begin to heal itself.  </p>
<p>Let's say your test comes back showing high levels of mercury.  The practitioners will ask you if you consume large quantities of fish.  If you answer yes, a simple suggestion of eating less fish or smaller species that have had less time to accumulate mercury will be made.  If your test comes back high in aluminum, the practitioners will ask if you regularly consume tap water or use antiperspirants that may be contributing to your high aluminum levels.   If this is the case, alternative practical suggestions will be made.  If your test reveals low calcium then a tendency exists towards osteoporosis, bone fractures, dental cavities, muscle cramps, etc.  If your test reveals an elevated calcium level, a strong tendency exists for arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries due to calcium plaques).  Recommendations will be made for balancing calcium levels to normal based on the rest of the test results.</p>
<p>Individual mineral levels and heavy metal toxicities need to be viewed in the context of the entire hair test before specific recommendations will be made as the body works as a system rather than in individual parts.  The hair mineral analysis allows a qualified practitioner to see the entire picture of what is going on with your health.  The medical science behind the hair analysis test  enables practitioners to make life changing recommendations to balance your body.</p>

<h3>Objectives of our campaign:</h3>
<p><b>1. To promote awareness of hair mineral analysis, the sensible and scientific method of analyzing your health.  </b></p>
<p>Our team has been using this evidence based method of health assessment for over thirty years.  It is time to bring this scientific process mainstream.</p>
<p>What if you spent the next twenty years trying to find out what is wrong with you only to discover that the well water you drank as a child contained lead?</p>
<p>Imagine the lead stored in your body causing you to have symptoms such as:  abnormal brain function, insomnia, depression, chronic constipation, diabetes, cancer, hypothyroidism.   Now imagine receiving all types of medication to combat your problems and not ever dealing with the root cause of the issue, which is the lead poisoning.  </p>
<p>You want to be armed with all of the information you can possibly have to improve your health.  A simple hair test will provide you with very different information than a blood or urine test. </p>
<p>The first step to get out of the downward spiral is to see if there are any obvious imbalances in your body chemistry which will be shown on your hair analysis test results.  We will review your test results with you and make recommendations to bring your body back into balance so it can begin to heal itself.</p>
<p>Test Your Hair offers a healing protocol that will change your understanding regarding product and food choices, eating habits, drinking water, exercise, rest, weight balancing, and overall lifestyle.  </p>
<p><b>2.  Never before have we been exposed to such high levels of stress and chemicals in our foods and environment.  We need to give Dr Lawrence Wilson the opportunity to update the out of print book Energy with current information so people are given the tools on how to increase energy and regain vitality. </b> (The book Energy is based on an interview with Dr Paul Eck, the pioneer of hair analysis.)  </p>
<p>Many people today are burned out, stressed, more easily irritated, and fatigued, leading to deteriorating health.  Dr Lawrence Wilson has spent the last thirty years fine tuning the process of using hair analysis to pinpoint stress patterns and toxicities that cause fatigue and burnout.  We are working with Dr Wilson on Energy II, an easy-to-read guide that will help you increase your vitality and maintain your energy levels.  A must read for anyone struggling with low energy and looking for answers.</p>

When was the last time you did something for yourself or someone you care about?  Get a hair mineral analysis test!  The hair test will provide information on ways to improve your vitality and energy levels.  The spin-off effects of your improved health will make you a more enjoyable person to be around, your increased energy will make you more productive, and simple health solutions and suggestions from our experienced practitioners will allow your body to begin to heal itself.  
Let's say your test comes back showing high levels of mercury.  The practitioners will ask you if you consume large quantities of fish.  If you answer yes, a simple suggestion of eating less fish or smaller species that have had less time to accumulate mercury will be made.  If your test comes back high in aluminum, the practitioners will ask if you regularly consume tap water or use antiperspirants that may be contributing to your high aluminum levels.   If this is the case, alternative practical suggestions will be made.  If your test reveals low calcium then a tendency exists towards osteoporosis, bone fractures, dental cavities, muscle cramps, etc.  If your test reveals an elevated calcium level, a strong tendency exists for arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries due to calcium plaques).  Recommendations will be made for balancing calcium levels to normal based on the rest of the test results.
Individual mineral levels and heavy metal toxicities need to be viewed in the context of the entire hair test before specific recommendations will be made as the body works as a system rather than in individual parts.  The hair mineral analysis allows a qualified practitioner to see the entire picture of what is going on with your health.  The medical science behind the hair analysis test  enables practitioners to make life changing recommendations to balance your body.








Objectives of our campaign:
1. To promote awareness of hair mineral analysis, the sensible and scientific method of analyzing your health.  
Our team has been using this evidence based method of health assessment for over thirty years.  It is time to bring this scientific process mainstream.
What if you spent the next twenty years trying to find out what is wrong with you only to discover that the well water you drank as a child contained lead?
Imagine the lead stored in your body causing you to have symptoms such as:  abnormal brain function, insomnia, depression, chronic constipation, diabetes, cancer, hypothyroidism.   Now imagine receiving all types of medication to combat your problems and not ever dealing with the root cause of the issue, which is the lead poisoning.  
You want to be armed with all of the information you can possibly have to improve your health.  A simple hair test will provide you with very different information than a blood or urine test. 
The first step to get out of the downward spiral is to see if there are any obvious imbalances in your body chemistry which will be shown on your hair analysis test results.  We will review your test results with you and make recommendations to bring your body back into balance so it can begin to heal itself.
Test Your Hair offers a healing protocol that will change your understanding regarding product and food choices, eating habits, drinking water, exercise, rest, weight balancing, and overall lifestyle.  
2.  Never before have we been exposed to such high levels of stress and chemicals in our foods and environment.  We need to give Dr Lawrence Wilson the opportunity to update the out of print book Energy with current information so people are given the tools on how to increase energy and regain vitality.  (The book Energy is based on an interview with Dr Paul Eck, the pioneer of hair analysis.)  
Many people today are burned out, stressed, more easily irritated, and fatigued, leading to deteriorating health.  Dr Lawrence Wilson has spent the last thirty years fine tuning the process of using hair analysis to pinpoint stress patterns and toxicities that cause fatigue and burnout.  We are working with Dr Wilson on Energy II, an easy-to-read guide that will help you increase your vitality and maintain your energy levels.  A must read for anyone struggling with low energy and looking for answers.

<p>Hobson (affectionate nickname) was first diagnosed with breast cancer about four years ago. She had a double mastectomy then underwent several harsh chemo and radiation treatments. The chemo was so intense that she would be sick in bed for days. There were blisters all inside her mouth and down her throat. She had trouble walking because her feet and hands were so blistered and raw. It was a very rough year but the results were good and we thought we beat it. We had a christmas celebration with all our closest friends and family and thought everything was great. We were starting over. Then she started to get pain in her back. </p>
<p>When the doctors checked, our worst nightmare came true that the cancer metastasized. It had spread into her lungs, ribs, spine, some muscles in her back and more recently into her adrenal glands. Hobson once again underwent several painful radiation treatments and milder chemo treatments. In conjunction with these treatments she has also been taking lots of vitamins and minerals, juicing vegetables with fruits, eating mostly vegan and only organic. She has also been undergoing various other treatments. She starts with a vitamin C treatment twice a week for ($150.00 each time). Additionally she gets localized hyperthermia ($400.00 each time) twice a week and full body hyperthermia ($1000.00 each time) once a month. Hyperthermia is a type of cancer treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures (up to 113°F) to damage and kill cancer cells. She also receives a Xgeva shot once a month. It is a bone strengthening treatment to help where the cancer has eaten through her ribs and spine. These treatments help to boost Hobson’s immune system; by opening the body’s vessels to assist the chemotherapy so it can penetrate deeper into the cancerous tissues and destroy them. And on top of all this she also has chemotherapy every second thursday. Furthermore Hobson has several pain medications that are also very expensive. We wanted to host this fundraiser to help pay for these treatments. </p>
<p>There is a clinic in Tijuana that creates something called the dendritic cell vaccine. They will take her blood cells and cancer cells to create a vaccine specifically catered for destroying the cancer that is in Hobson’s body. The fundraiser is mainly for this dendritic cell vaccine. Unfortunately it’s not offered in Canada yet. The dendritic cell vaccine is currently only being researched in Canada and the United States. With your help Hobson will be able to get to the hospital in Santa Barbara, California. Once there, she will be driven across the border to Tijuana to start gathering her T cells and cancer cells to create the dendritic cell vaccine. She will be going back and forth because we plan to continue doing all of her other treatments as well. </p>

<h3>I was always told by dentists that I 'need' braces because of a few crooked teeth.  I never took 
them seriously.  They just want to make a bunch of money off me, right?  How important is it to have pretty teeth, 
really?  So, obviously I never bothered, until now.  I was recently 
shown an x-ray of my TMJ joint (where the bottom jaw meets the top jaw).  I saw that about 30% of the 
bone (that used to make the joint) is just gone!  No one had ever 
mentioned that my crowded teeth could cause damage to my jaw!</h3>
<br/><p>It was explained that the uneven crowding of my teeth was putting extra pressure on one side of my jaw, causing the bones to grind together when ever I move my jaw.   I will never be able to repair the existing damage, but braces can relieve the pressure and stop more damage from happening.  I opted to get the cheapest, most uncomfortable braces available, but the bill will still be over $6,000 in total.</p>
<p>I don't expect anyone would be into paying for my braces and appliances (I don't really know what these are, and they sound painful.  The dentist says that they are needed to make the braces work properly).  I am hoping that I can find a lot of people who are willing to put a couple dollars to help.  Maybe find someone that is willing to pay for me to be in pain for a couple years?  (I won't be offended if that is your reason for donating)<br/></p>
<p>Obviously loosing some of the bone in my jaw can cause issues any time the jaw is used.  Until my treatment is completed, this will also continue to cause more damage.  Unfortunately, I live in an area where most employers are call centers.  Basically, I talk for a living and this means I make the damage worst, just by going to work.  If I don't stop the damage, I will eventually be unable to work (talk) or chew.   </p>
<p>I don't have the best job, it pays a bit above minimum wage, and has no health/dental benefits.  I am willing to cut out every unnecessary expense to pay for as much of the braces as possible, but I don't think I can do it alone.  Every dollar helps get me closer to paying for the braces.  <br/></p>
<p>Some day I hope to start a family and I want to be able to speak to my child/children (maybe grandchildren someday) and enjoy a normal meal with them and not be in pain or have a jaw that gets locked open.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone that can give (even if it is just a dollar) or can spread the word to others.  I understand if you don't have extra money to help me, but helping me find others to help is just as important!  A moment of your time and energy can be worth the world to me. Thank you all!<br/></p>

It was explained that the uneven crowding of my teeth was putting extra pressure on one side of my jaw, causing the bones to grind together when ever I move my jaw.   I will never be able to repair the existing damage, but braces can relieve the pressure and stop more damage from happening.  I opted to get the cheapest, most uncomfortable braces available, but the bill will still be over $6,000 in total.
I don't expect anyone would be into paying for my braces and appliances (I don't really know what these are, and they sound painful.  The dentist says that they are needed to make the braces work properly).  I am hoping that I can find a lot of people who are willing to put a couple dollars to help.  Maybe find someone that is willing to pay for me to be in pain for a couple years?  (I won't be offended if that is your reason for donating)
Obviously loosing some of the bone in my jaw can cause issues any time the jaw is used.  Until my treatment is completed, this will also continue to cause more damage.  Unfortunately, I live in an area where most employers are call centers.  Basically, I talk for a living and this means I make the damage worst, just by going to work.  If I don't stop the damage, I will eventually be unable to work (talk) or chew.   
I don't have the best job, it pays a bit above minimum wage, and has no health/dental benefits.  I am willing to cut out every unnecessary expense to pay for as much of the braces as possible, but I don't think I can do it alone.  Every dollar helps get me closer to paying for the braces.  
Some day I hope to start a family and I want to be able to speak to my child/children (maybe grandchildren someday) and enjoy a normal meal with them and not be in pain or have a jaw that gets locked open.  

I would like to thank everyone that can give (even if it is just a dollar) or can spread the word to others.  I understand if you don't have extra money to help me, but helping me find others to help is just as important!  A moment of your time and energy can be worth the world to me. Thank you all!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<span>As
a small child I had a will to fight so deep that no one could understand, a
drive so strong that it scared others. Over my life I have been taught many
things and one of them was to never give up one was also that your life is
private. I was someone who thought as being a healthy good person this was not
something that would affect me. I had a tumor develop and being unsure what it
was had it looked into, 3 times I was confirmed it was not cancer so we
scheduled surgery to take it out. It was that day June 20th my life would
change forever. After a ruff week after surgery I went in for my appointment,
for a few weeks I was told what it could be and given more fear and not
answered questions than comfort. Still in my head there was no way... I had
been told 3 times it wasn't, this has to be a weird fluke. Until that day I
walked in for my appointment for the news i thought would be a negative was the
day my walls crumbled around me. I held it together like the brick house I am,
until I got in my car and wept. I’m 24, I’m healthy how could this happen?
Through the next few weeks’ things progressed and appointments gathered. Exhausted
and worn out I didn't know who to talk to, who could I tell? Who could I let
know this. My fears of people’s reactions, being treated different, peoples
concern. I quickly realized through the guidance of support this is not
something you can do on your own. Although we may not want to ask for help we
sometimes must. I broke, I sat down and thought and thought and consulted
others. I came to the realization that this is nothing to hide. I am going to
be ok, my job here on this earth is to share, to educate and to help others.
The truth is I need help and support from those around me and that it is in
every aspect. Although every day is different during this process I want my
journey to be the magic in someone else’s and the strength for them to get
through it. I am forever grateful for the support I have received and continue
to receive to those around me. The ones I know and the strangers I can only
hope to know.<br/></span>

southern girl living a really nice Arizona life. I grew up dancing and wearing
tights and toe shoes and not once did I ever think it would take almost dying
to lead me to handcrafting natural body care products. But, in 2006 I got
extremely ill with a near fatal case of Valley Fever.  After about 18
months in and out of the hospital, I was discharged and when I got home I had
to take 17 different medications every day.  Those medications were so
strong they killed everything in my body, the good stuff and the Valley Fever.

southern girl living a really nice Arizona life. I grew up dancing and wearing
tights and toe shoes and not once did I ever think it would take almost dying
to lead me to handcrafting natural body care products. But, in 2006 I got
extremely ill with a near fatal case of Valley Fever.  After about 18
months in and out of the hospital, I was discharged and when I got home I had
to take 17 different medications every day.  Those medications were so
strong they killed everything in my body, the good stuff and the Valley Fever.
I survived the brain legions and the fungus in my lungs but I was left with
horribly damaged skin.                       Have you ever had sunburn so bad
that your skin blistered, cracked and peeled?  Have you ever gotten poison
ivy and with the itchy little blisters?  Imagine a combination of both of
those! Medication didn't heal my skin and I wound up with dry, scaly skin that
often bled when I scratched. I didn't even get relief with the 2 ounce, $50+
lotions and creams that were recommended for me to use. I realized I would have
to find my own solution and I learned to make body care products.                                                               Learning to make lotion let loose my
“mad scientist” alter ego! I learned about the properties and benefits of
natural ingredients, like oils and butters and I formulated my first lotion.
When I used my natural ingredient based lotion, there was a HUGE difference
with my skin. My skin that had flaked like dandruff and often bled, soon healed
and there were very few indications there was ever any damage.  After a
while no one could tell that I had been so sick or that my skin had been so
badly damaged.  My family and friends noticed the changes in my healed
skin and they began to actually pay for what I made.What began as a need to heal my
damaged skin became a vision that has now transformed into SweetSavours
Natural Body Care Apothecary. SweetSavours' products are currently
available at www.etsy.com/shop/sweetsavours. 
With so many people taking the time
and paying attention to what we put into our bodies to keep us healthy,
shouldn't we take time to also think about and use good products we put ONTO our
bodies? YES! We should!  Just like we take vitamins to care for ourselves

   I would like to see SweetSavours become a strong small business that provides natural, cost effective body care products to people. A
product that is made with a skin care need in mind.

With such a severe illness, there
have been a few remaining effects.  Because of those I am currently living on disability.  Making
lotion not only healed my skin, it helped me realize that I can live beyond
the disability and make body care products for others that may help with their skin care concerns as well. I love what I do and there
are people who love my products who continually ask for more.  
SweetSavours’ goal is to receive $7,350 however; there is no limit on what SweetSavours can
accept! Thank's Indiegogo!  Contributions received above the
goal we've set will be used to move SweetSavours Natural Body Care
Apothecary forward into 2015. SweetSavours will continue to grow and
become a strong, small business handcrafting natural body care products and
making them available, nationally and worldwide. As SweetSavours becomes
more rooted, it will take its place in both the local and online business
communities. SweetSavours will become a small, but
important part of the City of Chandler, the State of Arizona and the great
country of the United States economics. Not only will SweetSavours make
products people can use and benefit from, it will also be the catalyst that
helps me live beyond the label of “disabled.”  
There is more than enough
room forSweetSavours Natural
Body Care Apothecary as this small business will bring it's fresh & unique approach of
""Outside-In"" care to the body care market.               I am very partial to the
“FootSavours – Foot Balm” for a quick save when my feet are chapped or rough
and I know I’m going to be snagging my hosiery if I don’t give them some
serious attention! Applying a little of this Foot Balm works better than ten times
the amount of any of the standard lotions I've tried! - V.S. 



I love my Sweet Savours products
because of the light fragrance and creamy moisture. I cannot wear perfume
because of allergies. When I use my Luxury body lotion from Sweet Savours I
smell nice and I can breathe. LOL. Also I live in the Phoenix area of Arizona.
It is dry here and so is my skin. My Sweet Savours body lotion keeps my skin
nourished, soft and unflaky or cracked. - K.E.

I have to say I love my “A
Time To Dance – Silken Body Oil.” It has a long lasting, wonderful fragrance
and absorbs into my skin quickly leaving it silky soft with no lingering oil to
get on my clothing.  - V.S.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You want to know what’s in your food before you buy it, before you order it, and before you eat it - because your health depends on what you eat. </span></p>
<p>Many foods contain chemicals and allergens that we want to avoid. But it can be difficult to know whether these chemicals and allergens are in your food or not. How can you tell if your food contains the nutrients you need? What about things like sodium, gluten or trans fats that you might be trying to avoid? Food labels can give us some information if they're available, but they are not always intelligible and some ingredients may not even be reported. </p>
<p>We have invented a system called TellSpec combining a spectrometer and a unique algorithm to tell you the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in your food.</p>

<h3>What is TellSpec?</h3>
<p>TellSpec is a three-part system which includes: (1) a spectrometer scanner (2) an algorithm that exists in the cloud; and (3) an easy-to-understand interface on your smart phone. Just aim the scanner at the food and press the button until it beeps. You can scan directly or through plastic or glass. TellSpec <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">analyzes the findings using the algorithm and sends a report to your phone telling </span>you the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in the food. TellSpec is a fast, simple, and easy-to-use way to learn what's in your food.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We need your help to make it smaller and manufacture it as a handheld device.</span></p>

<p>The TellSpec food analysis algorithm learns from each scan. So every time you scan, you not only learn about what's in your food, you also help others learn what's in their food. That's why distributing TellSpecs globally, and into the developing world, is so important to us. As the algorithm learns from reference scans from around the world, the analysis everywhere will get better and better.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to make this amazing system available to everyone, everywhere; and to encourage others to use our tools to make great things for the good of human health.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The handheld scanner is a Raman spectrometer. The low-powered laser inside the scanner emits coherent light through the front window. Stimulated light from the sample is then collected through a filter in the window that removes the Rayleigh scattered light. The light then passes through a diffraction grating that disperses the light onto a CCD detector. The CCD detector converts the light into an electrical signal that is then digitized and sent to the smart phone over Bluetooth.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The smart phone receives the digital spectrum of the food and transmits it to the TellSpec analysis engine which processes it, compares it to reference spectra, and runs a learning algorithm on it. The output is interpreted through a large database, and information about the food is selected and customized for the user. The smart phone then downloads the information and displays it to the user.      </p>
<p>Our designs for the scanner and the user interface are guided by the principle that interested people should be able to use the TellSpec system easily and immediately, without training and without reading a user manual; and they should be able to understand and use the displayed information without an extensive knowledge of food chemistry. </p>

NASDAQ TAKES NOTICE of TELLSPEC!

Many thanks to Remy Blair for her independent review of TellSpec for AoI.



Beam up the facts about what’s in 
your food

You want to know what’s in your food before you buy it, before you order it, and before you eat it - because your health depends on what you eat. 
Many foods contain chemicals and allergens that we want to avoid. But it can be difficult to know whether these chemicals and allergens are in your food or not. How can you tell if your food contains the nutrients you need? What about things like sodium, gluten or trans fats that you might be trying to avoid? Food labels can give us some information if they're available, but they are not always intelligible and some ingredients may not even be reported. 
We have invented a system called TellSpec combining a spectrometer and a unique algorithm to tell you the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in your food.





What is TellSpec?
TellSpec is a three-part system which includes: (1) a spectrometer scanner (2) an algorithm that exists in the cloud; and (3) an easy-to-understand interface on your smart phone. Just aim the scanner at the food and press the button until it beeps. You can scan directly or through plastic or glass. TellSpec analyzes the findings using the algorithm and sends a report to your phone telling you the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in the food. TellSpec is a fast, simple, and easy-to-use way to learn what's in your food.  We need your help to make it smaller and manufacture it as a handheld device.




What will TellSpec do?

TellSpec will identify allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in foods or beverages.

TellSpec will warn you when a food contains allergens such as gluten or egg.


 
TellSpec will track your daily calories and help you achieve your daily targets.



TellSpec will tell you about inaccurately reported ingredients like trans fats and give you the background story on mysterious ingredients like tartrazine. TellSpec goes beyond the label! 



TellSpec will track what you eat, and based on your reports of how you feel, it will help identify your food sensitivities.



TellSpec will help you monitor your intake of toxic chemicals such as mercury, so that you will stay within recommended limits.


TellSpec will track your intake of essential vitamins and minerals, and help you ensure that you are getting the right amount




How will it work?

Light is made up of particles called photons. When you beam the low-powered laser in the TellSpec scanner at the food, some of the photons are absorbed, raising the energy states of the molecules in the food. Lower energy photons are then reflected back. The spectrometer inside the TellSpec scanner sorts these photons by wavelength and counts them. The resulting numbers, called a spectrum, describe the chemical compounds in the food.

This spectrum is uploaded to our analysis engine where it is analyzed and correlated with other reference spectra. Information about the allergens, chemicals, nutrients, calories, and ingredients in the food is then downloaded to you and displayed on your smart phone.



TellSpec responds to your specific food requirements and preferences. TellSpec is a smart system that learns as you use it, so that you see the information that is of most interest to you.


An SDK for developers and researchersWe believe that the community can develop applications of TellSpec that go beyond our dreams. So we are also developing a software development kit (SDK) that will provide developers with tools for directly accessing the food analysis data from our servers so that they can create their own amazing applications. The SDK includes source code for iPhone and Android apps, an API for TellSpec's analysis engine, JSON specifications for data interchange, and access to information about each nutrient, chemical, allergen, and ingredient.

<p><i>Pictured above is Kerry with actor, singer, dancer and writer John Barrowman, who visited her in hospital.</i></p>
<h2><b>Kerry Robertson</b></h2>
<h4><b>Kerry, 19, has been diagnosed with oral cancer, and her life has changed forever.</b></h4>
<p>Kerry Robertson, throughout her life, has taken a great interest in helping and caring for people around her. She has a huge involvement in looking after her grandmother and helping her mother look after her younger siblings. Her bubbly personality and great sense of humour has made her very popular, and her future ambitions revolved around helping and caring for people.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Kerry had complained of a mouth ulcer to her dentist, which had been bothering her for a few weeks. The dentist, after examining the ulcer, suggested Kerry visit her doctor, which she did at the first opportunity. The doctor, to Kerry's frustration, sent her back to the dentist, who had told her they could not do anything to help alleviate her pain and discomfort in her case. This carried on for a number of weeks and Kerry's concerns increased until she could visit the dental hospital, which referred her to Glasgow's Southern General Hospital which, ultimately, diagnosed her with oral cancer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kerry was at a stage where the cancer had spread, and she underwent operations to remove the most afflicted areas. Kerry lost her tongue, sections of her mouth and parts of her voice box. She is awaiting the commencement of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and there are plans to rebuild her tongue using muscle tissue from her leg, but Kerry is coming to terms with the fact she will be on a liquid diet for the rest of her life, and her voice, a key part of her positive and bubbly personality, will never be the same again.</p>
<p>Kerry, since October 2011, has been a part of the McDonald's restaurant based on Renfrew Road, Paisley, where she is a hard-working and highly-respected member of staff. She also recently attended college where she took a course in working with children with special needs. She was due to start further education in James Watt College after the summer, but, due to her circumstances, can no longer carry out her studies.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for reading this appeal for Kerry, and if you can donate in any way, please do so as generously as you can, anything is appreciated.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On May 8, 2012 Kyle Carpenter was dirt-bike riding at the Comp Edge MX Track. While riding about a ninety foot jump, he overcharged it, and when spotting nearby people, winded up ditching the dirt bike. Unfortunately, this caused a tragic, terrible accident.</p>
<p>Soon after the loss of feeling in his legs and immense pain in his arm, Kyle was airlifted to the Arrowhead hospital. It was confirmed that the accident caused a broken arm and a broken spine. Some of the bones were completely shattered, leaving the surgeon to remove part of Kyle's hipbones to help repair his back when finally undergoing surgery. Kyle's wrist, on the other hand, now contains plates, pins, and screws that will be removed in about six weeks. All in all, the results from the surgery were, thankfully, good.</p>
<p>A few days after the surgery, Kyle was transferred to another hospital. Although he is already on his way to a road of recovery, there are hospital bills and rehabilitation bills that cannot go unpaid.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p><strong>A friend of Leah’s who wants to remain anonymous has offered a challenge to all of Leah’s friends and supporters. For every dollar you donate, they will match it dollar for dollar till we reach our goal of $3000, so tell your friends about Leah’s love and how her light  shines for all of us and ask them to help, knowing there’s another friend ready to match their donation.</strong></p>
<p>                   </p>
<p>  This Is Leah Elizabeth Rivera.  She is eleven months old and such a good baby.She is ALWAYS smiling; it is rare that anyone will see her cry.  Unfortunately, Leah was diagnosed with retinoblastoma on May 31st of this year.  Retinoblastoma is a rare, cancerous tumor of a part of the eye called the retina.  It is so rare that four out of a million kids are diagnosed with this cancer a year.  On June 14th Leah had to undergo surgery and have her eye removed, hopefully that’s the worst that Leah will have to go through.  We will shortly find out if the cancer has spread and if it’s genetic.   We are praying that Leah does not have to go through chemo and that it’s not genetic.  Leah’s parents, Kelly and Anthony are both hard working, young, loving parents.  Leah is their first and only child.  Kelly had to take a leave of absence in order to give her full attention to Leah.  Although Leah has insurance, Kelly and Anthony have to pay co-pays and deductibles.  We are asking you to donate a small portion so they are able to pay Leah’s bills.  They would be so incredibly thankful.  If you are not able to donate, a prayer would help and would be appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

<p>This product design project combines mechanical engineering, evolutionary biology, and modern material capabilities.</p>
<p>We have designed the Shearwater to be 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a practical application of ‘biomimicry' (copying nature's engineering / efficiency);</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>a uniquely compact paddle adaptable for a variety of water sports (webbed blade folds inward, and shaft breaks down for storage and transport);</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>an educational tool for science centers, camps, and parks.</li>
</ul><p>Working prototypes have been made, but with the key center or throat part in solid, CNC-machined aluminum. In order to make the Shearwater accessible and lighter, our project goal is to get enough support to have tooling made for the unique pieces, and place an initial material order for the other components.</p>
<p><em>Express yourself</em>: webs will be made of thick, strong PVC material, in a color of your choice by Alberta Tent &amp; Awning.  A backer option is for your web to be made from RECYCLED fabric, similar to this Swiss company's heavy-duty products: <a href=""http://www.freitag.ch/about/production"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.freitag.ch/about/production</a></p>
<p>Black fiberglass shafts will be standard, for a warmer feel warm on the hands.  For Canoe and SUP Shearwaters, a special top grip has been chosen.</p>
<p>When collapsed, Shearwater paddles fit in a 3"" (8cm) wide tube!  When quickly assembled, they behave in the water much like rigid recreational paddles, but with less disturbance than most.  Perfect trailing tip spiral vortexes are generated, as is a very slight blade flex and whip effect to smooth thrust, both just like with birds' feet (see Science diagram in the video).  You can see some testing photos under the Gallery tab above, and videos at this link: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/BiomimeticPaddle/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/user/BiomimeticPaddle/videos</a></p>
<p>Please note that the paddle pre-sale prices are a bit higher than we had hoped.  It is not so easy to mimic nature and custom-build!  These paddles involve a number of pieces, different North American suppliers and, while very compact, still become a relatively long package to ship to you.</p>
<p>This project is ""All or Nothing"" - if we don't meet our Goal, we can't produce and send out the paddles (your contribution will be refunded). So, please get your friends involved!</p>

<br/>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Sigi Nissimov. I have a loving husband Jack and we are the proud parents of two great kids, Kai, age 11 and Tia, age 9. I am a professional bellydancer and I own and operate Life Movement Spirit and Dance Center for children and adults in Fair Lawn NJ. </p>
<p>About a year and half ago I was diagnosed with Adrenal Cancer, an extremely rare cancer for which there is no cure. The doctors at Sloan Kettering offered me surgery and chemo as my best chance of prolonging my life but even then they weren't giving me much time, maybe a  year at best. I did what they told me to do. I went and had surgery to have the tumor removed and I went thru 6 grueling rounds of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>I really do not want to discuss my personal details of chemo but I am sure all of you can imagine the emotional distress, pain and suffering that my family and I went through during this trying time.</p>
<p>I tried to live my life normally each day while tending to my family and career. If the doctors were right I was going to try and enjoy every moment i had left.</p>
<p>Last August, during one of my routine monthly checkups, it was discovered that my cancer had returned. I asked my local oncologist what that meant  and I was told the prognosis was not good. At best I was told I had 3-6 months to live and there was nothing they could do for me.</p>
<p>We flew out to the University of Michigan where they specialize in this type of cancer. Their prognosis was not much better. They could offer another surgery and more chemo and at best gain another few months. They told me there was no cure and other than a miracle there was nothing more they can do.</p>
<p>The Angel of Death came forward into my life that day and I began feeling it next to me, walking in my shadow</p>
<p>I did not know what to think, how to understand what was being told to me. My senses became numb. I began to feel mute, blind and helplessly crippled in my own body and soul.</p>
<p>How for Gods sake could I begin to move forward and acknowledge what to do, how to feel, how to talk how to accept this fate?</p>
<p>Along the journey of life we experience and are taught many things</p>
<p>In the school of life they teach us to laugh</p>
<p>In the school of life they teach us how to be angry and how to cry</p>
<p>In the school of life they teach us to learn from others and to learn from our mistakes</p>
<p>But did Mom and Dad ever talk about death??</p>
<p>Does anyone ever teach us how to die??</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do I tell you all do this? So that you can feel me in your hearts. Cases like mine happen all the time, but we always say this can not be happening to me.</p>
<p>In the realm of angels, two came hand in hand to visit me after that dreadful day. One was the Angel of Death and the other was very special angel, a bright light of hope. I could either accept my fate or fight to change it.</p>
<p>Who says we can't change fate?? Just because Western medicine says i only have a few months left does that mean i should give up and accept it?</p>
<p>With the help of family and friends I decided not to give up but to fight..I was directed to holistic organizations, sent to Chinese herbal doctors who have had success in prolonging peoples life years past their diagnosed dates. I was directed to eat certain organic foods. People held fundraisers for me and I was able to see a therapist to help me cope mentally with all that was going on.</p>
<p>I decided to change the story of this deadly cancer into a miracle story..against all odds!!!</p>
<p>I was able to breathe again!!!. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>In order to pursue the alternative treatments I need to stop working and focus full time of my recovery. We cut as much as we could from our daily living expenses but in the end there is not enough at the end of the month to pay our bills. And that's before we factor in the cost of all the different treatments I am trying. The stress of worrying about money is taking my focus away of what should be my only job..healing myself so I can be around to watch my kids grow up. I want my kids to feel like nothing is wrong so we are trying to keep them enrolled in after school activities as best as we can but that costs money as well. Any money that will be raised will go towards one purpose and and one purpose only..It will allow me to go out and try all different kind of alternative therapies that have worked for other people. Infra red saunas, herbal medicines,  specific diets based on blood chemtisty etc etc.  I know that I am on the right path andy Im planning to do everything so I can be with my family.</div>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Any money raised will go to helping me survive longer. There are stories of people who have tried these alternative ways and have lived decades longer than what they were told. I need to buy all organic foods, I need to pay the bio chemist who is monitoring my blood levels, i need to fly to see the Chinese doctor who is advising me on what herbal medicines I should be taking. I need to buy those herbal medicines which can run up to $1000 per month. Part of the therapy is sitting in an infra red sauna twice a day for 1/2 hour at a time. On top of that I need the kids to have after school routines so that they feel life is normal and all is well. If i can eliminate the stress of worrying how to pay for my treatments than i can focus on actually getting better. The doctors say the less stress i encounter the stronger my body will be to fight this cancer.</p>
<p>I know times are tough and a lot of you have already helped me. But this is my life and I need to fight this. Im asking you whatever you can do, even a dollar or shekel will help. Can you skip that night out once? Can you watch a movie at home instead  of going to the theater? I know its a lot to ask but again this is my life I'm fighting for, not a economic or comfort plea!!</p>
<p>As to what you will get by helping me the best I can offer you today is the knowledge that you helped my kids  have their mother around as they grow up and get married. I wish I had more to give but all my resources both financially and spiritually are going to one cause and one cause only..to live!!</p>

Our Story
My name is Sigi Nissimov. I have a loving husband Jack and we are the proud parents of two great kids, Kai, age 11 and Tia, age 9. I am a professional bellydancer and I own and operate Life Movement Spirit and Dance Center for children and adults in Fair Lawn NJ. 
About a year and half ago I was diagnosed with Adrenal Cancer, an extremely rare cancer for which there is no cure. The doctors at Sloan Kettering offered me surgery and chemo as my best chance of prolonging my life but even then they weren't giving me much time, maybe a  year at best. I did what they told me to do. I went and had surgery to have the tumor removed and I went thru 6 grueling rounds of chemotherapy.
I really do not want to discuss my personal details of chemo but I am sure all of you can imagine the emotional distress, pain and suffering that my family and I went through during this trying time.
I tried to live my life normally each day while tending to my family and career. If the doctors were right I was going to try and enjoy every moment i had left.
Last August, during one of my routine monthly checkups, it was discovered that my cancer had returned. I asked my local oncologist what that meant  and I was told the prognosis was not good. At best I was told I had 3-6 months to live and there was nothing they could do for me.
We flew out to the University of Michigan where they specialize in this type of cancer. Their prognosis was not much better. They could offer another surgery and more chemo and at best gain another few months. They told me there was no cure and other than a miracle there was nothing more they can do.
The Angel of Death came forward into my life that day and I began feeling it next to me, walking in my shadow
I did not know what to think, how to understand what was being told to me. My senses became numb. I began to feel mute, blind and helplessly crippled in my own body and soul.
How for Gods sake could I begin to move forward and acknowledge what to do, how to feel, how to talk how to accept this fate?
Along the journey of life we experience and are taught many things
In the school of life they teach us to laugh
In the school of life they teach us how to be angry and how to cry
In the school of life they teach us to learn from others and to learn from our mistakes
But did Mom and Dad ever talk about death??
Does anyone ever teach us how to die??
 
Why do I tell you all do this? So that you can feel me in your hearts. Cases like mine happen all the time, but we always say this can not be happening to me.
In the realm of angels, two came hand in hand to visit me after that dreadful day. One was the Angel of Death and the other was very special angel, a bright light of hope. I could either accept my fate or fight to change it.
Who says we can't change fate?? Just because Western medicine says i only have a few months left does that mean i should give up and accept it?
With the help of family and friends I decided not to give up but to fight..I was directed to holistic organizations, sent to Chinese herbal doctors who have had success in prolonging peoples life years past their diagnosed dates. I was directed to eat certain organic foods. People held fundraisers for me and I was able to see a therapist to help me cope mentally with all that was going on.
I decided to change the story of this deadly cancer into a miracle story..against all odds!!!
I was able to breathe again!!!. 


The Impact
In order to pursue the alternative treatments I need to stop working and focus full time of my recovery. We cut as much as we could from our daily living expenses but in the end there is not enough at the end of the month to pay our bills. And that's before we factor in the cost of all the different treatments I am trying. The stress of worrying about money is taking my focus away of what should be my only job..healing myself so I can be around to watch my kids grow up. I want my kids to feel like nothing is wrong so we are trying to keep them enrolled in after school activities as best as we can but that costs money as well. Any money that will be raised will go towards one purpose and and one purpose only..It will allow me to go out and try all different kind of alternative therapies that have worked for other people. Infra red saunas, herbal medicines,  specific diets based on blood chemtisty etc etc.  I know that I am on the right path andy Im planning to do everything so I can be with my family.
 

What We Need & What You Get


Any money raised will go to helping me survive longer. There are stories of people who have tried these alternative ways and have lived decades longer than what they were told. I need to buy all organic foods, I need to pay the bio chemist who is monitoring my blood levels, i need to fly to see the Chinese doctor who is advising me on what herbal medicines I should be taking. I need to buy those herbal medicines which can run up to $1000 per month. Part of the therapy is sitting in an infra red sauna twice a day for 1/2 hour at a time. On top of that I need the kids to have after school routines so that they feel life is normal and all is well. If i can eliminate the stress of worrying how to pay for my treatments than i can focus on actually getting better. The doctors say the less stress i encounter the stronger my body will be to fight this cancer.
I know times are tough and a lot of you have already helped me. But this is my life and I need to fight this. Im asking you whatever you can do, even a dollar or shekel will help. Can you skip that night out once? Can you watch a movie at home instead  of going to the theater? I know its a lot to ask but again this is my life I'm fighting for, not a economic or comfort plea!!
As to what you will get by helping me the best I can offer you today is the knowledge that you helped my kids  have their mother around as they grow up and get married. I wish I had more to give but all my resources both financially and spiritually are going to one cause and one cause only..to live!!

are some we’ve developed to get you started:</span></p>
<p><b>1,
Easy Rock: </b></p>
<p>Place your feet as wide as your
shoulders on the step board, with a little bend on both knees, both hands
naturally hold on the rocking handle close to the center of your chest, relax
the whole body from toes to fingers, then use your legs to push your whole body
in left and right rocking cycles for a couple of minutes. This move is recommended
for an easy beginning warm-up and a cool down relaxation before the end of
exercise.</p>
<p><b>2,
Left Yaolu (a Chinese Rowing Scull):</b></p>
<p>With both hands holding onto the
handle, turn your body toward the left, place your left foot on the left front
side of the step board and right foot on the right front side of the step
board. Pull the handle back to your center chest and push the handle forward
using your whole body as if you’re rowing a Chinese Rowing Scull Oar. That is
correct. We got the boat and rowing scull movements into the office, living
room and kitchen. Now you can exercise water sport anywhere and anytime you
like. </p>
<p><b>3,
Right Yaolu (a Chinese Rowing Scull):</b></p>
<p>Opposite from the left Yaolu, with
both hands holding on to the handle, turn your whole body right, and place your
right foot on the right front side of the step board and left foot on the left
front side of the step board. Pull the handle backward to your center chest and
push the handle forward with the strength of the whole body as above. </p>
<p><b>4,
Left Frame Saw</b>:</p>
<p>With both hands hold on the handle,
turn your body halfway left, place your left foot on the left front side of the
step board and right foot on the right front side of the step board. Pull the
handle backward to your right shoulder and push the handle forward with the
strength of your whole body just like you are cutting a log with a frame saw. </p>
<p><b>5,
Right Frame Saw:</b></p>
<p>Opposite from the left frame saw,
with both hands hold on the handle, turn your body halfway right, and place
your right foot on the right front side of the step board and left foot on the
left front side of the step board. Pull the handle backward to your left
shoulder and push the handle forward with the strength of your whole body as
above.</p>
<p><b>6,
Whole body kayaking</b>: </p>
<p>Place your feet as wide as your
shoulders (or a little wider) on the step
board, bend both knees as low as you like. With both hands holding on the
rocking handle, start from your legs to push your whole body in left and right
rocking cycles, following the legs pushing through trunk, core muscles, and
shoulder sequence, hands pulling and pushing the handle bar from one side all the
way to the other side. Repeat the action to other side. The balance action
allows the muscles to either push or pull at a relative tension and active relax
cycle. The balance action allows you to work harder without feeling
much soreness in your muscle groups. </p>
<p><b>7,
Stir the Soup</b>:</p>
<p>Similar to 6, Whole body kayaking. The only
difference is an additional forward or backward movement to push hands around
the center rocking bar like stirring soup on the top of a hot pot with a
clockwise or counter-clockwise movement.</p>

<p>Fit-Rocker <sup>TM</sup> is designed
to do many of the functions and movements from activities and chores of “old
time”. The simple back-forth and left-right rocking actions harness all muscle
mobility with Mother Nature’s gravity to improve balance and whole body
strength. Fit-Rocker <sup>TM</sup> is designed to allow one single back-forth
and left-right rotate action to exercise the entire body, especially focusing
on the core muscles and shoulders and back muscle groups. And by focusing on
certain move direction and dynamics, you can customize your workout and target
specific muscle groups. It is one device that provides a whole body workout.</p>
<p><b>Easy

<p>Since it is one device that provides

<p>I had always been quite fit, maintained an active lifestyle and was
always very healthy. Over the years, with increasing work and family demands, I
no longer had time available to attend to my fitness needs. About 5 years ago I
started to experience chronic back and shoulder pain. I was running around to
doctors getting opinions and testing. Taking painkillers provided little
relief. After becoming frustrated with taking all the painkillers without any
permanent relief, I decided to take a more pro-active approach to my physical
health. I remembered my early days, when I lived in a small fishing village. We
used simple frame saws for cutting lumber, old blast furnace sharpening chisel
for stone works, and a large, heavy sculling oar to drive a “sanban” on the ocean
water. The whole body pumping, rocking motions and hard work of those early
days made me strong, fit and healthy. I began to focus on building the type of
machine that could duplicate those muscle building and strengthening movements.
After much thought and a few drawings, I bought and made up all components, and assembled
my first rocking fitness device. I started to stretch and
gently rock my body on the device every day, increasing the resistance and
range of motion as time progressed. The physical benefits from these natural
motions were truly astounding; I was a new man within a few weeks. My back and
shoulder pain were gone! Additionally, I felt my entire muscular-skeletal
system improving through this simple core strengthening exercise.</p>

<p>Be a founding partner of this awesome project to brighten up the world of kids in a Bangkok Red Light District! <strong>Make this project Your Story, too! Any size donation you make from your heart will help these kids. This first campaign will raise money for formation of the legal Thai entity and the first year of operation.<br/></strong></p>
<p>You will truly be able to say that you helped start-up the <strong>Happy Faces Bangkok Night Care and Learning Center</strong>, a safe place for the little eye witnesses who are currently totally vulnerable to the sights and sounds of the red light environment.  We will be posting occasional updates as we go through this fundraising process so you can keep your friends up to date on how “your” project is going!</p>
<p><strong>We think you’re an awesome bunch of people</strong> and we thank you for your action in helping us accomplish this, and demonstrating that there are people in this world who care about protecting kids and saying ""No"" to sex trafficking.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Vision:</h2>
<p>Rescuing kids from the sights and sounds of the sex trade. Helping them build their own vision of a future in a traffic free environment!</p>
<p>There is NOTHING inside the red light district to care for these kids<em>.</em></p>
<p>When you walk down the streets of the red light district and see what goes on, it is inconceivable that little children from the ages of around 3-10 years old are wandering around inside the bars and in the market/vendor areas, some hidden under tables when sleeping. </p>
<p>Within this “community” there is an underlying population of innocent eyewitnesses to everything that occurs in the area, and they are the children of those who drive, provide and enhance the area for the sex trafficking business. Not only is there no escape from watching and listening, but in many cases the children are required to work selling items such as roses inside the bars where  business is taking place, or sit at their mother’s  sexy lingerie display as men come by to purchase something for the girl they just bought for the night. They witness women, girls and boys being fondled by strangers, moms getting naked, women getting slapped and beaten, and thousands of men a year coming here to do it. Sometimes, they see their own authorities (police, offcials, etc.) participating in these activates as both sellers and buyers.</p>
<p>In a society where “nice” Thai women do not enter these areas, there is an additional stigma attached to the children of those who support the sex industry here, especially girls. They are victims of their circumstances and have no choice but to be steeped in the midst of it. We want to change that.</p>
<p>That is why <strong>Happy Faces Bangkok Night Care and Learning Center </strong>will be located in the middle of the red light district, creating an environment where more healthy physical and psychological development can take place.  Good food, a place to learn (including English), study, do homework, and sleep.

      IT WILL BE ENGLISH LESSONS, ACADEMICS AND FRIENDS.

Make Happy Faces Bangkok Your Story:
Be a founding partner of this awesome project to brighten up the world of kids in a Bangkok Red Light District! Make this project Your Story, too! Any size donation you make from your heart will help these kids. This first campaign will raise money for formation of the legal Thai entity and the first year of operation.
You will truly be able to say that you helped start-up the Happy Faces Bangkok Night Care and Learning Center, a safe place for the little eye witnesses who are currently totally vulnerable to the sights and sounds of the red light environment.  We will be posting occasional updates as we go through this fundraising process so you can keep your friends up to date on how “your” project is going!
We think you’re an awesome bunch of people and we thank you for your action in helping us accomplish this, and demonstrating that there are people in this world who care about protecting kids and saying ""No"" to sex trafficking.
The Vision:
Rescuing kids from the sights and sounds of the sex trade. Helping them build their own vision of a future in a traffic free environment!
There is NOTHING inside the red light district to care for these kids.
When you walk down the streets of the red light district and see what goes on, it is inconceivable that little children from the ages of around 3-10 years old are wandering around inside the bars and in the market/vendor areas, some hidden under tables when sleeping. 
Within this “community” there is an underlying population of innocent eyewitnesses to everything that occurs in the area, and they are the children of those who drive, provide and enhance the area for the sex trafficking business. Not only is there no escape from watching and listening, but in many cases the children are required to work selling items such as roses inside the bars where  business is taking place, or sit at their mother’s  sexy lingerie display as men come by to purchase something for the girl they just bought for the night. They witness women, girls and boys being fondled by strangers, moms getting naked, women getting slapped and beaten, and thousands of men a year coming here to do it. Sometimes, they see their own authorities (police, offcials, etc.) participating in these activates as both sellers and buyers.
In a society where “nice” Thai women do not enter these areas, there is an additional stigma attached to the children of those who support the sex industry here, especially girls. They are victims of their circumstances and have no choice but to be steeped in the midst of it. We want to change that.
That is why Happy Faces Bangkok Night Care and Learning Center will be located in the middle of the red light district, creating an environment where more healthy physical and psychological development can take place.  Good food, a place to learn (including English), study, do homework, and sleep. Thai Supervising Staff.
The normal development of these children is certainly affected. The environment a child grows up in is critical in the child’s development and well-being, and these kids live in a very challenging environment on many levels.  These kids are at increased risk for sexual abuse and being taken into the sex trade as they grow older. They are positioned to become supporters of the sex industry themselves, whether by being trafficked for sex, working for supportive business, etc.
What a different picture we wish to paint!  We plan to help change the course of this upcoming generation of kids in the red light district of Patpong. We plan to bring Love and Hope in big measure!
In addition, through regular interaction and relationship with mothers we can help those actively being trafficked to connect with appropriate NGO's that can rescue and restore them.

<h3 align=""center"">In the UK, it’s more than 120 per day, and in Australia, there’s more than 36 people diagnosed with breast cancer each and every day.</h3>
<h3 align=""center"">And something like 30% of all cancers diagnosed in women are breast cancers.</h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">~~~~~~~~</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and we Need Your Help Now please!</strong></h2>
<p align=""center"">~~~~~~~~</p>
<h3><strong>Our Mission:</strong></h3>
<p>We all know someone who has been affected by Breast Cancer, and whilst a lot of great work is being done around the world on prevention and research to find a cure, our Breast Cancer Bags Appeal is to help out those who are affected now, and until such time as we can cure this terrible disease.</p>
<p>The number of people undergoing breast cancer surgeries is staggering, and we need your help to expand our Breast Cancer Bags Appeal and help brighten the day of a Mother, Sister, Aunt or friend who’s in need of a little pick-me-up.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Appeal:</strong></h3>
<p>My Mum and I have an Australian-based online business designing and selling patterns for quilts and bags, and a couple of years ago one of our Bag Club members contacted me, looking for a pattern for a suitable bag for breast cancer surgery patients.</p>
<p>Mastectomy or breast cancer surgery usually requires one or more drains, which empty into a 500ml/pint size bottle or pouch that the patient has to carry around with them.  Usually they are sent home with these drains and bottles in place, and they can remain there for a matter of weeks or even a month or so.</p>
<p>Until that point, I had no idea that such a thing was required, and assumed that if anything like that was needed, that the hospital would just supply it anyway. </p>
<p>Imagine my horror, when I found out that in this day and age, often these women are sent home with their bottles in a pillowcase, or worse – a plastic disposable shopping bag.  If it’s not bad enough to suffer the trauma of breast surgery, the indignity of then having to carry around your surgical ‘bits and pieces’ must be truly awful.</p>
<p align=""center"">-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><em>“</em><em>Dear Bag Makers,</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to thank you for doing this, I was one of those ladies that brought home a pillow case with my drains. I was so self-conscious of it ,I didn't go out until they were taken out and as I am only 38 !! it does nothing to help the process along to try to recover. So once again THANKYOU to you and everybody that will do this. You make me feel like people care .</em></p>
<p><em>                                       Kind Regards,  Perry”</em></p>

<p>“<em>Jody &amp; Annette, I was interested to receive this email from you in regard to helping BC patients with a bag to accommodate their drain bags.  I, myself are familiar with this predicament, as I have had a double mastectomy only 4 years ago.  It’s a great idea and I had a super friend who made something similar for me, which later I used as a peg bag, but at the time it was priceless.  I want to thank you on behalf of all the ladies you are trying to help.</em></p>
<p><em>                                      Regards,  Charmane.”</em></p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, wonderful sewing volunteers around the world have made our one-size-fits-all bags, and donated them to their local hospitals, for their breast cancer surgery patients. </p>
<p>We are not a registered charity - we are just regular people who were inspired by a need, and decided to try and do our bit to make a difference.</p>
<p>We have sent out in excess of 2200 bags ourselves in Australia, through donations sent to us directly. This is still an ongoing commitment, but we would love to expand it now so that even more patients can benefit from this small, but meaningful assistance.</p>

<p><em>“Hi Jody, </em></p>
<p><em>I simply want to take the opportunity to thank you (and those involved) for your generosity in providing our service with the collection of lovely drainage bag bottles I received in the mail today.</em></p>

<p align=""center""><em>---------------------------------------------------------</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Goal:</strong></h3>
<p>Our dream is that no-one will have to go home with a hospital pillowcase or plastic bag for their drains following breast cancer surgery.  We would love to expand our Appeal, so that local Community , High School and Sewing Groups could look after the bag needs of their local hospitals, around the world.</p>
<p>As a 2-person team now, we can only reach so far, and in order to achieve our goal, we need to set up a bigger awareness and marketing campaign, with a website and info packs that can be sent out.</p>
<p>With the money raised through this Indiegogo Appeal, we will set up a website where individuals and groups can register their offer to make bags, and where hospitals can register their needs for bags.  We will have downloadable information packs available with the bag pattern, so that with your help, we can start the ball rolling on getting more bags to more needy people.</p>
<p>A basic website to do this will be around $5000, and the remainder of funds raised will go towards production and distribution of the info packs.  This is still really just Phase 1 – this will be enough to get our expansion started properly, but any additional funds will make a huge difference to the interactive side and scope of the website, and just how far we can set up this program around the world.</p>
<p>Already, we have had support from as far afield as Hawaii, Texas and Costa Rica, and we know of a few groups internationally that have embraced this appeal and are now supporting their local hospitals’ needs.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p>We would really appreciate your support.  Please donate what you can – even a dollar will help us show some love and support to a breast cancer surgery patient.</p>
<p>Please spread the Word about our campaign to your friends – the more people that hear about this through Facebook, Twitter, Blogs or Forums the better, as this campaign is also about awareness and we are truly grateful for your support.</p>

If you don't understand the magnitude of ""peak oil"" and the impact it is now having on the global economy, please watch this YouTube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=_qeRaBaPRmk. 

Did you asked for cheaper alternatives to oil and gas? The H2-Flex is a self-contain hydrogen generator and low-cost fuel-cell that converts water, under any condition, into very clean and pure hydrogen gas on-demand for every type of vehicle on the road (including EV).
 
The 20-inch H2-Flex produces pure hydrogen at the rate of 60 PSI, which is added to the normal fuel line and fuel mixture. This greatly improves overall combustion quality by allowing higher octane, a faster burn, and very clean burn. You will greatly reduce, or completely eliminate, the amount of gasoline or diesel the engine needs (see FAQ).
 
About 10 liters of hydrogen gas is stored in the filter system. This type of storage is considered the safest. Even gunshot tests on full hydrogen storage alloy do not result in any combustible reaction, which clearly demonstrates the safety level of the product. Unlike the high-pressure hydrogen cylinders, hydrogen is bonded with the alloy metal chemically. So it will take hours before the system fully release the gas in event of leakage caused by system’s damage.
 
No electricity is required! H2-Flex MAKES PURE H2 at much higher rates than electrolysis with NO OXYGEN generated.  That means NO need for O2 extenders needed, and no need for EFIE fuel injection system modifications to your car. It works on a simple and very inexpensive chemical reaction using aluminum and water! 
 
This is the ideal situation for your car as there is no questioning if you have enough output or if you could benefit from additional ‘fine tuning’ such as adding O2 extenders to your oxygen sensors or adding an EFIE (Electronic Fuel Injection Enhancer). Chemical Mode allows you to immediately find out how much gains are possible in your specific vehicle with hydrogen.
 
Connecting the H2-Flex to any vehicle is a relatively simple 3-step, 10-Minute process:

1) Place the H2-Flex in the trunk (or back) of a vehicle;
2) Join the hose to the fuel line, which is under the back seat of most vehicles;
3) Add water to the container.
 
User would then be able to go between 100 to 150 miles to the gallon of gas. This is considerably more MPG than most hybrid vehicle on the market!
 
The Impact
Our mission is to raise funding for tooling and production of the H2-Flex, secure a strong management team, and provide clean, portable, and inexpensive gas to everyone QUICKLY! If there is no H2-Flex, expect to park your vehicle (and the economy) in 2012! Don't expect Governments to solve the current energy crisis, the ultra-powerful oil industry will not allow any changes until every drop of oil is out of the ground!
 
What We Need & What You will Get
The H2-Flex was designed and engineered by a team of specialists from California, China, and India, using powerful Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. $55,000 is now needed for tooling of the H2-Flex for prototype production, which will be completed in 30 ~ 45 days. Your contribution of US$500 will serve as special ""pre-order"" price and lower contribution will be ""down-payment"". Please note that this is on a first come, first serve basis.
 
The production process will be outsourced to a well-established manufacturer. This way, we can get the H2-Flex out to you quickly while keeping cost low so even people in the developing world can afford it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Betzold, I go by many titles, such as husband, dad, amputee, cage fighter.  These titles make up the very core of who I am. I lost my leg when I was 6-years-old, due to someone poisoning some candy that they gave to me. I used to street fight often, but got myself on the straight and narrow in high-school by joining an MMA gym. I wanted to fight MMA, and I trained years to do it, but it wasn't that easy.  I fought battle after battle just to get the right to step in the cage because people believed I couldn't handle myself.  I was finally allowed to fight, and became the first amputee to fight in a sanctioned MMA match, and now I hold the World Fighting Federation's Flyweight Title.  </p>
<p>Along with MMA, I have actively competed in the grappling world for 10 years, and now hold a grappling record of 150 wins and 29 losses.  I have represented the U.S. Grappling Team twice, taking 2nd in the Worlds.  I now have the opportunity to represent the U.S. MMA Team.  I fought for my position on the team and took it in April of this year.  I need to raise the funds to get myself to Russia to compete in the FILA 2012 Senior World Championships, where I will not only become the first amputee to fight on the U.S. MMA Team, but also the first to bring home the gold.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $2700 to get myself to Russia to compete, and to assist with costs of finishing up my training camp.  I have been putting all of my focus into training for this competition so that I can come home with the gold. I want to, once and for all, break down all preconceived notions of what an amputee is capable of.</p>
<p>I can promise all of the donors that I will train and fight with everything I have, and that they will be an integral part to me reaching this goal.  </p>
<p>If any donors wish to make a larger contribution, I could wear company shirts or patches while I'm in Russia competing. Just get in contact with me on my Facebook, so we can work something out.  I am also open to suggestions if they have any other requests.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All of these tournaments and MMA fights I win are not just a victory for me and my family.  I am out to show people that you can always do anything you set your mind to if you want it bad enough and you work hard enough.  I currently work with different people, including our country's servicemen to help them overcome their physical and mental challenges.  I want to help the soldier who came home with a missing limb to know that he can still be just as good in combat as he was before, or the child who gets picked on for being different to own his differences and not hide from them; for everyone in between who doubts themselves to know that we are all only as capable as we allow ourselves to be. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that times are tough right now, and everyone might not be able to donate.  However, it would be extremely appreciated if you could spread the word, and share this with everyone you know.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, I am extremely grateful for any help or contributions.</p>

I need to raise $2700 to get myself to Russia to compete, and to assist with costs of finishing up my training camp.  I have been putting all of my focus into training for this competition so that I can come home with the gold. I want to, once and for all, break down all preconceived notions of what an amputee is capable of.
I can promise all of the donors that I will train and fight with everything I have, and that they will be an integral part to me reaching this goal.  
If any donors wish to make a larger contribution, I could wear company shirts or patches while I'm in Russia competing. Just get in contact with me on my Facebook, so we can work something out.  I am also open to suggestions if they have any other requests.  
 


The Impact
All of these tournaments and MMA fights I win are not just a victory for me and my family.  I am out to show people that you can always do anything you set your mind to if you want it bad enough and you work hard enough.  I currently work with different people, including our country's servicemen to help them overcome their physical and mental challenges.  I want to help the soldier who came home with a missing limb to know that he can still be just as good in combat as he was before, or the child who gets picked on for being different to own his differences and not hide from them; for everyone in between who doubts themselves to know that we are all only as capable as we allow ourselves to be. 


Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that times are tough right now, and everyone might not be able to donate.  However, it would be extremely appreciated if you could spread the word, and share this with everyone you know.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, I am extremely grateful for any help or contributions.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
John and Diana were expecting twins on October 19, 2012.  In the second week of July they took a vacation down to North Carolina to visit family.  Shortly into the stay, Diana's water broke.  She had to get an emergency c-section by doctors she'd never met and in a hospital that was unfamiliar to her.  On July 14, 2012, Isabella Grace was born at 1 pound 14 ounces and Mason John at 2 pounds and 1.8 ounces.  Since the hospital didn't have a NICU, Isabella and Mason had to be brought to another hospital 60 miles away from Diana.  Since the babies weren't fully developed by that time, they were both put on a respirator, amongst other equipment to assist their growth and development outside of their mother's womb.  John and Diana were eventually able to get a room at the Ronald McDonald House, where they have been staying since.  They have been at their babies' sides, day in and day out, wondering if the next minute will bring an advancement or a setback.  John and Diana would love to be able to bring their babies home, where they could be under close watch at the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, NY, and be closer to family, friends, their jobs and their home.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
Although they would never ask, this fund is to support John, Diana and their two blessings in getting home, which is $14,000 alone because of the massive amount of equipment and staff needed to support them in their condition during the journey, and to assist with other finances that this critical situation has brought upon them.</div>

UPDATE 4/30: We hit the goal!! Yes! But please don't stop contributing and keep sharing this with your friends! $1200 was a low-end estimate for the project, and we can use every penny. All extra funds go right back into the project to get more people involved. Getting 1000 respondents will not be easy, even with 4 months.
Thank you so much! We did it! This great research will happen because of you. Give yourself a good pat on the back and a firm handshake. And a big hug. You deserve it.

My Story
I'm Ted, and I’m a hoop dancer. That means I dance and play with plastic rings for a living, and teach others. Hoop dancing (“hooping”) has enriched my life in so many ways. I hoop for art, for fun, for a creative outlet, for exercise, and for meditation. It’s also my job, and there’s nothing I’d rather be doing!
Before I started hooping I was a certified personal trainer. I helped people get in shape safely. I met lots of people who got hurt because they weren’t educated in how to move and exercise properly, in a way that supports them. I loved helping people gain a better understanding and love of their bodies.As a hoop dance instructor, I meet lots of people getting hurt all around me too. So many hoopers I've met have had pain or injuries, but don't talk about them, or hope they'll magically go away. The truth is that they don’t just go away, and most of them are preventable.
What’s the solution? 
In order to keep ourselves safe so we can hoop for many more years, we need to understand our injuries more deeply. What injuries are most common? Why are they happening? When are they happening? Who are they happening to? Only when we fully understand the problem can we create positive, lasting solutions.I am conducting the first large scale, independent study on hooping injuries. The aim of the research is to explore pain and injuries in hoopers, and provide a better understanding of its causes, symptoms, and treatments.
Why should you care? 
  If you’re a hooper, this is important work. Everything we know about hooping injuries has so far been anecdotal:   “My friend said you don’t need to hoop in both directions”   “My teacher thinks stretching is a waste of time”   “I heard Arnica gel and Reiki are the solutions to Hooper’s Hip”How do we know what to trust? Conflicting opinions are everywhere. Right now it’s one person’s opinion vs. another’s. We don’t have to be in the dark any more. Let’s get closer to the truth!   If you love a hooper, are friends with a hooper, or have ever seen a hooper and want to support this fast growing art form, your contribution can make a real impact.    For a casual hoop dancer - or any dancer, injuries can be painful and demoralizing. For professional hoopers, who depend on their good health to put food on the table, it can be financially devastating. Many hoopers have given up the promise of a stable income to chase their dreams as an artist. Being unable to dance for weeks at a time is simply not an option. Let’s help each other dance forever!
What We Need & What You Get
Our financial goal is $1200. More would be great, but not as critical. This covers: 

$300: hosting a professional online survey so we can collect and analyze the data effectively
$600: advertising on Hooping.org to reach the maximum number of hoopers around the world
$100: cash prize randomly awarded to a survey respondent to increase participation, commitment, and awareness of the survey
$200: administrative costs: website fees, fundraising fees, fulfilling fundraiser perks, etc
Here’s the great perks: 


$1: A huge thank you and a digital hoop hug

$5: A huge thank you and a digital hoop hug, thank you card, and mention in the newsletter and Facebook group
$10: An email PDF guide: Top 5 Tips for a Perfect Hoop Warmup, and a fancy HIPS pin-back button

$25: Tote bag from Cécile Pompompom of Bristol UK (free shipping to UK/europe, $5 extra shipping to US or Canada)


$25: Your choice of 1 of 4 Hoopnotica instructional hoop DVDs from Tilly Whirls  - SOLD OUT


$50: $30: 1 hour hoop health consultation on Skype
$50: hoop hugger from RainedanceHoops of Ottowa - SOLD OUT

$75: $50: One custom-made taped polypro hoop in your choice of size and colors, generously donated by Serenity Hoops and New Whirled Designs.  SOLD OUT


$100: $75: choice - Skype lesson with Marria & Zach of Ninja Hoops, or Skype consultation with Meagan Ruppert: Building your Business 

$325: A Weekend Pass to Hoopfest New England- SOLD OUT

$1000: $500: I will come to your town and host a hoop safety & wellness workshop for you and up to 10 friends.

If we don’t reach our entire goal, we’ll eliminate some advertising and spread the word as best we can, leveraging the power of social media and word of mouth.If we exceed our goal (fingers crossed!), we’ll invest more money into the survey prizes to increase participation and excitement, and possibly advertise on Google, Facebook, and Youtube to reach more people.
The Impact
This informal study is not for personal profit and very much a collaborative effort. I am receiving  input & testing from 2 medical doctors, physical therapist, a clinical research psychologist, 4 certified fitness trainers, a massage therapist, & 2 Pilates instructors. I will be eliciting feedback from the community (that’s YOU!) throughout the process to help guide the project. I want everyone to understand that that it’s for hoopers, by hoopers - and everyone can help in some way. Even if you just tell one friend, or donate a dollar, that's fantastic! Every bit counts.Other Ways You Can Help (and get great exposure for your business)The 3 Most Pressing Needs Right Now:

Help spread the word about this fundraising campaign! Less than 2 days to go!
Free or discounted advertising if you run a high traffic hoop site or blog - now and especially May - August when the survey is live
Other important ways you can participate:

Funny video of you faking a hoop injury. This will be cut into a video with lots of other injuries to promote the survey itself. Be silly. Really ham it up! Charlie Chaplin style. Whack yourself, trip, scream, whatever. You can do a few takes but no more than 15 seconds total.
Share your hoop injury story on video. I'd love to include it in the video I'll be posting during the fundraising drive. Under 1 minute is perfect.

Help spread the word about the survey itself when it goes live May 8 (I can remind you later)
Your help beta-testing the survey & offering feedback in April if you’re a: researcher, doctor, statistician, physical therapist, exercise physiologist, personal fitness trainer, licensed massage therapist, certified Pilates instructor, or other movement expert.
Language translation. The survey is international so we'd like to make it available in other languages. If you have an excellent command of English as well as either Spanish, French or Japanese (I believe those are the most common non-English languages among hoopers), and you can devote some time in May, please let me know.
You don't have to do all these things to help. Just contributing in 1 or 2 ways would be incredible.I will credit you in the survey, promo videos, mailings, and on Facebook for your contributions, so it's great exposure. The study will be advertised on Hoopcity & Hooping.org as well as spread across Facebook and Youtube all summer long, so tens of thousands of hoopers will see your name as a contributor or sponsor.Here are details about the study including how the data will be used & how will the money be used:https://www.facebook.com/groups/hoopstudy/doc/159971170790078/Thank you!Huge thanks to our wonderful sponsors & contributors (so far):Cécile Pompompom - Miss Pompompomhttps://www.facebook.com/MissPompompomJennifer Anderson - RaineDanceHoopshttp://www.rainedancehoops.blogspot.com/Marria & Zach - Ninja Hoopshttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ninja-Hoops/139616369469094Maria Randolph - HoopFest New Englandhttp://www.hoopfestnewengland.com/Meagan Ruppert - Return to Roots Hoop Gatheringhttp://r2rhoops.comLeslie Perales of Tilly Whirlshttp://tillywhirls.com/Leslie & Dave McKenzie of Serenity Hoops & New Whirled Designshttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Serenity-Hoops-and-New-Whirled-Designs/204957642875652Corie Wallace Designshttp://www.befreckle.comJoin the mailing list for HIPS updates:http://eepurl.com/jZX9DFind us on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/groups/hoopstudy/Email me with questions/comments/suggestions: hoopstudy@gmail.com",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Let's face it, we eat too many bacon cheeseburgers. Heart health is a leading medical issue in developed countries. However, technology development is slow to bring new ideas into the field of pump technology that can be used for cardiac assist and replacement.</p>
<p>We're exporing new pump actions with the intention of advancing health care quality for surgical patients needing cardiac assist equipment. The technology is based on ferrofluid- ferrite nanoparticles suspended in a base liquid. We're raising funds to build prototype pumps. <strong>Our prototypes won't be tested on animals.</strong> We will design, build, and test the pump in the lab. <strong>The backer perks include working pump mechanisms!</strong></p>
<p>Instead of directly appoaching venture capital or approaching medical corporations, we elected to put this project on Indiegogo to try a grass roots approach to launch the exploratory phase of this medical R&amp;D project. Please get involved by helping us spread the word about this exciting project!</p>
<h2><strong>Team</strong></h2>
<p>Our team has the background to rapidly complete the technology exploration. Team members include:</p>
<p>-Christopher Suprock, PhD<br/>-Jeffery Nichols, MS ECE<br/>-Joanna Suprock, Project Management<br/>-Biological/Anatomical advisers<br/><br/></p>
<p>Website: <a href=""http://www.suprocktech.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Suprock Technologies"">www.suprocktech.com</a></p>
<p>We are located in New Hampshire near Ferrotec Corporation and work with them to source custom ferrofluid and technical advise.<br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Current pump technology is not optimal for cardiac application because it causes mechanical damage to the blood cells (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolysis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hemolysis</a>). Centrifugal pump and rotary turbo pump designs are the norm. One example of modern pump technology is the Heartmate II, a turbo pump. These require high dosage of anticoagulant drugs to prevent clotting from occurring due to trauma in the pump unit.  Dangerous conditions may lead to post operative problems such as stroke. </p>
<p>Our goal is to investigate an improved pump technology that minimizes damage to blood tissue and can replace antiquated pump technology to improve the safety of cardiac assist- and eventually- stand alone artificial heart designs. </p>
<p><strong>We're taking a unique approach and exploring the applicability of magnetic fluid technology to mimic muscular behavior. We hope that this research will contribute to replacing the century-old pump technologies still present in modern operating rooms.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Technical Design</strong></h2>
<p>There are several technical concepts applicable to this technology. The first is to reproduce traditional chambered designs. Although this is not as suitable for transplant or surgical application, it is a nice way to prove the concept and mimic heart behavior in a test system.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Magnetic Fluid Chamber Pump"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.suprocktech.com/files/SteelHeart/SteelHeart_Chamber.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Magnetic Fluid Chamber Pump""/></strong></p>
<p>Another way is to build a linear peristaltic pump that could be used for left ventricle assist device (LVAD). This type of assist pump has a larger commercial market versus full replacement pumps.</p>

<p>Many designs are possible- due to the flexibility of the magnetic fluid pump action, designs can range from simple push-pull type to fancy revolving membrane actions.</p>

Instead of directly appoaching venture capital or approaching medical corporations, we elected to put this project on Indiegogo to try a grass roots approach to launch the exploratory phase of this medical R&D project. Please get involved by helping us spread the word about this exciting project!
Team
Our team has the background to rapidly complete the technology exploration. Team members include:
-Christopher Suprock, PhD-Jeffery Nichols, MS ECE-Joanna Suprock, Project Management-Biological/Anatomical advisers
Website: www.suprocktech.com
We are located in New Hampshire near Ferrotec Corporation and work with them to source custom ferrofluid and technical advise.
Background
Current pump technology is not optimal for cardiac application because it causes mechanical damage to the blood cells (hemolysis). Centrifugal pump and rotary turbo pump designs are the norm. One example of modern pump technology is the Heartmate II, a turbo pump. These require high dosage of anticoagulant drugs to prevent clotting from occurring due to trauma in the pump unit.  Dangerous conditions may lead to post operative problems such as stroke. 
Our goal is to investigate an improved pump technology that minimizes damage to blood tissue and can replace antiquated pump technology to improve the safety of cardiac assist- and eventually- stand alone artificial heart designs. 
We're taking a unique approach and exploring the applicability of magnetic fluid technology to mimic muscular behavior. We hope that this research will contribute to replacing the century-old pump technologies still present in modern operating rooms.
Technical Design
There are several technical concepts applicable to this technology. The first is to reproduce traditional chambered designs. Although this is not as suitable for transplant or surgical application, it is a nice way to prove the concept and mimic heart behavior in a test system.

Another way is to build a linear peristaltic pump that could be used for left ventricle assist device (LVAD). This type of assist pump has a larger commercial market versus full replacement pumps.

Many designs are possible- due to the flexibility of the magnetic fluid pump action, designs can range from simple push-pull type to fancy revolving membrane actions.

<h2>What is a Salt Cave?</h2>
<p>A Salt Cave is a chamber where the healing, microclimate of a natural salt cave is reproduced, monitored and controlled inside a room, called a salt cave, by using a special Halotherapy device and technology, called a Prizma"".</p>
<p>During a salt room session the client sits fully dressed in a comfortable chair in our spacious cave like room for 45 minutes (one session), listening to relaxation music and breathing normally. Research has shown that Himalayan salt crystals have a particular kinetic energy emitting natural occurring negative ions that are proven to reduce stress and fatigue while supporting a better sense of well being. By breathing deeply, clients inhale a very light salt infused air very similar to sea air which works on clearing the respiratory system.</p></span><p></p>

<p><span class=""s1""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""s1""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Dear friends,</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For the last three years I have been relieving the aches and pains as well as the stress and discomfort of clients of all ages and from all walks of life, and during this time I have been a part of so many heartwarming and gratifying experiences that I intend to continue our adventure and journey together by bringing you more experiences that will truly enhance your sense of well being and allow you to really enjoy the art of relaxation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">My business started out as a small sole proprietorship from a one room office in the heart of Bethesda MD on West Lane, and over the last handful of years, I have had the honor of supporting you in a lot of your bodywork endeavors and as always I remain committed to providing you with the best bodywork practices possible. This encompasses both stretching, massage, energy work or anything else that I can do to help you. I have become increasingly aware of your ever rising stress levels and your struggle with allergies wether they be from allergens around you or what you are consuming.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a bodyworker I am not immune to stress and allergies, and when I first came to America from South Africa, I too fell prey to all the effects that working too hard to build my practice could bring on me. So when I had my first salt cave experience in Asheville NC it was nothing short of life changing. Needless to say I came back to DC filled with a renewed sense of urgency to recreate this amazing experience for your benefit.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Salt caves are known all over the world for having an amazingly soothing effect on people of all ages, and are acclaimed for relieving the symptoms of things such as allergies, stress, sinusitis, barometric headaches, asthma, eczema as well as psoriasis and that is only the tip of the list. It is a chamber built entirely out of tons of Hiamalayan crystal rock salt. </span></p>

<p class=""p1"" style=""line-height: 21.75px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>Our salt cave details:</b><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""line-height: 21.75px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The room will be approximately 500 sqf in size which is large enough for small intimate groups of 15 people for meditation and yoga purposes and large enough for 20 people to sit fully clothed in the zero gravity reclining chairs which we will be using for our peace and quiet sessions. Not everyone likes music and movement some people just want to be able to breath deeply and sleep. The floors will be covered with salt granules 2-3mm in size and the walls will be built out with bricks and boulders of salt rock ranging from 1 pound to 22 pounds in size. The room will be lit with salt lamps and the ceiling will be covered with salt crystals and lighting as well. The air will be infused with a minute trace of salt which clients inhale and it is here that the healing starts. The colors in the room range from a soft pink to burnt orange, coral and deep reds and with the lighting behind the walls it all melds into a very soothing visual experience.</p>

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Some interesting facts about Himalayan crystal rock salt:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span class=""s1"">The crystal salt is formed over a period of 250 million years during which micro-organisms are compressed and fossilized into a layer of salt very deep beneath the earths crust. The result is a crystalization process which combines the salt and micro-organisms. How does this help us? The crystal salt is enriched with 84 minerals and trace elements found on the periodic table which is no longer freely available in our every day food. Salt is not on the periodic table but the nutrients in the Himalayan salt crystal are, and it is acclaimed that it is a great source of calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc and  iron. When dissolved it is alkaline to the skin, and when heated it disperses a negative ionic charge into the air which negates the harmful effects of all the electronics that we surround ourselves with. Crystal salt is a natural anti-microbial agent that is known to kill mould, spores and bacteria. it does not possess added iodide, anti caking agents or preservatives and it is known to be the purest salt on earth, while also being considered of nutritional benefit.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> </span></h2>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/977288/pictures/original/20130809055015-tibetan.jpg?1376052615"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></span></h2>
<p>So when a space very close to where I am currently situated became available, I knew that I had to take the leap of faith and take action. I have for quite some time now, wanted to start the process of expanding my business to incorporate elements of natural healing and well being by building the first ever Himalayan rock salt Cave in Bethesda MD. I have always felt that this would be the natural progression in offering new services that would continue our journey together.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I have spoken at great length with many of my clients as to what this would mean for you and how your experience would improve by adding this along with community acupuncture, salt cave yoga and meditation to the list of offerings, and you have all told me, “Build it and we will come”.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">So, here we are, I am so excited to say that a once in a life time opportunity presents itself for me. I have found a 2 200 sqf space right next to the Bethesda Metro and the Hyatt Hotel. It is on the ground floor and has the structural integrity that we will need for building a 550 sqf salt chamber. However going from a one room massage studio to a 2 200 sqf  space is going to be a whole different kettle of fish, and to complete this task I need your support. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This has been an incredibly easy but nerve racking decision for me.  I know that building the salt Cave will offer natural healing possibilities beyond our wildest imagination. The most difficult part is actually describing something so beautiful. Its almost impossible if you have not already experienced a salt cave on your own. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I have consulted with salt cave owners and their clients, all eager and willing to share their miracle stories and who have urged me to get started. With their continued support and the support of my clients and community I believe this can really happen and become a reality.</span></p>
<h3 class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><span class=""s1"">With your support I will be able to do the following:</span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Redesign the space and make structural changes to the existing building that will allow us to have enough space to fit 16-20 people inside the salt cave at a time.</span></li>
<li class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Purchase 32 tons of Himalayan rock salt to actually build the internal structure of the salt cave, add a special Halo-generator for infusing the air with Himalayan salt on a micro-ionic level to recreate the sea air, and to build a dedicated HVac system that will ensure the air inside the room remains 10x purer than outside, and also Hermetically sealing the room.</span></li>
<li class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Expand my services to offer a multitude of differing options which will include but in no way be limited to community acupuncture, salt cave yoga, meditation, aromatherapy workshops, didjeridoo evenings, Tibetan singing bowl events and vibrational energy workshops. The possibilities are endless.</span></li>
<li class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Stock our store with amazing organic and natural Himalayan rock salt products for use in your home to clean the air, flavor your food, light your childrens rooms, enhance your bathing experience and impress your friends.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The success of this project would mean so much to so many people.  Parents who have travelled as far as Asheville NC, Williamsburg VA and Carlysle PA have all asked if this was something that I think we can accomplish and I truly believe the answer is ""Yes, together we can""</span></p>

<p>Salt rocks are fantatstic for cleaning the air of impurities, they are soothing on the eyes, great as night lights and really promote a great nights rest. When the salt is heated it emits a negative ionic charge theat counteracts the harmful effects of electronics that surround us on a day to day basis.Choose from three different sizes starting with the small one which comes in three different styles, is usb powered and great in any kids room, on a bar or just in a little corner as an added ambience., or maybe the medium or large natural boulder shaped lights that come with a globe and dimmer switch, all ready for taking the healing experience home. Change the magnetic vibe inside your home within an instant.</p>

<p>Want a salt block to use as a cutting board for preparing veggies, your steak or presenting an amazaing sushi platter? Culinary chefs use blocks of Himalayan salt to age their steaks, present their sushi dishes or just as elegant and unusual centre pieces. we have it in three different sizes for your ease of use or maybe you would like all three. Remember that when the salt block has become smaller due to a lot of use, you can still use the salt to flavor your food by grating it or crushing it depending on how you like it.</p>
<p>Salt tiles, bricks and blocks come in various shapes and sizes. The grilling blocks we are offering is a package of two sizes together. One 8x4x1 size, ideal for preparing sushi or presenting a small cheese platter, plus a 10x6x1 ideal for grilling a steak or chicken on the barbecue. Should we reach our goal, then we would be able to offer different shapes and sizes on a roll out basis.</p>

We have it in chunks, grinder size as well as powdered salt. Remember, Himalayan Crystal Salt has 84 different minerals and elements in it that no other salt has. Ordinary Sodium Chloride is bleached and devoid of any nutritional benefit. So by using Himalayand Crystal Salt you are actually feeding your body nutrients it needs, and it is in fact a good source of calcium, potassium, magnesium and zinc.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Not interested in being paid in salt like the Roman Soldiers were, well we have some great Salt Chamber sessions or massage series that may suit you better and I am so looking forward to sharing this experience with you.</p>
<h3>What happens if we do not reach our goal:</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why we have agreed to flexible spending is that the Indiegogo site allows you our clients to pay with a credit card as well as Paypal. If we had decided on the fixed amount you would only get the opportunity to pay with paypal and I know that this would be very limiting for many of my clients.</p>
<p>I have a certain portion of the funds required to start the project and if for some reason I am not able to raise all the funds we need to start the space, we will have to build a smaller chamber. In the event that the salt cave is not built at all, we will still be in a position to meet all massage and salt product obligations and all other funds for salt cave sessions will be returned to the respective contributors. I promise full transparency to all contributors and you will always be kept up to date with where we are in every stage of the project.</p>
<h2><strong>Delays:</strong></h2>
<p>Should we be delayed for whatever reason, we will keep our clients posted and updated at all times, not only with the progress of our build out but also if things go wrong. All salt products will be available for pick up from October 1st, 2013, all massages can still be done at our current venue, and so construction and buildout delays will only affect salt cave sessions.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Research has proven that a salt cave is a safe and alternative manner in which people of all ages can alleviate stress and a general lack of energy. I believe that because of the high pollen counts within the DC metro area, that the salt cave is going to be a valuable asset to children and parents alike and it is my sincere wish that it will decrease the amount of hospital visits for everyone as a result of seasonal allergies and asthma related issues. </p>

Himalayan Crystal Rock Salt
Himalayan crystal rock salt is being pioneered by doctors such as Dr Oz as being the purest form of organic salt in the world with amazing healing capabilities. Consisting of 84 different trace elements and life force minerals it contains a bio energetic field and is considered to be a super food by nutritional experts. It is used by allergy and asthma sufferers all over the world. It is my intention to build a salt cave for our community, so that they may have the opportunity to experience these healing benefits. 
Salt Caves have been known to alleviate the symptoms of:



asthma
chronic bronchitis
cough
sinusitis
ear infection
psoriasis


rhinitis
hay fever
respiratory allergies
cystic fibrosis
tonsillitis
eczema


 
What is a Salt Cave?
A Salt Cave is a chamber where the healing, microclimate of a natural salt cave is reproduced, monitored and controlled inside a room, called a salt cave, by using a special Halotherapy device and technology, called a Prizma"".
During a salt room session the client sits fully dressed in a comfortable chair in our spacious cave like room for 45 minutes (one session), listening to relaxation music and breathing normally. Research has shown that Himalayan salt crystals have a particular kinetic energy emitting natural occurring negative ions that are proven to reduce stress and fatigue while supporting a better sense of well being. By breathing deeply, clients inhale a very light salt infused air very similar to sea air which works on clearing the respiratory system.



Dear friends,
For the last three years I have been relieving the aches and pains as well as the stress and discomfort of clients of all ages and from all walks of life, and during this time I have been a part of so many heartwarming and gratifying experiences that I intend to continue our adventure and journey together by bringing you more experiences that will truly enhance your sense of well being and allow you to really enjoy the art of relaxation.
My business started out as a small sole proprietorship from a one room office in the heart of Bethesda MD on West Lane, and over the last handful of years, I have had the honor of supporting you in a lot of your bodywork endeavors and as always I remain committed to providing you with the best bodywork practices possible. This encompasses both stretching, massage, energy work or anything else that I can do to help you. I have become increasingly aware of your ever rising stress levels and your struggle with allergies wether they be from allergens around you or what you are consuming.
As a bodyworker I am not immune to stress and allergies, and when I first came to America from South Africa, I too fell prey to all the effects that working too hard to build my practice could bring on me. So when I had my first salt cave experience in Asheville NC it was nothing short of life changing. Needless to say I came back to DC filled with a renewed sense of urgency to recreate this amazing experience for your benefit.
Salt caves are known all over the world for having an amazingly soothing effect on people of all ages, and are acclaimed for relieving the symptoms of things such as allergies, stress, sinusitis, barometric headaches, asthma, eczema as well as psoriasis and that is only the tip of the list. It is a chamber built entirely out of tons of Hiamalayan crystal rock salt. 


Our salt cave details:
The room will be approximately 500 sqf in size which is large enough for small intimate groups of 15 people for meditation and yoga purposes and large enough for 20 people to sit fully clothed in the zero gravity reclining chairs which we will be using for our peace and quiet sessions. Not everyone likes music and movement some people just want to be able to breath deeply and sleep. The floors will be covered with salt granules 2-3mm in size and the walls will be built out with bricks and boulders of salt rock ranging from 1 pound to 22 pounds in size. The room will be lit with salt lamps and the ceiling will be covered with salt crystals and lighting as well. The air will be infused with a minute trace of salt which clients inhale and it is here that the healing starts. The colors in the room range from a soft pink to burnt orange, coral and deep reds and with the lighting behind the walls it all melds into a very soothing visual experience.


Some interesting facts about Himalayan crystal rock salt:
The crystal salt is formed over a period of 250 million years during which micro-organisms are compressed and fossilized into a layer of salt very deep beneath the earths crust. The result is a crystalization process which combines the salt and micro-organisms. How does this help us? The crystal salt is enriched with 84 minerals and trace elements found on the periodic table which is no longer freely available in our every day food. Salt is not on the periodic table but the nutrients in the Himalayan salt crystal are, and it is acclaimed that it is a great source of calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc and  iron. When dissolved it is alkaline to the skin, and when heated it disperses a negative ionic charge into the air which negates the harmful effects of all the electronics that we surround ourselves with. Crystal salt is a natural anti-microbial agent that is known to kill mould, spores and bacteria. it does not possess added iodide, anti caking agents or preservatives and it is known to be the purest salt on earth, while also being considered of nutritional benefit.
 

So when a space very close to where I am currently situated became available, I knew that I had to take the leap of faith and take action. I have for quite some time now, wanted to start the process of expanding my business to incorporate elements of natural healing and well being by building the first ever Himalayan rock salt Cave in Bethesda MD. I have always felt that this would be the natural progression in offering new services that would continue our journey together.
I have spoken at great length with many of my clients as to what this would mean for you and how your experience would improve by adding this along with community acupuncture, salt cave yoga and meditation to the list of offerings, and you have all told me, “Build it and we will come”.
So, here we are, I am so excited to say that a once in a life time opportunity presents itself for me. I have found a 2 200 sqf space right next to the Bethesda Metro and the Hyatt Hotel. It is on the ground floor and has the structural integrity that we will need for building a 550 sqf salt chamber. However going from a one room massage studio to a 2 200 sqf  space is going to be a whole different kettle of fish, and to complete this task I need your support. 
This has been an incredibly easy but nerve racking decision for me.  I know that building the salt Cave will offer natural healing possibilities beyond our wildest imagination. The most difficult part is actually describing something so beautiful. Its almost impossible if you have not already experienced a salt cave on your own. 
I have consulted with salt cave owners and their clients, all eager and willing to share their miracle stories and who have urged me to get started. With their continued support and the support of my clients and community I believe this can really happen and become a reality.
With your support I will be able to do the following:

Redesign the space and make structural changes to the existing building that will allow us to have enough space to fit 16-20 people inside the salt cave at a time.
Purchase 32 tons of Himalayan rock salt to actually build the internal structure of the salt cave, add a special Halo-generator for infusing the air with Himalayan salt on a micro-ionic level to recreate the sea air, and to build a dedicated HVac system that will ensure the air inside the room remains 10x purer than outside, and also Hermetically sealing the room.
Expand my services to offer a multitude of differing options which will include but in no way be limited to community acupuncture, salt cave yoga, meditation, aromatherapy workshops, didjeridoo evenings, Tibetan singing bowl events and vibrational energy workshops. The possibilities are endless.
Stock our store with amazing organic and natural Himalayan rock salt products for use in your home to clean the air, flavor your food, light your childrens rooms, enhance your bathing experience and impress your friends.

The success of this project would mean so much to so many people.  Parents who have travelled as far as Asheville NC, Williamsburg VA and Carlysle PA have all asked if this was something that I think we can accomplish and I truly believe the answer is ""Yes, together we can""




What You Get: also check out the images on our gallery page
 

 



The Salt Rock lights :


Salt rocks are fantatstic for cleaning the air of impurities, they are soothing on the eyes, great as night lights and really promote a great nights rest. When the salt is heated it emits a negative ionic charge theat counteracts the harmful effects of electronics that surround us on a day to day basis.Choose from three different sizes starting with the small one which comes in three different styles, is usb powered and great in any kids room, on a bar or just in a little corner as an added ambience., or maybe the medium or large natural boulder shaped lights that come with a globe and dimmer switch, all ready for taking the healing experience home. Change the magnetic vibe inside your home within an instant.


 


Massages: $85


Choose a lovely combo of maybe a massage with a salt chamber experience afterwards, please remember that the services are only available once we open our doors. If we are delayed in any way with the build out we will be in a position to obviously still do the massage services from our existing location and you would then just have to do the chamber experience on its own once we do open. However we are quite confident that this will not be necessary.
                 
 


Tequila glasses $18 for 2


2 Tequila glasses.Enjoy a shot of tequila or vodka in style with Shooter glasses made from Himalayan Rock salt, get two, four or six and remember that salt is a natural anti-microbial agent and a quick rinse and air dry cleans the glass to ensure that you have many uses out of it. Maybe you would like to get two with a nifty usb light that changes colors for that intimate setting, and wether its a dorm room or a wet bar in your office its just so unusual you will be sure to be the centre of attention.
             


Grilling Blocks


Want a salt block to use as a cutting board for preparing veggies, your steak or presenting an amazaing sushi platter? Culinary chefs use blocks of Himalayan salt to age their steaks, present their sushi dishes or just as elegant and unusual centre pieces. we have it in three different sizes for your ease of use or maybe you would like all three. Remember that when the salt block has become smaller due to a lot of use, you can still use the salt to flavor your food by grating it or crushing it depending on how you like it.
Salt tiles, bricks and blocks come in various shapes and sizes. The grilling blocks we are offering is a package of two sizes together. One 8x4x1 size, ideal for preparing sushi or presenting a small cheese platter, plus a 10x6x1 ideal for grilling a steak or chicken on the barbecue. Should we reach our goal, then we would be able to offer different shapes and sizes on a roll out basis.

 
 


 





Himalayan Salt:


Grinder salt or chunks ? Maybe you want some salt to refill your grinder, make a great hand/body scrub or even to use it in your bath after a really hard day at work or workout. We have it in chunks, grinder size as well as powdered salt. Remember, Himalayan Crystal Salt has 84 different minerals and elements in it that no other salt has. Ordinary Sodium Chloride is bleached and devoid of any nutritional benefit. So by using Himalayand Crystal Salt you are actually feeding your body nutrients it needs, and it is in fact a good source of calcium, potassium, magnesium and zinc.



Gift Certificates:


Get $20 for the price of $10 or $50 for the price of $25, either way, you can buy or gift goodies to your hearts content and all in time for the holiday and festive season.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Not interested in being paid in salt like the Roman Soldiers were, well we have some great Salt Chamber sessions or massage series that may suit you better and I am so looking forward to sharing this experience with you.
What happens if we do not reach our goal:
One of the reasons why we have agreed to flexible spending is that the Indiegogo site allows you our clients to pay with a credit card as well as Paypal. If we had decided on the fixed amount you would only get the opportunity to pay with paypal and I know that this would be very limiting for many of my clients.
I have a certain portion of the funds required to start the project and if for some reason I am not able to raise all the funds we need to start the space, we will have to build a smaller chamber. In the event that the salt cave is not built at all, we will still be in a position to meet all massage and salt product obligations and all other funds for salt cave sessions will be returned to the respective contributors. I promise full transparency to all contributors and you will always be kept up to date with where we are in every stage of the project.
Delays:
Should we be delayed for whatever reason, we will keep our clients posted and updated at all times, not only with the progress of our build out but also if things go wrong. All salt products will be available for pick up from October 1st, 2013, all massages can still be done at our current venue, and so construction and buildout delays will only affect salt cave sessions.  



The Impact
Research has proven that a salt cave is a safe and alternative manner in which people of all ages can alleviate stress and a general lack of energy. I believe that because of the high pollen counts within the DC metro area, that the salt cave is going to be a valuable asset to children and parents alike and it is my sincere wish that it will decrease the amount of hospital visits for everyone as a result of seasonal allergies and asthma related issues.

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Marita Hansen, and I am 33 years old and I live in Norway.</p>
<p>Most of my adult life I've suffered from depression and anxiety.  Because of this, I have not been able to work more than a few months once in a while. This again have caused some isolation on my part, and low self esteem.</p>
<p>Last January I was lucky to tag along with a few people who where going to go indoor climbing. I've always wanted to try it - and was really looking forward to it! <strong>I had promised myself that the first time I tried, no matter what, I would not give up before I reached the top.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>And so I did! All five times! :-D</strong></em></p>
<p><br/>The rush was amazing! I was instantsly hooked. and was overwhelmed with all kinds of feelings, but mostly the one I've longed for for such a long time. A sense of accomplishment. <strong>I DID THAT! I climbed that wall.<br/></strong></p>
<p>So I did it again, and again, until my arms were so tired I had to stop. And I think I smiled for days :-)</p>
<p><strong>I've experienced many times how fysical activity can help dealing with depression and anxiety. You get to know you body, and what it is capable of. What YOU are capable of.</strong></p>
<p><br/>And for me, climbing opened up something new in me. I had to trust the man holding the rope, I had to trust myself, I had to figure out the smartest way to go, how to use my body and my strength to get to the top.</p>
<p>And I want to do it again!</p>
<p><br/>Because of my work situation, I don't have any money left to ""luxury""-things like theese. All my money go to rent, food and bills.<br/><br/><strong>So I thought I should hear with you guys, if you wanted to help me.

<p align=""center""><strong><em>at the Drum Circle Facilitator’s Guild Conference! </em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center""><em>If you’ve been waiting, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">now’s the time</span> to make your contribution! Send him to these February drum conferences in healing, education and AT-RISK YOUTH!</em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>            Cornell ""Sugarfoot"" Coley is a reformed African and Latin dancer, now a successful healing drum therapist. Not that's he's given up dancing, but it now serves a greater purpose - to support the healing power of the drum.</p>
<p>           After teaching dance for 25 years at UCLA, Tufts, Smith, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and other colleges, Cornell still felt a gnawing emptiness that dance could not fill. And he was besieged by headaches for years.</p>
<p>            It all came to a head at the Brazilian Dance Camp in 1999 when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After a whirlwind of emergency rooms, a shunt in his head and three-hour surgery, he was on the road to a second chance with no complications.</p>
<p>            The following years were still confused with too many avenues, when an old colleague from the state arts council introduced him to <em>Healing Arts:Pathways to Health</em>. The director sent him as a talented novice into hospitals and veteran’s homes, covering three states. It was a great success.</p>
<p>            Now, he’s found a unique career niche - bringing drumming into education &amp; healing! And, his specialization in African and Latin traditions make his contributions unique to the movement.</p>
<p>            Meanwhile, his friend Richie Goldstein he succumbed to cancer in 2005 and left his unique creation, a toddler drum circle, without leadership. Cornell picked it up and built a successful weekly event, attracting families with toddlers of all abilities, races and classes.</p>
<p>            Running this program for six years launched his reputation with early childhood and he accepted several requests last year to become a drum specialist in the Boston public school system. Only one thing remains - truly “expert” facilitation training in education, health and at-risk youth.</p>
<p>            Cornell is raising funds to train with the best, including: <em>Arthur Hull</em>, Pioneer &amp; Father of the Drum Circle Movement; <em>Christine Stephens</em>, Author, Coach and Master Facilitator in Drum Therapy and <em>Dr. Barry Bittman</em>, neurologist, author, international speaker, researcher and innovator.</p>
<p>These are the programs he will attend:</p>
<p>February 1 - 3 -- HealthRhythms Intensive  - Valencia, CA $1,200 total (registration, air fare, hotel)</p>
<p>February 15-17 -- DrumBeat Intensive - Panama City Beach, FL $1,300 total (registration, air fare, hotel)</p>
<p>February 22-24 -- Drum Circle Facilitator’s Guild - Watsonville, CA $1,000 total (registration, air fare, hotel)</p>
<p>TOTAL $3,500</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>A word from Cornell:</em></p>
<p>Thanks everybody! Here are perks I can offer you:</p>
<ul>
<li>a signed copy of my band’s CD</li>
<li>one-on-one mentoring by phone</li>
<li>“A Fascinating Rhythm” my original, solo, interactive drum, dance and cultural performance that I’ve been doing for large audiences for 9 years in over 400 venues!</li>

at the Drum Circle Facilitator’s Guild Conference! 
 
If you’ve been waiting, now’s the time to make your contribution! Send him to these February drum conferences in healing, education and AT-RISK YOUTH!
***
            Cornell ""Sugarfoot"" Coley is a reformed African and Latin dancer, now a successful healing drum therapist. Not that's he's given up dancing, but it now serves a greater purpose - to support the healing power of the drum.
           After teaching dance for 25 years at UCLA, Tufts, Smith, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and other colleges, Cornell still felt a gnawing emptiness that dance could not fill. And he was besieged by headaches for years.
            It all came to a head at the Brazilian Dance Camp in 1999 when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After a whirlwind of emergency rooms, a shunt in his head and three-hour surgery, he was on the road to a second chance with no complications.
            The following years were still confused with too many avenues, when an old colleague from the state arts council introduced him to Healing Arts:Pathways to Health. The director sent him as a talented novice into hospitals and veteran’s homes, covering three states. It was a great success.
            Now, he’s found a unique career niche - bringing drumming into education & healing! And, his specialization in African and Latin traditions make his contributions unique to the movement.
            Meanwhile, his friend Richie Goldstein he succumbed to cancer in 2005 and left his unique creation, a toddler drum circle, without leadership. Cornell picked it up and built a successful weekly event, attracting families with toddlers of all abilities, races and classes.
            Running this program for six years launched his reputation with early childhood and he accepted several requests last year to become a drum specialist in the Boston public school system. Only one thing remains - truly “expert” facilitation training in education, health and at-risk youth.
            Cornell is raising funds to train with the best, including: Arthur Hull, Pioneer & Father of the Drum Circle Movement; Christine Stephens, Author, Coach and Master Facilitator in Drum Therapy and Dr. Barry Bittman, neurologist, author, international speaker, researcher and innovator.
These are the programs he will attend:
February 1 - 3 -- HealthRhythms Intensive  - Valencia, CA $1,200 total (registration, air fare, hotel)
February 15-17 -- DrumBeat Intensive - Panama City Beach, FL $1,300 total (registration, air fare, hotel)
February 22-24 -- Drum Circle Facilitator’s Guild - Watsonville, CA $1,000 total (registration, air fare, hotel)
TOTAL $3,500
 
A word from Cornell:
Thanks everybody! Here are perks I can offer you:

a signed copy of my band’s CD
one-on-one mentoring by phone
“A Fascinating Rhythm” my original, solo, interactive drum, dance and cultural performance that I’ve been doing for large audiences for 9 years in over 400 venues!
Please visit my web site www.afrolatin.net.
If you want to help and can’t contribute, please pass on this campaign to others through the social media that you use!

<h3>Help Us Lay Baby Logan to Rest.</h3>
<p>     My son and daughter-in law just experienced every parents nightmare. Fred and Ashley Hartley lost their son, Logan on July 20,2012 one month before he was to be welcomed to this world.  Ashley's placenta separated from her uterus and caused internal bleeding.  She was 36 weeks along and everything up until this point was a normal pregnancy. They did an emergency  C-section and baby Logan was stillborn.  Ashley received blood and might need more.  The entire family is devastated and heartbroken. Ashley is thinks she did something wrong and caused this to happen and both are having a rough time right now.</p>
<p>     We are seeking financial assistance to lay Logan to rest, as this has been such an unexpected and heartwrencing event.  Fred and Ashley  have 3 other children and no medical insurance so this unexpected tragedy it has put a heavy burden on the family. We are requesting assistance with  funeral expenses to say goiodbye to our lost angel. This would help my son and daughter-in-law immensely. It will not make the pain go away but it will give a little closure on this horrible ordeal.</p>
<p>*****Neither one of the kids use drugs and Ashley did not drink alcohol the entire preganancy.  The pregnancy was completely normal until July 20 and the entire family was eagerly waiting Logan's arrival.*****</p>
<p>   All funds will go to Logan's funeral. Thank you in advance for you kindness!</p>

<p>The Medical Cannabis Declaration (MCD) is 
an online platform founded on 16 February 2013 in
Ruethen, Germany, established by world wide medical professionals and patients who believe that the access to cannabis should not be determined by geography. MCD aims at promoting safe and regular prescription and use of medical cannabis, globally. The charity wants to be part of a growing movement to change the negative perception on cannabis to assure its real medical values are recognised. We solely rely on scientific studies developed for the medical use of the cannabis plant. Visit us at: <a href=""http://medical-cannabis-declaration.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://medical-cannabis-declaration.org/</a></p>
<p><b>Why donating?</b></p>
<p>When it comes to health issues, information is key. Under the motto ‘Say yes to cannabis as medicine’, the charity MCD aims to increase awareness of the benefits of medical cannabis by making decades of research freely available.

cannabis - an element of the right to health

The “Medical Cannabis Declaration (MCD)” invites you to be a part of  our crowdfunding campaign for a world wide, multi-lingual information platform on medicinal cannabis!

What if you had a serious disease that prevented you from living a normal life? Conventional medicines may not always work. What if there was an affordable natural medicine that could help, but there was no reliable source of information about this medicine or national laws would not allow you to use it?


This is the situation faced by millions of people around the world, who suffer from severe medical conditions, such as Multiple Sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic pain, severe depression and post traumatic stress disorder or chronic inflammatory diseases. Combining the scientific knowledge of today with thousands of years of human experience, we are better equipped than ever to understand and share the knowledge behind nature's most versatile medicine.

Only around 10 out of 200 countries in the world have legislation that grants their citizens access to the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids, active compounds found in the cannabis plants, which can help improve patients’ quality of life considerably.




With your help, we will make scientific information on the uses medical cannabis freely available in the most spoken languages around the world, helping those in need to access reliable information that can improve their lives considerably. We want patients, medical professionals, policy makers and the general public to understand the scientific reality behind a plant that has been use for a varied group of diseases, for millennia.
Please support this world wide information campaign by donating orsharing this information with your networks.
Empower patients who stand to benefit from medical cannabis.
Let us all say “Yes to cannabis as medicine”. 



Who are we?



The Medical Cannabis Declaration (MCD) is 
an online platform founded on 16 February 2013 in
Ruethen, Germany, established by world wide medical professionals and patients who believe that the access to cannabis should not be determined by geography. MCD aims at promoting safe and regular prescription and use of medical cannabis, globally. The charity wants to be part of a growing movement to change the negative perception on cannabis to assure its real medical values are recognised. We solely rely on scientific studies developed for the medical use of the cannabis plant. Visit us at: http://medical-cannabis-declaration.org/
Why donating?
When it comes to health issues, information is key. Under the motto ‘Say yes to cannabis as medicine’, the charity MCD aims to increase awareness of the benefits of medical cannabis by making decades of research freely available. Through its network of medical professionals, experts and patients, MCD will share scientific information in multiple languages targeted at medical professionals, policy makers and patients, alike.
With the budget raised through crowdfunding, among other activities, MCD will create and expand a database on all aspects of cannabis as medicine for patients and medical professionals as well as policy makers and the general public, freely made available in the most spoken languages in the world, distributed via newsletters, leaflets and other materials. The raised funds will also support close cooperation with existing platforms on cannabis as medicine and link and expand existing medical and patient networks – especially with the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines (IACM: http://www.cannabis-med.org/).
The project hopes to create a community of people who can help at the local, national and international levels by providing information on cannabis as medicine.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Homeopathy is regularly attacked in the media, and those of us who appreciate the science and art of homeopathy want and need a strong advocate who can respond to the misinformation that skeptics of homeopathy are providing.  Most recently, the U.S. government's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued a ruling asserting that the marketing of homeopathic medicines must now include a statement that there is no scientific evidence that homeopathic medicines work and that homeopathic principles derive from the 1700s that are not accepted by most medical experts.</p>
<p><strong>Dana Ullman, MPH, CCH</strong>, is presently in the process of finishing writing a detailed response to this FTC ruling.  By the time you come to this website, he may have already published this article at one or more websites.  Besides this article, future responses will also be important, even vitally important.</p>
<p>As you may know, Dana Ullman has authored 10 books on homeopathy, two of which contain a Foreword by the Physician to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  Dana has also written chapters on homeopathy in four leading medical textbooks, including two that were published by Oxford University Press and one by the American Pain Management Association.  He has lectured at Stanford Medical School, UCSF School of Medicine, UC Davis School of Medicine, Duke Medical School, UC Berkeley, NYU School of Journalism, amongst many  others.</p>
<p>Dana is intimately familiar with the scientific evidence that presently exists for homeopathy, and he has consistently written compelling articles that convince people of the value of homeopathy and homeopathic medicines.</p>
<p>Dana has written many articles at the Huffingtonpost that have reached hundreds of thousands of people, but he cannot afford the time and effort that it takes to write such articles or to work to promote them so that large numbers of people read these articles.  The very survival of homeopathy today depends upon people like Dana who are defending homeopathy in the media.</p>
<p>To see many of Dana's writings at the Huffingtonpost, click <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/dana-ullman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Dana does not want to ask any homeopathic pharmacy for contributions because the skeptics will then simply assert that he is shilling for homeopathic drug companies.  Instead, he wants to and needs the support from individuals who appreciate homeopathy and who appreciate the special strong defense that Dana provides to and for this science and art of healing.</p>
<p>Previously, Dana simply volunteered his time and expertise to writing articles, but he cannot afford to that anymore.  He needs your support.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Jess from England and I've been volunteering and working in South Africa for 9 years with an epic NPO called Genesis and a Church called Norwegian Settlers Church.</p>
<p>I came out to South Africa when I was 18 to uplift teenagers and children in communities who are affected by HIV/AIDS. I love the country, the people who live here and the organisation I work with.</p>
<p>I am currently working at a community centre which runs educational support programmes, youth groups, cell group and leadership activities for young people aged 5-25.</p>
<p>At Youthworx, we LOVE to play sports! In fact, our video is inspired by the literal use of bins and other household items to play sports around our centre! We have a dream to put up a sports centre that will allow young people to play sports in a safe Christian founded environment. </p>
<p>We have already been nominated by a bank for the 'Local Hero's Award' this year and they have given us $1000 towards the start of our sports centre. We are hoping that other people will see and understand the importance of our dream which is to provide a quality safe place for youth in a community-away from the many negative influences such as drugs, alcohol, sex and the risk of HIV infection.</p>
<p>It would mean the world to us if you supported our dream!</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We have already received $1000 in donations for our side netting but need another $1000 for our brick wall. </p>
<p>We are starting by fundraising for the brick wall which we can hopefully put up asap!!! We will still need funding after that for our surface material but this is our starting point.</p>
<p>At Youthworx, we want to recognise and remember every person who helps us to achieve our dream. For every person who sponsors us, we want to paint their names and towns on the brick wall of our sports centre. That way people can see how many friends we have around the world!!! </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We have 50 children coming to our educational support programmes, 100 high schoolers coming to our senior youth group, 50 who come to our junior youth group, 30 young adults in our cell group and 5 schools who we network with including a primary school called Cornerstone which hosts children with autism. </p>
<p>All of these young people and children will directly benefit from our sports centre!</p>
<p>We particularly hope to host children during the day who are home schooled so that they can have access to sports facilities which other students have going to main stream schools.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The cost of our dream sports centre is quite a bit-we have been quoted £15,000. We are hoping to build it bit by with with what we can afford and fundraise. </p>
<p>However, we have also had individual sponsors and businesses voice their desire to support our dream in substantial ways. We are also a NPO which means we can give Tax Certificates for donations for businesses who want to sponsor us through that avenue. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>Please share our dream with your friends, church or business. Perhaps you would consider becoming a fundraiser on our behalf and run a race for us or do some other activity for our worthy cause. You can share this page through Indigogo's sharing tools so check them out!<p></p></div>","Short Summary

We are hoping that other people will see and understand the importance of our dream which is to provide a quality safe place for youth in a community-away from the many negative influences such as drugs, alcohol, sex and the risk of HIV infection.
It would mean the world to us if you supported our dream!
   What We Need & What You Get 
We have already received $1000 in donations for our side netting but need another $1000 for our brick wall. 
We are starting by fundraising for the brick wall which we can hopefully put up asap!!! We will still need funding after that for our surface material but this is our starting point.
At Youthworx, we want to recognise and remember every person who helps us to achieve our dream. For every person who sponsors us, we want to paint their names and towns on the brick wall of our sports centre. That way people can see how many friends we have around the world!!!    The Impact 
We have 50 children coming to our educational support programmes, 100 high schoolers coming to our senior youth group, 50 who come to our junior youth group, 30 young adults in our cell group and 5 schools who we network with including a primary school called Cornerstone which hosts children with autism. 
All of these young people and children will directly benefit from our sports centre!
We particularly hope to host children during the day who are home schooled so that they can have access to sports facilities which other students have going to main stream schools.   Risks & Challenges  
The cost of our dream sports centre is quite a bit-we have been quoted £15,000. We are hoping to build it bit by with with what we can afford and fundraise. 
However, we have also had individual sponsors and businesses voice their desire to support our dream in substantial ways. We are also a NPO which means we can give Tax Certificates for donations for businesses who want to sponsor us through that avenue.    Other Ways You Can Help 
Please share our dream with your friends, church or business. Perhaps you would consider becoming a fundraiser on our behalf and run a race for us or do some other activity for our worthy cause. You can share this page through Indigogo's sharing tools so check them out!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

We are not asking you to back a project that is in the dark. The SMARTGOLF App is already running with our club from our previous Kickstarter campaign ('15). The mechanical and electrical design for the putter is complete with the prototype already built and ready. We are working on finalizing software development (precision) and full scale mass production.<strong> With Smart Putter being fully funded (183%) on Kickstarter, indiegogo backers would be receiving the Smart Putter for granted.</strong> With your support, we can bring the world's first digital putter that can give you all the information that other putting gadgets offered in a very reasonable price.

As we were continuing to develop more accessible and smart golf equipment, we have set our direction to inventing a putter that can give you the necessary training and perform as a gamer at the same time. We believe that when it comes to putting, your grip, weight, feel, and senses are all important. Which is why we worked day and night for months to invent and produce the Smart Putter which can lead you to a better putt but also perform and feel like your actual gamer. We have come a long way to make ""Smart Putter"" a real equipment from ideas. The only wall standing between you and the Smart Putter is this Kickstarter project.

Naturally you will become a winner on the green with the Smart Putter.                                                              How is it different?            1. No more wasting time setting things upYou have to acquire several equipment and different setups to improve your overall putting. However, with the SMART Putter your Targeting, Horizontal movement, and Stabilization is all taken care of with ONE SMART Putter. With just one putter, you can develop a develop and sustain a muscle memory that will get you that hole in one.                                                                                                     2. With or Without the AppNo app requiredUnlike other golf simulators and analyzers that help with just one phase of your putting stroke, our Smart Putter provide an all-in-one putting solution.    
 3. Real-time animationThe avatar in our SMARTGOLF App does not display some random pre-made animation that only plays after you swing. The putter delivers real-time data to your App and with this live data, the App has the avatar move with it. The avatar will move and swing just as you are. This is recorded and you can play it back and forth to observe your form.     An effective putter even with LED/Laser turned off4. No more switching between your practice putter and game putter.The grip and weight of your putter are major factors when it comes to building proper muscle memory. Don't lose your momentum by going back and forth from your practice putter to your game putter. With the Smart Putter, practice with the LED level indicator, laser aimer, and connection with application for analysis. After learning proper muscle memory formed with the Smart Putter, just turn off the technology and enjoy the Smart Putter as you would your usual putter.SMARTGOLF App              The SMARTGOLF App is currently available on App Store , Google Play Store, and Windows. The App is fully compatible with ios, android and Windows PC platforms.VR is planned for SMARTGOLF App next year May. For the ultimate and the most realistic golf experience. Stay tuned for updates on VR SMARTGOLFAfter connecting the SMART Putter to the App, watch as the avatar move according to your exact movement. Play the your recorded stroke back and forth for comparison. Utilize the analysis that the App provides. SMART PUTTER GALLERY   Timeline Why We Need Your PledgeWe are a growing startup company with the huge goal of making golf practice or even the sport itself more accessible and affordable. We are not asking you to back a project that is in the dark. The SMARTGOLF App is already running with our club from our previous Kickstarter campaign ('15). The mechanical and electrical design for the putter is complete with the prototype already built and ready. We are working on finalizing software development (precision) and full scale mass production. With Smart Putter being fully funded (183%) on Kickstarter, indiegogo backers would be receiving the Smart Putter for granted. With your support, we can bring the world's first digital putter that can give you all the information that other putting gadgets offered in a very reasonable price. We have already have set contracts with our manufacturing counterparts which means once we receive the funds it is just a matter of time before you get your Smart Putter on time.                                                                      Our Story SMARTGOLF has marched for providing an effective an accessible golf practice method to golfers of every level since 2015. With two successful Crowdfunding Campaigns ( '15 Smartgolf Club Kickstarter, '17 Smart Putter Kickstarter) we have kept our word in fulfilling all delivery of rewards to our backers.  Therefore, we can safely say that we have experience and confidence in what we do. As we were continuing to develop more accessible and smart golf equipment, we have set our direction to inventing a putter that can give you the necessary training and perform as a gamer at the same time. We believe that when it comes to putting, your grip, weight, feel, and senses are all important. Which is why we worked day and night for months to invent and produce the Smart Putter which can lead you to a better putt but also perform and feel like your actual gamer. We have come a long way to make ""Smart Putter"" a real equipment from ideas. The only wall standing between you and the Smart Putter is this Kickstarter project. Let us break down that wall with a fantastic success on our project and get you the solution that you need!",23.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>For Those of You Who Love the Details:</b></h3>
<p>Phase 1 – In this phase, we will design and build the basic
mechanical / electronic components of the robot. Things like the
frame, wheels, motors, controllers, batteries, etc. We will leverage
this design from our past work on small mobile robots. The heart of
phase 1 will be the design and fabrication of the deterrents. We want
to have 4 of these deterrents installed and operational on the robot.
For this phase, we intend the robot to be operated via human
remote-control only. The final goal being a working prototype,
remote-controlled, and having 4 onboard deterrents controlled via the
remote-control unit. 
</p>
<p>Phase 2 – We’ll add the ‘smarts’ to the robot during this
phase – in short, we’ll give him a brain. He’ll then have the
basic ability to wander around remotely and not run into anything or
anybody. The software for this sort of navigation is widely
available. We will research a number of these systems and pick the
best one suited to our application. We’ll add some sensors so he
can detect obstacles – and tell the difference between a post and a
person. Simultaneously, we’ll be working on a scheme for employing
the deterrents once we are in ‘super hero’ mode. It might be an
approach where the deterrents follow some random pattern, or we might
find that a scheduled approach is more effective. The final goal
being the ability to get from Point A to Point B without hitting
anything – then engaging the four deterrents in some determined
fashion. 
</p>
<p>Phase 3 – Even though our robot is smart – he’ll need to be
smarter. Here is where the hardware and software need to start having
serious discussions with one another. We’ll need sensors that can
detect a gunshot, and software smart enough to determine the location
and direct the robot towards the threat. Once there, we’ll need the
ability to lock on to the target and deliver the deterrents. If the
intruder runs, the robot needs to monitor his movements and follow in
his wake. Again, the ultimate intent is to buy time – if all we end
up doing is chasing the intruder around the school – then that is
time they aren’t targeting our kids. 
</p>
<p>Phase 4 – Here’s where we’ll bring it all together. Or maybe
a better way to describe it is this is where the rubber meets the
road. Once we have a working prototype, we need to head out into the
Real World for field testing. Good ideas are only good ideas if they
work. We’ll need to secure a suitable location, or locations, and
run the robot through a series of scenarios to see how it responds.
There will be failures, improvements, more failures and more
improvements – this is the nature of testing. Our ultimate goal
will be a full-up working system which meets our original design
criteria – that criteria being to simply ‘buy time’. Time for
our kids, time for our teachers and time for our police. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/244308/files/20131205121811-NASA_ROVER.jpg?1386274691"" src="""" style=""width: 522.017px; height: 350px;""/></p><p><b>RoPro's six wheeled rover - designed for NASA / Carnegie Mellon University</b><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>Safety Features:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Human Operator Override Feature</b></h4>
<p>Despite that movies love to portray the out-of-control robot
running around hurting people, in real life, robots rarely go
berserk. And when they do, they typically just run down over the hill
into the woods. However, we most definitely will install a human
override function that is accessible to whoever is granted access to
robot’s operation. There are actually a number of different
techniques that could be employed that would keep the robot from
confronting those it is not programmed to confront. But we aren’t
going to discuss those here as that would be giving away our secrets
to the bad guys. 
</p>
<h4><b>Non-harmful deterrents</b></h4>
<p>When we talked with people about this project during our initial
investigation, their first concern was about the robot potentially
harming the very children it is intended to protect. We want to make
it clear that our intent isn’t to maim, harm or injure an intruder,
our intent is to deter, confuse and distract them. To force him/her
to deal with the robot and thus either slow or stop them from
carrying out their original intention. Ultimately we are trying to
buy time, time for the kids and teachers to get behind locked doors –
time for the good guys to arrive and stop the assailant. <br/></p><p></p><h3>Risks and Challenges: 

</h3><p>We will need thick skin as many people are going to be eager to
tell us all the reasons this isn’t going to work. We aren’t
saying this is going to be easy, all we will say is that we’ll give
it the best chance of success that we can muster.</p>
<p>Multi-floored schools: Though most modern suburban schools are
constructed across a single level, many older urban schools still
have multi-floor lay-outs. Building a robot to climb stairs is an
entire KickStarter project in itself. Multiple stationed robots will
be a better solution here. These robots will need to talk with one
another so if the intruder escapes to another floor, that information
can be relayed to those robots on the floors above and below. So
beside B.o.B, you might need a few B.a.r.B’s and T.o.M’s.</p>
<p>Single gunshot: In the event an intruder has an individual target
in mind, he/she may only fire one or two shots. This may not give the
robot enough time to locate the source of the gun fire. An option
here is to give the person monitoring the school’s security camera
system, the ability to manually direct the robot’s movement. This
might be nothing more than mousing over the suspect in question on
the video screen and clicking the “go get ‘em’ button. This
information is then relayed to the robot who will do its best to
locate the intruder.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Robot itself is targeted: Of course, this is the one that everyone
will point out. What happens if the intruder turns the gun on the
robot? Our response to that is - GREAT! If they are shooting robots,
then they won’t be shooting kids. Important electronics can be
hardened from attack, tires can be solid rubber. We’ll make sure
that the robot can take some serious damage and continue on its
mission. Remember, he doesn’t need to survive for an hour; he only
needs to survive the time gap until the police arrive. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/244329/files/20131205122756-ff2276aa6e339e94c8a30e662be22348_large.jpg?1386275276"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>RoPro's Robotized John Deere Utility Vehicle</b><p></p><p>Knife instead of a gun: We’ve assumed up to this point that the
intruder is armed with a gun – but what happens if it is a knife or
baseball bat instead? Again, like the ‘too few shots’ scenario
from above, the robot could be manually directed to the target from
the person monitoring the security cameras.</p>
<p>We are sure there are many more challenges and limitations before
us; some that we won’t discover until testing. Many of you will
point out ones we haven’t thought of – great - we welcome your
input. Our goal here is to save lives, not show you how smart we
think we are. But standing around and talking about the many reasons
this won’t work, will never solve the problem. Hard work, long
hours and working capital is what this project calls for. So jump on
the band wagon with us here and be part of the solution!</p>

decided in 2004 to grow this talent internally. We sifted through the
local high schools for ‘good clay’, then offered internships to
the aspiring engineers we found there. Rather than teaching
engineering from the classroom, we teach it from the shop floor. If
you can’t fabricate, how can you possibly expect to design? So we
quickly immerse the interns into our shop’s fabrication process.
Through fabrication, they slowly begin to get a sense of scale, of
the ‘feel’ of materials, of best design practices. Armed with
this strong sense of fabrication and design then, their high school
and college engineering classes begin to take on more meaning –
rather than being empty exercises with no practical application. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/242400/files/20131204131640-d31bf262a469d4cb380e183e20d47773_large.jpg?1386191800"" src="""" style=""""/><b>Throwing out the first pitch at PNC park</b></p><p>This immersion style of teaching is needed now more than ever, as
kids simply don’t get the exposure to mechanical systems as the
previous generation. I’m my era; all our Dads changed the oil in
their cars and did the majority of household repairs themselves. We
all built tree houses and go-carts from scratch. We knew how a
bicycle worked and how to fix it when it didn’t. When the car quit
running, there wasn’t a cell phone lying on the seat to call AAA.
We’ve lost this sense of mechanical resourcefulness, and you can
see it clearly reflected in the poorly designed products that infest
the market place today. Regardless of the continued proliferation of
software and electronic gadgets, we are 3-dimensional creatures that
inhabit a 3-dimensional world. We interact with this world through
mechanical devices and tools. In our own small way then, we are
fighting back against this increasing lack of mechanical knowledge
one intern at a time. If our company achieves nothing more than
turning out solid engineers, grounded in the principles of practical
engineering, we will ultimately deem our work at RoPro Design a
rousing success.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/242409/files/20131204131753-b4f721976ec8c5c76bce1bfe669f6e39_large.jpg?1386191873"" src="""" style=""""/><b>RoPro's Chemical Sensor Package - designed for Applied Perception Inc.</b></p><p>Visit The RoPro Design's site to see more of our exciting projects.

intruder is armed with a gun – but what happens if it is a knife or
baseball bat instead? Again, like the ‘too few shots’ scenario
from above, the robot could be manually directed to the target from
the person monitoring the security cameras.
We are sure there are many more challenges and limitations before
us; some that we won’t discover until testing. Many of you will
point out ones we haven’t thought of – great - we welcome your
input. Our goal here is to save lives, not show you how smart we
think we are. But standing around and talking about the many reasons
this won’t work, will never solve the problem. Hard work, long
hours and working capital is what this project calls for. So jump on
the band wagon with us here and be part of the solution!
About RoPro Design:
RoPro Design – incorporated in 2003, our company’s core focus
is the design and fabrication of mechanical prototypes for the mobile
robotics industry as well as other high technology research and
development markets. In addition to this core focus, we also aspire
to be a ‘Teaching Hospital for Young Engineers’. Of all we do, we
consider this our highest calling and a critical part of our Mission
Statement.  RoPro's Demining Robots - designed for Army / Carniegie Mellon UniversityAfter not being able to find the engineering talent we needed, we
decided in 2004 to grow this talent internally. We sifted through the
local high schools for ‘good clay’, then offered internships to
the aspiring engineers we found there. Rather than teaching
engineering from the classroom, we teach it from the shop floor. If
you can’t fabricate, how can you possibly expect to design? So we
quickly immerse the interns into our shop’s fabrication process.
Through fabrication, they slowly begin to get a sense of scale, of
the ‘feel’ of materials, of best design practices. Armed with
this strong sense of fabrication and design then, their high school
and college engineering classes begin to take on more meaning –
rather than being empty exercises with no practical application. Throwing out the first pitch at PNC parkThis immersion style of teaching is needed now more than ever, as
kids simply don’t get the exposure to mechanical systems as the
previous generation. I’m my era; all our Dads changed the oil in
their cars and did the majority of household repairs themselves. We
all built tree houses and go-carts from scratch. We knew how a
bicycle worked and how to fix it when it didn’t. When the car quit
running, there wasn’t a cell phone lying on the seat to call AAA.
We’ve lost this sense of mechanical resourcefulness, and you can
see it clearly reflected in the poorly designed products that infest
the market place today. Regardless of the continued proliferation of
software and electronic gadgets, we are 3-dimensional creatures that
inhabit a 3-dimensional world. We interact with this world through
mechanical devices and tools. In our own small way then, we are
fighting back against this increasing lack of mechanical knowledge
one intern at a time. If our company achieves nothing more than
turning out solid engineers, grounded in the principles of practical
engineering, we will ultimately deem our work at RoPro Design a
rousing success.RoPro's Chemical Sensor Package - designed for Applied Perception Inc.Visit The RoPro Design's site to see more of our exciting projects.

<p>Ishbel is the Executive Director of the NMHOA, and her work

some cases have resulted in injury and death. 
Retirees living on a fixed income often are forced out of their own homes

Shortly after as if being shook up wasn't bad enough I was sent to the hospital with a severe back pain and at 26...I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, sciatica, and was told that my SI joint was severely damaged. From all this...I need surgery. Which I can't afford and my insurance will hardly pay. I was told that I wasn't able to go back to work, and I am fighting to get disability with no luck...and my family can't help out more than they already do...<br/><br/>I wish that my story stopped there but it gets worse. In July of 2014 I was hospitalized again, and had a strange stutter. Turns out that I had two mini strokes, my body was shutting down, and I still can't fully talk right...because of this I lost the ability to work a desk job...so with my back out of wack, and my head messing with me...I have been lost. My story however still doesn't end there...though I wish that it did...<br/><br/>In September My heart rate was over 200bpm, and I found out that my heart as a flaw in the electrical currents that are inside of it. I had to undergo so many tests to figure out what was wrong...it has now been decided that I need a simple procedure, but once again...my insurance can't pay much leaving me with medical expenses I can't pay. <br/><br/>When it rains it pours. I lost my home, my job, my car...basically everything. I'm lost, confused, and barely getting by...I need to get my health sorted out so that I am able to get a job, and start my life up again. I'm only 26...my birthday to turn 27 in a few days. <br/><br/>Friday October 3rd...the results came in that I have rheumatoid arthritis...and I'm not even in my 30's. These are conditions that I shouldn't even be facing, and I can't seem to get any help. So I am asking. Even just a small donation will help me. I have got to get back on my feet. These bills are piling up...and I can't handle it. The stress only making my health worse. <br/><br/>So please...if you're still reading this...can you please help me fix my life back up. I'm so lost, and I hate drifting between places to live...and barely eating. I can't even afford the medication I need...<br/><br/>If you help me, I will be eternally thankful...and I really am all out of options...so please..and if you do...thank you. If you can't donate...please get my story out.

Shortly after as if being shook up wasn't bad enough I was sent to the hospital with a severe back pain and at 26...I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, sciatica, and was told that my SI joint was severely damaged. From all this...I need surgery. Which I can't afford and my insurance will hardly pay. I was told that I wasn't able to go back to work, and I am fighting to get disability with no luck...and my family can't help out more than they already do...I wish that my story stopped there but it gets worse. In July of 2014 I was hospitalized again, and had a strange stutter. Turns out that I had two mini strokes, my body was shutting down, and I still can't fully talk right...because of this I lost the ability to work a desk job...so with my back out of wack, and my head messing with me...I have been lost. My story however still doesn't end there...though I wish that it did...In September My heart rate was over 200bpm, and I found out that my heart as a flaw in the electrical currents that are inside of it. I had to undergo so many tests to figure out what was wrong...it has now been decided that I need a simple procedure, but once again...my insurance can't pay much leaving me with medical expenses I can't pay. When it rains it pours. I lost my home, my job, my car...basically everything. I'm lost, confused, and barely getting by...I need to get my health sorted out so that I am able to get a job, and start my life up again. I'm only 26...my birthday to turn 27 in a few days. Friday October 3rd...the results came in that I have rheumatoid arthritis...and I'm not even in my 30's. These are conditions that I shouldn't even be facing, and I can't seem to get any help. So I am asking. Even just a small donation will help me. I have got to get back on my feet. These bills are piling up...and I can't handle it. The stress only making my health worse. So please...if you're still reading this...can you please help me fix my life back up. I'm so lost, and I hate drifting between places to live...and barely eating. I can't even afford the medication I need...If you help me, I will be eternally thankful...and I really am all out of options...so please..and if you do...thank you. If you can't donate...please get my story out. I could really use a rainbow after this storm hit my life, and spun me upside down. Even if I don't get the full amount...every penny counts...Thank you for your time reading this...I appreciate even the thought.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
