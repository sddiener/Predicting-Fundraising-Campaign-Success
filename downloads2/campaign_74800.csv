<p><b>Our
Goal:</b></p>
<p>My name is Marci. I am a founding
member of the FTR community, the Bouldering Wall project coordinator, and a passionate
climber. I struggled for several years battling a drug addiction. I have
been sober for 3 years. Exercise and the love of the outdoors is a huge part of
my recovery. Fit To Recover is a place I go that helps me stay sober and enjoy
life with friends in recovery. <a href=""http://fit2recover.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FTR</a> already offers many different classes from Yoga
to CrossTraining; I want to add bouldering to the schedule.</p>
<p>I have found joy in climbing and it has
been a creative outlet in my life. When I am climbing, the outside world does
not matter; I am in the moment. My mind is only thinking of my next step. Climbing
is a physical and mental challenge. The peace and freedom that come when
climbing, words cannot describe- but other climbers know it is true. These
feelings are something I want others in the FTR community to feel. </p>

from the desire to share the beauty of  what a Single Scotch Whisky can 
be. With your help, I can complete the production of the first batch and

I’ve had a love affair with Scotch Whisky, exploring its richness and 
complexities. I decided to develop a brand of Scotch Whisky due to a 
debate that was ongoing about the quality of whisky at various social 
events, I was determined to provide some satisfaction and enjoyment of a
 quality drink of Scotch Whisky for future events around the city and 
that is how the birth of Smugglers Proof came to life. Smugglers Proof 
is a unique brand of Scotch Whisky with special packaging. I especially 
love the moment when the brand is introduce to someone and to see the 
wonderful reaction from them. <br/><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Work ongoing and completed</span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>• Carefully selecting an award-winning distiller to create the highest quality product<span style=""""> that is completely aligned with the</span><span style="""">  mission of this brand.</span></p><p><span style="""">• Completed work on designing a modern decanter bottle and packaging.</span><br/></p><p><span style="""">• Securing difficult and stringent approvals in the United States and Canada. </span><br/></p><p><span style="""">• Got a number of approvals. </span><br/></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Plan</span><br/>With
 your support, we can put SMUGGLERS PROOF Single Malt Scotch Whisky in 
the hands of people worldwide. The project is currently in the final 
stages and we are ready to start bottling our special 15 year and 20 year old Scotch
 <span><span><span>Whisky</span></span></span>.<br/><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How Will the Funds be used</span><br/>The 
main portion of funds received from our supporters will go towards bottling costs, 
freight and taxes. The goal of this project is for the initial run of 600 bottles. <br/><br/>A very aggressive sales

from the desire to share the beauty of  what a Single Scotch Whisky can 
be. With your help, I can complete the production of the first batch and
 have it imported for distribution in Canada and the United States. To 
achieve this, I need your help to finalize the production with the 
distillery, bottling, labeling, packaging, shipping, customs and 
warehouse storage in United States and Canada.How your Pledge WorksTo accomplish
 this, the goal is to raise $25,000. I’ve created some amazing rewards 
to thank you for your generosity.The StoryFor the last 8 years, 
I’ve had a love affair with Scotch Whisky, exploring its richness and 
complexities. I decided to develop a brand of Scotch Whisky due to a 
debate that was ongoing about the quality of whisky at various social 
events, I was determined to provide some satisfaction and enjoyment of a
 quality drink of Scotch Whisky for future events around the city and 
that is how the birth of Smugglers Proof came to life. Smugglers Proof 
is a unique brand of Scotch Whisky with special packaging. I especially 
love the moment when the brand is introduce to someone and to see the 
wonderful reaction from them. Work ongoing and completed• Carefully selecting an award-winning distiller to create the highest quality product that is completely aligned with the  mission of this brand.• Completed work on designing a modern decanter bottle and packaging.• Securing difficult and stringent approvals in the United States and Canada. • Got a number of approvals. The PlanWith
 your support, we can put SMUGGLERS PROOF Single Malt Scotch Whisky in 
the hands of people worldwide. The project is currently in the final 
stages and we are ready to start bottling our special 15 year and 20 year old Scotch
 Whisky.How Will the Funds be usedThe 
main portion of funds received from our supporters will go towards bottling costs, 
freight and taxes. The goal of this project is for the initial run of 600 bottles. A very aggressive sales 
campaign will begin to make sure the first batch is sold quickly and a 
second larger batch can be ordered and enjoyed. In exchange for your

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Marcos Mendez. This studio has been my dream since I was a kid where I would ""host"" my own radio show from my grandparents home in a South Texas barrio. I would interview my sister, my grandmother, my grandfather, and my aunt...anyone that would let me really.  I would record interviews into a handheld recorder onto analog audio cassettes. I'm ready to move into the digital communication realm and specifically podcasting.</p>
<p>Broken Dam Studio will become the project of a lifelong dream to communicate with a larger audience. We will produce professional podcasts that will highlight stories, music, and ideas that we will share with our networks.</p>
<p>Last year I unsuccessfully attempted to crowd fund a podcast project. This time will be different. I have reevaluated my approach,  researched the art of podcasting, researched equipment needs, and I am attempting to expand the scope of the project but decreasing the funding need. Instead of focusing on one podcast I am moving forward to create an entire podcast NETWORK with a tighter, more reasonable, budget. Together we can make this project a reality.</p>
<p><b><i>""What is a podcast?""</i></b></p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with podcasting and others of you may not. Generally podcasts are ""online radio on-demand."" Podcasts can be listened to using a smartphone app or via a computer or laptop. The medium is relatively new and many media organizations are now turning to podcasts to reach their audience. National Public Radio is a large player in the podcast arena. Shows like This American Life, Snap Judgement, and RadioLab reach large numbers of consumers and podcasting is quickly becoming a preferred vehicle to share information and ideas. </p>
<p><b><i>""Why now? Why podcasts?""</i></b></p>
<p>Today is a very crucial time for podcasting. Podcasters create content that is being shared on social media (Facebook, Twitter, reddit, etc.), video sharing sites (Twitter, Vimeo, etc.), and traditional media outlets like radio and television. From non-ficton, short-form storytelling and old-time radio shows to music shows and science shows the scope and content created through this medium is limitless. </p>
<p>Recently appointed NPR President and CEO Jarl Mohn was recently interviewed by Maria Hinojosa, host of the NPR program Latino USA. He explained that NPR will be focusing heavily on increased diversity in their programming to allow the network to represent our ever evolving society. Broken Dam Studio will be a vehicle to help develop the diverse content and content creators (hosts) that will soon fill a need for natinal companies like NPR and other content seekers.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am seeking <b><i>$1500 to purchase all of the items required to assemble a mobile podcast studio</i></b>. With that $1500 I will purchase the following items:</p> <ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Zoom H5 Digital Recorder</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mackie 1202VLZ4 Audio Mixer</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(3) Dyamic Microphones</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(2) Condenser Microphones</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(3) Boom Microphone Stands</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(3) 6 ft. XLR Microphone Cables</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(2) 3 ft. - 1/8 in. TRS Cables </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(4) Hi-Fi DJ Headphones</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ARTcessories Headphone Amp</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">1-year Website Hosting Membership - Squarspace</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">1-year Podcast Hosting Membership - Libsyn</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Reaper Digital Audio Workspace (Audio Mixing Software)</span></li>
</ul>
<div><b><i>""What will I get for backing the project?""</i></b></div>
<div>Many of the ""perks"" that you will receive are outlined in the <b>PERKS</b> section for this project. However, some of the ""perks"" that you will find there are:</div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Opportunities to guest host a podcast</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Handwritten thank you notes</span><br/>
</li>
<li>swag (t-shirts, koozies)</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">acoustic house concerts</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">...and more</span></li>
</ul>
<div><b><i>""What happens if you don't reach your goal?""</i></b></div>
<div>This is why I've chosen Indiegogo as my crowd funding platform. If I do not reach the goal I will still have access to the funds that you have so generously provided and THE STUDIO WILL SURVIVE. I will use what is raised to get the studio started. The Studio will be paired down to the most important pieces of equipment which are the microphones, the cables, and the podcast hosting site. The other items will be added as soon as I am able to raise enough money to purchase them. We only have 30 days to reach our goal, but I am very confident that we will hit the goal early. When we surpass the goal I can start to review the current equipment list and continue to upgrade the microphones and cables to ensure the best possible recording conditions are available for our content creators. You only have one time to make a flawless impression for the podcast audience. </div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></div>
</div><div> <p>This project impact will be two-fold. First, the Studio will give content creators access to professional level equipment and a commitment from me to provide quality programming. Together we will release content into the ether with the hope that the topics covered will resonate with a large and ever growing population.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Studio will bring recognition to our community and to the unique and talented members of the community. Your stories, your music, your legacy - they can all be shared with the WORLD. </p>
<p>In my research I have found that podcasters that have found their story unique come to realize that there are many other people around the globe that share their sentiments or have similar stories but have never shared it with others. Podcasts and podcast creators give strength to their peers and their community. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Here is an incomplete list of challenges:</span></h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Time: The daily grind has been described by some podcasters as a Sisyphyean  task, but hard work is always worth the effort. Consumers of podcasts - of which I am one - want consistency in their programming. This means that the content must be released in a timely fashion on a set schedule. If they do not stick to the schedule consumers will quickly loose interest and move on to someone else's podcast.</li>
<li>Learning Curve: I have never produced a show or run a studio. But, I've been a musician for the better part of 20 years. I'm a vocalist that also plays guitar and saxophone. While I have only been running sound as a hobby for less than 3 years for local bands and private concerts I'm ready to take on this challenge starting now. Over the last year, In addition to my experience with live sound, I've been studying up on recording techniques and podcast production. I'm well prepared for this project to hit the ground right now.</li>
<li>Marketing: You will be our audience. We need to reach you. This project is the start of a great thing and we will need to use all of our resources to reach each one of the people that will benefit from hearing our podcasters messages. Social media, word-of-mouth, cross-podcast collaboration and many other options will make this project successful.</li>
<li>Content: (New, Fresh, and Exciting) Content is King. We will need to keep our podcasters up-to-date on trends and how their audience is reacting to specific content that they are creating. If we put out stale content, that is not relevant now consumers will drop the podcast and seek out others that are delivering new, fresh, and exciting.</li>

<div>Thank you for checking out my campaign. I hope that my story and my vision is clear in this presentation. If you are able to donate to the campaign I would greatly appreciate it. Know that your donation will be used to strengthen our community and all that live in it. </div>
<div>If you are moved by this project but are unable to donate monetarily does not mean you cannot help me reach my goal. YOU are still an import part of this project. Please share this link on your social media sites and with your friends and relatives.  You can also utilize Indiegogo functionality and share this project with the Indie gogo Share Tools! Each time you share this project I am that much closer to finding a way to make my DREAM a REALITY!</div>
<div>Finally, I've been asked in the past, ""What would you want to be if money was no object?"" I've always answered that I would choose the path of a Travel Channel host. This project is keeping me honest to my answer to that question.</div>
</div><div>I sincerely thank you for your time.</div><div><br/></div><div>-Marcos </div></div>","Short Summary My name is Marcos Mendez. This studio has been my dream since I was a kid where I would ""host"" my own radio show from my grandparents home in a South Texas barrio. I would interview my sister, my grandmother, my grandfather, and my aunt...anyone that would let me really.  I would record interviews into a handheld recorder onto analog audio cassettes. I'm ready to move into the digital communication realm and specifically podcasting.
Broken Dam Studio will become the project of a lifelong dream to communicate with a larger audience. We will produce professional podcasts that will highlight stories, music, and ideas that we will share with our networks.
Last year I unsuccessfully attempted to crowd fund a podcast project. This time will be different. I have reevaluated my approach,  researched the art of podcasting, researched equipment needs, and I am attempting to expand the scope of the project but decreasing the funding need. Instead of focusing on one podcast I am moving forward to create an entire podcast NETWORK with a tighter, more reasonable, budget. Together we can make this project a reality.
""What is a podcast?""
Some of you may be familiar with podcasting and others of you may not. Generally podcasts are ""online radio on-demand."" Podcasts can be listened to using a smartphone app or via a computer or laptop. The medium is relatively new and many media organizations are now turning to podcasts to reach their audience. National Public Radio is a large player in the podcast arena. Shows like This American Life, Snap Judgement, and RadioLab reach large numbers of consumers and podcasting is quickly becoming a preferred vehicle to share information and ideas. 
""Why now? Why podcasts?""
Today is a very crucial time for podcasting. Podcasters create content that is being shared on social media (Facebook, Twitter, reddit, etc.), video sharing sites (Twitter, Vimeo, etc.), and traditional media outlets like radio and television. From non-ficton, short-form storytelling and old-time radio shows to music shows and science shows the scope and content created through this medium is limitless. 
Recently appointed NPR President and CEO Jarl Mohn was recently interviewed by Maria Hinojosa, host of the NPR program Latino USA. He explained that NPR will be focusing heavily on increased diversity in their programming to allow the network to represent our ever evolving society. Broken Dam Studio will be a vehicle to help develop the diverse content and content creators (hosts) that will soon fill a need for natinal companies like NPR and other content seekers.   What We Need & What You Get I am seeking $1500 to purchase all of the items required to assemble a mobile podcast studio. With that $1500 I will purchase the following items: 
Zoom H5 Digital Recorder
Mackie 1202VLZ4 Audio Mixer
(3) Dyamic Microphones
(2) Condenser Microphones
(3) Boom Microphone Stands
(3) 6 ft. XLR Microphone Cables
(2) 3 ft. - 1/8 in. TRS Cables 
(4) Hi-Fi DJ Headphones
ARTcessories Headphone Amp
1-year Website Hosting Membership - Squarspace
1-year Podcast Hosting Membership - Libsyn
Reaper Digital Audio Workspace (Audio Mixing Software)

""What will I get for backing the project?""
Many of the ""perks"" that you will receive are outlined in the PERKS section for this project. However, some of the ""perks"" that you will find there are:

Opportunities to guest host a podcast

Handwritten thank you notes

swag (t-shirts, koozies)
acoustic house concerts
...and more

""What happens if you don't reach your goal?""
This is why I've chosen Indiegogo as my crowd funding platform. If I do not reach the goal I will still have access to the funds that you have so generously provided and THE STUDIO WILL SURVIVE. I will use what is raised to get the studio started. The Studio will be paired down to the most important pieces of equipment which are the microphones, the cables, and the podcast hosting site. The other items will be added as soon as I am able to raise enough money to purchase them. We only have 30 days to reach our goal, but I am very confident that we will hit the goal early. When we surpass the goal I can start to review the current equipment list and continue to upgrade the microphones and cables to ensure the best possible recording conditions are available for our content creators. You only have one time to make a flawless impression for the podcast audience. 
The Impact
 This project impact will be two-fold. First, the Studio will give content creators access to professional level equipment and a commitment from me to provide quality programming. Together we will release content into the ether with the hope that the topics covered will resonate with a large and ever growing population.
Secondly, the Studio will bring recognition to our community and to the unique and talented members of the community. Your stories, your music, your legacy - they can all be shared with the WORLD. 
In my research I have found that podcasters that have found their story unique come to realize that there are many other people around the globe that share their sentiments or have similar stories but have never shared it with others. Podcasts and podcast creators give strength to their peers and their community. 
  Risks & Challenges
Here is an incomplete list of challenges:

Time: The daily grind has been described by some podcasters as a Sisyphyean  task, but hard work is always worth the effort. Consumers of podcasts - of which I am one - want consistency in their programming. This means that the content must be released in a timely fashion on a set schedule. If they do not stick to the schedule consumers will quickly loose interest and move on to someone else's podcast.
Learning Curve: I have never produced a show or run a studio. But, I've been a musician for the better part of 20 years. I'm a vocalist that also plays guitar and saxophone. While I have only been running sound as a hobby for less than 3 years for local bands and private concerts I'm ready to take on this challenge starting now. Over the last year, In addition to my experience with live sound, I've been studying up on recording techniques and podcast production. I'm well prepared for this project to hit the ground right now.
Marketing: You will be our audience. We need to reach you. This project is the start of a great thing and we will need to use all of our resources to reach each one of the people that will benefit from hearing our podcasters messages. Social media, word-of-mouth, cross-podcast collaboration and many other options will make this project successful.
Content: (New, Fresh, and Exciting) Content is King. We will need to keep our podcasters up-to-date on trends and how their audience is reacting to specific content that they are creating. If we put out stale content, that is not relevant now consumers will drop the podcast and seek out others that are delivering new, fresh, and exciting.

We adopted her from the animal shelter near our school with the intention of giving her a better life. It is the shelter's policy to medically evaluate all animals before offering them up for adoption, and to spay the animal before releasing her to adoptive parents. All of this is understandable, but a negligent procedure and poor medical evaluation landed us with one sick kitten.

She had her own room and had 1000x more space to be the curious kitten she is. Lemon Poppyseed loved all the company and attention at our house, even falling asleep amongst her new friends while we had people over. She had normal cycles of energy, giving us both playtime and downtime to enjoy her company in our home. We were a family. </div><div><br/></div><div>A couple days later, a lump formed near her stitches, so we made an appointment at the vet. Poor Blueberry had developed an umbilical hernia, left undiagnosed by the shelter, and another hernia in her stomach that was a direct result of a reckless procedure before her release.

After being at the vet for an hour, we had received a call from the doctor. Muffins would have had only days to live if we did not bring her in. We heard more bad news from the vet- we would need two surgeries. The vet also informed us that Chocolate Chip had a virus, Feline Distemper, that can only be contracted at birth, and that's what the shelter called ""conjunctivitis."" Not only was the vet appalled that she was spayed so young, but was appalled that they would let someone have a new kitten with something that could kill them within a week.

So we decided to be the changes we wanted see in our country. This will be a dream come true for us, and it will advocate a new approach to life, spread kindness and love of animals throughout an entire society. The main goal of our restaurant is to foster the increase of conscience in our society in every way possible. It will also act as a supporter and promoter to carry out different programs by Armenian vegans, bring about any events on vegan matter and charity acts for free.VEGIT'S KITCHENThe basis of our kitchen is not only vegan food but we also emphasize the art of eating ecologically clean food. Our food sources will only be fresh products from local farmers. The cooking will never be done through any unhealthy means, such as microwaving, frying, etc. Following the saying “you are what you eat,” the aim of our cuisine is to make the new developing cells of our costumers cleaner through our healthy and kind food. Our kitchen will be so tasty that even non vegans will love to visit us and have a satisfying and fulfilling meal that will provide them with energy and good mood. WHY YOU SHOULD HELP USWe have already successfully established and developed the most active and the biggest stray animals protection organization in Armenia. We created it from nothing and now it is spreading love towards animals in the conscience of our society day by day. Through the last eleven years, this idea has ripen, and now we are ready to realize it. The biggest aim of our project is to share the idea and culture of a healthy life, and the beauty of human-animal relationship.WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT Having written a very detailed business plan, we found out that we need $60.000 to begin the project. We have raised $20.000 ourselves and have won $10.000 from the Small and Medium Entrepreneurship Development Nation Centre in Armenia as the best beginner business project. Right now we are missing only $30.000.By donating even the smallest amount, you will support a whole country to support the vegan movement and have the first veggie eating corner.  Your name will be on the thank you list of those, who will always be remembered as the supporters of the biggest and first vegan project in Armenia.                                 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME                                             LIVE HAPPY AND HEALTHY                                                                     :)",3.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p>My name is Patrick Joyce, I'm a father of three, an inventor, and I have MND/ALS. <br/></p><p>The eyedrivomatic project aims to give independent
mobility back to electric wheelchair users who thought they had lost
it forever. A combination of software and hardware, eyedrivomatic
allows users to control their wheelchairs using only their eyes. It
is an entirely open project, meaning that all the plans and software
will be available free online, for anyone to use - the idea being,
that a non technical person, without special skills or tools, could
build one themselves for under £100. Eyedrivomatic is now at the
working prototype stage. It works really well - but could be so much
better.  It has been funded thus far by myself, but now I'm looking
for funding to take it to the next stage.</p>
<p><b>Where will your money go? </b>
</p>
<p>This whole project is not for profit, and all the
team members are unpaid volunteers. The money will mostly go on 3d
printing supplies and electronic parts. Both the hardware and the
eyegaze reliability need improving, which will use a lot of 3d
printing plastic. Also, we want to make four more eyedrivomatic
prototypes, so we can enlist four more MND sufferers as product
testers. When the prototypes are as good as they can be, we will
publish everything online. At that point we will need to publicise
the project – because eyedrivomatic can't help anybody if they
don't know it's available. To prepare for this, we want to get
eyedrivomatic t-shirts made for the team members to wear for
appearing in promotional videos. 
</p>
<p><b>How it all began... </b>
</p>
<p>I was hit with the initial idea in 2013, and am
leading the project. I have an electric wheelchair, and an eyegaze
system for controlling my computer, both provided by the NHS. Eyegaze
technology is only intended for operating a computer and
communicating, not for driving the chair. So when you lose the use of
your hands, you are expected to rely on carers if you want to move
anywhere. I found that idea extremely dispiriting, and resolved to do
something about it. 
</p>
<p>As I don't actually own either the wheelchair or
the eyegaze equipment, my solution was to make something that would
interface with the wheelchair mounted computer and physically move
the wheelchair's joystick. Crucially this would mean not making any
modifications to the loaned hardware, and could work with any
wheelchair and eyegaze combination.</p>
<p>The eyedrivomatic system is made up of two parts,
an 'electronic hand' which fits over the wheelchairs joystick, and a
'brain box' containing the electronic workings. The brain box
receives it's instructions from software on the pc - which the user
controls with their eyes. The brain box then talks to the electronic
hand, which has two servo motors that physically move the joystick. 
</p>
<p>To really make a difference, it needs to be cheap,
and fairly easy for people to construct themselves. In an ideal world
it will end up as an inexpensive manufactured product as well,
something we  aim to pursue later on. I also want to investigate the
possibility of using a web cam to track eye movement for people
without access to eyegaze.</p>
<p>Eyedrivomatic has the potential to help thousands
of people at a bleak period in their lives. And it's not just MND/ALS
sufferers either. Any quadriplegic with control of their eyes would
benefit. With adequate funding we can perfect eyedrivomatic within a
couple of months and get it out to the people who need it. Any money
raised over our target will go to improving the system further and
providing eyedrivomatic systems to people in need. Please help us. 
</p>
<p>We are also interested to hear from any disabled
eyegaze users who would like to get involved with the project. If you
would like to get an eyedrivomatic system, or just want to help, then
let us know. People with 3d printers or programming skills would be
particularly welcomed.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Setup is easy. Staying connected is even easier.</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Presence Pro Care is an unobtrusive way to help your loved ones enjoy the comfort of their own home, while still feeling connected and cared for.</p>
<p>People are living longer, and nobody wants to end up in assisted living or a nursing home.  Seniors prefer to stay in the comfort of their own home and maintain their independence and way of life.  As this becomes increasingly difficult with age or chronic illness, seniors need a simple, cost-effective technology solution that can help them and their children, caregivers, and loved ones.</p>
<h4>Presence Pro Care offers three main categories of services:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Connecting devices that detect emergencies, protect the home, and track medication.</li>
<li>Organizing ""trusted circles"" of caregivers to help those in need.</li>
<li>Sharing precious moments with live video calls, photos, and videos through the optional Presence Camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research shows that caregivers can significantly extend and improve their loved one's quality of life by helping them maintain a regimen of eating, sleeping, moving, and taking medications.  You don’t have to do it alone.  Delaying or preventing the move to an assisted living facility can save families hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><i>“Presence has already delivered over 37 million Video Alerts to make homes more safe and secure.  Now we’re asking the user community to help us extend our technology to support one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, which is how to care for the people who cared the most for us,”</i> said Gene Wang, CEO and co-founder of People Power. <i>“The innovative capabilities of Presence Pro Care will enable seniors to maintain independence and extend the quality of life in their own homes, while offering family members and caregivers greater flexibility and peace of mind.""</i></p>

<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: How do I talk with my loved one about installing a solution like Presence Pro Care?  <br/>A: </b>We know firsthand that having this conversation with your aging loved ones can be awkward and difficult.  Presence Pro Care doubles as a security system for the home, and this is how most beta users framed it for their loved ones.</p>
<p>As a modern security system, Presence will protect your home while you're out and about.  On top of this cutting-edge security system, seniors will be interested in the fact that Presence Pro Care adds a connected pill dispenser, an emergency response button, and 24/7 professional monitoring for protection, without sacrificing privacy.</p>
<p><b>Q: How easy is it to install Presence Pro Care?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Extremely easy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the Presence app to your smartphone and sign in.</li>
<li>Tap the ""Add Device"" button and scan the QR code on the back of your gateway.  Plug your gateway in to ethernet and USB power.  A video plays in the app showing what to do next, while the gateway automatically enters pairing mode.</li>
<li>Pull the battery tab on a sensor and wait for 10 seconds.  The sensor will pair automatically to the gateway.  You will be asked what the sensor will be used for, and the app will guide you through the installation process.</li>
<li>Peel off the sticky backing on the sensor and place the sensor where you want it to go.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: How many sensors can a single gateway support?</b><br/><b>A:</b> 25</p>
<p><b>Q: How many caregivers can I invite to my caregiver network?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Unlimited.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do the Ambient Fall Detection analytics work?</b><br/><b>A:</b>  Presence Pro Care uses data from the motion, touch, and entry sensors to detect occupant activity and location information over time.  The system uses this data to learn the activity patterns of the occupant.  Anomalous periods of inactivity may trigger an alert to caregivers and professional monitoring services, as this may indicate that an accident (e.g., a fall) has occurred.  With Presence Pro Care, these <i>Ambient Fall Detection</i> analytics serve as a safety net in case the senior cannot reach the Emergency Button or a phone to call for help.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: How does the 24/7 professional monitoring work?</b><br/><b>A:</b>  When Presence Pro Care detects something in the home that looks like a serious problem, the caregivers and professional monitoring service are contacted.  The professional monitoring service will notify a call tree of people you provide in the app, and if the problem can't be resolved directly, local emergency services will be notified.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: Can I add multiple gateways to my home?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Absolutely.  Your Presence app supports unlimited devices and gateways.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can you add ZigBee or Z-Wave Sensors, or just ""Presence"" Sensors?</b><br/><b>A:</b> The current gateway supports ZigBee Green Power and ZigBee Home Automation, and can connect many different types of devices that already exist in the market.  The Presence user interface and rules are layered on top of those devices, so new devices are usually brought into the app under careful quality assurance to offer the best experience for our users.  The Presence app and the cloud software that powers it connect to many other devices, clouds, and protocols.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the wireless range of the sensors?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Our range testing shows about 2-3x the performance of WiFi.  We are consistently seeing about 130+ feet indoors, through 4 walls.  In the same test, WiFi connected about 30-60 feet through 2 walls.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the lifetime of the batteries? What type of batteries? Does the motion sensor need to be connected to a power source?</b><br/><b>A:</b> The sensors are extremely low power and are expected to last 2 to 5 years on batteries, depending on use.  Most sensors use a CR2032 Lithium coin cell battery, which makes them small and unobtrusive.  This battery has a shelf life of 10+ years. The motion sensor uses 2 AA batteries.</p>

<p><b>Q: Will I be able to purchase individual sensors?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Yes.  We will be offering sensors for individual purchase on the Presence store at <a href=""http://presencepro.com/store."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://presencepro.com/store.</a></p>
<p><b>Q: Can the Presence app installed on your primary phone detect when you leave the house and automatically arm all the sensors?</b><br/><b>A:</b> Yes, geofencing will enable Presence to detect when you're Home, Away, or on Vacation.</p>

</div></div>","Why Presence Pro Care?


Caring for our loved ones is one of the most important things we will ever do. However, being a caregiver can be tough.  Most caregivers live over 100 miles away from the loved one they care for.  On average, professional care services cost between $112 - $205 per day!  As we enter the holiday season and spend time with the people we love, we realize the need for a better solution.
People Power provides the best at-home monitoring solution for caregivers, so they can be connected to the one they care for.  With Presence Pro Care, an aging family member or sick loved one can maintain independence, while caregivers know everything is ok from anywhere in the world.  
Presence Pro Care protects loved ones in multiple ways.  A Caregiver Circle is formed in the app to connect multiple caregivers to the person being cared for.  Wireless activity sensors are unobtrusively placed inside the senior's home, without invading the occupant's privacy and without drilling holes.  Our Ambient Fall Detection system will learn daily living patterns from the activity sensors, to alert both the caregivers and 24/7 emergency response services (U.S. only) if those patterns break unexpectedly.  Ambient Fall Detection analytics are a great backup for the Emergency Button, which can be pressed to call for help directly inside the home.  The connected Pill Dispenser will remind the senior and caregivers when medicine needs to be taken.  Additional home activity and safety sensors act like a security system when no one is home, giving the senior peace of mind when out of the house.
Some caregivers want Internet-connected cameras so they can see and interact with their loved ones directly.  Presence Pro Care has the award-winning best solution for this:  spare smartphones and tablets can be transformed into Presence Cameras!  You gather as many spare smartphones or tablets as you want (with no cellular plan required!), and Presence securely turns them into Internet-connected cameras.  When sitting idle, Presence Cameras will become digital picture frames, allowing caregivers to push and share meaningful memories with the ones they love.Requirements:
The senior's home should have Internet access with a Wi-Fi access point.
The caregivers must have a smartphone capable of running the Presence app. Presence is compatible with Android 4.0 and newer, and iOS 6.0 and newer.  Download the app free from the Apple App Store or Google Play.

Presence Pro Care offers three main categories of services:

Connecting devices that detect emergencies, protect the home, and track medication.
Organizing ""trusted circles"" of caregivers to help those in need.
Sharing precious moments with live video calls, photos, and videos through the optional Presence Camera.

Research shows that caregivers can significantly extend and improve their loved one's quality of life by helping them maintain a regimen of eating, sleeping, moving, and taking medications.  You don’t have to do it alone.  Delaying or preventing the move to an assisted living facility can save families hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“Presence has already delivered over 37 million Video Alerts to make homes more safe and secure.  Now we’re asking the user community to help us extend our technology to support one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, which is how to care for the people who cared the most for us,” said Gene Wang, CEO and co-founder of People Power. “The innovative capabilities of Presence Pro Care will enable seniors to maintain independence and extend the quality of life in their own homes, while offering family members and caregivers greater flexibility and peace of mind.""

Here's what people have been saying about Presence:














FAQ
Q: How do I talk with my loved one about installing a solution like Presence Pro Care?  A: We know firsthand that having this conversation with your aging loved ones can be awkward and difficult.  Presence Pro Care doubles as a security system for the home, and this is how most beta users framed it for their loved ones.
As a modern security system, Presence will protect your home while you're out and about.  On top of this cutting-edge security system, seniors will be interested in the fact that Presence Pro Care adds a connected pill dispenser, an emergency response button, and 24/7 professional monitoring for protection, without sacrificing privacy.
Q: How easy is it to install Presence Pro Care?A: Extremely easy.

Download the Presence app to your smartphone and sign in.
Tap the ""Add Device"" button and scan the QR code on the back of your gateway.  Plug your gateway in to ethernet and USB power.  A video plays in the app showing what to do next, while the gateway automatically enters pairing mode.
Pull the battery tab on a sensor and wait for 10 seconds.  The sensor will pair automatically to the gateway.  You will be asked what the sensor will be used for, and the app will guide you through the installation process.
Peel off the sticky backing on the sensor and place the sensor where you want it to go.

Q: How many sensors can a single gateway support?A: 25
Q: How many caregivers can I invite to my caregiver network?A: Unlimited.
Q: How do the Ambient Fall Detection analytics work?A:  Presence Pro Care uses data from the motion, touch, and entry sensors to detect occupant activity and location information over time.  The system uses this data to learn the activity patterns of the occupant.  Anomalous periods of inactivity may trigger an alert to caregivers and professional monitoring services, as this may indicate that an accident (e.g., a fall) has occurred.  With Presence Pro Care, these Ambient Fall Detection analytics serve as a safety net in case the senior cannot reach the Emergency Button or a phone to call for help.
Q: How does the 24/7 professional monitoring work?A:  When Presence Pro Care detects something in the home that looks like a serious problem, the caregivers and professional monitoring service are contacted.  The professional monitoring service will notify a call tree of people you provide in the app, and if the problem can't be resolved directly, local emergency services will be notified.
Q: Can I add multiple gateways to my home?A: Absolutely.  Your Presence app supports unlimited devices and gateways.
Q: Can you add ZigBee or Z-Wave Sensors, or just ""Presence"" Sensors?A: The current gateway supports ZigBee Green Power and ZigBee Home Automation, and can connect many different types of devices that already exist in the market.  The Presence user interface and rules are layered on top of those devices, so new devices are usually brought into the app under careful quality assurance to offer the best experience for our users.  The Presence app and the cloud software that powers it connect to many other devices, clouds, and protocols.
Q: What is the wireless range of the sensors?A: Our range testing shows about 2-3x the performance of WiFi.  We are consistently seeing about 130+ feet indoors, through 4 walls.  In the same test, WiFi connected about 30-60 feet through 2 walls.
Q: What is the lifetime of the batteries? What type of batteries? Does the motion sensor need to be connected to a power source?A: The sensors are extremely low power and are expected to last 2 to 5 years on batteries, depending on use.  Most sensors use a CR2032 Lithium coin cell battery, which makes them small and unobtrusive.  This battery has a shelf life of 10+ years. The motion sensor uses 2 AA batteries.
See http://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4421334/2/Long-Live-Coin-Cells--Getting-years-of-battery-life-from-small-batteries-in-low-power-devices
Q: Will I be able to purchase individual sensors?A: Yes.  We will be offering sensors for individual purchase on the Presence store at http://presencepro.com/store.
Q: Can the Presence app installed on your primary phone detect when you leave the house and automatically arm all the sensors?A: Yes, geofencing will enable Presence to detect when you're Home, Away, or on Vacation.
Q: I'm a developer. Can I connect my own gadgets to Presence?A: Absolutely.  Sign up at http://fabrux.peoplepowerco.com to learn how to connect your own devices into Presence, and customize your own device UI's. Connectivity is free for developers and manufacturers.


Q: When are you shipping?A: We're currently on schedule for delivery in May 2016.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi My Name is Rob i'm the owner of Tranzmission Planet Radio. Ive spent the last 12 years working in the broadcasting industry in both corporate radio and for the last 4 years as the operator of a community run internet radio station. What we're trying to accomplish at Tramzmission Planet is to create a platform of discovery and promotion thats free for unsigned musicians and independent labels.We believe that the heart and soul of the music industry is the innovative music that comes from the Indie community. With your help we can build this platform and community to help expose and promote all the great music that gets ignored or under played by other broadcasters. With your help we can build this and ensure that there will always be a home and a voice for the indie music community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At Tranzmission Planet we try to utilize as much free technology as we can to create our platform but unfortunatley for as ""thrifty"" as we try to be things just cost money.</p>
<p>The money we raise will help us purchase new (or refurbished to save money) computers as well as the broadcasting sofware we use to create what we hope will be some entertaining and engageing programming. We try to recycle as much technology as we can to save money but unfortunately the things we cant get cheaply are also the things that are vital for us to broadcast our stations, Money raised will also be used to help pay for our operational costs like the internet and our electric. In addition to the things listed above we will need to promote our station and  like our love of free technology we love free promotion but we will have to spend some money to promote ourselves (and by default Indie music) effectively. We are currently operating in a borrowed unheated attic (play sad violin music here) eventually we would like to move into a small rental space so the money raised now will help to expedite that goal. Finally every dollar we raise helps us to launch new stations so we can create new genre based channels to better promote the indie music community.</p>
<p>PERKS!</p>
<p>Every person who contribute will be put on our WALL OF FAME on our website so you will always be on the roster of people who support us and the indie music you love. For everybody who donates $25 or more we also have stickers. If you donate more money we will record you so we can put your voice into our programming as a ""liner"" or maybe you want to sponsor our programming for $500 we will create ""your name presents"" programming, this is a great way to get some low dollar promotions for you, your business or organization.</p>
<p>Our Goal is 15 thousand dollars but all money raised immediatly goes to getting as many stations on the air as we can, No money raised will be used to buy unnessary equipment or be used for ""payroll"".</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to launch our First station on January 1st 2013 so we can kick off the new year with some great music. By having a Radio Network that plays Indie music exclusivley we hope that helps to level the playing field so that smaller indie labels and unsigned musicians have a dedicated service to help them promote themselves and grow their fanbase. Indie music and indie broadcasting need each other so this is our part to further the cause.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that money is tight but if you want to help us create this platform of discovery help us promote Tranzmission Planet Radio. We have a Facebook community in place to help promote us as well as any projects you are working on or maybe you can tell any musicians you know to submit their music to us so we can get it on the air.</p>
<p>Dont forget Indiegogo has some great tools to help ""share"" us across the internet.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping us out. Please check out our Facebook page(s) and our Website for more information.</p>

Our Goal is 15 thousand dollars but all money raised immediatly goes to getting as many stations on the air as we can, No money raised will be used to buy unnessary equipment or be used for ""payroll"".


The Impact
We want to launch our First station on January 1st 2013 so we can kick off the new year with some great music. By having a Radio Network that plays Indie music exclusivley we hope that helps to level the playing field so that smaller indie labels and unsigned musicians have a dedicated service to help them promote themselves and grow their fanbase. Indie music and indie broadcasting need each other so this is our part to further the cause.


Other Ways You Can Help
We know that money is tight but if you want to help us create this platform of discovery help us promote Tranzmission Planet Radio. We have a Facebook community in place to help promote us as well as any projects you are working on or maybe you can tell any musicians you know to submit their music to us so we can get it on the air.
Dont forget Indiegogo has some great tools to help ""share"" us across the internet.
Thank you so much for helping us out. Please check out our Facebook page(s) and our Website for more information.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em>John Keto was raised on a farm near Lake Sylvia. He knew that he wanted to one day own a piece of land there. In the early 1930’s that dream was realized.

<p>Dear Patron:<br/><br/>A New Beginning Foster Family Agency is a 501C3 Non-Profit California Corporation that was established five years ago. The Agency serves the needs of abused and neglected children that are adjudicated as Dependents of the Juvenile Court from San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Foster children of all ages from ages from birth to twenty-one. The Agency's specialty is the focus on teens including the following: Child Abuse (Physical, Sexual and Emotional), Neglect, Abandonment, or come from families where Substance Abuse and incarceration is commonplace.</p>
<p>The Agency would like to request your help for our foster children by asking you and/or your company to give a donation. Your contribution of just $5, $10, $20 or more will help foster children. Donations of clothing, baby items, educational toys, electronic games, books, school supplies, gift certificates, computers, financial donations, etc., are also welcomed. All donations made to the Agency on behalf of the foster children are Tax Deductible and the Agency provides you and/or your company with an official receipt letter. The Agency will list the names of everyone who donated in the Annual Christmas Party’s Program Guide.<br/><br/>The Agency’s focus is teenagers and teenage mothers/fathers. The Agency focuses on teenagers because most teenagers in Foster Care are not reunified with their families due to their families not completing their court ordered Treatment Plan. At times, extended family members are able to have the foster children placed with them, but some foster children cannot be placed with extended family members due to the extended family members either not being able to pass the required background check or they don’t have the financial means to care for the foster children. As a result, many foster children end up remaining in the Agency until they are eighteen or nineteen years-old (foster children who have not finished high school can remain in Foster Care until they are nineteen years-old).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially, when children are placed into Foster Care, it is under a case plan of Reunification and their families have approximately a year and a half to complete their court ordered Treatment Plan. The Agency provides trained supervised visitation monitors for court ordered visits at the Agency, Children and Family Services, at a park or a restaurant. During the Reunification process, if the families do not complete their court ordered Treatment Plan within the time limit, the case plan may be changed either to Legal Guardianship, Adoption or Non Relative Placement. All Certified Foster Parents in the Agency are given the first choice of having the foster children permanently remain in their home under one of these case plans when this occurs. Over the past five years, several of the Certified Foster Parents in the Agency have become Legal Guardians, Adoptive Parents and Non Relative Placement Parents over the past four years and have provided nurturing and caring homes for many foster children of all ages, especially teenagers.<br/><br/>The Agency is committed toward providing the necessary services and activities needed for the foster children in placement. The services provided include Tutoring, College Preparation, Independent Living Program, Process Groups, Anger Management Classes, Teen Parenting Classes, Substance Abuse Classes, Therapy and Crisis Intervention. The Agency provides clothing for all foster children placed; as most often; the foster children are placed with only the clothing they are wearing at the time. The Agency provides transportation to and from court hearings and visits. The Agency gives $200 to foster children who graduate from High School and help with submitting paperwork for college grants and scholarships. There have been several foster children who went on to college and vocational schools, as well as securing jobs in the community. The Agency also provides an Annual Summer activity, with the input of the foster children (where they want to go and what they would like to do), an Annual Thanksgiving Dinner in which the foster children and their biological parents have a formal dinner and celebrate and an Annual Christmas party in which, the foster children dress in formal wear and invite their families to sit down dinner, so that they can celebrate Christmas with them and the Agency provides all of the food, music and gifts. The services provided are educational and recreational, so that all foster children can be taught appropriate social and coping skills necessary to lead normal healthy lives, even though they are removed from their families and placed into Foster Care.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the numbers listed above or on my cell phone: 760-508-3629. Thank you for your time, consideration and support.<br/><br/>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>What is the back story to Geek Out (Maid &amp; Cosplay) Cafe?</h3>
<p>I'm a young geek girl who is very passionate about a ton of things. Cosplay, food, and community. I was raised with Star Wars, Star Trek, Pokemon, Dragon Ball Z, computers, Mario, Nintendo, Play Station. Anything of that caliber has always been a HUGE part of my life. I came up with the idea for a cosplay cafe one day, when I was thinking about the perfect place to eat. The perfect place for geeks to eat. Somewhere they can pull out their Magic cards, and have a match. A place they can safely LARP (which is live-action roleplaying), without the judgmental eyes of others. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Or maybe just a place that served delicious food to a few individuals who wanted a super awesome dining experience. I want to bring together the community with something everyone can enjoy, whether or not they indulge in hobbies of the nerdy kind. I want a place that a customer can walk into, and feel welcomed, and loved. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>But what is cosplay? And what is a ""maid cafe""?</b></p>
<p> Cosplay is shortened term for ""costume play"", considered a theatre art where people wear costumes and accessories to represent a certain character from a variety of sources (books, comics, tv shows, manga, anime, etc).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A maid cafe is technically a cosplay themed restaurant, where the employees dress in elegant maid uniforms and butler garb. The whole idea behind it is to create a different kind of atmosphere, that you usually do not see that often in American dining. The employees interact with the guests in a friendly manner, and they play board games with them, or just discuss anything that could be recent news of interest to the guest. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What makes this so much different from the next cafe?</b></p>
<p>Geek Out Cafe isn't just my dream. It's every single person who has always just wanted a place to belong's dream. I want to reach out to my local community, and help people get recognized for their talents. It would feature art from local artists, the music playing in the background would be that from a band that usually played only in their garage. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We would soon feature an after school program, to help get children off the streets and doing something positive. I myself, love children, they are our future generation, and they need to be nurtured and nourished, so they grow. Every week we would feature or highlight an activity, idea, thought, a dream, whatever the case, and learn more about it. Sometimes, people would come in and do guest-speaking. If you're a con goer and enjoy panels, think of it like that. A lot of hands on learning that not only gives your children something to do for an afternoon, is fun for adults as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On weekends, for dinner, we would throw on short skits/shows for entertainment with help from the local thespians.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I plan to cater to everyone-- be it vegans, vegetarians, and people with allergies. I plan to buy local, support local, and never accept less than the best.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My small community of people, consisting of the nerdy bookworm, the socially awkward video gamer, the kid who wears wild wigs to school-- they all need a place to go, where they can feel safe, and not judged by the rest of society. I've discussed this with a lot of people, and everyone is already backing me 100%. To see this happen, would just be such a dream come true. I would like to hope, that Geek Out Cafe can bring the people of my city/surrounding areas come together, the way it should be.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we can make this happen, I would be sure that I gave back to the community 110%. Donating to charities, schools,and hospitals would only just be the start, and it would just increase as Geek Out Cafe increased. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to raise at least 5,000 dollars. This would cover the basics. Kitchen equipment (the stove and fridge I am looking at are about 1,000 right there) A first month's rent(another 1k), business permit and licensing fees(about 500$) food supplies (ranging from 500$+) and any other small kind of purchases needed to get this on the road. If my goal is not reached, the money will still be used to kick start Geek Out Cafe gear, and going into a savings fund. Geek Out Cafe is going to happen, no matter how long it takes! I am certain of this. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've already explained what Geek Out Cafe is, but by helping make it happen, you get some cool stuff too! Tees, bags, bracelets, comic books, you know, cool stuff. :D</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know the times are hard, but if you don't have A LOT of extra money floating around in your pocket, a dollar goes a long way. If 5,000 people just donate, ONE DOLLAR, we can make this happen. Skip the Mickey D's Sweet Tea just this once (I know, we love their Sweet Tea), and put it to a slightly better cause (even though your thirst is important too). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know a lot of people have huge doubts in this, in me. And I really need some supporters and funders to prove everyone wrong. Remember, this isn't just about me. It's about all of us. So maybe if you know some cool cats who love helping out the little guy, write on their facebook, send them an email, and maybe even tell them about Geek Out Cafe and why they donate to such a great cause like this one.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Every little bit counts, and without you guys, we can't make this happen. Thank you, thank you, so much for every little donation.</p>

It would feature art from local artists, the music playing in the background would be that from a band that usually played only in their garage. 

We would soon feature an after school program, to help get children off the streets and doing something positive. I myself, love children, they are our future generation, and they need to be nurtured and nourished, so they grow. Every week we would feature or highlight an activity, idea, thought, a dream, whatever the case, and learn more about it. Sometimes, people would come in and do guest-speaking. If you're a con goer and enjoy panels, think of it like that. A lot of hands on learning that not only gives your children something to do for an afternoon, is fun for adults as well.

On weekends, for dinner, we would throw on short skits/shows for entertainment with help from the local thespians.

I plan to cater to everyone-- be it vegans, vegetarians, and people with allergies. I plan to buy local, support local, and never accept less than the best.

The Impact
My small community of people, consisting of the nerdy bookworm, the socially awkward video gamer, the kid who wears wild wigs to school-- they all need a place to go, where they can feel safe, and not judged by the rest of society. I've discussed this with a lot of people, and everyone is already backing me 100%. To see this happen, would just be such a dream come true. I would like to hope, that Geek Out Cafe can bring the people of my city/surrounding areas come together, the way it should be.

If we can make this happen, I would be sure that I gave back to the community 110%. Donating to charities, schools,and hospitals would only just be the start, and it would just increase as Geek Out Cafe increased. 


What We Need & What You Get
I would like to raise at least 5,000 dollars. This would cover the basics. Kitchen equipment (the stove and fridge I am looking at are about 1,000 right there) A first month's rent(another 1k), business permit and licensing fees(about 500$) food supplies (ranging from 500$+) and any other small kind of purchases needed to get this on the road. If my goal is not reached, the money will still be used to kick start Geek Out Cafe gear, and going into a savings fund. Geek Out Cafe is going to happen, no matter how long it takes! I am certain of this. 

I've already explained what Geek Out Cafe is, but by helping make it happen, you get some cool stuff too! Tees, bags, bracelets, comic books, you know, cool stuff. :D


Other Ways You Can Help
I know the times are hard, but if you don't have A LOT of extra money floating around in your pocket, a dollar goes a long way. If 5,000 people just donate, ONE DOLLAR, we can make this happen. Skip the Mickey D's Sweet Tea just this once (I know, we love their Sweet Tea), and put it to a slightly better cause (even though your thirst is important too). 

I know a lot of people have huge doubts in this, in me. And I really need some supporters and funders to prove everyone wrong. Remember, this isn't just about me. It's about all of us. So maybe if you know some cool cats who love helping out the little guy, write on their facebook, send them an email, and maybe even tell them about Geek Out Cafe and why they donate to such a great cause like this one.

Every little bit counts, and without you guys, we can't make this happen. Thank you, thank you, so much for every little donation.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><b>Our Experience</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last 20 years, my brother Matt and I have
lived in the greater Grand Rapids area, enjoying what this ""best kept secret"" of a city has to offer.  Now it's time to give back to the place that has for so long enriched our lives.  Here's how, with a little back story to go with it.</p>
<p>In
the summer of 2007, we spent a majority of our time heavily involved in the
pomp and circumstance of friends and loved ones getting married.  I can think of a whole list of adjectives to describe that promise those people make to each other before God.</p>
<p>How about Exciting?  Perhaps terrifying.  Uplifting, encouraging, emotional, heartfelt, wondrous!  The list goes on.  With each wedding came a recurring observation made by my brother Matt and I.  If this day is so highly valued.  If this moment is so connected with who we are and who we are to become...then this day must happen in a place worthy of its grandeur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Time and time again we spoke with people who were frustrated by
the lack of unique venues in Grand Rapids.  <span>People want to break free from these places that
haven't
changed their formula in a decade.  They want a place that breaks the mold.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Having been in the DJ business and wedding industry for over a decade; many clients told us they wanted more in a venue. We set out to build something that reignites the excitement and pride of a wedding day; or any event for that matter.</p>
<p>Something that elevates the standard of excellence.  A place with a purpose to beautify West Michigan.</p>
<p>Brixton
Way is a dream formed from years of research and development in events
and ceremony services.  It will be an indoor and outdoor events center that will be
unmatched in beauty and elegance.  We are redefining what an event center is.  We are offering to construct a place worthy of your day. Join with us in this dream. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Okay, the quick synopsis:</p>
<p>Brixton Way is, first and foremost, a multi-purpose outdoor event center catering
specifically to guests with parties of 250 guests or less.  This
is the venue for social gatherings, community events, family reunions, Wedding
receptions/ceremonies, company gatherings, live band performances etc.  Brixton Way will borrow some of its design framework from the Victorian era. Think 19th century English Estates.</p>
<p>The
primary building will consist of a 100’x40’ pavilion structure with attached
walking paths that will lead to bathroom facilities, pampering rooms, and a catering prep area. 
The key aesthetics of the center will be its cobblestone patio, gas light path and Victorian era inspired Grand Hall.  Some of the key amenities are the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cobblestone paths</li>
<li>Wooded Trails circling the
     property</li>
<li>Gas light pathway leading to Grand Hall Entrance</li>
<li>Water gardens</li>
<li>Stone Archways</li>
<li>Marble Fountains</li>
<li>Stone Fire Pits</li>
<li>Horse Drawn Carriage Rides</li>
<li>Reflection pond</li>

<div>We weren't kidding when we said we have spent the last few years working on this project.  We partnered with the Small Business Administration to gather our demographic research and start formulating a design that is specifically catered to you.  With years of experience as a successful DJ company, we took notes on what people expect and what features are lacking in most event venues.<br/><br/>Above all, we began to understand that our customers want options.  </div>
<div>
<i>Just because my reception is indoors, why can people only dance inside?  Can we move the dancing outside?  Can we move the whole party inside if it starts to rain?  I want to enjoy the sunset!  I want to feel the cool Michigan breeze against my face as I pour another glass of wine.  </i><br/><br/>First off if that last sentence is true, by golly you have come to the right place!</div>
<div>From the moment you set foot on the Brixton property, the experience begins.  A cobblestone path warmly welcomes you on your trip towards the Grand Hall, Gas lights burning brightly to help guide the way.  The Grand Hall is large in scale, yet warmly welcomes you in to enjoy its inner beauty; as if you are walking into an old English manor.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>What about the ceremony? It is after all one of the most intimate moments a couple can share on their special day. <br/><br/>At Brixton, we have invested a large amount of time into the design of the courtyard that will accommodate this very important part of the celebration. The idea is to find a balance between beauty and space. How much is too much? How many people can we comfortably fit into this place and how do we design the space so that it is decorative and yet not obtrusive? <br/><br/>From the beginning of this endeavor, Matt and I agreed that we want this place to feel elegant but not overwhelming. The outdoor courtyard will consist of cobblestone flooring with a seating capacity of just over 200. The inner walls will be landscaped with various plants and decor to make you feel as if you are in a “secret garden"" nestled deep within the walls of the manor.  Secret, yet open and inviting to a warm breeze that may just find its way to your ceremony.<p></p> </div><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/700980/files/20140707183134-10368300_672964812792110_7839183584363989265_o.jpg?1404783094"" src="""" style=""width: 599.290187891441px; height: 463px;""/></p></div><div>
<p>The whole idea is multi-purpose.  Let's say the weather on your wedding day is downright beautiful.  Why would you waste your evening inside?  Let's move the tables out of the courtyard, roll the bar out and tell the DJ we're dancing under a Michigan sunset!</p>
<p>Looks like rain?  Well that's okay too, because the Grand hall<b> </b>can fit everyone comfortably and keep out the rain with retractable walls.  Our interior is just as beautiful as the exterior.  The wooden beams allow for easy placement of any decoration and will boast an overhead heating system to keep guests warm if it gets too cold out there. </p>

<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Their has been a passionate fire that has been burning in the hearts and minds of Grand Rapids folk for a while now.  As a guy with a film production background, I have seen more videos go viral for GR than anything else.  Whether it's an underdog story about a micro-brewery or a simple lifestyle piece that shows off GR in all of it's cultural glory, we want to be a part of it.</p>

<h3>Progress to date</h3>
<p>So far, we have crafted and fine-tuned the business plan, polished
the financial projections and purchased a nine acre parcel of land that we hope
to be the future location of Brixton Way.<br/><br/>We have been busy working
with our planning and engineering team to create a site-plan for the nine
acres. It will include every specific detail as far as building location,
trail paths and how we will create and utilize a rolling
landscape to accommodate the gardens. Within the next few weeks from this campaign launch, we will
be submitting this plan to the planning commission  in
hopes of getting the green light to start building.</p>
<p>Aside from polishing the site plan; we have also started the
process of taking our vision and engineering it into a blueprint

nuggets in your pan! Well you can now even in your home, and you could 
find more gold then the 100% real gold containing pay dirt mined from 
area claims and shipped to your door! From the miner into packaging to 
your door! Guaranteed gold and sometimes even a profit on your purchase!
A desire to be free of monthly ssdi payments and help employ a few other
 disabled individuals I took a hobby and turned it into a business. 
Starting with nothing we managed to lay down a foundation despite the 
odds for a start-up with no funding available.</p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><h2>
                            What future are we creating?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Two different futures are being made possible here, one a way for
 disabled individuals whom desire to be able to return to work despite 
limitations but need a job with very flexile conditions and 
understanding employers to help cope and provide conditions
 that ables them to perform regardless of physical limitations. This 
allows a disabled and unemployed person to again provide for thenselves 
and others, giving back the feeling of accomplishment and function, that
 is often lost during lengthy unemployment,
 yet when that feeling is returned it creates a drive to make ways to 
open doors that seemed sealed shut before.</p>
<p>Secondly, Besides giving hope and work to disabled persons this 
company creates a good clean fun as well as educational activity almost 
anyone can enjoy!  Who wouldnt be excited to be the first person ever in
 the world to lay eyes on the gold they pan from
 the mined dirt we obtain. Its always a surprise what shape, what size, 
of nugget will be in there will it be a beautiful specimen. rare wire 
gold, it may be more in value then was paid!! Its an unknown when its 
taken from the earth and passed to another without
 being totaly searched! We dont know we test each load to insure there 
is good average gold so you atleast find reasonable amounts and then 
there are always some that crush the average and find something truly 
special! A mystery and excitement that once was
 only known to the few with access to a gold mine, now enjoyed by anyone
 without even leaving the house or backyard! </p>
<p>Hats what its about to provide at the highest level of care and 
quality possible to know someone smiled today someone enjoyed themselves
 or time with others thru the experience many could never have had 
easily before, and on top the lives changed by being
 able to return to the workforce thru new found abilities, regaining alot
 from feeling productive and able to provide once again!</p>
<h2>
                            How We Are Creating It</h2>
<p>I started a small business out of my home in which I was able to 
work very flexible hours, work in any kind of position sitting standing at
 times whatever when the injuries or body needed to, no heavy lifting
 was required and many other benefits for an
 injured and disabled person.  I soon needed help and decided this was 
something I needed to share with as many like myself that needed an opportunity like I had created.</p>

<p>Hi!!
 My name is Robert Schaefer thats me above, I had been unemployed for a 
long time, owing to physical
 disabilities; yet had a resolution to be independent and free of 
periodical Social Security payment, so I decided to maximize my 
potential and passion.  As a result, I first started as an eBay seller, 
offering exclusive pay-dirt concentrates (you know the
 dirt they shovel into machinery on shows like Gold Rush or Bearing Sea 
gold, the dirt with gold nuggets hidded within!!) as well as special 
deals of gold matrix specimens, loose nuggets, and equipment like sluice
 boxes and pans. These could be used in home
 by anyone wishing to try thier hand at panning for gold and not having 
access to gold bearing areas, or for the miner wanting to practice 
setting up thier machines to insure less gold loss in the field. I had 
started gold mining as a hobby and now am turnining
 it into a business wherein I began to feel a sense of personal 
fulfillment by being productive agian and wanted to share with other 
disabled individuals<br/><br/>
  With business growing, I employed another disabled person to work with
 me wanting to share the newfound flexible emoploymet with someone else 
in need.  Business was already doing well considering it was started 
with no financial backing besides the couple
 hundred dollars on hand at the time.</p>
<p>We quickly grew much bigger than 
imagined and found ourselves now in a place where we need funding to be 
able to purchase wholesale lots of the equipment we sell to miners and 
hobbyists, obtain enough stock of the mined dirt
 we offer and had so many very pleased with. We dont have the means to 
purchase the wholesale bulk orders at lower cost which would allow us to
 grow further, hire more help, provide our customers with an even better
 price then we can now, all while not worrying
 day to day if we are going to be able to fill demand before we can 
order more inventory. .  We need proper stock on hand in order to run 
profitently, be able to order more before we are running out of product,
 purchasing product at the lower rate as well as
 giving us more room to put some funds away incase the need arrises to 
handle unexpected costs. T be able to use saved funds to hire additional
 help with the networking side.  We already cut most of our advertising 
because we just couldnt afford to purchase
 enough sellable items at a time to handle the load and are just doing 
enough to keep the business alive, it needs support so it can reach full
 potential.</p>
<p>We have seen and we know what amazing
 oppertunity is in front of us.  The only thing hampering us from 
reaching further is lack of funding.  With this help we can again 
advertise while keeping enough items in stock to fill
 orders in time, soon after hire a few others in much need of a flexible
 work opportunity and make this into the thriving venture it has shown 
it can be while giving those in need an income to provide for themselves
 and family, bring a positive outlook into
 those lives again, and give our customers a special product they are 
sure to enjoy that normaly would not be as easy to experience for most!</p>
<p>We can create alot of good in 
numerous ways here. I've tried to obtain funding thru banks and other 
lenders, they wont approve anything after being unemployed so long and 
the business being so new. This is our last chance
 to obtain the funding needed to create the path that will see this 
venture off to doing good in many ways for many people thru existece</p>
<p>What we are asking:</p>
<p>In short we have no financial power to pour into inventory to fulfill
 demand that we experience, pay off a few debts from past years while 
unemployed that are currently affecting the ability to obtain credit for
 the business which would allow us further
 growth in the future, into other areas we are thinking of such as 
making gold nugget jewelry and other items that have been being perfected on the side. We can begin to advertise the new site and let 
it be known we are in business ready to meet demands and
 I would like to hire a few other people who are unemployed and could 
benefit from what we can provide in terms of flexible and understanding 
work conditions. This is why we are here.</p>
<p>All efforts to obtain credit 
facilities from financial institutions proved abortive. I have tried 
bank loans and some other credit facilities, but my applications were 
not granted. Nonetheless, I'm not giving up at all after
 what good was stemming from the work.</p>
<p>I ask please if anyone can contribute 
to our cause please do! We wont stop and are sure to see this thru and 
make as many changes for the better in our and others lives as 
possible!  This is an amazing opportunity and any bit
 large or small is a big thing towards seeing this thru!!</p>

nuggets in your pan! Well you can now even in your home, and you could 
find more gold then the 100% real gold containing pay dirt mined from 
area claims and shipped to your door! From the miner into packaging to 
your door! Guaranteed gold and sometimes even a profit on your purchase!
A desire to be free of monthly ssdi payments and help employ a few other
 disabled individuals I took a hobby and turned it into a business. 
Starting with nothing we managed to lay down a foundation despite the 
odds for a start-up with no funding available.

                            What future are we creating?

Two different futures are being made possible here, one a way for
 disabled individuals whom desire to be able to return to work despite 
limitations but need a job with very flexile conditions and 
understanding employers to help cope and provide conditions
 that ables them to perform regardless of physical limitations. This 
allows a disabled and unemployed person to again provide for thenselves 
and others, giving back the feeling of accomplishment and function, that
 is often lost during lengthy unemployment,
 yet when that feeling is returned it creates a drive to make ways to 
open doors that seemed sealed shut before.
Secondly, Besides giving hope and work to disabled persons this 
company creates a good clean fun as well as educational activity almost 
anyone can enjoy!  Who wouldnt be excited to be the first person ever in
 the world to lay eyes on the gold they pan from
 the mined dirt we obtain. Its always a surprise what shape, what size, 
of nugget will be in there will it be a beautiful specimen. rare wire 
gold, it may be more in value then was paid!! Its an unknown when its 
taken from the earth and passed to another without
 being totaly searched! We dont know we test each load to insure there 
is good average gold so you atleast find reasonable amounts and then 
there are always some that crush the average and find something truly 
special! A mystery and excitement that once was
 only known to the few with access to a gold mine, now enjoyed by anyone
 without even leaving the house or backyard! 
Hats what its about to provide at the highest level of care and 
quality possible to know someone smiled today someone enjoyed themselves
 or time with others thru the experience many could never have had 
easily before, and on top the lives changed by being
 able to return to the workforce thru new found abilities, regaining alot
 from feeling productive and able to provide once again!

                            How We Are Creating It
I started a small business out of my home in which I was able to 
work very flexible hours, work in any kind of position sitting standing at
 times whatever when the injuries or body needed to, no heavy lifting
 was required and many other benefits for an
 injured and disabled person.  I soon needed help and decided this was 
something I needed to share with as many like myself that needed an opportunity like I had created.


                            Our Story & Why You Should Support U

Hi!!
 My name is Robert Schaefer thats me above, I had been unemployed for a 
long time, owing to physical
 disabilities; yet had a resolution to be independent and free of 
periodical Social Security payment, so I decided to maximize my 
potential and passion.  As a result, I first started as an eBay seller, 
offering exclusive pay-dirt concentrates (you know the
 dirt they shovel into machinery on shows like Gold Rush or Bearing Sea 
gold, the dirt with gold nuggets hidded within!!) as well as special 
deals of gold matrix specimens, loose nuggets, and equipment like sluice
 boxes and pans. These could be used in home
 by anyone wishing to try thier hand at panning for gold and not having 
access to gold bearing areas, or for the miner wanting to practice 
setting up thier machines to insure less gold loss in the field. I had 
started gold mining as a hobby and now am turnining
 it into a business wherein I began to feel a sense of personal 
fulfillment by being productive agian and wanted to share with other 
disabled individuals
  With business growing, I employed another disabled person to work with
 me wanting to share the newfound flexible emoploymet with someone else 
in need.  Business was already doing well considering it was started 
with no financial backing besides the couple
 hundred dollars on hand at the time.
We quickly grew much bigger than 
imagined and found ourselves now in a place where we need funding to be 
able to purchase wholesale lots of the equipment we sell to miners and 
hobbyists, obtain enough stock of the mined dirt
 we offer and had so many very pleased with. We dont have the means to 
purchase the wholesale bulk orders at lower cost which would allow us to
 grow further, hire more help, provide our customers with an even better
 price then we can now, all while not worrying
 day to day if we are going to be able to fill demand before we can 
order more inventory. .  We need proper stock on hand in order to run 
profitently, be able to order more before we are running out of product,
 purchasing product at the lower rate as well as
 giving us more room to put some funds away incase the need arrises to 
handle unexpected costs. T be able to use saved funds to hire additional
 help with the networking side.  We already cut most of our advertising 
because we just couldnt afford to purchase

My Story






I am a retired engineer with a long  career working for defense contractor companies, designing and manufacture products related to cutting edge technology. Over the years of being a homeowner and raising a family, I became keenly aware of lights burning needlessly for hours and even days. Not being able to find any realistic and practical solution, other than constantly yelling at the kids to turn off the lights, my frustration grew. 

I recently remembered participating in a project several years ago with Bell Telephone Company. They were experiencing serious issues with lights being left on for days and weeks in remote relay substations. Their solution was the inspiration for BrightSwitch!




Our Goal
To provide BrightSwitch technology in residential homes, business offices, hotels, motels, or any other place where energy is wasted from unattended burning lights.

We are currently making the BrightSwitch in three colors:

White

Risks and challenges

A great amount of
effort and resources have been spent in designing and testing a product that
meets the highest standards of craftsmanship, performance and durability. We
have had some significant challenges on our journey which we have overcome and
we are now in a very good position, but surprises can happen. We will be

We have built in
extra time for any problems that might come up during the new design upgrades,
added safety testing and manufacturing process, and we are confident we will
ship by the projected dates however, we will always keep you notified if things
take longer than we expect.
PRODUCT
We have taken the
following steps to make sure that we deliver the highest quality product: 
- 
Produced and thoroughly tested an initial product run of 100 BrightSwitches
to insure quality. In order to enhance the product experience, we will continue
to improve the product based on your feedback.

Extensively tested prototypes for performance, convenience and
durability.

 We have
established relationships with experienced manufacturers to mitigate the risk
of delays by material suppliers and to ensure quality control is implemented to
the highest level. In addition, we have produced an initial run with our
manufacturers and set up all the necessary facilities and tooling.

<p>Sovereign Remedies above all is
hospitality.  It is comfort. It is
nostalgic yet new.  It is an honest
product for an honest price.  It is for
the love of the craft and for the love of gathering friends. It is neither
stuffy nor slack but respectful.  It marries
the past with the present, the country with the city.  It is local artists and local food.  It is a place for travelers to rest, for the
young to explore, for the old to share the past, for the lovers to love, and
for the imbibers to drink in, and for all to celebrate life.</p>
<p>It is a sun filled café, a botanical rich craft
cocktail bar, a place of curious learning, and Community Supported Agriculture all in one room. It is what you get when a bartender, a baker and
a farmer find the perfect space in downtown Asheville NC. </p>
<p><b>RSA?</b></p>
<p>Working with Patchworks Urban Farms, we kick off Asheville’s
first “<b>R</b>estaurant <b>S</b>upported <b>A</b>griculture”
program.  An RSA is a pledge to share the risks and uncertainties of farming, and commits to design a menu based on truly supporting responsible farming practices.  Our strategy is to allow the farmer full reign in creating food systems based on the needs of the land, soil, and water, rather than requiring the farmer to sacrifice ""good farming"" for the current market demands.   This means our menu will really express the current happenings on the farm along with the old-time methods of ""hedging our bets"" by preserving, fermenting, curing, and freezing in times of surplus.</p>
<p><b>What we have achieved
so far:</b></p>
<p>We have found the perfect space in the growing city of Asheville
and signed a lease.  We have worked with
some very talented local artists to design and build all of our furniture (we're half
way done!).  We have driven over a
thousand miles during the past few months to purchase the lion share of our
equipment from restaurant auctions and Craigslist ads.  And we have been pickling, freezing and
drying the early bounties of the farm to prepare for this fall! Every day we
get a little closer.</p>
<p><b>Why contribute some of your hard earned money?</b></p>
<p><i><b>Not only do you help
us launch our dream, your contribution is PAID FORWARD!</b>  </i>Yes! For every dollar
we raise to make this beautiful space we will in turn over the next 5 years, pay-forward the value of this campaign by sharing our space, our

<p>Charlie has worked in the bar biz throughout  the past 20 years,
starting as a way to support a career in dance and then falling in love with the
craft of making a perfect cocktail consisting of well sourced
ingredients.  After opening a successful nightclub with two friends in
Portland Oregon, he worked at opening 7 more programs through his 8-year stay,
including the Clyde Common in the Ace Hotel (listed in David Wonderich’s “Best
Bars”).  Followed by the Amigo Room in the Palm Springs Ace Hotel featured
in Detail Magazine’s Top Ten Hotel Bars in the world. Sovereign Remedies is a
way to combine many years of creating/running successful programs with a true
passion for the history and craft of making incredible drinks.</p>
<p>Leah has spent the past decade working in almost every facet of
the “service industry”. From doula work to kitchen work Leah has made working
with people <i>and</i> for the betterment of people an extremely fulfilling career
path. Born and raised in Asheville North Carolina, a sense of adventure and
desperation led her to the weird wild world of the Netherlands, where---for the
love of cooking, fine Dutch tulips and a surly Dutch gentleman---Leah found
herself working under the tutelage of Italian chef, restaurateur and power
house Margarita Rossi. For the better part of the 2000’s Leah called both
Utrecht, the Netherlands and Boston, Massachusetts her home and during this
time soaked up as much local food and culture as humanly possible. When the
call of the Appalachian Mountains became too strong and the migration home
began Leah would start the process of marrying all the wonderful traditions she
had picked up along the way.</p>
<p>Sunil is a farmer, permaculturist, and an avid cook, cheese
maker, and baker. Having studied cultural anthropology, he traveled extensively
through Asia and spent three years as an English teacher in Japanese schools.
Back in the states, he studied natural farming methods and worked for farmers
in California, West Virginia, New Jersey, and Oregon. Sunil has collected many
skills from growing 4-season biodynamic vegetables, to managing a grass-fed
dairy herd, making artisanal raw milk cheese, baking for production in a
commercial wood-fired oven, natural building, and helping maintain permaculture
sites. Hailing from Pennsylvania, he managed a large CSA there for 4 years. In that time, the farm expanded a quarter acre plot to a
12-acre working farm. In January 2013, he relocated to Asheville to be site manager and coordinate the launch of the Urban Farm School at the Ashevillage
Institute.  This year Sunil has launched Patchwork Urban Farms, a
multi-plot farm in Asheville. </p>

Everyone knows that special interests have far too much influence over lawmakers. Since those elected in a corrupt system are unlikely to
reform themselves, the question becomes what can people outside the system do to effectively address a problem that impacts so many aspects of our lives? 
Just complaining about it, paying no attention to it or circulating online petitions that have little chance of being enacted will not solve this problem.It is time for some fresh thinking on
political reformWe are developing an exciting new two-step approach to reform. First, we're making it much easier for voters to see the identities of the biggest contributors to the candidates and ballot measures they'll be voting on.The Supreme Court has made it clear that they will not permit any meaningful restrictions on campaign contributions, and so revealing the sources of those contributions to voters is now more important than ever.We’ve also begun construction on an online grid to connect candidates and voters everywhere, for free. Having a no-cost platform for candidates to reach  an unlimited number of voters will enable more citizens who are not wealthy or indebted to special interests, to run for office.
Phase One – Making It Easy to See Who Is Contributing to Whom 
Currently, it is much too difficult for voters to see who is financing political campaigns. Finding this data requires accessing multiple or difficult-to-use government websites, or utilizing search engines more appropriate for journalistic or academic research.Most voters have busy lives and simply do not have the time to conduct such research, and so we’re making it easy to see this vital information.We’re extracting useful data from cumbersome government websites and other online resources that track campaign contributions, which few voters know about or would have the time to consult even if they did.We’ll collate, combine, and summarize this data in user-friendly ways that are easy to understand.Just by entering their zip code, voters will be able to quickly see the following information for each candidate and ballot measure we cover.
Listings of their top 20 contributors
Highlighting the top 20 contributors
Contributions sorted by size
Contributions sorted by source (Individuals, Political Action Committees, Political Parties, and Independent Expenditures)
Phase Two – Connecting Candidates and Voters at No CostHigh campaign costs leave candidates dependent on special-interest contributions. One of the largest expenses is advertising, but only because there is no single website where candidates know they can reach most voters. Nor is there a site where voters can hear directly from the candidates they’ll be voting on.NextGenElect will fill this void by becoming the nation's first ""Election Supersite"", connecting voters and candidates, at no cost to either. We'll invite every candidate on the ballot for the races we cover to tell voters about themselves by way of a video statement. All in one place, voters will be able to watch these video statements, see who is financing the candidates' campaigns, and view their ratings from diverse groups.We’ll make similar information available for both the proponents and opponents of ballot measures. What you won’t find on NextGenElect is any partisanship or bias. We will NOT endorse any individual candidate, political party, or ideology.When, Where, and How We'll Do ItWe'll begin Phase One this fall in California by providing the campaign finance data on candidates for all statewide races, for both the proponents and opponents of all statewide ballot measures, and for the candidates for all state legislative offices.  For future elections, we'll provide this data on candidates for federal offices, local races (whenever that information is available), and for candidates and ballot  measures in other states.Phase Two, the free online platform for candidates will be ready for use in the 2016 elections, when the nation will elect a new president. We'll again begin in California and expand coverage to other states as quickly as resources permit.  The goal is to build a nationwide online infrastructure that makes this information available for every candidate and ballot measure in the country.Our extensive marketing will raise the public profile of all participating campaigns, thus reducing the need for them to raise large amounts of individual contributions or to depend on spending from outside groups and SuperPacs.  Further, the NextGenElect concept of creating a level online political playing field is by no means limited to the United States. It can be exported and will work well in other countries, particularly those with emerging democracies. 

Have We Done This Before?
Yes we have and on some good-sized stages. From 2006 – 2010, we developed and ran a predecessor program based on the same concepts called NextGenPolitics. It was used primarily by ABC-TV network-owned stations in California. Watch the brief 2006 debut video introduction of NextGenPolitics for ABC7-TV, San Francisco.Click here to learn
more about NextGenPolitics. The program was popular with voters and candidates, particularly those who were lesser-known and did not have the financial resources to pay for expensive paid advertisements. We learned a lot from that experience and are ready to take this no-cost way of connecting candidates and voters to the next level.
Have You Created Any Other
Innovative Applications?
Yes! Our team at NextGenElect has a track record of innovation. One example is our trailblazing
work in professional baseball using digital video and predictive statistical
analysis (Watch the ESPN SportsCenter Story below.)We've done it off the field too. When most pollsters conducted exit polls and crowd research using clipboards and paper surveys, we led the way in using tablets, long before iPads had even been invented. (Watch this fun ABC7-TV news story about the Great Mustard Poll for the San Francisco
Giants.)
We have been an industry leader in conducting reliable online research, and incorporating video and other media into the online survey process.
How Your Contribution Will Be Put To Work
The funds raised will be used to:
Build the
web infrastructure
Collect and collate the campaign finance data
Finance outreach efforts to make voters
aware of the website
The initial amount of funding sought is the minimum we feel is necessary to provide coverage of the California election contests and ballot measures we described for this November's General Election.Raising additional funds will allow us to accelerate and broaden our outreach efforts to introduce voters and candidates to NextGenElect, and expand its coverage more quickly.Additional Revenue Sources
We see several sources of revenue to support further development of the website, expand its coverage, and cover operating expenses in future years:
Sponsorships and grants
Donations from individuals
Advertising revenue

Fees paid by news organizations who use our resources

To maximize our reach, we would like to work with as many news organizations as possible, even at little or no cost, if we can raise sufficient funds elsewhere.NextGenElect will be a lean operation. We’ll use great
programmers and other professionals that we’ve worked with before, and recruit new talent willing to
work at patriotic rates or on a volunteer basis.
Our commitment to building a useful election resource
will endure even if we don't reach our funding goal. We have a backup plan to reduce or
phase in some features and/or cutback in certain areas, if necessary. 
What's in it For Contributors? 

We have some fun perks but the biggest thing
most people will get out of contributing to NextGenElect is the
satisfaction of knowing they are helping to enact meaningful change in America. 
Even those who can’t help financially
can still make a valuable contribution by helping us get the word out about NextGenElect
via Indiegogo's Share Tools, social networking, or just plain word of mouth.
NextGenElect will demonstrate what crowdsourcing can
accomplish by bringing an innovative idea to
fruition and driving its ultimate success!
Getting the Word Out
While our goals are noble, we are realistic about the sustained and creative effort it will take to attract and engage a large audience.Beyond our sharing and networking plans, we'll promote NextGenElect in many other ways including: 
Enlisting news organizations to use and credit our resources
Gaining free publicity from news stories and public appearances we will shamelessly solicit
Developing catchy
promotional spots and asking ad agencies, public relations and production companies to help us at little or no cost
Creating and continually updating a music video with new segments we add from submissions by users and, occasionally, celebrities (you never know who might show up in the next version). 
We'll work hard to establish footholds in several key
vertical markets. One group we really want to engage is younger people, and one way we'll do this is through campus newspapers. Many universities also run programs that emphasize the importance of voting and being engaged in
civic affairs.NextGenElect will be a great resource to share with students and teachers, groups who can also help spread the word and be a source for volunteers. To
further diversify and increase our user base, we'll also reach out to get non-English language news organizations to use NextGenElect. The site will be translated into as many languages as demand and resources permit. 


Measuring Success
We’re confident that NextGenElect
will be a success! 
Initially, just having an unbiased and informative
election resource will clearly benefit voters who use it.
After that, as we generate increased web traffic, success will build on

Future FeaturesWe want to expand the capabilities of NextGenElect that will benefit voters both at election time and year-round.We'll provide to links to government websites that will allow users to register to vote, request an absentee ballot, or conduct other election activities. We will also provide links and content to help prospective candidates take the necessary steps to run for public office. Other election-oriented resources we plan to develop include online debates between candidates or between the proponents and opponents of ballot measures, as well as candidate forums in which voters can participate. We will also develop online educational content to help people improve their basic knowledge of our political system and how they can most effectively impact it.We'll try fun quizzes, contests, or anything else that can help voters become better informed and more engaged in civic affairs.Wrapping Up
Yes, many people don’t pay attention to news about politics, and some don't even bother to vote because they feel helpless about a dysfunctional system that doesn't represent their interests. But if enough of us are willing to invest even a very modest amount of our
time and energy (and a few bucks), we can make our democracy more vibrant and functional. And NextGenElect will prove how crowdsourcing can be used to address even seemingly intractable problems.
Let's be clear; our
success is not predicated on expectations of some great renaissance of civic engagement in the
United States. Most Americans simply have other interests and are not wired that way.
But there is a broad consensus that something needs to be done to elect
representatives who are more concerned with the public interest than special interests. This intense public desire for greater political integrity creates the perfect environment for NextGenElect
to take off and thrive.We hope you'll agree and will support our efforts to revitalize our democracy. Together we can bring about great change. Thank you!

</div><h2><b>A Short Autobiography</b></h2>
<p>During my third year of undergraduate studies I heard a talk that
changed the trajectory of my life for the 9 years to come. The talk was on ‘Tissue
Engineering’, a field concerned with creating living tissues in the lab using
the patients’ own cells in order to replace diseased or malfunctioning tissues.
I knew right away that this was the future of medicine. Patients will no longer
have to wait for months or years to get an organ transplant, but will get one
that is uniquely theirs, within a matter of weeks. I was so intrigued by this
field that I went on to do my Masters and <a href=""http://www.mcgill.ca/biomat-x/lab-members/graduate-students/mina-mekhail"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.mcgill.ca/biomat-x/lab-members/graduate-students/mina-mekhail"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.mcgill.ca/biomat-x/lab-members/graduate-students/mina-mekhail"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PhD </a> (McGill University) in Biomedical

published 7 research papers, filed 2 US patents, presented in 10 conferences,

We've been operating out of a 300 square foot trailer for the past year or so and have just secured a lease on a great new 3000 square foot space.  This move will allow us to welcome more members with more shop space for co-working and fabrication. It would also give us the capacity to expand our current programs and implement many more that have been contingent on space, including youth programs, classes and workshops, and community partnerships with schools and arts organizations.
The new space is a blank slate.
We need to do finishing work, like cabinetry and electrical, as well as get more equipment in place for member use.
Your contribution will be used to pay for materials and labor to:



Run electrical to equipment and work areas.


Build worktables, storage areas, and room dividers.


Obtain welding equipment.


Buy folding chairs and such for presentations and classes.


Buy necessary safety equipment.

Build walls to enclose the woodworking area.
Enclose an area of the parking lot for working outside.
Add soundproofing to work areas.

Your support for this campaign will help us keep our momentum going. 
The community response to our vision has been overwhelming. Within 9 months of opening our doors in
December 2013, our membership alone supported our expenses. At this time we:


Have become a 501c3 non-profit with a diverse community-minded board of directors. 
Have almost 60 members of all ages, 5 of whom are scholarship members. 
Have hosted 120+ interest-based meetup events.
Currently average 2 to 4 free public meetups a week focused on everything from 3D printing to jewelry making. 
Have had well over 2,000 people come through our space in the past year.

Please help us get the word out.
 If you can't help us financially with this campaign there are other ways you can contribute.  We would really appreciate if you would help us get the word out about this campaign.  Tell your friends about us using Facebook, Twitter or other social media platform.  You may also use the Share tools on this page.  
Thank You

<h2>Welcome home.</h2>
<p>I'm Sam, avid reader, dog mom, and most recently, entrepreneur. Let me tell you why you're here. I'll start at the beginning.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Just a girl and her books</span></h3>
<p>Blue House Books is the product of a lifelong passion for stories. Ever since I was a child, I was writing and reading. From infuriating my brother because I was reading while walking slowly home from elementary school, to staying in last weekend because I couldn't put a book down. </p>
<p>My love for books never ceased. After an education and short career as a journalist, I turned my love of stories into a degree. I earned a Master of the Arts in Publishing from Oxford Brookes University, the U.K.'s number one publishing program. After moving back to the States, I decided to stay in Kenosha, but there were no job opportunities in my field. So I decided to make one.</p>
<p>I have more than 10 years of experience in customer service and have been working for more than a year in gaining buying and admin experience. I have learned a great deal from two years of running Blue House Books as a pop-up retailer, and I am also talking with other indie bookstore owners to help fill in my gaps in knowledge of opening a full brick-and-mortar store.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here's what we need</span></h3>
<p><font>I am trying to raise $3,000. Here's where that money will go:</font></p>
<ul>
<li>$500 for fixtures and shelving</li>
<li>$1,000 for book inventory</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$500 for other merchandise</span></li>
<li>$1,000 for other expenses, such as licenses and permits</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach the full goal of $3,000, I will still expand my inventory, but will be required to remain as a pop-up bookseller for now.</p>
<p>Of course I would never ask you to give your money away for nothing! You'll find several incentives as a thank you for your contribution. Rewards range from advertising for corporations and small businesses to free books and discounts for individual contributors.</p>
<h3>More than just a bookstore</h3>

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<div>I believe the gap between city and country has become wider. Fewer people work the land due to technological advances. Supermarkets offer aisles of plastic wrapped 'foods'.

<div>I'd love to take back some control from the multinationals and educate consumers through two documentaries about the true value of fresh milk - and the effort, resources and commitment that goes into its production. I do believe that by creating awareness about milk production, we will together be building a social conscience that will bring about change.</div>
<div>I'm taking my message on a road tour through Northern New South Wales and Queensland. These trips will go ahead regardless of this campaign outcome, as my family business has already committed to their importance. The funding we are hopeful of raising is to enable us to capture my journey in documentary style, and spread my message far beyond the small number of people we will meet on the road. For this work we have enlisted the expertise and services Boomi Films.</div>
<div>Of critical value also is the educational component. We will create two documentaries about the importance of animal health and welfare, the production of milk and its value to society.

<p>Truth be known - the only risk we took was on you, the consumer! I prefer to think of it as a leap of faith...for which we are rewarded every day we stay alive in business.

<p>Are you ready to take a risk on us - with us? Perhaps a leap of faith, that you will have helped reconnect our farmers with the consumers they produce food for?

I have to speak out about this! Dairy farming runs deep in my veins - the Dennis family have been dairy farming since the 1800's. Even my Nan grew up on her family farm before marrying a dairy farmer - and so did my Mum! We consider it a privilege to produce and supply farm gate fresh, minimally processed milk to consumers.
I'm just one farmer out to make a difference. Crazy? Maybe - but I'm going to put my heart and soul into this and I need your help.
Join me on a campaign to change consumer decisions back in favour of local, family owned dairy farms - and away from the multinationals. In doing so, you'll help prevent more farmers going under, and ensure locally produced fresh milk is still available for our kids in the future.

The Campaign
I believe the gap between city and country has become wider. Fewer people work the land due to technological advances. Supermarkets offer aisles of plastic wrapped 'foods'. Milk is sold in white plastic bottles - there is no connection to the farmer who produces the milk. Consumers buy cheap milk without any sense of the effort that has gone into producing it.

 We need to act now. I won't be chasing government funding or corporate endorsements. I'm putting my hopes in people power.
We would like to raise $120,000 to complete the filming of a series of events, road-trips, and educational documentaries over the coming eight months - in Queensland and New South Wales, and if possible, New Orleans - USA, where I'll be speaking at the 2016 International Dairy Meet.

It's crazy to think that a single farmer can make a difference. Maybe I can't - but with your help, my voice will become your voice and we will share it with the world.
Family farms matter. Fresh food matters. The little bloke matters. A future with real milk matters. 
Please support my campaign.

Risks & Challenges
  Many thought we took a huge risk in 2013, to break away from the security of our Internationally owned Milk Processing Company, and invest more than $1 Million in our own factory. Retailer after retailer assured us that 4Real Milk would not sell at the price we required...but they were prepared to take a punt on us. Our three biggest stockists today were amongst the doubters. 
Truth be known - the only risk we took was on you, the consumer! I prefer to think of it as a leap of faith...for which we are rewarded every day we stay alive in business. A heart felt THANK YOU is definitely in order! I knew you would come through - the desire for real milk, farm gate fresh, direct to local stores is too strong. 
Are you ready to take a risk on us - with us? Perhaps a leap of faith, that you will have helped reconnect our farmers with the consumers they produce food for? And in doing so, change purchasing decisions to ensure fresh, locally produced milk by family farms, remains a part of our kid's future.
Other Ways You Can Help
 Since the GFC, it's been a tough road for many of us, as individuals, families and  businesses. I totally understand and respect the fact that you may not be in a position to support this project financially. There is every chance however that you may absolutely love what we're doing, and what we will achieve. 
You may have family members, close friends or associates who are better positioned to help and would want to - if only they knew. Please share with your networks, through Social Media or community groups - by email or text. It's as easy as starting a simple conversation and stimulating interest. We could not even put a dollar value on that kind of help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are embarking on an

<p><b>Preserving an Important Beer Style </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hoegaarden, Belgium is the
birthplace of Belgian witbier, which has been brewed in the village since 1445.
The village has been synonymous with this aromatic, cloudy, witbier for
centuries. In 1955 the last brewery in Hoegaarden that made witbier, Brasserie
Louis Tomsin, closed for good when the brewer retired. Unfathomably, the
region’s treasured witbier died with it. </p>
<p>Fortunately, that isn’t
the end of the story. As the town and beer lovers across the country grieved
for its loss, Pierre Celis, who had learned to make witbier at neighboring Tomsin,
quietly began making home brew versions of it in 1965. On March 13, 1966, Celis
singlehandedly revived the Hoegaarden witbier style in his brewery, Brouwerij
De Kluis. Over the years, the cloudy witbier made with wheat, hops, coriander,
and orange peel became world renowned and many breweries began making similar styles.
</p>
<p>Pierre Celis later went on
to found Celis Brewery in Austin, Texas, in 1992 and continued to make witbier.
</p>
<p>The brewing equipment used
to resurrect the style of beer remained in the original farmhouse in Belgium
where he first brewed his witbier. The historic, weathered open mash tun, two
copper kettles, an open fermenter, heat exchanger, and coolship hasn’t been
used since 1979. Like the original witbier, it too could die. </p>
<p>We can save this
extraordinary piece of brewing heritage dating back to the 1900s. Just as her
father rescued witbier from extinction, Christine Celis is determined to save
his legacy by bringing the original brewing equipment to install and display in
the new Flemish Fox Brewery in Austin, Texas. </p>
<p>We need your help to
preserve brewing heritage.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458853977/gw6j5g7scv8mef9c8anf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>A
Monumental Task </b></p>
<p>Moving the 2-toncast-iron open mash tun and copper brew
kettles from the brewery in Hoegaarden to Austin is a monumental task. The
extensive process to reclaim the brew kettles involved chiseling it free from
the brick and concrete in which it is encased with jackhammers. The roof and
walls of the brewery had to be removed to allow space to pull out the brewing
equipment using a massive construction crane. The very building itself had to
be reinforced to allow it to sustain this excavation. The walls and roof will
of course will have to be repaired as well. </p>
<p>We will restore the
equipment with curative sandblasting processes and repair work. Following
restoration, the copper kettles, mash tun and open fermenter will be packed in
custom-made protective wooden crates to be shipped across the Atlantic to Texas.
</p>
<p>It’s a project of historic
importance not seen before in the village of Hoegaarden. The streets were blocked
to allow for enormous trucks to transport the brewing equipment to the harbor
for its long ocean voyage to the Port of Houston. Pierre Celis’ equipment will
retrace the brewing journey that he took from Belgium to Texas. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458854023/dwn0nhvcy46u8hl4mb2h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>
</p><p><b>1.</b> <b>Raised Beds for Households</b> - We are raising funds to cover the cost of building materials and soil. We will also construct the raise beds, deliver them and fill them with new soil for free for those experiencing food insecurity. </p>

<p>
</p><p>We also welcome volunteers to help deliver the raised beds or those who want to donate building materials or plants for new growers. Please send a message if you'd like to volunteer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>2. Gardens for Faith Communities - </b>We are willing to work with any faith community that wants to explore the possibilities around transforming their property into spaces of food production. Producing food might benefit their own congregational needs, be used in their food pantry, to offer more healthy items for people experiencing food insecurity, as an opportunity to invite neighbors to grow in the garden, as a youth project, or provide resources to other populations experiencing food insecurity. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we can design a growing space, which could include vegetables, herbs, fruit bushes and fruit trees; Build raised beds or till land (depending on results from soil testing); Maintain the garden/growing space or teach others how to take care of a garden and offer the following workshops </p>
<p>Food Justice - an examination of the current food system and how we can collectively practice food justice.</p>
<p>How to grow food - offers the basics on growing your own food, which includes how to plant, soil maintenance, water use, mulching, pest management, harvesting, seed saving and winterizing your garden.</p>
<p>Canning - how to can pickles, tomatoes, salsa, apple sauce, etc.</p>
<p>Using faith community kitchens for promoting food sharing and food justice.</p>

<h3>The Magic of Stargazen</h3>
<p>My name is Dianne. I live at Stargazen Sanctuary, in the gorgeous woods of west central Wisconsin, where Miracles and Magic abound! Stargazen was created as a woodland nursery cum women's retreat, by my Beloved, Delightful partner, Raven, and me. Raven Transitioned from this earth while shoveling snow after a fierce storm. I found Her laying near the trailer She was digging out, as a surprise for me. I performed CPR on Her, ultimately with the help of two neighbors. . . and then, a team of paramedics.  After more than two hours of desperately attempting to revive Her, Raven went Home, enveloped by the energies of the Geminid meteor shower.</p>
<p>Losing my Eternal True Love, I fell into a deep, abiding, grief and despair.</p>
<p>Reviving Stargazen was further impeded when I sustained a head injury in September of 2014. I was struck in the back of my head by a load of plywood being navigated by a customer at our local building materials store. The customer fled as I lost consciousness, slung over my cart. The store denied culpability, and would not release the surveillance tapes. I was left with thousands of dollars of medical bills, not covered by my catastrophic insurance. As I worked to heal and pay the medical debt, I passionately reminded myself that Grace was more powerful than grief and trauma. That Trust is greater than fear. That Raven was watching over me.</p>
<p>I determined that I needed to revive my Life, and that included Stargazen. Stargazen is of my Soul. Part of me feels out of Balance because Stargazen is out of Balance.</p>
<p>With the Kind help of Friends, and my new Love, Janet,  we have begun revitalizing Stargazen. This is imperative! Over the years, MANY women have found Peace and Wholeness at Stargazen.  For some, it is their second Home.</p>
<p>There is a large pole barn, which has always been used for storage and a workshop. Remodeling the pole barn into a large group meeting and celebration venue is a perfect and necessary goal. We will add weddings to our menu, including LGBTQ ceremonies. The space will be upgraded with barn wood, luscious, old beams and industrial influences. We will add weddings to our events list. Stargazen is a Gorgeous landscape for Dreams and Love.  Lush gardens. Quaint dwellings. A rustic pavilion with Family-style dining tables. A vast, grassy mound, that includes a stage and ample space for Your tented event. We will accomplish this miraculous renovation during the winter months of 2016-17.  We will be ready to host Your ""Dreams Come True"" by May, 2017. It will be Magnificent!</p>
<p>Once the pole barn is reworked (and if our funding exceeds our goal), we will move on to finishing the RavenSoul Chapel. The skeletal structure of this building awaits its own ""Day of Dawning."" It, too, was abandoned due to grief. It is ready to Rise!!</p>
<p>Thank You for ""hearing"" my story and my ""plea.""  With the Deepest Humility and Gratitude, I am asking for Your help! The integrity of Your contribution will be an integral thread in the weave of our Resurrected Sanctuary. Please KNOW that I will ever-Honor Your generosity and Kindness. I cannot do this without EACH OF YOU. . .  &lt;3</p>
<p>We would be forever grateful if you share this with others near and far! You can share directly from Indiegogo. Thank you!!!</p>

<h3>Who I am:</h3> <p></p>
<p>My name is Leah, and I am a recent graduate that is passionate about empowering others. I am the founder of Business Women
of the 415, a Lean In Circle in San Francisco made up of female professionals
in business and finance-related careers. In my spare time I enjoy traveling, and have worked as an intern at the Grameen
Bank in Bangladesh and volunteered at the Maya Mountain Research Farm in rural
Belize.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Through the project Stepping Forward: Profiles of Millennial Women, I will engage with
millennial women across the United States from a wide range of different
fields, educational backgrounds, and geographic areas, and learn about their career
paths, opportunities, and dreams. I will profile these women and share their
stories to help young women from around the country learn about the
opportunities that are available to them and help them identify what they want
their future to look like and what they can do to step forward in their career.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><p>Currently, there are few resources available for young
women trying to explore their options; most career guides focus on
professionals that are already well established, rather than just getting
started, and generic advice about communication and leadership is harder to
learn from than real-life examples and stories. Furthermore, as the workplaces
and industries evolve, the opportunities for young women are changing, so
advice from millennial women may be the most relevant. This project will create a guide for young women that are looking to build their career that
will serve them as they are going through some of the most critical times of
their life.</p>
<p>For my project, I will
travel across the United States and meet with millennial women that are early
on in their careers in a variety of different fields. The interviews will focus
on three key aspects of career development:</p>
<ol>
<li>How did you find your career
     path? What twists and turns did you have along the way? What has your
     educational path been?</li>
<li>What has your experience been
     working? What was your first job like, what did you learn, and what did it
     lead to?</li>
<li>What are your aspirations? What
     are you doing now to get there?</li>
</ol>
<p>I will make an effort to
focus on as many different industries and types of work as possible to give
readers a sense of different career options and to tell a wide range of
experiences. The focus will be on women under the age of 30, with particular
emphasis on the 22-25 age range.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<h3>The Outcome</h3><p></p>
<p>The resources produced from this project will
educate young women about different career options while simultaneously giving
them advice about ways to reach their goals. By highlighting the stories of
millennial women pursuing their dreams through a range of different career
paths, this MTP project will allow young women to learn from peers that they may
never have the chance to meet.</p>
<p>While traveling on the train, I will create blog posts throughout the journey following
stops in each city and include some of the profiles of millennial women in that
city. I will create an ebook that includes compilations of all of the
interviews collected through the trip. The ebook will be searchable by
industry, geography, education level, and age group, so that readers can easily
find and focus on stories that resonate with them and are relevant to their
life stage and situation. </p>

This project was created with the idea of growing our local business into an international business. Over the past three years we have stumbled upon many unforeseen difficulties. The main one is liquidity. Our family heritage in Costa Rica is compromised and there is a very high risk of losing it.
We want to invite you to support us, in order to save our heritage and develop our other Project which is large, but requires liquidity. We have learned that honesty is not enough to resolve the problem because we are creditor of large loans, and mortgages.
THE IMPACT
Our project will generate Jobs in the country, and will eventually provide scholarships for needy families.
The funding we require is US$47,000 to continue our business. We have never thought about giving up because we have already invested more than seven times this amount, but we  require liquidity to be able to continue

The Crystal Creek distillery is bringing a new twist to an American classic with unique infusions like Serrano-Cucumber, Coffee-Pecan, Peach-Lavender, and Blackberry-Mint. 5% of the profits from bottles sales will be going towards supporting Austin based charity, A Glimmer of Hope.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432160905/m4pdpykzhexiqavan16w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>

The Bootleggers
Born out of the Austin Hill Country and inspired by The Roaring ’20s, Shane and Sam are the only ingredients involved which weren't grown in Texas. The Crystal Creek distillery is bringing a new twist to an American classic with unique infusions like Serrano-Cucumber, Coffee-Pecan, Peach-Lavender, and Blackberry-Mint. 5% of the profits from bottles sales will be going towards supporting Austin based charity, A Glimmer of Hope.

                                                        Sam (left) & Shane (right)
Sam Wakefield: Co-founder, Master Mooner

This wild specimen is vital to our team. Inspired by the surge of craft spirits and missing the environment of his former brewery job in Boulder, CO, Sam brought the idea of distilling America’s classic spirit to Shane and it snowballed from there. While the craft movement began as a hobby, it has quickly developed into a passion  and from there, a way of life. 


Shane Berber: Co-founder, Chief of Mooning
This rare and beautiful creature is a true asset. Inspired to make an impact by a visit to Ethiopia, socially responsible business has always been at the top of his agenda. Shane likes to work hard and play hard, so the distillery lifestyle came naturally. Keep an eye out for him when downtown in Austin after the bats have taken flight.

                                              (Having a bit of fun at the distillery - and yes... we always wear those)


  
What We Need & What You Get We are ready to bring our moonshine to the people. Help us get it there!  Funding will go directly into improving/purchasing equipment, allowing us to improve capacity and efficiency. Our perks will get you anything from a kiss on the cheek, to your own personalized whiskey barrel (branded w/your name) in which it was aged. Regardless of what we raise, this campaign will help CCM take all of the Crystal Creek products out into the market.
    The Impact Your support will not only impact us, but the community of local businesses we work with:  Our product is made from Texas grown ingredients like Goodflow Honey, and our infusions are also sourced from local farms and businesses. In the time we have been open, we have managed to support not only A Glimmer of Hope, but also several other fantastic non-profits including: Divine Canines, Ronald McDonald House, Marbridge Foundation, Bikers Against Child Abuse, and many more. Charitable support will remain on the forefront of the Crystal Creek Mission.
Partnerships with local farms allow us to remove our waste product and provide them with high quality fertilizer for their land. 

     


    Risks & Challenges  Every day at the distillery comes with a unique set of challenges to overcome and we've got the scars to prove it:  While the competition is steep, we are uncompromising on quality when it comes to ingredients and practice.  We've learned from the mistakes we've made, and are better prepared than ever to take our small business to the next phase.  
The Distilled Spirits world is filled with giants, but the craft movement has been growing exponentially with support for small and local business. The craft movement is the heart of why we have seen more and more support for businesses like ours.
    Other Ways You Can Help Get out to your local bars, restaurants and liquor stores. Remember, the consumer (you!) has all the power:  Some of the most valuable support you can give is by simply spreading the word to as many as you can.
 Share our campaign with any and everyone! You never know who may be interested!
Do you know of any establishments supporting Craft or Local products? Let them know about Crystal Creek. If they reach out to us, we'll do the rest!                       
  We really do appreciate your help and support.Lots of love, Shane and Sam",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hey Guys!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for stopping by! My name is Bethany Cole, Owner and Director of MomPlex in Tempe, Arizona. But those are both new titles for me. I'm also a mom of 2 boys, a wife, a full time student, and a Financial Coach. </p>
<p>Before MomPlex, I worked from home while also being the only caretaker for my boys. I spent 10 to 15 hours a day juggling work, school, and my kids needs. Nothing got 100% of my attention, and I felt like I was failing at everything. We won't even talk about what my house looked like. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now. In the morning, the boys and I get up and go to MomPlex. They go back to the toddler room, and I go out to the coffee shop to work. They are just down the hall, and I can check on them anytime I want. And I get to spend 4 hours a day getting work done. My homework gets done on time, I'm replying to clients the same day they are emailing me questions, and I get to be around other moms! I also get to squeeze in a yoga class once a week. </p>
<p>And the best part is, when we get home, the kids are so tired from playing, that they take a long nap! I have time to clean the house. And when they wake up? They have my 100% undivided attention until bedtime because I got everything done at MomPlex!</p>
<p>MomPlex is the support system moms across the country need to be better moms, better spouses, better business owners, and better versions of themselves. Obviously, the big goal of spreading this idea across the country is several years away. For now, we are still trying to just get our flagship location up and running. That's where you come in! </p>
<p>We have been open for 1 month, and we have got 6 members already! It will take 12 members to make MomPlex self sustainable, and 15 to 20 for us to able to start opening other locations. $8,000 would completely carry us through August 2017, giving us the resources to reach out to more moms, gain members, and begin planning our second location. </p>
</div><div>
<p>So where do you come in? Well. It would take just $8 from 1000 moms for us to reach our goal, and we know that this is a goal we can easily reach with your help! We honestly believe that when we come together and support each other, moms can do absolutely anything. </p>
<p>Where is your $8 going? Well, when you donate to MomPlex, you are:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Paying the moms we have hired to run the childcare. They get to bring their kids to work with them at no cost, and they get to take home a paycheck. This has been such a blessing to the moms who are working for us, but it is also our biggest operating cost. </li>
<li>Providing business, marketing, and finance classes for moms and their growing businesses, so that they can start growing their businesses and take home more money! </li>
<li>Putting a roof over our head. Even though we are operating out of a church (and they have been very supportive of us!), it is Arizona, and air conditioning isn't cheap. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these costs are necessary in building the support system moms need, and we appreciate your contribution. If you can't donate, there are still ways to help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this page. People can't donate if they don't know about it!</li>
<li>Like us on Facebook, follow us on Instagram</li>
<li>Email us your story. We would love to hear more stories from moms all over. You are not alone! Tell us how a MomPlex in your area would change your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our business and helping us grow! </p>

<p>Hi everyone! As you may know, my name is Sandy, and I am going into my third year of architecture at the University of Maryland College Park. I decided to kick start my future in architecture this summer by helping others as well as helping myself! Although I volunteer during the school year for our local Habitat chapter, I wanted to get a sense of how things might be done in a city with conditions different than ours. Consequently, I applied and was accepted to be a team member on a two-week long build trip to Anchorage, AK at the end of August!</p>
<h3>About Habitat for Humanity</h3>
<p>Habitat for Humanity works to eliminate substandard housing for less fortunate members of its community by constructing neighborhoods of new Energy Star certified houses especially for low-income families. Just like in any other city, a portion of Anchorage’s population is less than affluent and may not have access to decent, affordable housing. Businesses and organizations, trade workers, donors, construction workers/contractors, volunteers, and the families themselves are all involved in the infrastructure and construction processes.</p>
<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
<p>As an architecture student, I’m learning that an architect is responsible not only for creating beautiful structures but also for ensuring that they build practically and accessibly for the general public. This particular trip caught my attention as Anchorage presents a very special circumstance when it comes to providing a home to those in need – although its summer temperatures can reach a beautiful 70° F, wintertime temperatures can dip to below 0°. I believe that every person has the right to a home that will keep them safe, warm, and healthy. While I'm hoping to learn more about how to build a house and what kind of work goes into the construction processes, I'm also excited to see community health development first hand. Working alongside the people who will be beneficiaries of everyone's dedication is also an experience that builds strong connections and fosters a sense of friendship, responsibility, pride, and social awareness in all participants in the community.</p>
<h3>So How About It?</h3>
<p>Habitat for Humanity encourages its participants to spread awareness for its cause and also to cover part of their own trip costs by asking friends and family to donate payments that will go towards everything from construction materials to volunteer meals. Therefore, I welcome and am grateful for any donations that you would like to make towards sponsoring my project. Any amount is enormously appreciated, whether $20 or $200. I’ll try and keep you all updated in the forms of emails and photos detailing what I’ve learned, architecturally or socially!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my request and support this effort! If you know anyone who may be interested in contributing to my cause, please feel free to send them this link as well :) Best wishes to you all!</p></span></div>","About Me

<h2>Le projet</h2>
<p>Coquets, Originaux et pétillants sont les maîtres mots des vêtements Au Pays des Pullip !   Aidez nous à ouvrir notre boutique. Nous avons choisi la capitale car elle est accessible facilement de toute la France, nous permettant d’être plus proche de vous.</p>
<p>« <strong>Au Pays des Pullip</strong> » cherche à rendre accessible et à développer la communauté autour de sa marque. C’est ainsi qu’a émergé l’idée d’ouvrir une boutique sur Paris, encouragé dans cette voie par votre engouement pour nos créations.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/8828/atnl.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Au Pays des Pullip""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Qui sommes nous ?</h2>
<p><strong>Au Pays des Pullip</strong> est l’association d’une mère et sa fille autour d’une passion commune : <em>la couture</em>. Cela fait cinq ans que nous vous offrons chaque année de nouvelles créations Pullip.</p>
<p>Le début de l’aventure commença par de la lingerie. Nos amis les Pullip ont besoin de leur petite culotte ! Maintenant, la boutique propose une ligne complète de vêtements : robes, t-shirts, pantalons, ensembles lolita et accessoires en tout genre,…</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Sous vêtements Pullip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/3775/mjdz.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Sous vêtements Pullip""/></p>
<p> Depuis l’an dernier, la mode est passée à une taille supérieure : Les BJD (MSD, YOSD et Puki fée), répondant à un désir d’épanouissement des fans.</p>
<p>Toujours à l’écoute de vos attentes, notre boutique s’est développée sur le projet de la BJD (MSD, YOSD et Puki fée) en vous proposant une nouvelle gamme de vêtements adaptés pour elles. Nous avons ainsi pu découvrir une nouvelle communauté et espérons pouvoir réunir les deux autour du même projet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Pullip et BJD</h2>
<p>La Pullip est une poupée articulée, créée en 2003 par l’artiste coréen Chunsang Chunha. Ces poupées de collections mesurent environ 30 cm, elles sont en vinyle. Vendues aux alentours de 150€ pour les modèles les plus courants, elles peuvent monter assez cher pour les versions les plus rares.</p>
<p>Chacune des Pullips sorties a sa propre personnalité et son monde attaché. Ainsi nous retrouvons l’univers de Rozen Maiden ou de Alice pour les plus connues… mais aussi des univers bien plus originaux ou touchants, comme celui de Hello Kitty…</p>
<p>Elles se caractérisent principalement par leur grosse tête et leurs grands yeux très expressifs, qui peuvent tourner à droite ou à gauche grâce à une petite manette derrière la tête. Elles peuvent également cligner des yeux.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Pullip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/3524/tqo6.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Pullip""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Une Ball Jointed doll est une poupée articulée grâce à des boules. Elle est fabriquée en résine polyruéthane, une matière plastique assez chère, plus solide que la porcelaine, mais qui conserve un aspect délicat. Contrairement aux Pullip, les BJD ont une apparence et des proportions plus réalistes. Il existe une multitude de tailles de BJD :</p>
<ul>
<li>Les tiny ou Puki fée : Ce sont des poupées de 10 à 35 cm de haut d’apparence très enfantine.</li>
<li>Les YOSD ou minigem : Modèles d’environ 30 cm.</li>
<li>Les MSD : Modèles compris entre 40 et 50 cm.</li>
<li>Les SD : Modèles compris entre 55 et 80 cm.</li>
</ul><p align=""center""><img alt=""BJD"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/4963/ofe0.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""BJD""/></p>
<p>Il existe des exceptions et des créations d’artiste dans le monde des BJD. Nous pouvons ainsi retrouver des BJD animaux et créatures fantastiques aux couleurs innovantes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Un lieu de découverte et de partage</h2>

Le projet
Coquets, Originaux et pétillants sont les maîtres mots des vêtements Au Pays des Pullip !   Aidez nous à ouvrir notre boutique. Nous avons choisi la capitale car elle est accessible facilement de toute la France, nous permettant d’être plus proche de vous.
« Au Pays des Pullip » cherche à rendre accessible et à développer la communauté autour de sa marque. C’est ainsi qu’a émergé l’idée d’ouvrir une boutique sur Paris, encouragé dans cette voie par votre engouement pour nos créations.

 
Qui sommes nous ?
Au Pays des Pullip est l’association d’une mère et sa fille autour d’une passion commune : la couture. Cela fait cinq ans que nous vous offrons chaque année de nouvelles créations Pullip.
Le début de l’aventure commença par de la lingerie. Nos amis les Pullip ont besoin de leur petite culotte ! Maintenant, la boutique propose une ligne complète de vêtements : robes, t-shirts, pantalons, ensembles lolita et accessoires en tout genre,…

 Depuis l’an dernier, la mode est passée à une taille supérieure : Les BJD (MSD, YOSD et Puki fée), répondant à un désir d’épanouissement des fans.
Toujours à l’écoute de vos attentes, notre boutique s’est développée sur le projet de la BJD (MSD, YOSD et Puki fée) en vous proposant une nouvelle gamme de vêtements adaptés pour elles. Nous avons ainsi pu découvrir une nouvelle communauté et espérons pouvoir réunir les deux autour du même projet.
 
Pullip et BJD
La Pullip est une poupée articulée, créée en 2003 par l’artiste coréen Chunsang Chunha. Ces poupées de collections mesurent environ 30 cm, elles sont en vinyle. Vendues aux alentours de 150€ pour les modèles les plus courants, elles peuvent monter assez cher pour les versions les plus rares.
Chacune des Pullips sorties a sa propre personnalité et son monde attaché. Ainsi nous retrouvons l’univers de Rozen Maiden ou de Alice pour les plus connues… mais aussi des univers bien plus originaux ou touchants, comme celui de Hello Kitty…
Elles se caractérisent principalement par leur grosse tête et leurs grands yeux très expressifs, qui peuvent tourner à droite ou à gauche grâce à une petite manette derrière la tête. Elles peuvent également cligner des yeux.

 
Une Ball Jointed doll est une poupée articulée grâce à des boules. Elle est fabriquée en résine polyruéthane, une matière plastique assez chère, plus solide que la porcelaine, mais qui conserve un aspect délicat. Contrairement aux Pullip, les BJD ont une apparence et des proportions plus réalistes. Il existe une multitude de tailles de BJD :

Les tiny ou Puki fée : Ce sont des poupées de 10 à 35 cm de haut d’apparence très enfantine.
Les YOSD ou minigem : Modèles d’environ 30 cm.
Les MSD : Modèles compris entre 40 et 50 cm.
Les SD : Modèles compris entre 55 et 80 cm.

Il existe des exceptions et des créations d’artiste dans le monde des BJD. Nous pouvons ainsi retrouver des BJD animaux et créatures fantastiques aux couleurs innovantes.
 
Un lieu de découverte et de partage
Des rencontres goûters entre fans de Pullip et/ou de BJD seront organisés régulièrement afin de faire partager notre passion autour d’une part de gâteau et d’une tasse thé ! Prendre des photos de nos petites puces et échanger nos avis sur les nouvelles sorties.

</div><p></p><p><span>Have you ever had something so
good you were willing to fight over it? When was the last time that item was
food?</span></p>
<p><span>From the first time I introduced
an Italian Sausage Pie people have asked me to describe the taste.  If you
were to ask anyone that has ever tried one, you will get a lot of answers. My
favorite will always be, “Just try one, they’re delicious.”<br/>
As a chef, the joy of creating an item that everyone enjoys, regardless of their
palette, is amazing.</span></p>
<p><span>When I first found this recipe in
my great-grandmother’s old cookbook, it made me smile. She had been a constant
in my family and food had always been important. I didn’t know where she had
obtained the recipe and it was strange that I couldn’t remember her ever making
it.</span></p>
<p><span>My original sausage pie recipe is
an adaptation of the one that I found. Oddly enough, I can’t remember ever
eating this as a child. I’m sure I would have fond memories of that spectacular
crust, hot and fresh from the oven.</span></p>
<p><span>I cannot tell you how many times
I have been threatened, coerced and bribed for the recipe, but I kept listening
to the little whisper that told me to keep this tasty  dish a secret.  What started out as taste
this, try that, turned into learning not to walk away from a plate of this
pie.  It's funny to watch the look of disappointment that comes with the
knowledge that you were taken for your slice. </span></p>
<p><span>Seventeen years after I found
that recipe, a friend had the chance to taste what is now our <span>Signature Saucisse Italiano. He coerced me into make
him at least one a week. Under one condition, I had to charge him for them. Three
months later, I had too many orders to fill and not enough time to fill them. 
That was the inception of Saucisse Gourmand, Inc. </span></span></p>
<p><span>My chicken recipe <span>Signature Saucisse Poullet was a choice originally
made, because my nephew couldn’t eat pork as a child. To date it almost equals
the sausage as the #1 favorite. As for the taste, a simple chicken, vegetable,
cheese and flaky pastry dish has a whole new meaning.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Our products are made with locally grown produce and we do not use any salt,
pepper, spices or oils. As unbelievable as that sounds we have managed to
create a product that tastes incredible.</span></p>
<p><span>Fortunately, our business that
started on a plate has outgrown the confines of its environment. We are literally
feeding a football team on a weekly basis on top of all our other orders and we
are thinking about distribution. Right now we are looking to start with
$5000.00 so that we can start expanding our current facility, move into a new
one, or rent shared commercial space in the interim. We are ready to take on new customers, as we start taking small steps in
that direction. </span></p>
<p><span>We are weighing the difference in
cost between purchases of new equipment versus moving into a new commercial
facility. With your help we are looking to make this cumbersome task a little
easier. Along the way we want to feed as many people as possible. Please tell
all your of friends about us and get your contribution in early so you can taste

Fundraiser for Gabe Colston</h3>
<p>
Hi,
my name is Matt Hagen and I am currently living in Detroit spending a
year serving the city through Youthworks-Detroit.  I have a lot
of hair. I am going to cut it all off sometime this Lenten season,
but why not help someone along the way.  With your
scissor-friendly donations we can create the opportunity of a
lifetime for an excellent young Detoiter.</p>
<p>
Youthworks
has been running outreach to Detroit youth since 1995.  Much of
what makes this work possible is the volunteer service by young men
and women from all around the world.  For years, Youth
Initiatives has been sending their incredible young people from
Belfast, Northern Ireland to serve with us at Youthworks-Detroit.
 And with your help this could be the year we send one of our
own youth to serve a summer in Belfast!  </p><h3>
What
Donors will get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Donors
	of $10 will get pictures including a before, an after,
	and anything in between.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Donors

Fundraiser for Gabe Colston

Hi,
my name is Matt Hagen and I am currently living in Detroit spending a
year serving the city through Youthworks-Detroit.  I have a lot
of hair. I am going to cut it all off sometime this Lenten season,
but why not help someone along the way.  With your
scissor-friendly donations we can create the opportunity of a
lifetime for an excellent young Detoiter.

Youthworks
has been running outreach to Detroit youth since 1995.  Much of
what makes this work possible is the volunteer service by young men
and women from all around the world.  For years, Youth
Initiatives has been sending their incredible young people from
Belfast, Northern Ireland to serve with us at Youthworks-Detroit.
 And with your help this could be the year we send one of our
own youth to serve a summer in Belfast!  
What
Donors will get



	Donors
	of $10 will get pictures including a before, an after,
	and anything in between.  



	Donors
	of $25 will get a lock of my hair!



	Donors
	of $100 or more will be able to choose any hairstyle for me to cut
	and wear my hair in for a full day as I travel around Detroit doing
	various services.  Mullet, mohawk, bowl, cornrows, whatever!
	 You could just send me an ugly shape and I will buzz it into
	that shape.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Ken Smith, Pastor of a local church in Bridgeport CT. We are a very small organization who have decided to stop watching the news about the poverty and hopelessness in the city and have decided to get off the sidelines and do something about it.</p>
<p>I have witnessed families showing up at locations of the city for help just to get turned away because programs ran out of food and shelter related resources. I have seen families lose their homes and jobs with nowhere to turn. I cannot begin to convey the stories of those who stop by my church to get help only for us to turn them away.  It is the very lack of resources that causes us to tell a family, sorry, we ran out of food, winter coats, clothing, and we cannot help save your home.</p>
<p>Members of my church have put together an audacious plan to impact families by meeting their needs.</p>
<p>The funds received from this campaign will be used as follows: Help purchase a commercial freezer so that we can provide meats and other frozen foods free; expand the food pantry to store more non-perishables items; purchase back-to school bags and supplies for 2013/2104 school year; make special hygiene packages to give to the many who are on skid-row, and purchase machinery to clean up and maintain the neighborhood streets and yards. It will also be used to help purchase bread that’s given to senior homes and those in the community. In addition, we will do a home make-over for a family whose roof got damaged during the winter storms in the Northeast. The damaged roof has rendered one of the rooms unusable.The walls in the home are badly damaged. The three children living in the home are in dire need of beds and their furniture is broken down and unusable.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>“If you wait until you can do everything for everybody, instead of something for somebody, you’ll end up not doing nothing for nobody.” ~ Malcom Bane</p>
<p>Your contribution will impact and change lives one person at a time. Helping a community starts with helping one first. When people learn that complete strangers care enough to help provide for them, it means the world to them.  When we use your contributions to help people around the community, we do so with NO STRINGS attached. We will never give something and ask for something in return.</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, I have had the privilege of witnessing many lives change as a result of people helping people. We are just a conduit to get the type of resources to people that literally transform their lives. Two years back we ran a program called Angel Food that provided low cost food to anyone who desired to get the food. We witnessed people from the Urban and Suburban communities benefit from the program. When people could not afford the food, we simply went into our pockets and purchased it for them. Over the years we have given tons of clothing, food, school supplies, and one weeks’ worth of groceries to many during Thanksgiving time. Feel rest assured that your contribution will be maximized to its fullest.</p>

<h3>What is TREND?</h3>
<p>Something that Philadelphia's LGBT community and its allies need.

<p>Using the investigative reporting techniques and good government focus of <strong>Executive Editor Josh Kruger with the support of editing and writing staff with many veterans</strong> and others familiar to Philadelphia's LGBT community, TREND will add a much-needed voice of honesty and transparency in city's LGBT community.

<p>In 2010, we discovered that our son, Dag*, was being sexually molested.  We have been working hard to help him heal and grow past this, but it has been a very difficult few years. </p>
<p>Dag has many special needs and is now unable to attend regular camps like most children are able to... and it's breaking his heart.  After months of searching, we have found a special camp that is specifically designed for boys who are sexual abuse survivors.</p>
<p>The camp's Board of Directors has offered to allow Dag to attend the camp for free and we are very excited and grateful!  Now the challenge... We live in Fort Wayne, Indiana and the camp is based out of Astoria, Oregon.   </p>
<div>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Here's the plan: Dag and Mom fly out to Oregon together and arrive the day before the camp.  Mom and Dag stay that first night in a hotel together, then Mom rents a car and drives two hours to the camp to drop him off.  During Dag's stay at camp, Mom finds someone's couch to sleep on (thanks <a href=""https://www.couchsurfing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.couchsurfing.org/</a>).  After camp ends, Mom and Dag stay one more night in a hotel, then leave out the next morning. </p>
<p>Airfare (2 Round Trip Tickets for Mom and Son) - appx. $900</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A child with Autism and now Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Dag has restrictions that most children will never face, for his health, safety and emotional development.  He can't go to regular camps.  He can't have sleepovers with his friends.  He can't even walk down the street alone to see if a friend can play. </p>
<p>Imagine the experience that this will be for Dag!  Not only will he be able to share the camaraderie of other children in a camp environment, but he will be in a safe environment, where the counselors and therapists are specially trained to handle every challenge he comes with.  He will be in a camp with a one-on-one assistant and (for the first time) he will meet other children who have gone through what he has gone through.</p>
<p>This experience for Dag will surely be one of the most memorable of his childhood and his entire life.  Please help us realize this dream with him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>*Dag is a nickname for our son.  For his privacy, we're sure you understand why we will not disclose his name or Mom's name publicly.</em></p>

</div></div>","The Challenge
In 2010, we discovered that our son, Dag*, was being sexually molested.  We have been working hard to help him heal and grow past this, but it has been a very difficult few years. 
Dag has many special needs and is now unable to attend regular camps like most children are able to... and it's breaking his heart.  After months of searching, we have found a special camp that is specifically designed for boys who are sexual abuse survivors.
The camp's Board of Directors has offered to allow Dag to attend the camp for free and we are very excited and grateful!  Now the challenge... We live in Fort Wayne, Indiana and the camp is based out of Astoria, Oregon.   

The Solution
Here's the plan: Dag and Mom fly out to Oregon together and arrive the day before the camp.  Mom and Dag stay that first night in a hotel together, then Mom rents a car and drives two hours to the camp to drop him off.  During Dag's stay at camp, Mom finds someone's couch to sleep on (thanks https://www.couchsurfing.org/).  After camp ends, Mom and Dag stay one more night in a hotel, then leave out the next morning.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Wish Granters is a non-profit organization in the Boise area that grants wishes to adults with terminal illnesses. Here at Knife River we heard about this awesome organization earlier this year. We got involved with a fundraiser to send a young man with kidney failure to New York with his wife. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After putting out a donation jar with a copy of all the new wishes we were notified that one of the people on the list was actually a relative of a Knife River employee. We'd like to make his wish happen. His name is Terry and he has cancer. His last wish is only to see Arlington National Cemetery. He's been involved with the National Guard and patriotism has always been important to him.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The cost to make the wish happen is $2,500. We are thrilled to announce that Knife River will be matching contributions up to $500! </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We all know someone that is always there to help. That person will drop what they are doing, or add it to their already huge workload and give you their all. Without question or without thought of payback or compensation.</p>
<p>That person is known as the Phoenix. She got this name from her ability to, when knocked down, to get back up again. And again... She has the heart of a lion and the will of steel. Now, I am afraid, she needs your help.She would never ask for it. That is why I am doing this. </p>
<p>Phoenix was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 2000. She had chemo and radiation and moved on. It returned again in 2006. Again, more chemo, a double masectomy, hysterectomy and countless other surgeries. It returned again last year. It is now Stage IV. </p>
<p>She was raised in Setauket ,LI, NY in the area of the largest concentration of breat cancer on LI, I think in NY ,too. Her sister died at the age of 27 from Leukemia. Both of her parents are deceased. Sjhe has no known relatives. My immediate family cannot or will not help her. There are new medicines available, new pain medications, but our insurance plan doesn't cover those. We already pay thousands of dollars a month for medicines, treatments, etc. Since she is in continous pain, we are always looking for new medicines. We heard of a new one but it costs $800.00 a month extra. A new oral chemo drug  the Dr. suggested is $600.00 plus a month. This is on top of all the other treatments and medicines. She just got out of the hospital after 5 days. Her white blood cell count dropped so low, she had developed fever/infection/neutropena.</p>
<p>Phoenix has helped out friends and strangers alike. Please find it in your heart to help her now when she needs you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping Phoenix, you are helping many people, and animals too. Phoenix has been a Vegan for over 22 years and rescues, feeds and loves all animals and pets. Help Phoenix so she can continue what she does best. Helping others.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I figure she needs about $12,500.00 tro get her new medicines, and other things. Vitamins, supplements and other nutritional products. Also, she has had accupuncture in the past and it has helped ease her suffering temporarily and given her energy. As she has Lymphodyema in her left arm, she should also be having regular massage and body therapies for that.</p>
<p>I am looking into some things to offer for donations but I haven't gotten that far yet. I would like to offer at least a Tshirt or other item in return. I will post as soon as I have made arrangements.</p>

<p>The Farish-Georges Coffee Company is about to head off on an amazing path with my very own premium <strong>Coffee Liqueur Pre-Mix</strong>.  But this is not the beginning of my journey.  I have been diligently pursuing the perfect coffee product for over a decade.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.farishgeorges.com/images/fg_store_pic.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""100% pure Kona Coffee beans from the Kona region of Hawai'i""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Made entirely of American ingredients</strong>, including 100% pure Kona Coffee from Hawai'i (the only state in the USA where coffee is grown), the <strong>Coffee Liqueur Pre-Mix</strong> is a product that is mixed with vodka to produce a fabulous coffee liqueur with zero wait time!  No other coffee liqueur product on the market today can make the same claims that I am most proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses 100% pure Kona Coffee (finest coffee in the world) grown in America</li>
<li>The coffee ingredient is prepared using an ages-old cold filtration process that produces a wonderfully smooth flavor with less acidity</li>
<li>Produced entirely in America with American ingredients</li>
<li>Mixes immediately with your favorite vodka to produce a fine coffee liqueur that is unmatched in quality and flavor</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>Coffee Liqueur Pre-Mix</strong> is the result of hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars in product development carried out and born solely by me.  This was the only way to ensure the absolute finest quality.  From the time I began working directly with small farm coffee growers over 10 years ago on their marketing and sales efforts, through my own coffee sales over the Internet, up until today, I produced several different coffee products.  All products were based exclusively on Kona Coffee, and were prepared and sold locally.  By the very nature of Kona Coffee being the finest gourmet coffee in the world, these products were appreciated throughout the region.  The culmination of years of work in these various activities brings me to this highly critical point in the future of the Farish-Georges Coffee Company. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.farishgeorges.com/images/liqueur_math_2.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><strong>PROJECT:</strong> The formal introduction of my coffee liqueur pre-mix will actually occur in two phases.  The <strong>first phase</strong> will be as one of the primary ingredients in a <strong>premium coffee liqueur</strong> product from an American distillery.  <strong>This is where I am in need of funding assistance</strong>.  The distillery I am working with will require a significant volume of the coffee liqueur pre-mix.  I need to purchase ingredients, rent commercial kitchen time and equipment, and deliver the product within the next 30 days to meet the volume requirements of the initial batch of coffee liqueur.</p>
<p>The project goal amount listed is the bare minimum I need to deliver a first batch to the distillery.  I would like to exceed that goal in order to deliver a double amount to the distillery.</p>
<p>A <strong>second phase</strong> (timing is dependent on the success of the first phase) will be the preparation and packaging of the coffee liqueur pre-mix to be sold as a standalone product over the internet as well as in retail settings.  The only product development work to be done is related to the final packaging.  If needed, funding is expected to come from a portion of the profits from the first phase.</p>
<p>The sole focus <strong>today</strong> is to deliver the best coffee liqueur ingredient to the distillery.  That is where America and the rest of the world will be introduced to an amazing coffee liqueur.</p>
<p>All along the way, this journey has introduced me to so many wonderful people: small farm coffee growers, the people who lovingly tend their land, micro-roasters, ingredient manufacturers, micro-distillers, and all the people who have enjoyed my products.....the customers.  This business is really all about people connections and providing an enhancement to interactions between each other.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review about my project.  Please support this work.  I will keep you informed of the progress, in addition to the rewards described on this page.  Know that I am passionate about my work, diligent and resolute, and unrelenting in my pursuit of excellence.  And if there was ever any question about my loyalty, one only needs to look at my faith (a lifetime), my ""day job"" (34+ years with the same company), and my marriage (27+ years with the same beautiful woman).  This will be successful, and will become a bright legacy for my children.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Rich Hansen and I'm a sports dad. I've had two sons play baseball and my daughter is a swimmer. All three kids participated in youth sports and then made their respective high school teams. My wife and I were introduced to the concept of ""additional funds"" necessary for our kids' participation early on. Teams do their best to hold fundraisers, but the results are seldom enough and who pays? Parents.<br/></p>
<p>When the economy took a turn in 2008, my son's team struggled to sell sponsorships on expensive outfield signs. I've spent my career in advertising and design, so I had this idea and created the Walk-Up Pennant™—an over-sized (24"" x 54"") vinyl pennant based on traditional felt pennants. Sponsorships are now sold with tiered pricing (gold, silver, and bronze) which allows for a broad range of sponsors. Plus teams have flexibility to set their own pricing.<br/></p>
<p>But it wasn't all about raising funds. I really wanted to celebrate the athletes (who often don't have another sports experience beyond high school). Walk-Up Pennants featuring the athletes are created and displayed alongside sponsors and it's terrific recognition.</p>
<p>I've since created other fundraising and recognition products—as well as an online store. Teams and individuals can create a variety of items to sell or just enjoy.<br/></p>

Indiegogo is a crowdfunding site—and we are here to raise funds for BannerSeason. We need your financial support.

BannerSeason will use all donations to improve our current website and process.
Groups and teams will then be able to use a more robust bannerseason.com to run a profitable fundraising campaign.


Contact us if you need further clarification. Please read on...

WHO WE ARE:
Hi, my name is Rich Hansen and I'm a sports dad. I've had two sons play baseball and my daughter is a swimmer. All three kids participated in youth sports and then made their respective high school teams. My wife and I were introduced to the concept of ""additional funds"" necessary for our kids' participation early on. Teams do their best to hold fundraisers, but the results are seldom enough and who pays? Parents.
When the economy took a turn in 2008, my son's team struggled to sell sponsorships on expensive outfield signs. I've spent my career in advertising and design, so I had this idea and created the Walk-Up Pennant™—an over-sized (24"" x 54"") vinyl pennant based on traditional felt pennants. Sponsorships are now sold with tiered pricing (gold, silver, and bronze) which allows for a broad range of sponsors. Plus teams have flexibility to set their own pricing.
But it wasn't all about raising funds. I really wanted to celebrate the athletes (who often don't have another sports experience beyond high school). Walk-Up Pennants featuring the athletes are created and displayed alongside sponsors and it's terrific recognition.
I've since created other fundraising and recognition products—as well as an online store. Teams and individuals can create a variety of items to sell or just enjoy.
WHAT WE'VE DONE:
We call our company BannerSeason. We can help you have a successful and memorable season—on and off the field. This is what we've done to make that happen:
Designed professional looking products—and you set your own resale pricing
Tested products and selected quality partners
Launched our website and introduced the fundraising program (bannerseason.com)
Helped teams and groups raise thousands of dollars

Created an online store where you can create additional recognition products—for fun or profit (bannerseasonshop.com)

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:
We are pleased with our company's growth and success—and now would like to offer our products and fundraising assistance to teams and groups nationwide. To do so, we'll need to make some upgrades and improvements. With your contribution and those of your friends, we can implement the following:
Create instructional videos throughout the website—to guide you through our fundraising process
Improve customer relations with email campaigns—keeping your fundraising on track and offering tips and discounts

Beef up our tracking and reporting process (your BannerSeason dashboard)—where you manage ""who sold what to whom""

Implement a sales incentive program, where athletes can earn a FREE player pennant
Develop additional designs for fundraising and recognition products
Attend trade shows and events throughout the country to introduce our solutions to groups like yours
And much more


If funded, we anticipate these improvements to be in place by January 2014.
Our products can be used to raise funds for a variety of sports. Everything from baseball to lacrosse, football to hockey—boys and girls sports. There's even dance, cheer, and band! Apply our program to your needs as you see fit:
High School teams and groups
Junior High/Middle School teams and groups
Competitive/Travel teams
AAU teams
Little League teams
Many more!

Whether you're a parent of an athlete, a coach, school or league administrator, sponsor or interested crowdfunder, we need your help. We ask for your support as we look to improve our website, our process, and customer service. Help us take our company nationwide. We offer several levels of rewards and ask you to review them and contribute.
After contributing, please ""fund and forward""—which is simply telling your family, friends, and fellow sports parents about the great fundraising program and products BannerSeason offers. Let them see the benefit and add their support—so we all can enjoy a banner season!
PLEASE NOTE: Contributors creating a custom reward (car flag, phone case, canvas print, etc.) will receive their coupon code after the completion of our crowdfunding campaign. Products will be produced and mailed within 2-3 weeks of ordering. We're including FREE SHIPPING within the United States. Coupon codes will be valid for six months.CHALLENGES ABOUND.
As you'll see in the following articles*, funding youth athletics at all levels is more challenging every year—no matter wherever you live. Help us bring financial relief to teams across the nation.

<h3>Mito and his boat</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Josh. I volunteer for Sailcycletrek.org an NGO which works in support other NGOs. I also come across amazing people during my travel missions, people with with dreams, and a desire to help others. I help them along with making those dreams a reality.</p>
<p>I met Mito on the beach in Vilankulos, Mozambique. We struck up a friendship. He told me about his boat which he has almost finished, but couldn't as he lacks the funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>Thats why he needs your help. </p>
<p>If he can finish the boat, he can use it to create an income for himself and his family. Also, in exchange for my help (the creation of this Indiegogo campaign) he is going to teach me how to sail - a skill I will need to accomplish a much larger fundraiser I am embarking on next year January. (see Amazon Mission on sailcycletrek.org website)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Mito needs $ 200 (usd) to finish off his boat. (The campaign is set at $ 500 (usd) as this is the minimum available on Indiegogo). Any excess funds will be stored for further Sailcycletrek.org community projects.</p>
<p>the breakdown of the use of the $ 200 (usd) is as follows:</p>
<p>$50 to pay for work done on the boat so far.</p>
<p>$50 final waterproofing and paint to coat the outside of the boat</p>
<p>$50 Building the mast and other rigging needed for the sail</p>
<p>$25 Making the Sail</p>
<p>$25 Building the inner seating and storage of the boat.</p>
<p>I draw no personal funding from this or any of my other involvement with Sailcycletrek.org (I save my own earnings to use to volunteer in upstanding NGOs)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>To be a part of making a real change in a great guys life. A real change you can witness on the Sailcycletrek facebook page (He will need my help in the actual process of completing the boat and setting it on its maiden sail)</div>
<div>Depending on your level of involvement, you will receive the perk which corresponds to your commitment.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am working towards becoming a professional fundraiser for NGOs and individuals who are working towards effecting their environment with positive, active, and meaningful change.</p>
<p>This is my first Indiegogo.com fundraising attempt and I hope to learn more about this process and how I can achieve my goal of helping an NGO called faunaforever.org raise  $ 500 000 next year. It is a big dream, but hey, isnt our ability to dream the force which drives us to greater experiences. </p>
<p>So far my volunteering with NGOs such as Greenpop.org, Lion Encounter, faunaforever.org and many more individuals, has changed my life and brought about a drastic improvement in my appreciation of my purpose. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute funds, your help is still most definitely needed.</p>
<p>Sailcycletrek.org is working towards at least 1000 likes its Facebook page before I set sail from Cape Town, South Africa to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil in January 2014 (again, check out sailcycletrek.org for more details). So please head over there and like the page, and share it if you think your friends would like it too.</p>

<br/><b>Good Peoples: WE DID IT!!<br/><br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!<br/></b>
</h1><h4>
<br/>original fundraising text below---<br/>
</h4><h1><br/></h1><h2><b>We write to you with serious and sobering news. Despite all our efforts it has come to pass that we no longer have sufficient finances to keep Food For Thought Books open. Without a drastic change in circumstance and situation, we will be closing by the end of the year 2013. </b></h2>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></p>
<h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How can this be? </b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our events are frequent, usually unique, and well-attended. We've had  people join our membership program - even had a few choose the lifetime option. We have local groups and organizations reaching out to us for collaborations. We have media groups requesting interviews with us to talk about worker collectives. We have had donations of money and supplies. We know people still value the work we do. We hear and receive that support every day. </span></p>
<h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The main problem is the financial debt incurred by the massive drop in textbook sales over the past couple years - a legacy we are still trying to leave behind. </b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Were it not for this debt, we would be doing fine - the same Food For Thought Books you've always known. But with it, we are bled dry every month. You've all probably noticed it - hard not to. Our shelves have dwindled and thinned, poster and card racks too. This is because we have not had money to invest in new stock. Except for special orders, customers ordering specific titles (money we knew we could quickly recoup), it has all gone to the debt. As a result, the store is becoming a ghost of itself. </span></p>
<h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, here we are: at the end of our rope. </b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Maybe it is time to call it a day. We've been around for a good run: 37 years is no small thing. </span></p>
<h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But really, we're not going to go down without one last effort, one last try. </b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We think Food For Thought Books is worth it. And we think that the Valley still needs Food For Thought Books. There is no other place like it, and no other place that offers what it offers. Where is there another community space like ours in the Valley? Another public queer space? Another feminist space? Another radical space? </span></p>
<h2><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Here's the thing: There is a possibility for Food For Thought Books to make it to and through its 38th year. </b></h2>

original fundraising text below---
We write to you with serious and sobering news. Despite all our efforts it has come to pass that we no longer have sufficient finances to keep Food For Thought Books open. Without a drastic change in circumstance and situation, we will be closing by the end of the year 2013. 

How can this be? 
Our events are frequent, usually unique, and well-attended. We've had  people join our membership program - even had a few choose the lifetime option. We have local groups and organizations reaching out to us for collaborations. We have media groups requesting interviews with us to talk about worker collectives. We have had donations of money and supplies. We know people still value the work we do. We hear and receive that support every day. 
The main problem is the financial debt incurred by the massive drop in textbook sales over the past couple years - a legacy we are still trying to leave behind. 
Were it not for this debt, we would be doing fine - the same Food For Thought Books you've always known. But with it, we are bled dry every month. You've all probably noticed it - hard not to. Our shelves have dwindled and thinned, poster and card racks too. This is because we have not had money to invest in new stock. Except for special orders, customers ordering specific titles (money we knew we could quickly recoup), it has all gone to the debt. As a result, the store is becoming a ghost of itself. 
So, here we are: at the end of our rope. 
Maybe it is time to call it a day. We've been around for a good run: 37 years is no small thing. 
But really, we're not going to go down without one last effort, one last try. 
We think Food For Thought Books is worth it. And we think that the Valley still needs Food For Thought Books. There is no other place like it, and no other place that offers what it offers. Where is there another community space like ours in the Valley? Another public queer space? Another feminist space? Another radical space? 
Here's the thing: There is a possibility for Food For Thought Books to make it to and through its 38th year. 
It will require a lot of work and a lot of support but it can be done, with your help.
  
  We have spoken to our landlord who has agreed to help us reduce our store space by half. In the long run, we feel confident that Food For Thought Books could sustain itself with this new size and rental cost. Many of you remember when we were half our size years ago and that we still did many events, so that can all continue. 
The problem is in getting there. 
To reduce the store, we'll need to wait until after the holiday season. And then the store will need to be closed for anywhere from 3-4 weeks while reconstruction takes place. During this time we will still need to be paying all our regular expenses. With where we are at right now, there is no way we can do this, no way we can keep going for that long without any income to support us. 
So, what we need is support. 
What we need is support for the years we have been here and for the year to come. We are trying to raise $38,000 by the end of the year - a thousand for every year we've been open and a thousand for the year to come. If we can do so, we will be able to get to a more sustainable space for the future. Each Year a Grand Year = $38KWhy $38,000 ?? Good question. When we faced the prospect of closing we just couldn't accept it. So we asked ourselves: How much money would we need to reduce the store by half (back to what we used to be), cover our expenses while doing so, and land in a place where the debt from textbooks isn't bleeding us dry every month.

What will this money go toward? 

It will help cover rent while we are closed and transitioning to a new and smaller space.


It will help cover pay for the workers who will do the work of moving and reconstructing the store.


It will pay for the necessary materials needed to make the transition and reconstruction. 


It will help bring new & awesome books/media into the store.


It will help secure a line of credit that we are negotiating with Cooperative Fund of New England.

And it will keep at bay the debt payments that need to be made while we have no income while being closed. 


We believe that if we can make this transition then Food For Thought Books can continue to serve the Amherst community and the greater Pioneer Valley as it always has - as a bookstore full of books you can't find anywhere else, as a community center for all manner of social justice and progressive communities, and as a safe space for those for who much of the world is still not a safe space. 

We need to raise $5K by the end of November, and the remaining $33K by the end of December, so time is of the essence! Please give now and spread the word to your family and friends. 


Can we do it? We want to believe we can!

<p><b>Our
Pitch</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many people search for the steak that is cooked to perfection, the burger with just the right amount of moist and char, the donut with just the right ratio of melt in their mouth to sweetness. We are on a mission of creating the unforgettable hot wing. Our wings will be moist, and yet crispy on the outside, doused in just the right amount of one of our ten delicious sauces.</p>
<p>AJ’s Wings is YOUR Eastern New Mexico chicken wing restaurant :great food, excellent service and fun, friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>Portales is in need of a unique quick service restaurant and that is exactly what we have in mind with AJ's Wings. We feel the family friendly environment and great food will keep customers coming back for more, whether to enjoy the friendly service, the anticipated downtown patio seating area or just our great food.</p>
<p>After being laid off in March of this year, I have been looking for a new job/career in order to support my family of 6. Numerous attempts to get my foot in the door have led to nothing but rejection emails and frustration. Not knowing where to turn and not sure if we should uproot the family or not, I began pondering different ideas that would allow me to feed my family AND my entrepreneurial spirit, while keeping our kids in the town they have come to call home.</p>
<p>I believe the key to a successful business plan is doing something that you love and have a passion for. When I first moved to Portales in 2009 I felt that there was a need for a good wings place in town. Since that time, we have tried every possible wing option from the local establishments and have yet to find a place that serves something that makes us crave more and want to return again and again. At the risk of sounding like a glutton, chicken wings are something I am passionate about and I have always wanted to be my own boss. Being a college town, Portales is prime for a good wings restaurant.</p>
<p>My wife, Jo, is a third year culinary student, and, having spent a time in Louisiana, is also passionate about great food and hospitality. It is Jo's desire to serve great food, along with her joy of hosting large groups, that will help AJ's thrive. With Jo's expertise and experience in the kitchen, this venture can't help but succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why AJ's</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>One thing that Portales lacks is a quick service chicken wing establishment. There is simply nowhere to get a good chicken wing. However, AJ's will not stop at just good. We will not stop until we reach great. We have a passion for providing great food and an inviting atmosphere.</p>
<p>AJ's Wings will specialize in just that, Wings! Wings are great for any occasion...to celebrate a birthday, while watching your favorite sporting event, a casual get-together with friends, or just to feel a slight burn on a weekday afternoon. Whichever craving you have, AJ's will satisfy it with our amazing wings, delicious side dishes and refreshing lighter menu items such as salads and wraps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our opening day
menu will consist of the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/12667/files/20130814164017-Menu.jpg?1376523617"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will also take a slight spin on the traditional quick service restaurant by adding an outdoor patio area where our clients can dine and enjoy the sights and sounds of the downtown area,</p>
<p>either in the sun or under the stars. This area will be used for general dining, local gatherings, live music and, of course, hanging with friends. The downtown area of Portales is in dire need of something new and we feel that by creating a patio where locals can hang out and enjoy great food, amazing service and just feel at home, we will be serving a need that is being left unfilled by other businesses in the area. Our patio will include a sound wall to for noise control as well as a built-in fire pit to set the cozy and inviting mood that we want to provide for our customers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our
Need, Your Reward</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Traditional financing is not an option for Aaron and me. We feel that corporate banks couldn't care less about the little people and only care too much about the bottom line and how much they will make on a deal. This is why we feel that finding investors who genuinely want to try our product and have an interest in seeing us succeed is such a great option.</p>
<p>Our available initial investment is not enough to begin operations, but will be added to the funding received.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order for us
to open our doors we will need to strive for the following funding levels:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/14299/files/20130815121755-FundGraph.jpg?1376594275"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Feel free to give early and often. Your total investment will dictate your reward level. Every funder at the $50 level (and up) will receive a custom AJ's Wings t-shirt</p>
<p>Additionally, most funders will receive free meal combos redeemable after we have been established for a period of time.</p>
<p>Please note that funders who are not part of the local community will be offered additional t-shirts and merchandise in lieu of free lunch combos. We are working on a couple limited edition shirts that will only be available to our funders.</p>
<p>This Eye Heart Wings tee will only be available for funders who are not in the local area and donate $25 or more to our project:</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13253/files/20130814224430-IHeartWingsTee.jpg?1376545470"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>This We Like It Saucy tee will be used as our promotional tee for all funders who qualify:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13212/files/20130814220941-WeLikeitSaucyTee.jpg?1376543381"" src="""" style=""text-align: center;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our top funders will receive VIP cards good for discount off our menu items. This discount will be good for a period of 3 years. Top funders will also receive a commemorative engraved stone, which will be used in the building of our patio. These stones will forever recognize the contributions made by our funders and local community.</p>
<p>Other items such as soft opening invites, patio opening invites</p>
<p>and private parties/catered events are also available. We are even offering funders the opportunity to create and name their own sauce.</p>
<p>Rewards redeemable after 3 months of operations. Lunch certificates and VIP card will be mailed to backers. Limit 1 free lunch per month. *VIP card good once per day. **Alcohol not included if available. Event not to exceed 2 hours and is limited to schedule availability</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Giving
Back </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We realize that we cannot do this alone, which is why we have created this page, and we want to give back to our community. Having lived paycheck to paycheck for most of our lives, we understand the importance of being able to get out from under financial burdens. This is why within 6 months of opening our doors, AJ's will generate 2 part-time positions in the Portales community with wages above minimum wage. Our employees will share in our vision for great food, excellent service and community outreach.</p>
<p>Additionally, AJ's Wings will give 2% of its first year revenues to charity. Specifically, we would like to give to Chive Charities as we have seen the wonderful things that the Chive has done for so many people. It is an amazing community of selfless people who truly care about bettering other people's lives. We will aim to raise the amount given every year, but it will never drop below 2%. Chive Charities is an amazing foundation and they deserve all the help they can get. KCCO</p>

</p><p><span>
</span></p><p>I need help. Not that kind. I might need a psychiatrist but
that will have to be later.  The bank is
on the brink of foreclosing on my home and I don’t know what else I can do to
stop it.  I am not working, although I
used to.  I worked for the government for
years and years and years and years.  You
get the idea.  Until I could work there
no more.  So I retired.  I thought I could live on my retirement.  Frugally but still live.  I was wrong. After taxes and insurance my
little retirement package dwindled down to next to nothing. I certainly can’t
live on that.  I mean really, who
could?  So I tried starting my own
business but nobody hired me.  So then I
went to refurbishing furniture. Nobody bought it. I wrote a book. Nobody read
it.  Have you ever read Shel Silverstein’s
“Nobody ”? I’m the person with no
peaches’ or pears.</p>
<p>In the last 2 months I have applied for over 50 jobs and I
got 3 interviews.  The 1st one, a thrift
store, said I couldn’t lift the weight. 
The 2<sup>nd</sup> one, a dollar store said I wasn’t qualified. The 3<sup>rd</sup>
one said they hired someone on Friday. My interview was on Monday.  They were so sorry they forgot to call me.</p>
<p>It’s not that things weren’t bad enough as I started
scouting out bridges and underpasses for my next home but I took in my elderly
crazy sister.  My cuz called me and said
do you know your sister is homeless? I
didn’t.  Next thing I know she’s living here.  Who’s crazy now? This might sound like a humanitarian
act.  It wasn’t.  I weighed which option would cause <i>me</i> less stress. Her living with me or
her living out on the street.  Her living
with me won.  I’m now having doubts on my
choice.  Apparently she doesn’t shower.
She can’t use a vacuum cleaner, washing machine or dishwasher.  Although she has no problems with the TV,
stove or microwave.  So she is not
technology challenged. She has managed
to turn me into her servant.  So maybe
she’s not so crazy after all.  But I got
to tell you.  If I end up living under a
bridge she’s not coming with me.  She’s
going to have to find her own bridge.</p>
<p>But I digress.  I’m
doing this out of sheer desperation because I’m losing my home.  The home I grew my kids in.  The home that I have made my own with the
weird little touches only I would do.  The
place my miniature dachshund guards.  And
I want to keep it. I want it to be the place
I lay my head at night and cook my oatmeal in in the morning.  Crowdfunding seems to have worked for others
and I know it seems only one step above holding up a sign “Help The Poor” in a
Walmart parking lot.  But with just little
help from a lot of you this crazy cat lady can live out her life in peace and
harmony.</p>
<p>So look around you. 
What if this was you and you were in my shoes?  Just like me everything you own of value
would be up for sale on Ebay.  Your car
would be for sale.  You too would quit
eating and consider food a luxury.  And
isn’t it amazing that Ramen, which has no food value, is so fattening?  Now do what I would do if I were in your
shoes and make a contribution to my cause. 
Five, ten, twenty, a thousand, a trillion.  Just whatever you feel you can afford.  It will all be equally appreciated. And you can go to sleep tonight knowing you
did your good deed for the day.</p>
<p>And I’m thanking you in advance because I know you’re going
to help.  I just know it.</p>

</ul><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","I need help. Not that kind. I might need a psychiatrist but
that will have to be later.  The bank is
on the brink of foreclosing on my home and I don’t know what else I can do to
stop it.  I am not working, although I
used to.  I worked for the government for
years and years and years and years.  You
get the idea.  Until I could work there
no more.  So I retired.  I thought I could live on my retirement.  Frugally but still live.  I was wrong. After taxes and insurance my
little retirement package dwindled down to next to nothing. I certainly can’t
live on that.  I mean really, who
could?  So I tried starting my own
business but nobody hired me.  So then I
went to refurbishing furniture. Nobody bought it. I wrote a book. Nobody read
it.  Have you ever read Shel Silverstein’s
“Nobody ”? I’m the person with no
peaches’ or pears.
In the last 2 months I have applied for over 50 jobs and I
got 3 interviews.  The 1st one, a thrift
store, said I couldn’t lift the weight. 
The 2nd one, a dollar store said I wasn’t qualified. The 3rd
one said they hired someone on Friday. My interview was on Monday.  They were so sorry they forgot to call me.
It’s not that things weren’t bad enough as I started
scouting out bridges and underpasses for my next home but I took in my elderly
crazy sister.  My cuz called me and said
do you know your sister is homeless? I
didn’t.  Next thing I know she’s living here.  Who’s crazy now? This might sound like a humanitarian
act.  It wasn’t.  I weighed which option would cause me less stress. Her living with me or
her living out on the street.  Her living
with me won.  I’m now having doubts on my
choice.  Apparently she doesn’t shower.
She can’t use a vacuum cleaner, washing machine or dishwasher.  Although she has no problems with the TV,
stove or microwave.  So she is not
technology challenged. She has managed
to turn me into her servant.  So maybe
she’s not so crazy after all.  But I got
to tell you.  If I end up living under a
bridge she’s not coming with me.  She’s
going to have to find her own bridge.
But I digress.  I’m
doing this out of sheer desperation because I’m losing my home.  The home I grew my kids in.  The home that I have made my own with the
weird little touches only I would do.  The
place my miniature dachshund guards.  And
I want to keep it. I want it to be the place
I lay my head at night and cook my oatmeal in in the morning.  Crowdfunding seems to have worked for others
and I know it seems only one step above holding up a sign “Help The Poor” in a
Walmart parking lot.  But with just little
help from a lot of you this crazy cat lady can live out her life in peace and
harmony.
So look around you. 
What if this was you and you were in my shoes?  Just like me everything you own of value
would be up for sale on Ebay.  Your car
would be for sale.  You too would quit
eating and consider food a luxury.  And
isn’t it amazing that Ramen, which has no food value, is so fattening?  Now do what I would do if I were in your
shoes and make a contribution to my cause. 
Five, ten, twenty, a thousand, a trillion.  Just whatever you feel you can afford.  It will all be equally appreciated. And you can go to sleep tonight knowing you
did your good deed for the day.
And I’m thanking you in advance because I know you’re going
to help.  I just know it.

With your Contribution we can take our next important steps in developing our Innovation.  Imagine what the world would be like with the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM!  It would be a better and safer world where you can relax and enjoy a safer travel experience.The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is my Patent Pending innovation, which is in the 'Development of Concept' phase and I will soon be ready to build the Prototype!What is the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM? The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is one step ahead in leading edge, vehicle safety feature innovations! This device monitors Brain Waves, and alerts the vehicle operator immediately, as soon as drowsiness begins. LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM - HEADBAND COMPONENT - Monitors Brainwaves                                                                                            You have never seen anything like this before! This device will save tens of thousands of lives each year.  While operating a vehicle drowsiness and falling asleep is a huge problem!  The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM will solve this problem! If drowsy the vehicle operator will receive an alert consisting of both audio and visual signals/information.  The vehicle operator receives an alert as soon as drowsiness begins.  And, driving should not resume until the driver is alert.  This device will help prevent falling asleep while driving, and therefore will help vehicle operators avoid accidents on the road. Travel will become much safer.Future enhancements for this system especially designed for transport trucks are already in the planning phase and include alerting the vehicle operator of changing road conditions 100 meters to the front,  as well as monitoring the vehicle operator's temperature and pulse.The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM consists of a light-weight Headband enhanced with new technology and designed for your comfort while you operate a vehicle, even if worn all day. LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM - HEADBAND COMPONENT                                                                                                              This innovative Headband is adapted with leading edge, new technology  designed to record and monitor the vehicle operator’s brain waves.  By monitoring brain waves, drowsiness is detected immediately at the source. The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is unique since it is designed to provide an immediate alert  as soon as the vehicle operator's brainwaves change and if drowsiness begins for any reason.  The device monitors the vehicle operator’s brain waves for alertness/drowsiness to determine if one is awake or beginning to fall asleep.If the vehicle operator becomes drowsy or begins to fall asleep, or is on any type of medication affecting the vehicle operator's alertness, alarm signals will begin immediately. The alarm signals will alert the vehicle operator immediately as soon as drowsiness begins.  Because this device monitors brainwaves, it is highly fine tuned and can sense drowsiness immediately.  The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is the only alertness device that provides accurate alarms in enough time to help avoid a vehicle accident.  The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM  also consists of an enhanced Processor installed into the vehicle. This is technology central for the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM and can be further enhanced with many additional features such as the ability to provide information about temperature and pulse, along with accurately monitoring brain waves. In addition to monitoring brain waves to notify the driver when drowsiness occurs there are future enhancements in the works.  Future enhancements of the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM  for transport trucks will include the ability to record traffic conditions up to 100 meters distance in front of the vehicle.  Also, a potential future optional feature (presently in development phase) is additional monitoring of information/communication between the vehicle operator and an emergency response center.The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM  integrates a professional, commercial quality Headband, blue tooth technology, and micro-computer chip, together with an enhanced Processor, along with the newest in computer/electronic technology. Alerts are both audio and video, and recorded for future recovery.The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is the one and only vehicle monitor awareness system capable of detecting drowsiness as soon as it begins, fine tuned to immediately detect the slightest change in the vehicle operator's brain waves.  This brain wave feature is of utmost importance since it is the only way to  provide an immediate, accurate drowsiness alert.  A drowsiness alert delay of minutes or seconds would be the difference between life and death when operating a vehicle! By remaining alert and awake when operating a vehicle you will enjoy  less injuries and deaths due to tragic vehicle accidents, and safer travels!Insurance companies are sure to offer significant discounts to individuals and corporations who purchase a LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM for their vehicle operator. The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM will help you relax, and enjoy your travel experience.                     KEN HENSHAW - INNOVATOR -  Fallfest, Hamilton, ON.              - Enjoyed a full day of Meet & Greet the Public -                                                                                                                                     SELF & BACKGROUNDI have over 25 years of successful experience as a Computer Engineer Support Technician, specializing in Computer Room Support and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).Also, I am the successful Innovator/Inventor of:1) High Technology Golf Club Cleaner; cleans golf clubs by means of Sound Wave Technology.  2) Custom Design Power Source for Computerized Power Distribution.                                                  Ken Henshaw, Innovator,                                                 hrds1933@gmail.com                                 What We Need & What You Get                                                      Most of the Contributions will provide funding to build                                                       the Prototype for the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM.                                                       With your Contribution together we can help Save Lives!                                                  FUNDING DETAILS – GOAL $7,800WHAT WE NEED! - GOAL $7,800Prototype                             $3,860Beta Unit- componentsGrant Application                 $700Business Incorporation      $600 % indiegogo facilitators      $780Video Filming/Editing         $ 300   Marketing &                          $1,560Campaign Management    _______TOTAL                                    $7,800       PERKS – WHAT YOU GET!

                                      SAVE LIVES! If the operator of a vehicle on the road, on the water, or in the sky begins to fall asleep, or is intoxicated, or alertness level is affected by medications, or for any reason awareness level is decreased then brainwave frequencies change.  When a driver is no longer alert because brainwaves are detected to be at a drowsy frequency the operator will be alerted via vibration device installed in the Headband (along with audio/visual alarms).  Lives will be saved!Also, an optional feature for the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is the ability to connect the vehicle operator with an Emergency Call Center, monitored 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, by medical professionals.Future additional features for the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM designed for transport trucks are enhancements to monitor safety conditions on the road ie. alert if the road ahead is blocked up to 100 meters due to accident, fallen tree, or in poor vision quality (fog, snow) and alerts if there is an obstacle.The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM gives the operator information about how to make safe, informed decisions.  This device will save over 10,000 lives per year, just in North America alone.  The vision is to expand World-Wide and make the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM available internationally.                                                       RISKS AND CHALLENGESOverall there are almost no risks and challenges in developing and promoting the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM.  The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM is an enhanced, leading edge headband device that will save tens of thousands of lives per year.The only small risk or obstacle may be in the time it takes to be accepted by the Gov’t, Department of Transport, and the Police Department to have this new device, the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM mandated for all vehicles.                                            HOW TO OVERCOME RISKS AND CHALLENGESThe LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM will save hundreds and thousands of lives each year throughout North America.  The minor challenge of being quickly integrated and promoted by the Gov’t, Department of Transport, and the Police Department will be overcome with the strong plan that I have set in place to lobby these agencies directly.  Once they are completely informed with the facts and figures they will quickly be on board.My vision is to soon have the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM mandated by law.  Once 100,000 units of the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM system is in use by the public then approximately 1,000 lives per year will be saved from vehicle accidents in North America. The LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM once developed to its full potential will go international.I have incorporated strong Research & Development which will be ongoing.  Research & Development is key to highly profitable progress with the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM in order to keep updated and one step ahead.                                                      Ken Henshaw, Innovator                                               hrds1933@gmail.com                                                                    More Ways You Can HelpPlease know that all contributions large or small are very much appreciated and helpful!  It's easy to support our campaign - you can Contribute on-line by clicking on the Heart (top right of home page) or clicking on one of the Perks.  All Contributions through Indiegogo are safe & secure by means of Credit Card or Paypal.Some people are unable to contribute at this time, but there are still important ways that you can help!                                                         WAYS YOU CAN HELPYou can help us take our concept for developing my new innovation the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM from the drawing board to reality with your investment contribution. You can also help us to develop this new, High Technology innovation the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM by getting the word out there to your family, friends, colleagues, and through your social media such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Please encourage everyone to check out our campaign!Also, please use the indiegogo ""Share Tools"" to get the word out there.  Make a noise!  Let everyone know about our exciting, new innovation the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM.  We have the technology – together we can make it happen!Envision a new world!  A world of safety!  It’s a new world with the LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM and with your investment contribution in support of our campaign, together we can SAVE LIVES!             THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFESAVER CAMPAIGN!LIFESAVER MONITOR SYSTEM Ken Henshawhrds1933@gmail.com And that's all there is to it!Copyright Ken Henshaw 2016",8.0,0,"5 Campaigns

A BBA in marketing, with a focus on entrepreneurship and digital media, Myles provides the strategy and marketing angle on how to most effectively identify opportunities and how to leverage the web to get there. Kind of like Spiderman ('web', get it?).  Being apart of producing a YouTube channel that today has over 3.4 million views, video was his spark for a content creation passion. Myles' goal is to maximize the potential of clients digital and content strategy through integrating design, development and business, as well as bridge the communication gap between those departments.With years of self driven passion, Connor has taught himself everything that makes him the Batman of content creation. A perfectionist, who knows how to build almost anything and everything creative. Having worked on productions for National Geographic and History Channel, Connor holds himself to high standards. His pen tool does not rest until everything is perfect. With a comprehensive understanding and appreciation of business goals, Connor integrates purpose and design flawlessly.Myles Galvin and Connor McGuire are the Co-Founders, hereinafter referred to as ""we"".We bring an array of skills to the table and together, we complement one another like Batman and Spiderman. They compliment one another in a cool, awesome kind of way, right? I mean, if they lived in the same comic book universe kind of thing...          Artfully crafted animations that portray your brand in ways traditional video can't. Like the video above.With the combination of digital strategy, interactive design and creative thinking, our innovative approach focuses on integrating functionality and style into your website.            Viral doesn’t just happen, it is consistent multi-channel engagement and real time communication. At the heart of every digital campaign is stunning, meaningful and valuable content, designed to connect with communities through specific channels. Creating videos accumulating over 3 million views to high quality travel videos and commercials to working on shows produced for National Geographic and History Channel, our experiences are rich. We've got you covered from concept to delivery and beyondWe have decided to launch a micro-campaign to cover some upfront startup costs, which are primarily legal (incorporation) fees. There are a very limited amount of perks available as the services are being heavily discounted, hence ""micro-campaign"".The perks we are offering are coupons to our services. Please do not hesitate to contact us before purchasing a perk.info@smartcitymedia.co             For a few months we had been discussing the idea of launching our own business revolving around 'video stuff'. We have both been doing freelance videography for years and realized that we are both capable of producing some pretty cool content.Once the word leaked around the office that we were launching Smart City Media, we received a lot of interest in our services, which gave us confidence that we were filling a market need.After a two month trial run with a couple of select clients, we are excited to go forward with incorporating Smart City Media. This will ensure that both us and our clients will be working within a proper business structure.Being on the same page and all, neither of us wanted to go through the tangled experience of mixing business and personal expenses within a personal bank account ever again. For those of us who have experienced that, we know how jumbled that can get.The main purpose for this Indiegogo campaign is to raise enough money so that we can cover those upfront legal costs to set the business structure in place.  The remainder of the budget will go towards office equipment, labour and other operational overhead.If we surpass our goal, we will invest in equipment that will up our production value big time and expand our service offerings. A couple things we don't shut up about: DJI Phantom Quadrocopter Go Pro Hero             We want to be able to film from the sky.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Aloha,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are two sweetie pies that are here to bring abundance of happiness and health to your sweet tooth.  Our  names are Ahna Austin and Adriana Zollo and here is our story. We have known each other since we were little children and grew up through some interesting times. When college happened we parted ways and reunited after six years in our home town Port Jefferson, New York. After telling her my story and how I ended up in Hawaii she was convinced that this was her path to a health concise lifestyle. </div>
<div>With my knowledge of raw and healthy foods and Adriana's creative mind, we brought to life The Rawdue Pies. They are not only pies, they are a way to bring family and friends together. Food is a bonding experience for most people and cultures, and we want you to have the full experience! </div>
<div>The Rawdue Pies are a play off of Fondue, hence the name Rawdue. You may choose from a couple options of crusts! Once you choose the crust you decide on a few options from nuts, coconut, fresh fruit, dried fruit, cacao and much more! They will be presented in the center of the table with your crust...and then the fun begins!</div>
<div>We want to bring more life to the city of Paia and for there to be a place to go to at night where young people can socialize in a healthy environment. Currently the options are very limited and we are just envisioning a place where local artists could show their work, network, and enjoy great food! We want this to be up and running within the end of this year! Our goal is high but our intention is to bring on something exciting for a town that has become overrun by tourists and there is a need for a nightly scene with a creative twist! We hope that you are just as excited as us! </div>
<div>Also, 20% of the money we make will go towards the city of Paia to try and create a ""green"" common space. Currently we are trying to find out from the town hall where this could be possible. However, we want to expand our ideas throughout the community and make sure that we give back as well! Paia, Hawaii is a place that is loaded with many people coming in and out of it everyday, but there is no public area that can be enjoyed for just sitting, eating, or socializing. We want this to happen!! This town needs more unity and more positivity! </div>
<p>Ahna and I are currently working at Farmer's Markets to sell our Raw desserts to spread the buzz and once we raise the funds from indiegogo and all the wonderful sponsors we will be ready to move forward with the entire plan! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This new craze is here for you. All you health concise, guilty pleasure, sweet tooth, social bugs...well you have found the right spot. The reason for these delectable treats is to bring friends and family together for a sweet treat while good for you mind body and soul. The main ingredients in the crust of the pies are nuts, dates, and coconut.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The city we live in Paia, Hawaii is a very happening town. There a lot of cute stores and some sweet restaurants. When it comes to the night scene there doesn't seem to be a lot of activities. The main thing to do is go to the bars, but what about the health concise crowd? Well our idea is to have a shop that allows people to come together and what better way then with something sweet? The concept of the pies is there will be a crust and the base of the pie. Chocolate turtle pie, raw cheese cake pie, or..........Then there would be the options of many different toppings such as fruits that are in season, toasted coconut, goji berries, and cacao nibs. There will be also options of some raw sauces to add the to the pallet of your creation. Its the RAWDUE! A new way to bring people together. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This campaign is very important! We are trying to expand people's knowledge of their health through food and make a place where more social interaction can take place during the evenings! Also, just envision a cute small touristy town that is about a block long and full of people without a public green space! We want to use some of our funds to make this happen! The city will benefit in the long run and it will breath new life into the community and inspire others to make a change as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are shooting for the stars! We are looking to raise about 15,000 and 20% of this will be going towards making a campaign for a green space in the city of Paia, and the rest will go towards our 'Rawdue"" lounge. We are looking for support, and thats all we can ask for. Well if you are going to aim high might as well shoot for the stars right? We would love to manifest 15,000 to support us in creating our dream come true. We have no other funding sources and just heard about this website.</div>
<p>We believe in our goal and want you to as well! Also, some of the proceeds will go towards  our ingredients in bringing these pies to restaurants in the Paia area. We want to spread the mana so our goal is to get these pies out there and hopefully it shall spread and people will eat amazing treats guilt free! :) All in all the proceeds are going towards ingredients, investing in a space, and then donating some to the city. Therefore our goal is high!</p>

San Jose State Ice Hockey Club is a 22 year member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA Div 2).  The ACHA is the largest Collegiate Hockey League in the U.S. boasting 450 teams in total with more than 200 of these teams participating in Men's Division 2.   The ACHA Div 2 National Tournament features the best  teams from the Northeast, Central, Southeast and Western divisions with teams winning their Regional Playoffs tournaments to qualify.  The Spartans have made it to the ACHA National Tournament TEN times in its 23 year history, this year being the third time in the past 5 years!   Although the Spartans have not come home with the National Title in its previous campaigns, we believe that with our mix of talent, skill, coaching and heart on this years team that this is our time, and we will accept nothing less than a championship for SJSU! 



As a club sport, we do not get the necessary funding from our University to cover the expenses for our season which has a budget of $150,000+not including post season play.  This budget is funded by player dues (over $4000 per player), merchandise and ticket sales, sponsorships, community outreach and tax deductible donations.  This is where we need YOUR help to get to Nationals in Boston and proudly represent the University.  As a thank you for your generosity, we have some great incentives and your donation is tax deductible.

acid burning on an annual basis. This, according to analysts a gross
underestimation since there were 494 judicial cases on acid attacks against

<p>It is happening in all areas of India i.e.
poor and rich neighborhoods, rural and urban areas, Hindu and Muslim dominated
regions. Women are simply not safe in India. They have no freedom and therefore
no real life. </p>

live behind veils and walls. This needs to change and with an emergency.
Because, we, the people associated with Stop Acid Attacks campaign, are angry
with the way our women are being treated. The one who gives birth cannot be and
should not be subjected to such inhuman violence anymore in the only country
where people call her “Motherland”. We do need to understand that every girl is

<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>1.  Can my business use its own greeting, messages and
advertisement recordings?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely! The system has been
designed to allow businesses the ability of using their own greetings,
SMS messages and complete advertisements.
The recording is easily uploaded to the contest system via the
web.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>2.  Can we have multiple greetings and messages?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Yes, certainly! Our contest have
been designed to provide the most flexibility possible. You may select a
different greeting and message for each contest. This will allow the greeting
and message to be specific to a particular contest or recorded in the voice of
the current personality.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>3.  Can we track the progress of a contest?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Possibly one of the most attractive
features of our contest, is the ability to actually MONITOR a running
contest. Our system captures contest statistics as the contest is running and
displays the information for you to view on the web. This provides instant
feedback of what areas you are currently calling and the interest level in your
contest. This information allows you the ability to increase
call in response while a contest is still in progress!<br/><br/>
The contest data that is captured is available for review, even weeks after
running a contest. Armed with this information, your business will have
statistics to analyze good and bad timing and experiment with different
promotion types.<br/><br/>
Now you will KNOW how your contests are really doing!</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>4.  Can contests be pre-scheduled?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Busy campaign directors will
enjoy the advance scheduling flexibility offered by using our automated system.
An unlimited number of contests may be scheduled to run at specific times. Each
contest may be a different type, have different messages, have different
advertising targets and allow for live transfer or voice mail handling. Reports
are available on the web to check scheduling and monitor contest progress.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>5.  How can we be sure contestants listen to
advertising?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Our systems have been designed to
ensure callers hear your advertising message in a easy contest verification process BEFORE they hear what number
listener they are. This thwarts auto-dialers and ensures better chances for all
who call your contest. This helps businesses promote fair contests, especially
for your big ticket prizes. We even offer advanced call control features, which
can ensure only one entry per contest, etc.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>6.  What format sound files are supported?</span></a></b></p>
<p> Our system
supports MP3 files, however, we may not be able to process all possible types.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>7.  What happens if a contestant hangs up?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Contestants that hang-up before
hearing their contestant sequence number does not count and the system does not
increment the sequence number. This prevents auto-dialers from rapid dialing
and ensures your advertisers message hits the mark.<br/><br/>
For callers that match the selected winning number, our state-of-the-art
equipment captures the caller's phone number and displays it on the contest
statistics web page. This allows for a call-back, in the event of transfer
disconnection or other difficulties.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>8.  What equipment do we need to use our contest ?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Two things are required to use the
system:<br/>
A) Internet access - for pre-scheduling, statistics and reports<br/>
B) Dedicated contest telephone - only for transferred contestants</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>9. Can we block nuisance callers?</span></a></b></p>
<p>Yes, positively! Repetitive winners
and nuisance callers can be screened from participating in your contests. A
special entry screen is available on the web, that allows you to maintain a
list of blocked phone numbers. Callers that are blocked simply receive a busy
signal and will be completely unaware they have been blocked. This feature is
included at no extra charge.</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.contestcontrol.com/cc/questions_answers.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>10. How many contest run codes can we use?</span></a></b></p>
<p>As many as you wish (addt'l fee may
apply). Typically a business will use one contest code, but multiple
numbers are allowed. Different numbers may be assigned for different contest
types.</p>

Support Home-Based Business, Ivy Soapworks and Candleworks</b></p>
<p>We have been making homemade soap since 1999.<span>  Every cottage business needs a place to offer
their wares.  In addition to internet
sales, we’ve have had booths at several Renaissance Festivals across the
US.  A few years ago, we sold our booths,
and entered semi-retirement.</span></p>
<p>Since that time, we have had many requests to
return.<span>  We discovered that retirement is
not all it is cracked up to be.  We have
greatly missed the fun, the camaraderie, and the one–to-one interactions with
our customers. We think there’s no better way to spend a sunny fall afternoon
than cutting soap, listening to live bagpipe music, and interacting with all
those who wander into our shop. </span></p>
<p>This year, we were offered a unique opportunity to
come out of our semi-retirement and buy a booth at the Kansas City Renaissance
Festival, just in time for their 2014 season, which runs: </p><p><strong>August 30th - October 13th • Open Weekends and Labor Day <br/> 10am - 7pm •  Rain or Shine<br/> Open Columbus Day, October 13th from  10am - 5pm </strong></p><p><span>We were thrilled to
accept.  Then, the reality of what we had
agreed to do set in.  Starting from zero
and filling an entire booth for a massive show like KC is a staggering amount of
work.  It costs, a lot.  The work we can handle. We enjoy the
challenge.  The money is where things get
difficult. Normally, we would save money over the course of the year to fund a
large show, budgeting in bulk amounts of supplies, booth payments, and
fees.  The surprise gift of rejoining the
crafters at KC has stretched the limits of our budget.  We need help to get started.  Once we do, the profits from each season will
pay the preparation costs of the one following. </span></p>

</ul><p>What happens if we don’t reach our
goal?</p>
<p>Ivy Soapworks is committed to being
at the Faire this year.<span>  If we do not
reach our $12,000 goal, we will not have a permanent location.  We have a fantastic spot picked out for this
year.  It is easy to find, convenient,
and ideally suited to our needs.  Without
full funding we might have to change location, or go from a booth to a tent.  We will have inventory, but not as much as we
would like.  Your favorite scents might
sell out, only to reappear a week or two later. 
We are planning on expanding our line and adding some new scents.  That would not happen if we are not fully
funded. We will still have bad jokes on
our Soap Opera Sign, but they might not be as funny. </span></p>
<p>Why Help Ivy Soapworks?<span>  </span></p>
<p>You have a budget just like us.<span>  When you buy something new, you know just how
much you can spend.  You know where your
money goes.  Ours goes to the same places.  When you buy a bar of soap from us, the
profit we make pays our mortgage, groceries, and utilities.  You are helping other individuals like
yourself cover the expenses of life. Home-based
businesses expand and stabilize the economy. Your support allows the middle
class to flourish, improving the lives of normal people.  You aren’t making the rich richer.</span></p>
<p>Ivy Soapworks had a successful Renaissance
Festival career for 10 years.<span>  We bought
2 booths, and built another before our semi-retirement.  During that time we won awards, gave
interviews, appeared in publications and blogs, and heard “you are the best soap
ever” many times over.  We’ve been
invited to sell at other Faires in California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Texas, Ohio, and
New York.  Selling soap at Faires is not
just what we do; it’s what we’re best at. 
It took semi-retirement to drive that point home.  Help us grow.</span></p>
<p>Money isn’t the only way you can
contribute.<span>  We also need everyone to
spread the news that Ivy Soapworks is coming back to the Kansas City
Renaissance Festival.  Post it on
Facebook, Text it, Tweet it, email it to your entire address book.  Share this campaign with everyone you know.</span></p>

Thanks so much for your support.<span>  We can’t wait to see all our old friends
again, and we’re really excited to meet all the new ones.</span></div>","Help

the Kansas City Renaissance Festival, a very loud and public presentation of
the Holy Bath Scepter of Cleanliness outside of our booth on your first visit,
a gift basket (up to a $35 value), and a thank you on our Facebook page (unless
you wish to remain anonymous).
What happens if we don’t reach our
goal?
Ivy Soapworks is committed to being
at the Faire this year.  If we do not
reach our $12,000 goal, we will not have a permanent location.  We have a fantastic spot picked out for this
year.  It is easy to find, convenient,
and ideally suited to our needs.  Without
full funding we might have to change location, or go from a booth to a tent.  We will have inventory, but not as much as we
would like.  Your favorite scents might
sell out, only to reappear a week or two later. 
We are planning on expanding our line and adding some new scents.  That would not happen if we are not fully
funded. We will still have bad jokes on
our Soap Opera Sign, but they might not be as funny. 
Why Help Ivy Soapworks?  
You have a budget just like us.  When you buy something new, you know just how
much you can spend.  You know where your
money goes.  Ours goes to the same places.  When you buy a bar of soap from us, the
profit we make pays our mortgage, groceries, and utilities.  You are helping other individuals like
yourself cover the expenses of life. Home-based
businesses expand and stabilize the economy. Your support allows the middle
class to flourish, improving the lives of normal people.  You aren’t making the rich richer.
Ivy Soapworks had a successful Renaissance
Festival career for 10 years.  We bought
2 booths, and built another before our semi-retirement.  During that time we won awards, gave
interviews, appeared in publications and blogs, and heard “you are the best soap
ever” many times over.  We’ve been
invited to sell at other Faires in California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Texas, Ohio, and
New York.  Selling soap at Faires is not
just what we do; it’s what we’re best at. 
It took semi-retirement to drive that point home.  Help us grow.
Money isn’t the only way you can
contribute.  We also need everyone to
spread the news that Ivy Soapworks is coming back to the Kansas City
Renaissance Festival.  Post it on
Facebook, Text it, Tweet it, email it to your entire address book.  Share this campaign with everyone you know.

Thanks so much for your support.  We can’t wait to see all our old friends
again, and we’re really excited to meet all the new ones.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Imagine, that your washing machine, fridge, television or any other things in the house get broken and you want to fix them, since they are not so old that you should replace them with new ones.</p>
<p>Any other example? Your garbage disposal is clogged, faucet is broken, short circuit problem with an electrical socket, or your car gets broken and you are left alone on the roadside in other city or even country and there is nobody you know.</p>
<p>All these things have one thing in common and that is their solution. In most cases, a person sits down at a computer or picks up the phone and begins to search services, repair stores and does all things necessary, which takes over half an hour sometimes.</p>
<p>However, you can solve any of these problems with this application and just in a few seconds.</p>
<p>Let´s have another example. You are left alone with your broken car on the roadside, 500 km from home and the nearest cities are 40 km away from you. You simply choose a car service in this application, you select your current location, distance 50 km and IGS will show you a list of all available car services within a radius of 50 km. Then, just one click and service or all shown services will get your information like name, phone number, current location and short info- broken car. <br/>This service will receive your request and accept it with just one click and since they already have all information and location about you, they will send you a help. You are able to arrange and manage all of this and even more with IGS in a very short time.</p>

<p>Every
user, who creates an account on IGS platform will be able to use it
as a social network with common features. However, we want to expand
IGS of functions, that will improve communication between users and
companies, such as  videochat, calling through a mobile network, a
bazaar, targeted ads based on user´s interests ( option to disable
ads), saving  your own C.V. and then searching for job offers that
meet  job requirements, different kinds of discounts and much more.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What
makes IGS different from others? It is its ability to deal promptly
with problems and emergencies. The users will no longer have to
search companies, services and contact them, since this may be very
annoying and  take a lot of time. IGS will contact all business and
services that you need in your area or in a selected location.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All
users can also add and create a company account and a public company
profile to their current account, which will be available for all
users of IGS platform.  Besides the fact, that your company will get
noticed and visible, you will get access to various contracts, that
other companies entered in the system, you will get access to C.V. of
users, who are qualified and interested to work in your sector, CMS
system, the possibility of billing, creating of targeted ads and
offers, that will not unnecessarily appear to users with different
range of interest, enter various discounts, which will be presented
in IGS by form of  Discount portal and much more functions.

<p>Thanks
to your
help and ideas,
IGS will
be fully adapted
to the requirements of
user who will be
able to choose and set
everything that
he will need the application for.
 The
basic application available for the current  user and the
company can be supplemented with those downloadable additional
modules, that you want to use, so you will avoid having many icons
and functions that you will never need and use on user´s desktop.
IGS will be also an open system, in which the users will be able to
create their own modules or customize the design of platform.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
greatest challenge for our team will be fast and stable working of
IGS application. It means, that we need to create servers, that will
be able to work fast and reliably despite a high load. At the
beginning, we also need to provide enough of storage space for
databases and files of users. Every contribution
will help, so the application
will use the highest quality servers with sufficient storage space
and it will provide you with the highest quality services.

<p>IGOSIMPLE
will be the application, which will support international
databases.  Since this is not a small project and it requires
considerable funds, we decided to fund the start-up through
crowdfunding.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Why
Indiegogo? In our opinion, it is one of the best, if not the best of
all crowdfunding websites on the internet and it has already
supported many projects, which are successful. 
</p>
<p>For
us, this is not only the opportunity to run this project but also it
is a very good way how to promote ourselves and remain independent. 
</p>
<p>As
we would like to run this project together with people, we will be
very grateful if they contribute financially, but they are also
welcome to contribute their ideas and suggestions to IGS project. You
can share your ideas on our website <a href=""www.igosimple.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.igosimple.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.igosimple.com</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span><span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span><span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span><span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span><span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span><span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span></p>

<p>All
contributions received from you will be used for successful start-up
of IGS project. Since there is a huge amount of data, it is not
possible to rent data storage and servers. Therefore, we need to
provide our own servers and data storage which is about 20% of grants collected. The rest of the finances will be
redistributed to development of website and applications, to all
necessary equipment and to the wages for the programmer and support crew.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Imagine, that your washing machine, fridge, television or any other things in the house get broken and you want to fix them, since they are not so old that you should replace them with new ones.
Any other example? Your garbage disposal is clogged, faucet is broken, short circuit problem with an electrical socket, or your car gets broken and you are left alone on the roadside in other city or even country and there is nobody you know.
All these things have one thing in common and that is their solution. In most cases, a person sits down at a computer or picks up the phone and begins to search services, repair stores and does all things necessary, which takes over half an hour sometimes.
However, you can solve any of these problems with this application and just in a few seconds.
Let´s have another example. You are left alone with your broken car on the roadside, 500 km from home and the nearest cities are 40 km away from you. You simply choose a car service in this application, you select your current location, distance 50 km and IGS will show you a list of all available car services within a radius of 50 km. Then, just one click and service or all shown services will get your information like name, phone number, current location and short info- broken car. This service will receive your request and accept it with just one click and since they already have all information and location about you, they will send you a help. You are able to arrange and manage all of this and even more with IGS in a very short time.









Every
user, who creates an account on IGS platform will be able to use it
as a social network with common features. However, we want to expand
IGS of functions, that will improve communication between users and
companies, such as  videochat, calling through a mobile network, a
bazaar, targeted ads based on user´s interests ( option to disable
ads), saving  your own C.V. and then searching for job offers that
meet  job requirements, different kinds of discounts and much more.


What
makes IGS different from others? It is its ability to deal promptly
with problems and emergencies. The users will no longer have to
search companies, services and contact them, since this may be very
annoying and  take a lot of time. IGS will contact all business and
services that you need in your area or in a selected location.


All
users can also add and create a company account and a public company
profile to their current account, which will be available for all
users of IGS platform.  Besides the fact, that your company will get
noticed and visible, you will get access to various contracts, that
other companies entered in the system, you will get access to C.V. of
users, who are qualified and interested to work in your sector, CMS
system, the possibility of billing, creating of targeted ads and
offers, that will not unnecessarily appear to users with different
range of interest, enter various discounts, which will be presented
in IGS by form of  Discount portal and much more functions. 



What you can find on IGS platform:

Thanks
to your
help and ideas,
IGS will
be fully adapted
to the requirements of
user who will be
able to choose and set
everything that
he will need the application for.
 The
basic application available for the current  user and the
company can be supplemented with those downloadable additional
modules, that you want to use, so you will avoid having many icons
and functions that you will never need and use on user´s desktop.
IGS will be also an open system, in which the users will be able to
create their own modules or customize the design of platform.



The
greatest challenge for our team will be fast and stable working of
IGS application. It means, that we need to create servers, that will
be able to work fast and reliably despite a high load. At the
beginning, we also need to provide enough of storage space for
databases and files of users. Every contribution
will help, so the application
will use the highest quality servers with sufficient storage space
and it will provide you with the highest quality services. 





IGOSIMPLE
will be the application, which will support international
databases.  Since this is not a small project and it requires
considerable funds, we decided to fund the start-up through
crowdfunding.



Why
Indiegogo? In our opinion, it is one of the best, if not the best of
all crowdfunding websites on the internet and it has already
supported many projects, which are successful. 

For
us, this is not only the opportunity to run this project but also it
is a very good way how to promote ourselves and remain independent. 

As
we would like to run this project together with people, we will be
very grateful if they contribute financially, but they are also
welcome to contribute their ideas and suggestions to IGS project. You
can share your ideas on our website www.igosimple.com           
YOUR
SUPPORT AND OPINION ARE IMPORTANT TO US.

Thank you.

We will build and run our own servers and data-storages which will help us provide stable and faster connection.



If we reach more than 550 000€ goal ???

We get more people to our crew.We select some of your ideas and include them in application before launch day.We will be working harder to respond all of your inquiries and provide you with good support.All, website and applications will be available in alpha and beta for closed testing. (Only for supporters)Release date is around February - March 2015.All modules will include more detailed Content Management System and more options to set up your account for your needs.We select more languages from your ideas and raise number of available localizations.

Our future plans if we raise enough donations:
We want to open our app for you and you can make your own modules and your own designs.Application localizations will be open so you can translate whole application and modules create dictionary and more.We want to sync our app with WordPress, Joomla and Drupal so

you can export all your data from your website into our appand many more ...



All ideas and suggestions are really appreciated and we get closer look to each of them.


All
contributions received from you will be used for successful start-up
of IGS project. Since there is a huge amount of data, it is not
possible to rent data storage and servers. Therefore, we need to
provide our own servers and data storage which is about 20% of grants collected. The rest of the finances will be
redistributed to development of website and applications, to all
necessary equipment and to the wages for the programmer and support crew.
Graph shows how we will use money if we reach our target.





























After your donation of 110€ or more please send us email what combination and size of t-shirt you are interested in. Thank you.

Thanks board will contain the names of all donors. We will instal our THANKS board on wall in our office entrance.After the campaign we will share photos so that you could see the name of each donor.
