Since the authorities expect me to be living in the US by <strong>May 21st</strong>, there is only a small window of time for me to organize and fund everything. Therefore, your support would help to pay for my travel expenses and allow me to settle in during the first few weeks after my arrival as I set new goals for the future: Ultimately establish myself as an artist, which I would love to combine with teaching fine art and inspire a young audience.

<p>To provide aspiring artists with the tools, space, and training to learn to draw and paint. Christopher Sheldon seeks to provide this training and space to students at the lowest rate possible.

A studio space in better location, with communally held costs will allow him to better focus on his own painting and as such he is willing to teach students without recieving any monetary compensation.</p>
<p>THE MAN BEHIND THE STUDIO</p>
<p>Growing up in the depressed shop town of Troy, NH, Christopher Sheldon now sees an opportunity to bring the arts and revenue into his community by starting his own a atelier<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> there.

<p>He's spent the last 6 years using the now defunct Troy Blanket Mill as a studio space but the size and current state of disrepair are impractical for his purposes. A new space must be found.</p>
<p>This month a historic power station has been put up for sale on Route 12, which runs straight through the little town. With minimal remodeling this building would be an ideal location for the future Sheldon Studio. The space is suitably modest and the site is accessible and situated where commuters will have the opportunity to watch the project grow.</p>
<p>MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND</p>
<p>Funding for the project will be employed both in the purchase of the building and the restructuring of the Northern pitch of the roof, to capture the perfect lighting conditions for aspiring oil painters. Inside the front room which has been designated 'studio space' will be re-painted and partitioned into bays for the students. </p>
<p>SHOOTING HIGH</p>
<p></p><p>The project is designed to create a studio where students can get classical training at a minimum rate. Sheldon would not be extracting any fees and would in essence be teaching for free. The tuition required would go exclusively to the maintence of studio, classes, model fees, and other basic necessities.</p>Any extra money raised will be put toward tuition of low income students, on a basis of artistic merit and financial need.  Our dreams are sometimes hobbled by our credit or our debt, as we attempt to raise money for Christopher's dream we are mindful of the aspirations of others who may need help.<p></p>
<p>SHOOTING LOW</p>

</div></div>","For Zonotopia 2012 please go to Zonotopia and the Two Trees
 
---This is our 2011 campaign---
For two years now the wondrous Zomes of Zonotopia have revealed themselves on the Playa at Burningman. ??

 
Rob Bell creates Zomes: a magical, fantasy like architecture combining art, engineering and love into a series of pavilion-like structures. Like enormous radiolaria the Zomes seem to be enigmatic artifacts from a mythic age long ago. Each year more secrets from this bygone epoch are revealed and each year Zonotopia grows to further enchant people with its solemn, transcendent, spiritual quality.
In 2011 Zonotopia returns, and we need your help to pay for materials and transportation to the playa. Zonotopia is constructed entirely from sustainably harvested wood using state of the art digital fabrication tools and plenty of hand work to create a warm, natural and aesthetically harmonious proportion of form and function. The design, fabrication and construction is a 100% labor of love by the team.
We have a proven track record of delivering.??

In 2009, Rob Bell and Patricia Algara built the Bodhisattva Zome. Immensely popular, this beautiful eight frequency Zome pavilion has charmingly been referred to as a Princess Gazebo. This Zome has been assembled and enjoyed eight times proving the enduring quality of the system and the design.???

In 2010, Rob and Patricia with the help of Mission Country Club brought the Bodhisattva back now accompanied by the new and significantly more complex and larger Zonotopia Zome: a twelve frequency wonder. With a more advanced joinery system, painted white and illuminated with blacklights by night; the Zonotopia Zome fascinated and astounded everyone with it's beautiful proportion and attention to detail from near and far. From weddings to yoga to dance parties this Zome provided a stunning space for experiences to happen.

?
And now in 2011, in addition to the return the previous Zomes and some new charming zome siblings we will bring the true power and magic of Zomes forth from the playa in the form of a 40' tall twisting Zome tower to create a true zonohedral wonderland. The structure will be securely anchored to the playa and will be solid and safe for climbers. Inside there will be ample seating, a DJ and dance area and rigging for aerial acrobatic performances.
The astounding modular beauty of the Zome system means that once we begin production the more panels we can fabricate the more amazing art we can bring to the playa. All additional funds beyond our goal will create more magic in this zonohedral wonderland of inspiration and imagination. There are more zonohedral wonders under the Sun and the Moon yet to be seen.
You can help Zonotopia, this Once and Future Utopia of Zomes, rise again and prove that good design and beautiful architecture need not be a high-end commodity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Universe Revolves Around YOU is a new work by sculptor Zachary Coffin - a 30' merry go round made of granite and steel, slated to be built for Burning Man 2012. </p>
<p>Universe is a work about inertia. The idea is to create a plaything, an object that allows YOU to interact with rolling mass equivalent to a loaded railroad freight car. In this case, the load is big slabs of stone, spinning boulders and a lot of humans.</p>
<p>This human-powered merry go round will have a moving weight of about 80,000lbs, plus people.  The ring will be surfaced with thick slabs of granite and two kinetic elements will add or subtract energy from the spinning ring. All mass in motion.</p>
<p>The total cost of building this piece is estimated at about $94,000. We've raised nearly $60,000, which leaves us with a total of $34,000 to raise. We are hoping to raise $17,000 through Kickstarter, and will gladly accept more. Thank you for checking out our project! Please share with your friends!</p>

<h3>Jeff's Going to Colombia!</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone!</p>
<p>I'm very excited to let you know that this December I will be going to Medellin, Colombia to serve on a Mission Trip with 25 other Young Adults from the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.  I will be serving in a leadership position on this trip.</p>
<p>The goal of this trip is to put on a conference for our mission Presbyteries in Colombia.  I will be serving as a conference organizer and trainer on community organizing.  I was chosen to be a leader on this trip because of my experience as a community organizer.  As you know, I worked for the last 5 years as a community organizer in politics.  I learned so much about community involvement in that time and saw the benefits that it can bring.  </p>
<p>I will be working on training materials and curriculum for community organizing sections of this conference.  The Cumberland Presbyterian Church selected me as a leader for this Mission Trip because of these skills and I accepted this position because of my passion for community organizing.  </p>
<p>Not only is this trip a chance to bring community organizing skills to the people of Colombia, it is a trip that connects me with my family.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Grandaddy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/8972282928_41ee235a40_b.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As some of you know, my Grandfather, Dr. William T. Ingram Jr., was a Cumberland Presbyterian Minister and President of the Memphis Theological Seminary.  He had a great passion for mission work and he travelled to Colombia to help with the setting up of our mission Presbyteries in Colombia.  He also helped found the Seminary in Medellin, Colombia.  As part of my trip I will be making a visit to this Seminary.  </p>
<p>As you can see, this trip is very special and important to me.  I believe in the work that I will be doing there and this place also has a special significance to me and my family.  I hope that you will consider contributing and supporting me on this trip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Alright, so let's get down to business.  Here is what I will need for this trip.</p>
<p>My fundraising goal is $2,500.  This will go towards my:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel To and From Medellin, Colombia </li>
<li>Lodging and Travel While in Medellin</li>
<li>Conference Administrative Costs (Materials, Location, Food)</li>
</ul>
<p>I encourage you to give whatever you feel you can.  Whether it is $5 or $500, I appreciate all of the support you can give and you should know that your money is going to a worthwhile cause.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will be doing some special things for people that give certain amounts.</p>
<p>$10- A personal thank you note from me.</p>
<p>$25- A personal thank you note from me, plus a gift straight from Colombia!</p>
<p>$50- A personal thank you note from me, access to the trip blog, and a Captain Colombia T-Shirt.  Design Below:</p>
<p><img alt=""Captain Colombia T-Shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/8971150849_1c6d291661_b.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/> </p>
<p>Anyone that gives $75 or more will get to discuss with me some additional options.  I can't offer too much in the way of other things, but I also want to encourage you to give as much as you feel comfortable giving.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Community organizing has a tremendous impact on the communities that understand how to use it.  I train people to empower themselves and their communities to take action.  This is the impact that I hope to bring to our Prebytery in Colombia.  To train people on how to reach out to their community to solve problems in their community by using their collective power. </p>
<p>The purpose is to give church leaders the sense that they can have an impact on their community.  They don't have to confine themselves to the four walls of their churches.  They have a world of opportunity outside of those walls to make a difference in their community.</p>
<p>The Impact for me personally is also high.  I have been interested in my Grandfather and Father's trips to Colombia and I value that experience.  It would be immensely important to me on a personal level to be the 3rd generation of my family to go to Colombia.  Below are a couple of photos of my Grandfather on his first trip to Colombia.</p>

<p>If you believe in me and what I want to accomplish with this mission trip, I hope that you will be able to communicate with others to help me out.  Here are a few ways that you can help out if you cannot financially support me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray or send good thoughts to me while I go on this journey.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>The Artists of New Mexico Galleria now represents over 200 artists of all kinds.</strong> Artists have the option to setup their store on a weekly, monthly or multi-month basis, allowing them to have an inexpensive permanent location with internet access, clean facilities and heating/cooling. Artists can also elect to have their work included in the Galleria Consignment Shop if they cannot be here, due to family and job responsibilities. You’ll frequently find Bambi working in the Consignment Shop. Each month we also have between 18-25 small businesses and artists set-up their booths and tables to sell their work. Our small café, Cosmic Euphoria, specializes in heart-healthy deserts, lunches, snacks, &amp; beverages. The café owner Tami is also a very talented mixed-media artist. The Galleria also has a classroom area available for reservations for classes, workshops and conferences. The outside grounds of the Galleria features a community garden and a children’s playground. Every weekend the Galleria hosts live entertainment by local bands and schedules a community event each month.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>More About AoNM</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Artists of New Mexico &amp; Beyond Galleria is a wonderful group of artists, musicians, performance artists, teachers, families, &amp; so much more. AONM was created by Amalie Dorn and Bambi Cordova. They started working together in the year 2000 as waitresses at a restaurant. They each have 3 children and were looking for a way to support their kids from home. Amalie started Fireworks Jewelry and Bambi started Bamble's Jewelry. Their next step was to sell their unique designs at small arts and craft shows. One year they decided to rent a small tent and invite other artists to join them as vendors at the <strong>Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.</strong> It was a success!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">In 2008 Amalie and Bambi were given the opportunity to expand their art show at the Balloon Fiesta. <strong>They became the promoters of the only arts and crafts show at Balloon Fiesta.</strong> Artists of New Mexico &amp; Beyond was born. They have grown that business from a 12,000 square foot show to an over 20,000 square foot show in just 4 short years. In the meantime, both women continued to work hard designing and selling their own jewelry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">As Amalie and Bambi got to know the other artists they learned that many of them did not have a permanent venue to show and sell their work. The two women started looking for the perfect place to house all of this wonderful handcrafted artwork. They came across an historic building built in 1954 as the Old Town Albuquerque Boy's and Girl's club. The building, which had served many young people, now sat empty. After not being used for years it was in need of repair and love.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">In February of 2012 Amalie and Bambi leased the building thus creating the new Artists of New Mexico &amp; Beyond Galleria. Everyone knew it was important for us to respect and restore as much of the original building and signage as we could. <strong>Check out the gallery pics to see some of the people and work done.</strong> We had to move fast and open the doors by April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2012. A call was set out to all of the artists from the craft shows, family, friends, co-workers and we talked to local members of the community. Everyone came through with an amazing response. We literally had <strong>hundreds of volunteers</strong> show up to donate their time, materials, supplies, flowers, seeds and even food for those who were working so hard to get it done.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Many people who came in called us crazy;</strong> they said it was impossible and simply couldn't be done. We looked at them, asked for their help and said, ""many hands make light work."" We continued on with determination living into our slogan “TEAM” (Together Everyone Achieves more).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>Everyone worked toward a common goal of helping others make it.</strong> All the workers and supporters believed that where there is a will, there is a way in all that you do. We worked 18-20 hour days, 7 days a week. The deadline was coming up fast and we still had so much to do. The pressure was intense for some and pushed others to work harder. Finally, on April 5, 2012 the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce hosted our Artists of New Mexico &amp; Beyond Galleria's Grand opening ceremony.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">We did it thanks to all of those volunteers. Many artists now have a permanent home to share and sell their artwork.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">Rivkela Brodsky with the Albuquerque Journal came to interview Bambi Cordova. She was excited about the space and all of the people so dedicated to making it work. Rivkela wrote an article which was published in the <strong>Business Outlook</strong> section of the Albuquerque Journal on May 7, 2012. To see the article look in the gallery of pictures above. One of the artists, Leo Atreides who is also a filmmaker, was so excited he created a 2 minute commercial for AONM which ran on channel 7 – watch it on YouTube: <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=zZMyImgLYp8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=zZMyImgLYp8</a> to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">We advertise with a small ad in ABQ ARTS Magazine and with a small ad in the Alibi. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;"">We have another artist Alane Cole who is also a graphic designer. She helped create our website: <a href=""http://artistsofnm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://artistsofnm.com</a>  She also designed and printed our business cards, postcards, banners, &amp; helped launch our <strong>Facebook</strong> page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/artistsofnm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FB Fan Page"">https://www.facebook.com/Artistsofnm</a> Visit our Facebook page where we have many pictures of the artwork, artists and loads of information and links.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>We need your help</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>We need your help to continue on our journey to keep all of these hardworking artists in a permanent community based space.</strong> Bambi and Amalie have given it all they have financially. Each of them have both gone through their savings and yet are still willing to get their hands dirty and work hard. We have volunteers lined up waiting to do anything they can to help. Currently, all they can do is continue talking about us and getting people in to see what a wonderful place this is. A couple of our members Nona and Don Church even donated neon lights for the outside and made a donation to start a mural on the outside of the building plus they are the ones to thank for the lovely gardens we have blooming out front and the productive community garden.</span></p>

It started with an empty former community center and Artists of New Mexico founders Amalie and Bambi’s vision of a permanent arts and crafts market where handcraft artists like themselves could operate a storefront and sell their work. The Artists of New Mexico Galleria started on a shoe-string budget and was launched within months through the dedicated efforts of the many volunteers who believed in their vision. With both Amalie’s and Bambi’s life savings and hundreds of hours of volunteer work and donated materials they transformed the empty gym and facility into a vibrant home for the arts in downtown Albuquerque. 
 
The Artists of New Mexico Galleria now represents over 200 artists of all kinds.

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Story</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are a local family business that wants to help serve our community. We are focused on bringing people together to share a common interest. . Our ultimate goal is to have a full service yarn shop that is family friendly. </span><span> </span><span>In the meantime we  are going to start that process by finishing off our new workshop. As you can see from the picture, it needs work! We will not be contracting out any of the work. </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If this campaign is successful it will allow us to ramp up production and shorten wait times for custom dyed yarns. It will also get the dye work out of our kitchen, which is very important. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are, as far as we know, the only dyer to offer yarns made to order in whatever colors the customer requests. We also offer yarns based on themes. Some examples of those would be “I love the 80’s”, “My Little Ponies” and yarn inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This campaign will also allow us to have a sock of blank yarn to dye from, and chemicals (which will lessen wait time). We are also excited that in addition to offering rovings and batts we would love to start making hand felted wool or wool blend fedoras.</span></p>
<h3><span><span> </span></span></h3>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are looking for $3500  to renovate the studio space and make it comfortable and inviting. Where is the money going??? We realize that the cost of the materials are probably off. The funds raised will be distributed first to finish the shop, then to supplies. Shelving will be last.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If we are so fortunate to get $1000 over our goal, we will donate $500.00 of that to West Claremont Center for Music and the Arts. This will apply to each $1000.00 over goal we raise, so you help twice! <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>

Our Story
We are a local family business that wants to help serve our community. We are focused on bringing people together to share a common interest. . Our ultimate goal is to have a full service yarn shop that is family friendly.  In the meantime we  are going to start that process by finishing off our new workshop. As you can see from the picture, it needs work! We will not be contracting out any of the work. 
The Impact
If this campaign is successful it will allow us to ramp up production and shorten wait times for custom dyed yarns. It will also get the dye work out of our kitchen, which is very important. 
We are, as far as we know, the only dyer to offer yarns made to order in whatever colors the customer requests. We also offer yarns based on themes. Some examples of those would be “I love the 80’s”, “My Little Ponies” and yarn inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This campaign will also allow us to have a sock of blank yarn to dye from, and chemicals (which will lessen wait time). We are also excited that in addition to offering rovings and batts we would love to start making hand felted wool or wool blend fedoras.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for $3500  to renovate the studio space and make it comfortable and inviting. Where is the money going??? We realize that the cost of the materials are probably off. The funds raised will be distributed first to finish the shop, then to supplies. Shelving will be last.
If we are so fortunate to get $1000 over our goal, we will donate $500.00 of that to West Claremont Center for Music and the Arts. This will apply to each $1000.00 over goal we raise, so you help twice!  
Here is an outline of what we still need:


Flooring $160


Drywall $100


Insulation $100


Cooktop $400


utility sink $100


Cabinets and counter $700


6 steel shelves $300


2 wire shelve sets $50


Stock yarn (Few different bases) $1500



Fingering


DK


Worsted/Aran



Hat forms $100

 
What you get for your help?
$5 Thank you card with a photo of the completed studio
$10-10% off a one time order
$15- 15% off a one time order
$20-Knitting pattern by one of our friends

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>YorkSlam</strong> is the first-ever poetry slam series in York Region. During our inaugural season this year, we brought together people from across the entire region to experience the amazing art form of spoken word. In June we formed a team to represent the Region at the national slam championships this October in Saskatoon. The goal of this fundraising campaign is to get our poets to the festival.</p>
<p>The team is <strong>the youngest in the history of the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word</strong> – all the poets on the team are 25 years of age and under, and four of them will compete in the festival for the first time. CFSW 2012 Saskatoon will be a career-changing opportunity for these poets. Your generous support will leave a lasting impact on the development of spoken word in the Region, and on the voices of these five amazing young poets. Your help in making this vision become a reality is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase round-trip tickets for the team from Toronto to Saskatoon, as well as cover the cost of a hotel stay for six days (October 8-14). The amount of our goal will fully cover the cost of the trip, but if we do not reach 100% or more of our target, the money we do raise will help defray the travel-related costs for the five university-aged youth on the team.</p>
<p>You get poetic gifts galore from the team depending on the level of contribution you provide – video poetry, chapbooks, a free poetry showcase, CDs and custom written poetry are all among the special goodies the YorkSlam team will give you as appreciation for your generous support.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At a time when Markham is building a new city centre and a strong focus is being placed on developing the Region’s culture sector, YorkSlam provides an example of what is possible when people are energized and supported. We want to make sure our poets experience the best festival performance opportunities available to them in this country. Making sure the Team represents at CFSW 2012 Saskatoon will provide an additional push to the poetry series locally and boost the skill level of the poets who are representing us.</p>
<p>Once a poetry series sends a team to CFSW, the passion and fire of its poets is stoked to a new fever pitch. We believe strongly that YorkSlam can make a significant splash on the national level. First-year teams have previously found success and we are confident this Team will use your contributions to not just compete, but to contend as well. </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know you can’t always contribute financially, so spread the word as a way to help us as well! Share the link to this page with your friends, colleagues and contacts. Tell the media in the Region about what we’re doing. Use the Indiegogo share tools. Every little bit helps. Thanks for your support!!!</p>

question: ""What if?""  <i>What if we did that another way? What if
something we valued suddenly became something of no value or vice versa? What
if the same words could tell a totally different story?</i> </p>
<p>Several months ago, under the dark of
night, a 'what if' conversation led to an idea...What if I could take apart
stories and rebuild them to tell completely different ones? This led to an
experiment...which repeated itself several times over...leading to countless
conversations…which turned into bigger and bigger things…until it
became...Conversations|Reconstructed.</p>
<p>For me, I have to pursue writing and
art in the same way I pursue breathing. It must happen to stay alive. This
project is the next breath in our pursuit of creating, pushing boundaries and collaboration.
We have been awed by where it has already taken us, and we are eager to see
where it will continue to lead us as artists and creators. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; line-height: 38px;"">The Questions &amp;
The Details</b><br/></p>
<p><i>What if I could
take apart some of the greatest poems and use those words to reconstruct
completely new stories? Could it be done? Could I do it? Would the words be
able to tell different stories? Would I lose my voice if I could not choose my
words, not a single one? Do words have enough meaning to tell different stories
while they stay the same? </i></p>
<p>These are all the questions I asked
myself as I began this journey. It was frustrating not to be able to choose my
words but, as I started doing it, I saw the words, the same words, telling new
and different stories.</p>
<p>Once I completed a couple
reconstructions it became very apparent I needed visual artists to help bring my stories to life. As each artist joined the project, (Illustrator, Sculptor, Graphic Designer, Painter, Lino Cutter/Digital Printer, and Street Artist) a beautiful collaboration began between these artists, my reconstructions and the iconic poets. Not only were we able to bring the poem sets to life visually (""poem set"" being the term we use to describe an original poem, de-constructed word list and reconstructed poem), but each artist involved used the words to inspire their own story.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You will recognize some of the

<p>I worried about the constrained
creativity this project entailed. <i>I mean, come
on, a writer who doesn't choose any of her own words?!</i> I won't lie, it was
a struggle, but I discovered even when you constrain creativity, creativity will
not be constrained. Words carry meaning individually, and words together tell
stories. You take them apart, put them back together and they can tell
completely new stories. These stories then take on imagery, collaboration and multiple
interpretations. Soon you find you are having new conversations out of the old
ones! </p>

<p></p></div>","VISION 
All individuals have contributions to make - acts that nurture the individual and the community. Yet, people with limited use of their bodies, those considered to be physically or mentally disabled by some, often lack the resources, opportunities and relationships necessary to fully express themselves to make their contributions to society. Laser Eagles Art Guild is an organization that offers individuals the opportunity for self expression through art. The Laser Eagles will bring people together to passionately reveal their strong spirit and foster their ability to contribute their creativity and insight to the world.
The Laser Eagles Art Guild is one of the only art organizations in the Greater Toronto Area that provides fully-inclusive environments for those who have been labeled with a disability. The Laser Eagles artists gather weekly to create art that is generated solely from their own artistic visions. Laser Eagles’s trackers have formed wonderful nurturing relationships with Artists have produced a variety of artwork that are exceptional.

<p>Hi Family and Friends!</p>
<p>You will be happy to know that I am settled into the Windy City.  I have some exciting news from my studio, which is the foundation for this campaign titled: <em>Studio Upkeep</em>. In brief, <em>Studio Upkeep</em> is a project to raise money for the progression of my studio practice through the purchasing of my artworks.  I am excited to find homes for my works, which are ever growing and taking over many storage units across the country.  Thanks Dad, Uncle Mike, and the Muzzio’s.</p>
<p>Specifically, the monies will contribute to a residency at the <em>Vermont Studio Center</em> in Johnson, VT and the building of a <em>website</em>.  I have been invited for a month long residency where I will have the opportunity to be completely immersed in my studio.  The way the residency works is I am given a studio within a community of other dedicated resident painters, sculptors, and writers.  During my stay there will be visiting artist that come to give lectures on their work, in addition to, individual studio critiques.  Here is a link the artists that are coming the month of November:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.vermontstudiocenter.org/november-5/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vermontstudiocenter.org/november-5/</a></p>
<p>The good news is that I received a partial scholarship to attend!  However, the remaining tuition, travel, photographing of works, and material costs still remain.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Way It Works:</em></strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo is a free online platform where anyone can raise money for important causes or projects that they are passionate about.  If I reach my goal then Indiegogo keeps 4% of my earnings and if I don’t reach my goal Indiegogo keeps 9% of my earnings.  All of my earnings will go towards funding the building of a website that will better represent my paintings and a residency at the Vermont Studio Center this November 2013.</p>
<p>The <em>Perks</em> are the detail, which I am most excited about!  When you contribute toward my cause you will receive ART WORK!  See my <em>Perks </em>for more information!  Be sure to click on <em>Shipping Fee</em> depending on the size of your <em>Perk</em>. </p>
<p>Be sure to check out the Gallery to view some of my works!</p>

<p><strong><em>Other Studio News:</em></strong></p>
<p>I was recently in a show titled <em>Future Folk</em> in Brooklyn, New York at <em>Brooklyn Fireproof East</em>. </p>
<p>I have been selected for a catalogue that comes out a few times year called <em>New American Paintings</em>.  I am in the upcoming September Midwest Issue #107 you can order a catalogue here:</p>

You will be happy to know that I am settled into the Windy City.  I have some exciting news from my studio, which is the foundation for this campaign titled: Studio Upkeep. In brief, Studio Upkeep is a project to raise money for the progression of my studio practice through the purchasing of my artworks.  I am excited to find homes for my works, which are ever growing and taking over many storage units across the country.  Thanks Dad, Uncle Mike, and the Muzzio’s.
Specifically, the monies will contribute to a residency at the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, VT and the building of a website.  I have been invited for a month long residency where I will have the opportunity to be completely immersed in my studio.  The way the residency works is I am given a studio within a community of other dedicated resident painters, sculptors, and writers.  During my stay there will be visiting artist that come to give lectures on their work, in addition to, individual studio critiques.  Here is a link the artists that are coming the month of November:
http://www.vermontstudiocenter.org/november-5/
The good news is that I received a partial scholarship to attend!  However, the remaining tuition, travel, photographing of works, and material costs still remain.
The Way It Works:
Indiegogo is a free online platform where anyone can raise money for important causes or projects that they are passionate about.  If I reach my goal then Indiegogo keeps 4% of my earnings and if I don’t reach my goal Indiegogo keeps 9% of my earnings.  All of my earnings will go towards funding the building of a website that will better represent my paintings and a residency at the Vermont Studio Center this November 2013.
The Perks are the detail, which I am most excited about!  When you contribute toward my cause you will receive ART WORK!  See my Perks for more information!  Be sure to click on Shipping Fee depending on the size of your Perk. 
Be sure to check out the Gallery to view some of my works!

Other Studio News:
I was recently in a show titled Future Folk in Brooklyn, New York at Brooklyn Fireproof East. 
I have been selected for a catalogue that comes out a few times year called New American Paintings.  I am in the upcoming September Midwest Issue #107 you can order a catalogue here:
http://www.newamericanpaintings.com/
or contact me for a copy.
Other Ways You Can Help:
I completely understand not being able to support my campaign monetarily.  However, you can still support my campaign.  Make some noise and let you art collecting friends know about my project!

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I’m Mrs. Kimberly Moseberry; I was born and raised here in Chicago. I’ve always had a passion for art and storytelling. When I was a kid I would read my brothers and uncles comic books. To mean comic books allowed me to go to new worlds and meet new people. In 2001 I attended the Illinois Institute of Art and got my BA in media arts and animation. People who know me always say that I enjoy doing art and writing stories. I’ve worked on a few indie projects such as AWF (Amazon Wrestling Federation) and Urban Style Comics.</p>
<p>Enigma is a project I had ever since I was a freshman in high school. Enigma allows me to create my own world and people where I can talk about mature issues and what it is to be human. In enigma there are no simple black and white characters only people trying to survive. Enigma is important to me because it’s a place things aren’t simple and even the best of people can do terrible things and the worst of people can do wonderful things.</p>
<p>Through you wonderful donations I can truly bring the world of enigma to life. With your help and donations you open up a whole new world where beauty isn’t always on the outside but on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>What I need and what you get</strong></p>
<p>To get Enigma off the ground running I’ll need $2600 total these donates will go to paying the colorist, lettering and the printing of the first issue of enigma as well as the concept art book which will allow you to look into the world of enigma itself as well as a quick peek at the characters who will be in the comic.</p>
<p>Now you’re asking well what are the perks what do you get? Good question. Depending on what you donate. You can get anywhere from the first issue of enigma to shirts, posters, buttons, prints, concept art book. If you have a comic book store and you want to make a donation. Your store gets free advertising in my comic book and my table no matter which convention I go to your stores ad will be there.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>With your donations Enigma will be colored, lettered and this printed. None of this would be possible without your help. Enigma isn’t as clear cut on black and white issues like good or evil. There is only the idea of surviving in a broken world as a human being. In a way Enigma makes us take a look at ourselves as people. Back in summer of 2012 at Wizard World Chicago. I sold 50 sneak peek copies of Enigma. As of right now Enigma has a small fan base of a few 100 followers. Enigma will grow in time.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Now just because you are unable to make a donation, doesn’t mean you can contribute you can spread the world and tell other about Enigma. The more you know the more you can help! That’s it and thanks a lot folks!</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Art fairs are amazing networking opportinities for galleries. We will meet thousands of potential new clients in a matter of days, and meet dozens of our fellow gallerists from all over. We MUST to go to ArtPadSF, but exhibitor fees are sizable. ArtPad is one of the more accessible art fairs, with some booths just below $5K...  We can cover MOST of that, but we need a little help making up the difference!</p>
<p>We need about $1,750 to go to ArtPad... but MORE is BETTER! Everything we raise will go towards exhibitor fees... and $1,750 is just a fraction of that.</p>
<p>When you donate to our cause, get your money back through Art!  Take whatever amount you donate off of any art purchase at Satellite66, anytime, ever (up to 50% off of purchase price).  You can use that at the fair or at the gallery. So you're not just helping us out, you're also paying for your future art!</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Get!</h3>
<p>We participate in the hippest fair in SF, at the Phoenix Hotel in the Tenderloin, May 17-20.  We get to bring our artists to the fair and increase their exposure and hopefully help them sell their work!  We increase the gallery profile in the community, and hopefully meet a bunch of new clients that will help us maintain our presence in the challenging but blossoming Central Market corridor for a long time.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hiya, my names Vicky Blackthorn. I was at university studying marine science and now I'm training with the circus and teaching at a circus school. Since starting at circus I've found my home and my family, and I've always had dreams to combine my two passions, aerials and the ocean. I've been invited to be a part of a trapeze beach camp in Byron Bay in which I'll be able to fly on the trapeze over the ocean and learn a new way of connecting to the aerials to pass onto the children back home. This is possibly the most amazing opportunity I could hope for. I feel a deeply spiritual connection with the ocean and with the trapeze, and feel that I can create something truely amazing through this project to give to the children at my circus school. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am passionate about children, their vibrancy, spontaneity and fearlessness. At circus I teach children to live their dreams and to do things they never thought possible. I believe that in attending this trapeze camp I will come back to my circus school with even more passion and new skills to pass on to my students, to get them closer to their dreams of flying.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>To attend the trapeze beach camp I need to raise $1500, this covers airfares as well as the cost of the camp itself. If I don't raise the full $1500 through this campaign then I will be selling off my furniture in order to attend the camo. So, please be generous, or I won't have a bed to sleep on in the forseeable future<br/></p>

Out Loud Greetings was started to make adorable greeting cards for the LGBT community.


CURRENTLY, I'm raising funds to cover printing costs, acquire supplies, and exhibit in the 2014 National Stationery Show so that Out Loud Greetings can be seen by thousands of potential reps and buyers from across the country.
Greeting cards can be one of the fondest, most sincere ways to show someone their special place in your heart. With images and words alone, greeting cards have the potential to inspire, heal, celebrate, and so much more. Out Loud Greetings is a business who’s mission it is to bring that sentiment and meaning, through greeting cards, to the gay and lesbian community.
FINALLY, Cards that celebrate holidays, weddings, anniversaries, and other special occasions with images that are modest, thoughtful, and heartfelt.




*Pictured above is a sample of a booth at the National Stationery Show



WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
So far the online customers and local shops have been fantastic. To take the cards and the message to the next level and play with the big guys, there's no other place to do it other than right here in NYC at the National Stationery show next spring. The multi-day event is visited by thousands of reps and store owners - hopefully propelling Out Loud Greetings into the hands and hearts of people across the country.

<p class=""normal""><strong>E4LD </strong>is a hybrid project mixing theatre, architecture and cinema.

<p class=""normal"">The piece explores the use of mp3 players as a tool for organizing territory, time and the boundaries of the body in public space.

By using the mp3 players, the audio experience is transformed into both an internal and external theatrical experience. The participant -not the play or the technology- is the art.
The soundscapes heard on the mp3 players have two main components: the movement instructions (choreography) as well as music and text (the story). These components are directly inspired by the location where the installation takes place.
Previously, three versions of the project have taken place in Montreal, entitled: Afterlife (2008), Spiral Jetty (2009), and Home Theatre (2011).

<p> </p>
<p>I've always been interested in screenprinting my own tshirts with custom designs created from fragments of my own artwork. This is the fruition of that idea, but there's one problem - it's costly to get a quality product screenprinted as an independant artist.</p>
<p>With your support, I will be doing a small size run of t-shirts in both men's and women's cuts. This is also your opportunity to take advantage of being one of the first people to get one of these shirts. There are also some amazing perks available for those who love my original pieces as well. All of my perks and the original design for this shirt come from the in-progress series, <em>Dream Fevers</em>, more of which can be viewed through my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.400156196720915.93751.283614658375070"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>This particular project will help fund an artist from the small city of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, support the local businesses and help share art with the world. Like the design? Consider donating and being a part of something that will make my heart smile!</p>
<p>For a complete look at my portfolio, please visit <a href=""http://jessicamolcan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jessicamolcan.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>FUNDS</strong><br/>I have set a goal for this fundraising campaign at an amount that would cover costs associated with screenprinting and shipping the shirts, as well as fulfilling some of the perks. The quality of product I'm looking for isn't cheap, but the more shirts I run, the less expensive it gets. If I were to go over my fundraising goal, I would increase the amount of shirts produced, as well as the quanity of the t-shirt perks, adding some additional art goodies as well. Reaching my goal will also open the door to producing more art shirts and a variety of designs incorporating my own artwork - this is what my long term goal with this would be in getting the venture off it's feet.</p>
<p>I decided the best way to go about handling this particular project is with fixed funding - this means if I can't get the project funded completely, no one is out money and the t-shirts will have to wait to come to fruition some other time. I also chose IndieGoGo because it opens up my project to a broader audience, gives the world an idea of what I'm capable of, and takes care of the financial management of the project if I don't hit my goal.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE DESIGN</strong><br/>The design is based off the original piece, ""I am your one way ticket"". Halfway through the creation of the piece, I scanned it into Adobe Photoshop and finished it through digital painting. The design has been on quite a journey since then. Having a few shots at being printed, but none panning out, I finally decided to take the matter into my own hands. </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT JESSICA<br/></strong>Jessica Molčan is in her twenties and resides on the west coast of Canada on beautiful Vancouver Island. After completing her Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Visual Art, Jessica has continued to pursue her artistic endeavours as both a freelance illustrator/designer, and a practising visual artist, booking shows and selling pieces. Her inspiration is derived from her subconscious, fears and hopes, observations and the world around her. Jessica is continually striving to better herself and skill set as an artist.</p>
<p>Her pieces each contain their own haunted preservation of memory and can be read a variety of ways. Fascinated with the push and pull reaction, Jessica attempts to make her audience uncomfortable while still presenting a thing of beauty. This reaction has been consistent among Jessica's showings, and is especially true of the pieces most visceral, ominous and disturbing. It is the chase of this reaction that helps Jessica to keep evolving as an artist.</p>

<h3><strong><em>A Little About Me:</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>I am currently a Studio Art major at UNCG, with a diehard passion for photography and I will be graduating in the Fall of 2013. I live and breath art and photography. For me, there is no greater feeling than that of creation. It was very easy for me then to get into art at a very early age. I have worked ever since I was 16 and have always supported myself monetarily, and now support myself by working towards paying bills as a 21 year old on my own. A strong work ethic coupled with an extreme passion for making art has led me to where I am today and it is my hope in life to pass down this passion for art to my future children, and to as many other people as possible. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3><em><strong>Where Will Money Go?:</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Every dime raised towards the cause will be put towards purchasing photography equipment to kickstart my career in commercial photography. The money will be put towards studio lighting and set up, as well as any camera equipment needed.</li>
<li>Those that donate will get a 25% discount on any future photoshoots, as well as a framed 8"" x 10"" print of their choosing. Remember, the donations you provide will come back to you full circle through my photography!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong><em>The Impact of Your Generous Donations:</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recently my photography career has gained momentum. My work will be featured in the upcoming <em>Coraddi</em>, a school-wde arts and literature magazine that is published by UNCG. Also, another of my works will be featured at Maya Art Gallery on Tate Street in Greensboro, NC. With your donation, I will continue to work very hard at what I love so that one day my work and passion for what I do will spread even farther. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><em><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong> Contribute:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you cannot contribute monetarily, that's okay! Please share with your friends and family and encourage them to donate.</p>

For me, there is no greater feeling than that of creation. It was very easy for me then to get into art at a very early age. I have worked ever since I was 16 and have always supported myself monetarily, and now support myself by working towards paying bills as a 21 year old on my own. A strong work ethic coupled with an extreme passion for making art has led me to where I am today and it is my hope in life to pass down this passion for art to my future children, and to as many other people as possible. 



Where Will Money Go?:

Every dime raised towards the cause will be put towards purchasing photography equipment to kickstart my career in commercial photography. The money will be put towards studio lighting and set up, as well as any camera equipment needed.
Those that donate will get a 25% discount on any future photoshoots, as well as a framed 8"" x 10"" print of their choosing. Remember, the donations you provide will come back to you full circle through my photography!



The Impact of Your Generous Donations:


Recently my photography career has gained momentum. My work will be featured in the upcoming Coraddi, a school-wde arts and literature magazine that is published by UNCG. Also, another of my works will be featured at Maya Art Gallery on Tate Street in Greensboro, NC. With your donation, I will continue to work very hard at what I love so that one day my work and passion for what I do will spread even farther. 


Other Ways You Can Help Contribute:


If you cannot contribute monetarily, that's okay! Please share with your friends and family and encourage them to donate.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

contributing at the recast of the Tunisian cinematographic sector.</p><p>
<b>What is our project?</b></p><p>
Our project ""Mobile Cinema"" is inspired by the fairground and circus
atmosphere that roamed rural areas. Such event contributes in bringing joy and
festivity among villagers.<br/>
The action consists basically of a cycle of mobile screenings that takes place
every year covering a big part of the Tunisian territory, especially the rural
regions where citizens are disadvantaged from simple means of cultural
entertainment. The screenings are free and take place in open and public places
where everyone can have access to it. Generally the idea that we want to
deliver is that public spaces can become an asset for all citizens and a place where
they can freely express and talk their mind. <br/><b>Why it is important?</b></p><p>
This event represents a substantial value for us as it contributes in bringing
joy and delight for children who have never got the chance to see a movie on a big screen
before. Such event helps children and people to share artistic moments by
exposing art especially cinema. Also it can be a tool to discover their hidden
talents.<br/>
We are acting in a space where everyone
from all over the world can contribute to present the cinema and its forms to
these destitute people. As human beings we deeply believe that everyone can draw
a smile on children's faces with the simplest means available. </p>
<p>Since we are a committed organization we defined a list of objectives that
we want to reach from this project.</p>

Cinema and take it to citizens in rural villages. </p>
<p>5. Install a space of

<p>The Mobile cinema is a new genre of media and is
fundamentally different from conventional Storytelling media, such as web, TV,

<p>The mobile cinema
provides a mixed reality story presentation that is able to offer a sense of authenticity
that comes from ambient awareness, the movement of the audience's body, and depicted
story events that were often recorded at the location where they appear. In designing
mobile cinema, we are looking to design a cinematographic story experience that plays
out in small fragments over time in response to how the audience walks around a
location, move through the space along different paths and engage in different
aspects of the physical environment.</p>
<p>This concept of mobile cinema is entirely new; People who
can't havee access to cinema the cinema will go to them and by this, disadvantaged
people will be able to enjoy this opportunity that their social situation deprived
them from enjoying it.</p>
<p>Such important event that is still considered as a trend
will keep spreading to touch other regions until it reaches the whole country, why not the rural areas all over the world.</p>
<p>Most importantly contributors’ role must not be
forgotten as they are the backbone of the event and without them we wouldn’t be
able to fulfill our goals. Also such contribution will increase their <span>spiritual value</span>s as they
helped disadvantaged people to have a liftime opportunity to discover such magic; the magic of seeing a film on a big screen.</p>
<p>Our organization fulfilled this event the 2 last years
and it was able to reach people in many rural isolated areas. The impact of the
event was really impressive and people who were part of the experience really
enjoyed it and had an opportunity to really feel and see what mobile cinema is.
That’s why we want people to believe in us and trust us as a nonprofit
organization that aims to bring joy and happiness to people who suffer a lot in
their daily life and we really aim on taking a part of that sadness and replace
with something pure and happy. </p>

</div></div>","We are a group of artists participating in a network called INTAC (International Art Collaborations). This network is allowing those of us at OCAD University in Toronto, Canada to create collaborative artworks with partner universities in South Korea, India, Germany, Japan and Finland. We work primarily with photography and our overarching theme for the year is Desire: The Double Edged Sword. 
   
 Each year we curate a culminating exhibition to show our final collection of works. This year we have been given the opportunity to install our exhibition in Tampere, Finland AND Toronto, Canada.
Although installing two shows of this scale is an incredibly exciting and welcomed opportunity, the printing and organizing of these events will be a costly endeavour. We have therefore organized this Indiegogo campaign to offset some of installation and travel expenses associated with this project while giving you, the contributors, a chance to own some exclusive art made by some of the talented artists that together make up the INTAC collective. 


 Your contributions will directly aid in realizing exhibitions that will feature a passionate international group of artists. 
As this campaign is run by the students of OCAD University, all collected funds will go directly to the artists and will be spent on the following:



printing and installing artwork in Toronto

offsetting travel expenses en route to Finland
production and printing of promotional materials (posters/catalogues etc.)

<h3>A labor and birth colouring book?</h3>Adults have suddenly discovered that they can use colouring books; for relaxation, creative expression, and just for fun. I wanted to take the concept of an adult colouring book, and use it to show the beauty, power and grace of the birthing woman.  Throw in some of my favorite quotes about birth, and you have a colouring book that can be a personal art project, or a childbirth class activity. <p></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who we are </h3>
<p>Jessie Chappe &amp; Blake C. Hollaway met earlier this year and had an idea for a new type of fashion film. An innovative way to tell a beautiful, heartbreaking story about demons of our past, that hasn't been told before. From this idea, and meeting Finnius R. Morrisley, FRM Productions was born. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Blake C. Hollaway</h3>
<p>Forever attracted to all forms of storytelling, Blake began her career as a writer and an actress. At age 15 she moved to New York City to attend the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. In New York, she attended film classes in which the students learned by fulfilling a specific job on set during each class. This piqued her interest in working on the other side of the camera, but it was not until landing a leading role in Producer/Director Robinson Vil's feature film <i>Life.less </i>that Blake really fell in love with the art of filmmaking. Inspired by Robinson Vil's work and with his help as a mentor, Blake went on to open her first production company. Over the course of several years, she worked on various projects on the east coast. After making the big move to Los Angeles a little over a year ago, her focus has mainly been writing, directing, and producing. FRM will be her first LA based production company. With help from her partners Jessie Chappe and Finnius R. Morrissley, she hopes to continue to create circles of work for people in the industry and tell unique stories that invoke conversation. Fun fact about Blake: There is a lot of hidden symbols and imagery in her works that have helped give her a very specific style over the years. </p>

<p>A recent LA Transplant from Chicago. Jessie got her BFA in Playwriting from Cornish College of the Arts. Since college, she has been writing her way across the country. She has been working in casting since graduation, which is what brought her to LA a little over a year ago. She focuses her writing on intimate relationships that explore the human experience. Since arriving in LA, her dream has been to make movies that invoke conversations, move people, and inspire others to go out and follow their dreams. Here's a fun picture that is not candid at all but looks like it might be! Fun fact about Jessie: she collects the handwriting of people she loves and tattoos them on her body in her favorite quotes from movies and books that best represent that person. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Finnius R. Morrissley</h3>
<p>Finnius' background is still a mystery to most. We are still waiting on him to submit his official bio. As he is terribly camera shy and afraid of the spotlight, we might never get it ;) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we're here</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise at least $5000 to bring the visionary world of The Dark Prince to life.</p>
<p>$5000 is a TEENY amount of money for a film...even a short film. Even film budgets with 1 million dollars are considered low budget in this industry! We know $5000 seems like a lot for a short film - but we have to pay our talented artists. We have a team willing to work for little- because that's how much our team believes in the vision of The Dark Prince. The producers, Jessie &amp; Blake, will not be taking any of that money as payment. All the money will be going towards paying our crew, paying our actors, and renting equipment needed to shoot. We believe everyone deserves to get paid for their work. We only hire the best, and know that in order to do that, we need to meet our minimum goal of $5000.</p>
<p> As FRM's first fashion film production, we are hoping to start off with a bang. We have almost everything we need: an innovative script, a talented cast, a group of passionate filmmakers ...all that's left is the funding to bring our vision to life. Once completed, we will be competing in film festivals all around the world. We know that The Dark Prince is just the beginning of FRM. We can't wait to show you what we can bring to the big screen.</p>
<p>FRM is dedicated to bringing intimate stories of relationships to life on the screen through visionary filmmaking and original stories. We have found this group of artists in LA who can't wait to work on films that speak about the human experience.</p>
<p>What makes us so unique is our dedication to making the entire process of filmmaking a collaboration between all the artists involved. We strive to bring out the best in each other, and have found that through collaboration. </p>

<p>*Expendables are random out of pocket production expenses such as the very expensive hard drives that are necessary for editing. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Challenges:</h3>
<p>Since we are a new company, we aren't shy to let you know that we need the help from the rest of the community. Not just filmmakers and artists, but everyone who loves to discover new ways of telling/seeing stories. </p>
<p>Right now our biggest challenge is raising the funds for our production needs. We have the right team. We just need the funds. We know that once completed, The Dark Prince will be a tough competitor in the film festival circuit. We truly believe that the success of The Dark Prince will further the progress for the future of FRM Productions.</p>

<h4><b>Urban Art for Downtown Sudbury</b></h4>
<p><a href=""http://upfest.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Up Fest</a> is a public art festival that culminates in an emerging music festival and is topped off by an all-night art crawl.  From August 13 - 15, 2015, over 35 musicians in over 7 venues will transform the downtown core for 3 jam packed days featuring an all-night art crawl where the weird and wonderful collide under city lights.  </p>
<p>As an official Mural Sponsor, Old Rock is committed to help transform our city by “giving” our south wall to Up Fest (and Sudbury). We believe that public art has the power to transform the way we view and interact with our city by bringing people together and connecting us with our urban landscape.</p>

<h4><b>Coffee Fund for the Elgin Street Mission</b></h4>
<p>Your sommelier de café believes everyone in our community should have quality tasting,  fresh &amp; delicious coffee - that’s just part of our mission.</p>
<p>Our neighbours at the <a href=""http://themission.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elgin Street Mission</a> are often in dire need of coffee. <b>We want to ensure the patrons and volunteers of the shelter always have great tasting coffee.</b></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Help Us Make It Happen</h3>
<p>We’re excited to completely transform the Old Rock Minto location with an inspirational mural along Elgin St. (corner of Minto). Its design will focus on Sudbury, not Old Rock and will surely leave a lasting impression for Sudburians. <b>The cost for Old Rock to participate and support Up Fest is $5,000.</b></p>
<p>Old Rock has also started a coffee fund for our neighbours at the <a href=""http://themission.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elgin Street Mission</a>.  In collaboration with Pastor Rene, we estimated that the Elgin St. Mission needs an average of 16 lbs of coffee per day!  <b>With your generosity, we hope to raise $5,000 for the Elgin Street Mission. </b> Your donation will  brighten the days of the patrons at Elgin Street Mission with delicious, fresh &amp; local coffee. If we reach our goal, we’ll be able to start manufacturing coffee at cost (no profit) for the Elgin Street Mission.</p>
<p><b><br/>
</b></p>
<h3>Your Donation is Shared Equally</h3>
<p>Old Rock will ensure that both causes are equally shared 50/50.  If we raise funds beyond our total goal of $10,000 ($5,000 for Up Fest and $5,000 for Elgin Street Mission), any additional amount beyond that will be applied to the Elgin Street Mission Coffee Fund.  <br/>

</div></div>","STRETCH / HOOK, a live performance integrating sculptural installation, dance and live music will premiere on May 28, 2016 at Cotuit Center for the Arts! We need YOUR HELP to make this happen!!!

STRETCH / HOOK  STRETCH / HOOK is a powerful and provocative live performance integrating sculptural installation by visual artist John Cira; dance and choreography by award-winning performance artist DeAnna Pellecchia; and original music performed by legendary jazz pianist Kenny Werner.  STRETCH / HOOK innovatively explores and pushes the boundaries between three distinct art forms, taking audience on a visceral journey. 
""...you want to touch it, to swing on it,  to see if it bends, you want to photograph it, to paint it, to make a play within its spaces...""- The Barnstable Patriot review of John Cira's spandex installation""...muscular, mesmerizing...unforgettable.""- BAY WINDOWS review of dancer / choreographer DeAnna Pellecchia""...to say that this music is affecting and enthralling would be a gross understatement.”– ALL ABOUT JAZZ review of pianist Kenny Werner





STRETCH /HOOK is a fully collaborative effort, layering the expertise, imagination and perspective of each artist, producing a compelling, multi-sensory performance. John Cira’s mammoth rays of illuminated spandex growing out of the floor, walls and windows slice across the space creating an immersive landscape for dancer DeAnna Pellecchia. On her journey she climbs, dives, swings, confronts and embraces, disappearing into and emerging from the towering walls of fabric. The kinetic facades alternate from blockade to cradle; obstacle to vehicle; friend to foe. Jazz pianist Kenny Werner, heralded as one of the greatest pianists of our time, plays a spontaneous composition, acting as a fluid partner for the athletic and daring choreography. The three elements intertwine and drive each other, culminating in a literal unraveling and exciting transformation of the installation itself. STRETCH / HOOK features original lighting design by Lynda Rieman and couture costuming by fashion designer Carlos Villamil.

<p><b>I've been working as an art director in video games for a few years and I'm currently creating concept art for the <b>animation</b> film industry. </b></p>

<p><b>I've been asked <b>sometimes </b>if I have any books of my artwork. Well, I've never done one before so I've decided to put together my sketches, drawings, and doodles from over the years, and show you an idea of their creative processes.</b></p>

</div></div>","A little bit about me

Hey there, I'm Dani Diez.
 If I had to describe myself, I'd say I'm a professional illustrator, a painter, a concept artist or maybe a draftsman too... so just mix them up and there you go! :)
I've been working as an art director in video games for a few years and I'm currently creating concept art for the animation film industry. 
This is my first attempt for what I really want to end up doing; I'd like to
share my personal ideas with you.
 This is why I'm collecting daily drawings from my sketchbooks and projects into a beautifully printed book I've called ""The Draftsman's Close"".


I've been asked sometimes if I have any books of my artwork. Well, I've never done one before so I've decided to put together my sketches, drawings, and doodles from over the years, and show you an idea of their creative processes.

I need your help getting funded so that I can cover my costs of printing a first run of these sketchbooks. 




The Sketchbook


- Size: 148x210mm (5.8x8.3 inches)
- Perfect Bound Paperback
- 100 pages aprox, full of sketches and drawings including many never ever published works.
- Includes an in-depth showcase exploring my creative process, including sketches and preliminaries. 
- You will also find notes and little explanations.
- High quality printing. ( I want the drawings to look as close to the hand-made ones as possible, so I'm putting a lot of effort in the printing.)




What I need, what you get
I would like to make an initial printing run of 200 books, which will cost approximately $900 to get printed. 
The book will be sent to you for free, regardless of the country. Shippings will cost about $300. 
Indiegogo's and Paypal's fees will be around $200.
I'm also making postals, posters and bookmarks too; in order for you to have very special rewards. I've been preparing a few funding tiers with perks, so each person can choose the one they like the most.

The Shaman Series

During September '14 I did a self challenge: To draw a character per day, under the topic ""Shamans"". A lot of artists joined me using the tag #Septemberofshamans.
All the shamans are included in Draftsman's Close!

<p>In 1971, Lewis VanDercar was hired to build a dragon on the incredibly unique property at the very southern most tip of Merritt Island, Florida.</p>
<p>""Annie"" which was the dragons nickname, graced the point of the property for over 31 years as a Brevard County landmark and all around Icon. Because the dragon has always been in someones backyard, the dragon fell into the same disrepair as the home and the entire property, as homeowners struggled with markets and various lawsuits that came into the picture over the years.</p>
<p>As a florida native and resident of Brevard for the last 30 years, I've seen the condition of the dragon slowly just collapse on to the island, to what is now just a heap. It was my opinion that the main problem was that the super awesome landmark needed to be removed from the realestate world and cared for by the locals that love her.</p>
<p>We have come along way from the idea to the day we buy the land!</p>
<p>So now we are in negotiations with the bank and do now plan to buy the entire historic property as a community. Remove the home and rebuild the dragon.</p>
<p>The property will be private accept for times that the property can be rented for special occassions, such as weddings.</p>
<p>So please help us as a community of universal dragon lovers, to help restore the local landmark and help maintain the condition of the dragon for years to come! Thank You!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our entire project, to obtain the property, restore the land and rebuild the dragon is just under a million dollar project. Of course thats what we would love to accomplish, but in the chance that we don't raise every penny by our end of this year deadline, we will seek a banks assistance to cover the rest, and then pay them back.</p>
<p>We would like to share the experience with you, so we have a couple of ways to reward donations. First is an ""Adopt-A-Scale"" program, which will come with a certificate of adoption and either your name on the supporters wall or a limited amount of people can get their name actually on the dragon.</p>
<p>Also the rare remains of the dragon can be shared amongst the donors. Alone or in a beautiful shadow box along with a dragon scale.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are now dragon lovers all over the world! Its amazing to me how many people have been affected so positively by Annie and her quirky look! So many had the chance to visit her on the weekends and create these magical memories of a special time with special people.</p>
<p>This campaign has the opportunity to ensure a new generation of dragon lovers and the memories that they will create!</p>
<p>You can sense the excitement when people find out that we are trying to bring Annie back home to her historic perch!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Madeleine Marine.  I am a commercial and fine art photography student working on my final portrait portfolio.  I have been a photographer for six years doing paid commercial work and conceptual artistic work for myself.  My specialty is abstract people portraits.  My personal artistic projects are always emotionally driven, honest, and vulnerable.
There will be 6 final images, and a short film of each of the six scenes.
This project is my most gorgeous, highest production value, and most heartfelt series of images I will have done so far.  It is my labor of love and something that I hope to publish and print and cherish for the rest of my career. If you contribute to funding my project, you will be helping me begin my foreseeable successful professional career with an amazing portfolio.I am so lucky to have a hard-working, and committed pre-production and production crew working with me to help make this dream come true.  All of the shots are storyboarded, shot lists are made, locations are scouted, and we are casting professional actors to be a part of the project.   What We Need & What You Get I will be funding a good part of the production but I would like $750 to help pay for location, props, actors, equipment, printing and supplies, food for the crew, and transportation.  We are shooting on location and designing each scene to recreate the past, revive past emotions, and make each image look like a gorgeous, emotionally driven cinematic still.
A fraction of funds will go towards rewards. I am offering large, signed prints-- individually and full series-- and books with the full series and their corresponding story and concept behind each image.
The more contributions I get, the better the quality I can my my production and presentation.

  The Impact If you help fund my project, you will help me share my stories.  You will help me inspire and evoke warm feelings of love and passion.  You will help me kick off my professional career with an other-worldly, gorgeous series of fine art portraits.

  Risks & Challenges If we do not reach our goal, the production value of my labor of love may be compromised. My crew and I will work as hard as we can with whatever funds we have to continue to try as hard as possible to create the beautiful photography series we envision. 

  Other Ways You Can Help Ever contribution-- no matter how small-- helps enormously. If you cannot afford to help fun my project, please inform other and share my proposal with your friends, acquaintances and family.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

BIOARTNERGY we combine biosciences with art in the form
of installations, hands on workshops and various media work. We collaborate with many
artists around Yogyakarta and once per year we try to show the bio-art produced by citizen science
communities in our festival on Open Science and Art.   By this campaign we want to share and publish our movement as students to give more education for public about the importance of bioscience in unique and creative way! <br/>If you are passionate about science and you are interested to see our documentation from the festival, send us a small contribution and become a supporter of open science efforts in the Global South.<br/><div>
<b><br/>BIOARTNERGY #3:</b>
<p>After the
success of BIOARTNERGY #1 and BIOARTNERGY #2,  BIOARTNERGY #3 will have a theme - “A journey to the unseen world”.  We will reveal
the secrets of the minuscule world ignored by the society. The exhibited
projects will show the wonder and importance of those microorganisms in many
aspects of life. With this theme we also try to challenge the creativity of
students and our partners on how they’d see the facts of life in their own
perspective and present them in an interesting way. We hope that this would
fulfill our main goal, that is to enlighten the general public just how fascinating
and significant is the presence of the little giants in the everyday life, and
to kindle the potential of citizen science and DIY Bio in the society within
the city of Yogyakarta, and possibly Indonesia.</p>
<p>BIOARTNERGY
#3 will take place in Yogyakarta, the city of art and culture, where art
exhibition can be seen just about every day, but we can tell you for sure that
BIOARTNERGY is one of the pioneer of science-art exhibition in Indonesia,
especially Yogyakarta. This event is also the first established science-art exhibition organized by students of UNIVERSITAS GADJAH MADA. The detail is as follows:</p>

we wish to explore these reflections and patterns.</p>

Let us take you on a journey of some of the world’s most acclaimed headline viruses and bacterium. Presenting to you – The Contagion Cubes
 
 From Smallpox to Ebola, we have created six 3D designs of some of the world’s most destructive viruses and bacterium. Crafted into 3D cubes, these scientific visuals are infused with colour to achieve huge impact.The Contagion Cubes are brought to you by a team of young innovative designers who have worked tirelessly to deliver smart and conceptual design as demonstrated throughout our project.  The Contagion Cubes are more than just an accessory, they are truly a work of art. This tangible design has been carefully crafted to depict the designer’s replication of each product.Not only does this accredit its use as an educational aid but also creates a huge sense of admiration towards the sheer detail and craftmanship put into each cube. A true head turner and conversation piece.Each cube is polished to ensure a smooth surface but don't worry, we've made sure each individual virus and bacterium is sealed inside each cube so there's no fears of catching it!We are using the very latest high quality technology to ensure each individual design achieves supreme colour and highlight small intricate details that really make them stand out from the crowd.Let us take you on a Contagion Cube journey: The Black Death is one of our earliest Contagions on our collection’s timeline hitting its peak from 1347 to 1351, effecting areas throughout Eurasia, North Africa and Europe. The Black Death, also known as the Bubonic Plague, was a hugely disastrous global epidemic that resulted in the deaths of up to 75-200 million people.  Yersinia Pestis is a gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped, Coccobacillus Bacterium, without spores. This bacterium is the sole cause of the plague and is usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Every Yersinia Pestis model is available in your choice of the following sizes:2 cm Cube3 cm Cube4 cm Cube A virus that we are all too familiar with in everyday life. Coronaviruses are a type of virus. COVID-19 is a newly identified Coronavirus, otherwise known as SARS-CoV-2 that has caused a worldwide pandemic of respiratory illness.The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the three biggest respiratory disease outbreaks across the human population and there is still currently no cure.In our spectacular 3D depiction of COVID-19 you can clearly identify the structure of the molecule with clear indication of spike protein and lipid membranes.Every COVID-19 model is available in your choice of the following sizes:2 cm Cube3 cm Cube4 cm CubeEbola was first identified in the year 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This rare, severe illness attacks the immune system, causing extreme fluid loss and often death. Once infected victims can experience symptoms varying from fever, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and bleeding. Ebola Virus is a cylindrical/tubular molecule and appears in a long, filamentous form. From our detailed model you will be able to see structurally that it resembles a length of thread. Every Ebola Virus model is available in your choice of the following sizes:2 cm Cube3 cm Cube4 cm CubeThe origin of Smallpox remains a mystery but is thought to date back to the Egyptian Empire around the 3rd century BCE (Before Common Era), based on a smallpox-like rash found on three mummies.Smallpox was a highly contagious disease caused by Variola Virus.

<h1>Jean-Baptiste Monge</h1>
<p>The fantasy and Faery creatures of Jean-Baptiste Monge have been thrilling us for more than 20 years. His impish Gnomes, his big-shnozzed Goblins, grumpy Trolls and mischievous Fairies followed him to Canada to continue their tremendous story. In a studio much too small for his liking, Jean-Baptiste works on his personal projects and on the proper dissemination of his artwork with his partner Margo, under the infernal yoke of his two cats, Minus and Banana. Meanwhile, he also divides his time between different animation studios where his talent is put to good use as a Character Designer and Visual Development Artist.</p>

<p>This book echoes back to my childhood and the bedtime stories my mother told us, stories often imbued with magic from the moorlands of Brittany where she was born, and where I spent part of my childhood and my life as an artist.
</p>
<p><i><b>Celtic Faeries</b></i> is a collection of stories and annotations that I’ve written, created, or sometimes refashioned from Victorian-era texts, about the fairytale creatures who populate the folklore of the “little” Celtic mythology. We are not concerned here with the ancient gods, but rather with the little folk and their magic.</p>
<p>The book is filled with full-color illustrations, and presented in a somewhat encyclopedic format, though by no means an exhaustive one. Within its pages, you will discover creatures that are funny, impish, mischievous, or grumpy in the extreme, as well as enchanting creatures of great beauty, some with diaphanous wings, and others that are just plain endearing. But beware: in Faerie, looks are often deceiving. Stay on your toes, for here, the line between good and evil is a veil so fine that a simple whisper in the air is sometimes enough to tear it.</p>
<p>In this book, you will find descriptions of the nature of Faeries, their connection to the animal world and, of course, some hints on the places they frequent, as well as the different ways to spot them, lure them, and keep them for your very own…</p>
<p><b>SPECIFICATIONS of <b><i>Celtic Faeries</i></b>:</b><br/></p>

<h1>Goblin's WAY</h1>
<p>This is the name of the publishing house that I created with Margo in April 2013, and which Margo oversees full time and with great verve. Goblin’s WAY makes simple use of that little round bell that I’m so fond of, and that appears in almost all of my illustrations. It’s kind of my graphic signature. A little round bell is shiny, it makes a pretty sound, and you have to admit, it’s just too cute! On a more serious note, Goblin’s WAY is also a way to free myself of publishers and animation productions, and to be able to choose projects that I really want to work on. That freedom, so precious and vital to us artists, will allow me to create books exactly as I imagine them.</p>

<p>""JB Monge is a brilliant imagination and a link with the golden age of illustration. At once eminently modern and steeped in lore and tradition of centuries past. A worthy artist to support. I did!"" - <b>Guillermo del TORO</b></p>
<p>“Jean-Baptiste Monge has a rare and astonishing gift for capturing characters that magically transcend the page and leap to life. One wonders whether they are the product of his imagination or, as I like to believe, the visual diaries of an itinerant artist on vacation in the fairy realm.” - <b>Paul TOBIN</b></p>

On a more serious note, Goblin’s WAY is also a way to free myself of publishers and animation productions, and to be able to choose projects that I really want to work on. That freedom, so precious and vital to us artists, will allow me to create books exactly as I imagine them.

Testimonials
""JB Monge is a brilliant imagination and a link with the golden age of illustration. At once eminently modern and steeped in lore and tradition of centuries past. A worthy artist to support. I did!"" - Guillermo del TORO
“Jean-Baptiste Monge has a rare and astonishing gift for capturing characters that magically transcend the page and leap to life. One wonders whether they are the product of his imagination or, as I like to believe, the visual diaries of an itinerant artist on vacation in the fairy realm.” - Paul TOBIN

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! This is a campaign to raise money to release my coffee table book ""OH! THE HORROR!"" I want to release this in May of 2021 and make sure everyone who wants one gets a copy but I need your help to make that happen!</p>

<h3>Who am I? and What Is This Project?</h3>
<p>My name is Chris Butler and I run the Etsy shop Chris Butler Designs. I design and sell alternate posters of some of your favorite horror films. Since I was a kid my 3 passions were music, graphic design and movies (with horror being my numero uno). </p>
<p>I started my Etsy shop in October 2018 with 12 poster designs and have been overwhelmed by how much it has grown since. Now, with over 150 designs and 5,000 sales I have grown a small following on Instagram among fellow horror fiends like myself. I have had people reach out to me with pictures of entire walls in their homes covered top to bottom with my prints. I got to thinking ""What about all the people that like my posters but don't have the wall space?"" This lead me to make the decision to make a book. A book that would illustrate all my work.</p>
<p>Over the past year I worked endlessly on the layout. What size would it be? What would go where? How would I sort it? How many posters on each page? etc. I finally had a finished draft that was ready to print. When I received it in the mail my heart skipped a beat. I had not been that excited in a long time so I posted it on Instagram and Facebook. I received message after message from people who love my designs and wanted a copy! The comments and DM's kept pouring in so I decided I may have been onto something. </p>
<p>I spent the next few months perfecting it. Adding in stories here and there. Throwing in autographed versions I have received (The Bruce Campbell one is my favorite.) This is not your typical book of designs. I am not just a horror poster designer. I am a horror fan. This is a book made by a horror fan FOR horror fans and I want to share it with whoever I can.</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>I made the decision to not go through a publisher. I wanted to do this entirely by myself. A difficult task but most things worth doing are. By taking this on I have to handle getting these all printed and shipped by myself. I do this with posters every single day but a book is a bit of a different animal both in printing and shipping costs.</p>
<p>Because I am printing such a low quantity of these, the price per book is pricey. I had to balance finding a low enough price that also has the quality that I was looking for and supporters of my work have come to expect. I simply can not afford to print the quantity that I would like to to make sure that EVERYONE who wants one GETS ONE. This seemed like the best solution! If you would like a copy of this book NOW is the time to get one and I would love for you to be able to as I worked very hard to complete it.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, sharing this page would be a huge help! I worked really hard over the past year to complete this book and I am so excited to share it with you!</p>

<p>We are a group of twenty emerging documentary artists working to complete our Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degrees in Documentary Media at Ryerson University. The DocNow Festival is the culmination of two years of hard work, and an integral step in completing our degree: publicly showing our work.  We have a lot to say and look forward to the opportunity to say it!</p>
<p>This is the eleventh year of DocNow. Putting on a festival like this is a lot of work, and we have a lot to pay for. The good news is we have raised half the funds that we need to take DocNow into its second decade. Your sponsorship will help us close the deal and continue the tradition of excellence and free access to all events -- including film screenings, gallery installations, and more.</p>
<p>The largest portion of our budget pays for the theatres and galleries needed to show the work.  But there are other expenses, like speaker fees, film processing, web services, printing, advertising, catering, and so on. If we don't get all the funds needed, we will have to cut back on our schedule, and cut the other costs impacting the quality of the festival and access to it.</p>
<p>But this campaign is both give and take. We have perks that kick in at different contribution levels -- including priority seating at screening events, giveaways, artwork, and all of the above.</p>
<p>And there are even more ways you can help DocNow:</p>

<h3>What</h3>
<p class=""Section1"" style=""text-align: justify; font-family: helvetica;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Since the early 1990s, conceptual artist James Luna has worked collaboratively on an ongoing project titled The Shame-man meets El Mexican't, in which the assumptions and lazy thinking about ethnicity and culture in our society is challenged with a strong dose of melancholic humor and sharp-edged conceptualism. Currently touring nationally, the project uses nostalgia as style, a form of resistance and reinvention, exploring the cultural, symbolic and iconographic dimensions of “nostalgia” both on the Native American ""rez"" and in the Chicano ""barrio."" The artists participating in this performance are highly regarded in the national and international arts arena. James Luna (Puyukitchum/Luiseno) resides on the La Jolla Indian Reservation in North County San Diego, California. Luna’s exhibition and performance experience spans 30 years. His installations have been described as transforming gallery spaces into battlefields, where the audience is confronted with the nature of cultural identity, the tensions generated by cultural isolation, and the dangers of cultural misinterpretations, all from an Indigenous perspective. Local Calgary based performance artist Terrance Houle will participate as part of this dynamic performance as an invited guest. Terrance Houle is an internationally recognized interdisciplinary media artist and a member of the Blood Tribe. Involved with Aboriginal communities all his life, he has traveled to reservations throughout North America participating in Powwow dancing along with his native ceremonies. Houle utilizes at his discretion performance, photography, video/film, music and painting. Likewise Houle's practice includes tools of mass dissemination such as billboards and vinyl bus signage.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hello all. My name is Talia Johnson and I am an eleventh grader here in Seattle. Recently I came in to a once in a lifetime chance to visit Ethiopia and volunteer at the Richard Oslund Memorial Clinic on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. This clinic was founded, built and is operated by Blue Nile Children's Organization (BNCO), a non-profit based out of Seattle. One of my tasks there will be to organize and run a three week long art camp for HIV orphans sponsered by BNCO. </p>
<p>August in Addis is very rainy and the children don't have school. The crafts I will be making with them will engage their creativity as well as become a functional object. I will be letting them design and create their own wearable art in the form of t-shirt we will be repurposing in many ways.  The children do not have many clothes of their own and by giving them creative free reign, I hope to give them a real sense of ownership of self and mind, along with just having fun!</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What I Need</span></p>
</div>

</div></div>","Hello all. My name is Talia Johnson and I am an eleventh grader here in Seattle. Recently I came in to a once in a lifetime chance to visit Ethiopia and volunteer at the Richard Oslund Memorial Clinic on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. This clinic was founded, built and is operated by Blue Nile Children's Organization (BNCO), a non-profit based out of Seattle. One of my tasks there will be to organize and run a three week long art camp for HIV orphans sponsered by BNCO. 
August in Addis is very rainy and the children don't have school. The crafts I will be making with them will engage their creativity as well as become a functional object. I will be letting them design and create their own wearable art in the form of t-shirt we will be repurposing in many ways.  The children do not have many clothes of their own and by giving them creative free reign, I hope to give them a real sense of ownership of self and mind, along with just having fun!
What I Need


What I need most at this point is funding for the art supplies used at the camp. I will need to buy most of these products in the US before I fly over as there is a huge scarcity. I will need dyes for the tye-dying project, sponges, a large array of fabric paint, felting wool, white t-shirts of all sizes, etc.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I first created the Fellowship of the Fool Tarot deck while I was a student in Goddard College's MFA program. I have long loved the Tarot and have been teaching and reading the cards for over 20 years. Since 2009, I have been self-publishing the deck in several different forms. I hope to find a publisher to publish the deck, but until then, I am getting loads of requests from people all over the world for decks! I would love to be able to keep it in circulation, and the money raised from this campaign will help me do just that. </p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Fool Tarot is a multi-cultural deck featuring people from all walks of life. The deck is based on real people from my own communities, and is very magickal, featuring faeries, unicorns, and magickal beings of all kinds. It is also a unique reflection of the Pagan community in the 21st century. </p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the Funds raised, I would get 1000 decks printed, as well as books to go with the decks. If you help me out, here's what you'll get:</p>
<p><span><strong><br/></strong><strong>Donate $15 </strong> and receive a matted and signed print.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Donate $40 </strong>and receive a signed copy of the Fellowship of the Fool Tarot and a signed print.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Donate $60</strong> and you'll receive a print, a signed copy of the Fellowship of the Fool Tarot and a signed copy of the accompanying book.</span></p>
<p><br/><span><strong>Donate $100</strong> and you'll receive the print, the deck, the book, and a reading over email with me! </span></p>
<p>If I don't reach the full goal, I will still go ahead with the printing, I will probably not print as many. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My first printing of the deck was very successful - I sold out all 100 of the first copies I had printed. By printing 1000, I can distribute the deck wider than I have before!</p>

tribe. The Yaquis immigrated to Baja from main land Mexico, Senora, 
before the revolution of 1910. They are native Americans who have been 
in La Paz for generations. They came here to fish and dive for pearls. 
They were adept at holding their breath and were a great profit to La 
Paz at the time.</font><br/><font size=""4"">They have been left behind in 
the booming tourist industry. Many of the fishermen turned to the 
tourist industry as a new income, by taking the tourists out to see the 
whale sharks and sea-lionsâ€¦ The Yaquis have been socially excluded. Some
 say it's because of their alcohol and drug abuse problems ""They do it 
to themselves"". Some conspiracy theorists would say the CIA drug cartel 
targets certain disadvantaged areas to import and distribute to the drug
 market. What ever the reason might be, pointing fingers, will not 
change the situation one iota. The Yaquis children have a full 
understanding of drugs and the distribution of them. In the Arroyo I 
often smell meth cooking up.<br/>The future of these kids seem to be 
written and most of them would agree with that. In fact I often see 'No 
Fate' tagged on the walls.<br/>The fisherman are renowned to work hard 
all day then come home tired and drink alcohol. The women traditionally 
raise the children, but recently to keep up with the times have started 
to work. With a high rate of illiteracy not many women can find work in 
the fast evolving La Paz, many turn to prostitution. </font></p><font size=""4""><br/></font><div style=""text-align: center;"">

 Jose never asked his farther where his family came from before La Paz. 
He conceders himself Native to Baja Sur. He is a Pascadore Libre (free 
fisherman) who has worked for a private corporation for 30 years. I asked
 Jose how long the drug problems have been in el Esterito? Jose - ""15 
years, before that there were no drug problems. Now the children sniff 
glue, and cook Meth amphetamine."" I asked him what he thought about the 
Painting Pirates Club? Jose - ""It's very good for the children, since so
 many fathers lost their jobs the children have no one to teach them 
about the old ways, fishing and diving are not an opportunity for them. 
When they paint they learn much more then spending their day taking 
drugs. The kids are proud of the paintings, they show their painting to 
their families, they don't want anyone to graffiti over their paintings 
as it belongs to them."" I asked Jose if there was anything he would like
 to add in this article? Jose - ""To Love the sea, care and appreciate 
for the sea, in stead of drugs. I hope the children can go fish for free
 like before."" <br/></font></span></p><p><font size=""5""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/182504/pictures/original/20120308201349-GOPR0421.JPG?1331266428"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></font></p><font size=""3""><span class=""agText""><font style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"">Jose Maria Arse Ortega </font></span><span class=""agText""><font style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"">(Top right holding the fish)</font></span></font><font size=""4"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><br/></span></font><font size=""2"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);""> <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></font><br/><font size=""2"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></font><font size=""4"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);""><font size=""5"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 204);"">Betty</font><br/><br/></font><font size=""4"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);"">Betty
 is the owner of a fish and seafood restaurant in El Arroyo Concreto, 
her family has lived in El Estrerito for generations. Her farther and 
husband were fishermen. She is a single mother of 4 daughters. As a 
child Betty would go door to door selling her farther's daily catch. She
 now owns her own restaurant, which she runs with one of her daughters.<br/>You
 could defiantly consider Betty and her daughters a success story coming
 from El Arroyo Concreto. She and her daughters can read and write and 
have jobs in La Paz. <br/><br/>I asked her what she thought of the schooling system in La Paz? <br/>Betty
 - ""The Children go to school from 8h to 13h, they do not learn much at 
school. It is up to the parents to make sure their children learn. Most 
fathers are tired after fishing and the mothers are mostly illiterate. 
After the age of 12 most of the children don't go to school any more."" <br/><br/>I asked what the children did all day if they don't go to school? <br/>Betty
 - ""The Children turn to drugs, prostitution and cock fighting for easy 
money. This results in sexual deceases and drug addition. One of my 
daughters became addicted to meth, I took her to a detox home and we got
 her un-addicted which was horrible to go through and very hard for my 
daughter. At the time we had a detox home in La Paz, it was free to go 
to."" <br/><br/>I asked how she thought the people in El Esterito were holding up against the booming tourist industry? <br/>Betty
 - ""The People living in El Esterito live day to day, the people haven't
 had time to learn how to get a job in tourism. They are lazy and 
conformist and they have no confidence in themselves. The government is 
corrupt."" <br/><br/>I asked Betty what she thought the Painting Pirates 
Club has done for the people here? Betty - ""It's good, what you are 
doing for the children. Their mothers is gone or working, their farther 
are drunk and tired, so the children turn to vandalism. You have brought
 art and culture, the children have confidence in you, you have made the
 children proud of the paintings they do.""  <br/><br/>I asked Betty if she wanted to add any thing to the article? <br/>Betty
 - ""Yes!! Come to eat at Betty's! The freshest fish in all of Baja!"" she
 said with a cunning grin and then she added ""Love your colony, it is 
important that the colony gets organized, to understand the paperwork 
and the politics."" <br/><br/>Betty is the President of the Colony in El

 her restaurant. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></font><br/><font size=""4"" style=""color: rgb(51, 0, 0);""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></font><div style=""text-align: center;"">

 mid term project is to show Latin American films and documentaries to 
disadvantaged areas and teach them to film and make their own 
documentaries. Our
 long term project is to teach free expression in the schools, 
hospitals, the prison, and the battered women shelter in La Paz. Our
 over all goal is to teach people that they can make an income through 
art, and expression through art is good for them psychologically, 
physically, economically.

The Drug and alcohol ProblemsThe people we are teaching in La Paz have their origins in the Yaquis 
tribe. The Yaquis immigrated to Baja from main land Mexico, Senora, 
before the revolution of 1910. They are native Americans who have been 
in La Paz for generations. They came here to fish and dive for pearls. 
They were adept at holding their breath and were a great profit to La 
Paz at the time.They have been left behind in 
the booming tourist industry. Many of the fishermen turned to the 
tourist industry as a new income, by taking the tourists out to see the 
whale sharks and sea-lionsâ€¦ The Yaquis have been socially excluded. Some
 say it's because of their alcohol and drug abuse problems ""They do it 
to themselves"". Some conspiracy theorists would say the CIA drug cartel 
targets certain disadvantaged areas to import and distribute to the drug
 market. What ever the reason might be, pointing fingers, will not 
change the situation one iota. The Yaquis children have a full 
understanding of drugs and the distribution of them. In the Arroyo I 
often smell meth cooking up.The future of these kids seem to be 
written and most of them would agree with that. In fact I often see 'No 
Fate' tagged on the walls.The fisherman are renowned to work hard 
all day then come home tired and drink alcohol. The women traditionally 
raise the children, but recently to keep up with the times have started 
to work. With a high rate of illiteracy not many women can find work in 
the fast evolving La Paz, many turn to prostitution.

1) By teaching this people to express themselves you are giving them the courage to go after their dreams. One small nudge in the right direction.   2) The media coverage helps them to feel a sense of self-worth. The
 elitist social circles, which have grown out of the tourist industry, 
don't like the undesirables disturbing the tourists. Most of the 
disadvantaged and poor people stick primarily to their ghettos which the
 tourists are advised not to go to.3) You inspire the kids to believe, by being involved and belonging to their own club.When
 your father is out of the job, or is working several jobs for hardly 
any money, it is easy to assume that no matter how hard you work, 
because for where you come from, you will never achieve your dream... so
 why try? Many of the kids I paint with sniff glue and take other drugs;
 when you give them something else to do for 6 hours, it makes a 
difference. By funding this project you are giving them hope, making a difference in their lives and brightening up their world.

I have added two interviews from people who live in El Esterito to give you a better idea about the disadvantaged areas the PPC is working in.
Jose Maria Arse Ortega  
 Jose never asked his farther where his family came from before La Paz. 
He conceders himself Native to Baja Sur. He is a Pascadore Libre (free 
fisherman) who has worked for a private corporation for 30 years. I asked
 Jose how long the drug problems have been in el Esterito? Jose - ""15 
years, before that there were no drug problems. Now the children sniff 
glue, and cook Meth amphetamine."" I asked him what he thought about the 
Painting Pirates Club? Jose - ""It's very good for the children, since so
 many fathers lost their jobs the children have no one to teach them 
about the old ways, fishing and diving are not an opportunity for them. 
When they paint they learn much more then spending their day taking 
drugs. The kids are proud of the paintings, they show their painting to 
their families, they don't want anyone to graffiti over their paintings 
as it belongs to them."" I asked Jose if there was anything he would like
 to add in this article? Jose - ""To Love the sea, care and appreciate 
for the sea, in stead of drugs. I hope the children can go fish for free
 like before."" Jose Maria Arse Ortega (Top right holding the fish) BettyBetty
 is the owner of a fish and seafood restaurant in El Arroyo Concreto, 
her family has lived in El Estrerito for generations. Her farther and 
husband were fishermen. She is a single mother of 4 daughters. As a 
child Betty would go door to door selling her farther's daily catch. She
 now owns her own restaurant, which she runs with one of her daughters.You
 could defiantly consider Betty and her daughters a success story coming
 from El Arroyo Concreto. She and her daughters can read and write and 
have jobs in La Paz. I asked her what she thought of the schooling system in La Paz? Betty
 - ""The Children go to school from 8h to 13h, they do not learn much at 
school. It is up to the parents to make sure their children learn. Most 
fathers are tired after fishing and the mothers are mostly illiterate. 
After the age of 12 most of the children don't go to school any more."" I asked what the children did all day if they don't go to school? Betty
 - ""The Children turn to drugs, prostitution and cock fighting for easy 
money. This results in sexual deceases and drug addition. One of my 
daughters became addicted to meth, I took her to a detox home and we got
 her un-addicted which was horrible to go through and very hard for my 
daughter. At the time we had a detox home in La Paz, it was free to go 
to."" I asked how she thought the people in El Esterito were holding up against the booming tourist industry? Betty
 - ""The People living in El Esterito live day to day, the people haven't
 had time to learn how to get a job in tourism. They are lazy and 
conformist and they have no confidence in themselves. The government is 
corrupt."" I asked Betty what she thought the Painting Pirates 
Club has done for the people here? Betty - ""It's good, what you are 
doing for the children. Their mothers is gone or working, their farther 
are drunk and tired, so the children turn to vandalism. You have brought
 art and culture, the children have confidence in you, you have made the
 children proud of the paintings they do.""  I asked Betty if she wanted to add any thing to the article? Betty
 - ""Yes!! Come to eat at Betty's! The freshest fish in all of Baja!"" she
 said with a cunning grin and then she added ""Love your colony, it is 
important that the colony gets organized, to understand the paperwork 
and the politics."" Betty is the President of the Colony in El 
Arroyo Concreto, she often organizes free celebrations for the people in
 her restaurant.

consuming. There's no way you could just sit through a UA show and not be
gushing with excitement. I see great things for this group. All the way, yo!!”  -Joseline, Artist.


“This collective of wildly talented, raw,
and natural artists transcend and supersede the idea of an awe feeling moment
with the idea of an awe feeling experience. Urban Allure tackles stereotypes
and stigmas planted in the soil of an urban generation branded with an X. They
communicate the concept that through the power of art and expression one can
see the brilliance made, manifest in all of God's creations regardless of race,
sex, orientation, age, or class. I left the experience/show, feeling inspired,
touched, passionate, eager, and healed. They are the voice of our generation,
and it is beyond necessary for them to be heard across galaxies.” -Nathaniel

Canadian Spoken Wordlympics. The first festival included six teams of poets and
a small number of guests in attendance. In just nine short years, the festival
has grown from six teams to over twenty, with over 2,500 guests in
attendance.  This year will be the 10th annual CFSW and the first time it
will be hosted in Montreal between Nov 4-9, 2013. </p>
<p>This year, the festival organizing

<p> <font color=""red"" size=""4"">With that in mind, </font> the festival

 What we need: 
Up to this
point, the festival has been funded with support from the Canada Council for
Arts, as well as numerous volunteer hours from a dedicated group of
volunteers.  There are however still costs to cover to put on a festival
of this size. 
These include but are not limited to: 
- Paying artists to put on workshops for the community
- Sound and Projection costs
- Bringing in artists from isolated communities 
- Graphic design and printing costs
- Accommodation for featured artists

<p> <strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Since he was a young boy, Roy has viewed paper differently than most people. He sees possibilities of complex objects within simple paper that many others do not, similar to gazing upon a cloud, one person may see a deer while another sees a rabbit, or they may simply just see a cloud. His passion for paper awakened when he was just seven years old when he began experimenting with paper as a favored art medium; he's been creating with it and honing his craft ever since.</p>
<p>Roy's interest in strong geometric shapes and patterns, his eye for graphic flair and intricate paper work has taken him across the globe. His work has been featured in cities throughout the California Central Valley, San Francisco, New York City, and Japan. Some of the artist's more notable achievements have been being commissioned to make decorative paper boxes for Tiffany &amp; Co. display windows; being showcased in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, posters for the San Francisco Opera and the Joffrey ballet. His ornate paper lanterns can still be found in smaller galleries and boutiques.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How the Funds Will be Used</h2>
<p>This artist's hand-crafted works exemplify his love of distinctive design and turning paper into masterpieces. He has worked tirelessly for the love of his art, but the paper lanterns are labor-intensive, taking up to a week to hand craft from beginning to completion, and have become painful for Roy to produce now as a seasoned artist; yet he remains committed to sharing his awe-inspiring art with the world.</p>
<p>We’ve created computer files of Roy’s lantern designs and have made the prototypes.  All that is left is for the funds necessary to begin manufacturing.  Contributions will go towards the purchasing of materials and equipment that are required to produce Roy’s paper lanterns more efficiently and in higher volumes so that everyone can enjoy his life’s work.</p>

So if you are from Europe, America or Asia and wish to add to your resume of work and exhibitions, you will be able to use the space to do so.Most Exhibition spaces charge new artists a fee to rent space in a gallery, this can typically range from $300-$2000, they are also required to pay 30-40% of sales, this is not my aim with this venture. I will ensure the financial running of the gallery through my own art and photography and through a smaller commission on sales 25% from exhibitions.In funding this project you will give Australian and visiting creatives the opportunity to showcase their work to the public and get a foot in the door. Many artists are from disadvantaged backgrounds or suffer from mental or physical disabilities. Their creativity is their form of self expression and often depicts their view of the world around them which can be wonderfull, confrontational, vibrant and unique.The money raised will go towards securing a long term lease on an appropriate property and a complete professional fittout to create a stunning new gallery space in Sydney. I will keep adding to this page over the following weeks and months as I explore suitable properties and ideas. The Aim is to raise $50000 which will establish the Gallery and ensure its gets a head start plus the marketing/advertising it needs in the early days. We hope through your generosity to exceed and double this amount but If the total is not raised a smaller venue may have to be leased or the alternative of pop up gallery/exhibitions may have to be explored. If you love photography, art or sculpture please contribute what you can, if your in a position to help with free advertising, marketing etc please support my campaign.You can contact me at www.matthewlees.com 
This is a Layout of the space I have in mind. Excellent street frontage and facilities, New artists get to exhibit their work at the front of the gallery on four 3 metre long rails and two easels. The photography studio is 2.1m wide by 5m long ideal for all sorts of photo shoots.Please contribute generously.Matt",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>About a year ago last week I, Chelsea Southard, began a relationship with a community of glass artists in Boston at Diablo Glass School. I came into the school one day in early July looking for candle holders, blue ones to be precise, I left with no candle holders but with a warm and welcoming invite to come back. So I did. At first I contributed to the school by doing photography, making promotional videos, giving lighting advice, and working on websites for the artists there. During this time I was also working on my own projects and installations, sharing my practice with them, going to college, and falling in love with glass, I was warned that would happen.</p>
<p>What blossomed out of this was an invitation to become a resident interdisciplinary artist at the school. I happily accepted and began my exploration into the medium of glass. I held a series classes and workshops at Diablo teaching students about sound, light, circuits, sensors and Arduinos, and how to  write code to be used creatively in art. Through the creation of a project inspired by my discoveries while working with glass and with the help of my students I have been teaching, along with the army of glass artists at Diablo; the culmination of this residency is to create a collaborative sound installation with glass as the primary physical medium.</p>
<div>This is the installation. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is the finale.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Concept</h3> <p></p>
<p>Things/Time
(read Things over Time) is a public installation work in which human agency and
its relationship to the material world is explored. The work will be installed within a simple mobile storage unit or POD. Through sound, light and
technology the storage unit is transformed internally into an immersive chamber
displacing the participant’s perception of the changing materiality of our environment
through time, <b>Decay</b>, specifically related to that which divides space, our
walls. This dynamic is both a present and powerful relationship as we
study the growing community and urban renewal within Boston. The placement of
this installation is intended for Berklee College of Music, for it’s central
and iconic place in the social and physical landscape of Boston. It will be installed at 1140 Boylston St., outside of Berklee, from <b>August 1st to August 16th.</b></p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Abstract</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>SOUND</p>
<p>The POD will be installed with a Quad sound system (4 speakers, one in each corner) which will play pre-recorded “sonic portraits” of 360 degree ambiances impulse responses and material and environment interaction taken the abandoned MBTA subway tunnels below Tremont St. in Boston, <b>America's first subway tunnels ever built</b>.</p>
<p>Since I will not have access to the tunnels until mid-July I have alternately been creating sonic portraits of locations within Massachusetts to mock up the sonic environment I am imagining. Below is one of the portraits I created using sounds sampled from Belchertown State School in western MA. </p>

<p>GLASS</p>
<p>The technique that will be used for the glass pieces placed on the walls are done by method of overblowing glass spheres. By doing this and then breaking the bubble; delicate, angular and jagged glass pieces are formed. This aesthetic was inspired by peeling paint on a decaying wall; textural, fragmented and metamorphic. Also when lighting these shards of glass the imperfections of the glass reveal themselves as beautiful refractions of light and and texture.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of spheres will have to be made! But luckily I have the support of an army of glass artists willing to collaborate and contribute in the process of making these glass walls!</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>LIGHT</p>
<p>With the use of a variety of shaped and sized glass shards refractions of light will surround the inside of a movable Storage POD unit. This unit will be transformed internally into a chamber that captures the ephemeral nature of both mediums.<br/></p>
<p>The <span>landscape of
glass diffusers will grow over the edges of the Pod
internally onto the opposing walls and ceiling becoming
a kinetic landscape in which the pieces of “fragmented wall"" become
active, showing movement and genesis through light. Kinetic action will be
generated by servomotors and Arduinos. </span></p>
<p>During the day natural light
will penetrate the inside of the POD creating natural optical refractions
surrounding the space. And at night these visuals will be controlled by LEDs
placed within the piece. </p>

<p>There has never been an <span>art installment in
a transformed storage POD of this kind in Boston or at Berklee.
This installation
will: </span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Give the city a new public art experience; a single-space
installation pop-up gallery in the form of an art pod</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Give Berklee the experience of their first student-driven, large scale, public
art piece</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Raise social awareness of particular
areas and buildings within Boston that are in need of protection and rehabilitation</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Stimulate the
forward-thinking of the community to begin improving such community
spaces
with appreciation for the beauty inherent in the
history and meaning of even these decayed spaces</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>This installation will be a way of
promoting
<i>“green-thinking”</i> </b>for the reuse of resources, <i>attracting critical tourism</i>, and of <i>raising
the public
image</i> of Boston based <i>businesses</i> and <i>institutions</i> past and present.
<i>Sustainability</i> will be forefront in the project’s development and
exhibition;
metal used for the internal frame will be repurposed from Boston's Prospect Iron And Steel salvage yard, the wood will be reused from a demolished home and awaiting sponsorship, the site power
will be from
roof mounted solar.</p>
<p><b>This installation will give attention to the glass
artistry within Boston</b> and <span>particularly to Boston’s Diablo Glass School,
located in Roxbury Crossing. As part of Chelsea Southard’s interdisciplinary
artist residency at Diablo Glass School she will lead a collaborative team
of glass artists to assist in the creation of Things/Time. The artisans
at Diablo will have the opportunity to learn and apply the world of
technology-based art to glass, helping to further the knowledge of
future artists in interdisciplinary works.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Sponsorship! And the Gaps that need filling.</span></p>
</div><div> <p>We already have people behind us!</p> <ul>
<li>PODS Boston; donated the storage POD used for the installation</li> <li>Prospect Iron and Steel; donating all the metal</li>
<li>Boston MBTA; access and support within the tunnels</li>
<li>You-Do-It Electronics; technology materials side of things</li>
<li>Berklee College of Music is lending us professional field recording equipment!</li> </ul>
<div>But we still need some funding for:</div>

<li>Transportation of the POD to and from location</li>
<li>The plexiglass for mounting the glass</li>
<li>Lots of epoxy resin for glass adhesive</li>

The (short) Story

About a year ago last week I, Chelsea Southard, began a relationship with a community of glass artists in Boston at Diablo Glass School. I came into the school one day in early July looking for candle holders, blue ones to be precise, I left with no candle holders but with a warm and welcoming invite to come back. So I did. At first I contributed to the school by doing photography, making promotional videos, giving lighting advice, and working on websites for the artists there. During this time I was also working on my own projects and installations, sharing my practice with them, going to college, and falling in love with glass, I was warned that would happen.
What blossomed out of this was an invitation to become a resident interdisciplinary artist at the school. I happily accepted and began my exploration into the medium of glass. I held a series classes and workshops at Diablo teaching students about sound, light, circuits, sensors and Arduinos, and how to  write code to be used creatively in art. Through the creation of a project inspired by my discoveries while working with glass and with the help of my students I have been teaching, along with the army of glass artists at Diablo; the culmination of this residency is to create a collaborative sound installation with glass as the primary physical medium.
This is the installation. 

This is the finale.

Concept 
Things/Time
(read Things over Time) is a public installation work in which human agency and
its relationship to the material world is explored. The work will be installed within a simple mobile storage unit or POD. Through sound, light and
technology the storage unit is transformed internally into an immersive chamber
displacing the participant’s perception of the changing materiality of our environment
through time, Decay, specifically related to that which divides space, our
walls. This dynamic is both a present and powerful relationship as we
study the growing community and urban renewal within Boston. The placement of
this installation is intended for Berklee College of Music, for it’s central
and iconic place in the social and physical landscape of Boston. It will be installed at 1140 Boylston St., outside of Berklee, from August 1st to August 16th.




   Abstract 

SOUND
The POD will be installed with a Quad sound system (4 speakers, one in each corner) which will play pre-recorded “sonic portraits” of 360 degree ambiances impulse responses and material and environment interaction taken the abandoned MBTA subway tunnels below Tremont St. in Boston, America's first subway tunnels ever built.
Since I will not have access to the tunnels until mid-July I have alternately been creating sonic portraits of locations within Massachusetts to mock up the sonic environment I am imagining. Below is one of the portraits I created using sounds sampled from Belchertown State School in western MA. 

GLASS
The technique that will be used for the glass pieces placed on the walls are done by method of overblowing glass spheres. By doing this and then breaking the bubble; delicate, angular and jagged glass pieces are formed. This aesthetic was inspired by peeling paint on a decaying wall; textural, fragmented and metamorphic. Also when lighting these shards of glass the imperfections of the glass reveal themselves as beautiful refractions of light and and texture.
Lots and lots of spheres will have to be made! But luckily I have the support of an army of glass artists willing to collaborate and contribute in the process of making these glass walls!




LIGHT
With the use of a variety of shaped and sized glass shards refractions of light will surround the inside of a movable Storage POD unit. This unit will be transformed internally into a chamber that captures the ephemeral nature of both mediums.
The landscape of
glass diffusers will grow over the edges of the Pod
internally onto the opposing walls and ceiling becoming
a kinetic landscape in which the pieces of “fragmented wall"" become
active, showing movement and genesis through light. Kinetic action will be
generated by servomotors and Arduinos. 
During the day natural light
will penetrate the inside of the POD creating natural optical refractions
surrounding the space. And at night these visuals will be controlled by LEDs
placed within the piece. 



  The Impact 
There has never been an art installment in
a transformed storage POD of this kind in Boston or at Berklee.
This installation
will: 


Give the city a new public art experience; a single-space
installation pop-up gallery in the form of an art pod
Give Berklee the experience of their first student-driven, large scale, public
art piece
Raise social awareness of particular
areas and buildings within Boston that are in need of protection and rehabilitation

Stimulate the
forward-thinking of the community to begin improving such community
spaces
with appreciation for the beauty inherent in the
history and meaning of even these decayed spaces


This installation will be a way of
promoting
“green-thinking” for the reuse of resources, attracting critical tourism, and of raising
the public
image of Boston based businesses and institutions past and present.
Sustainability will be forefront in the project’s development and
exhibition;
metal used for the internal frame will be repurposed from Boston's Prospect Iron And Steel salvage yard, the wood will be reused from a demolished home and awaiting sponsorship, the site power
will be from
roof mounted solar.
This installation will give attention to the glass
artistry within Boston and particularly to Boston’s Diablo Glass School,
located in Roxbury Crossing. As part of Chelsea Southard’s interdisciplinary
artist residency at Diablo Glass School she will lead a collaborative team
of glass artists to assist in the creation of Things/Time. The artisans
at Diablo will have the opportunity to learn and apply the world of
technology-based art to glass, helping to further the knowledge of
future artists in interdisciplinary works.
Sponsorship! And the Gaps that need filling.
 We already have people behind us! 
PODS Boston; donated the storage POD used for the installation Prospect Iron and Steel; donating all the metal
Boston MBTA; access and support within the tunnels
You-Do-It Electronics; technology materials side of things
Berklee College of Music is lending us professional field recording equipment! 
But we still need some funding for:

Transportation of the POD to and from location
The plexiglass for mounting the glass
Lots of epoxy resin for glass adhesive
Lighting!
Speakers for the POD
Hardware; screws, nails, tools, fasteners
Acoustical treatment

  Other ways to help and get involved! Come to the fundraiser on Saturday August 12th at Diablo Glass School! It will be night of food, wine, glassblowing, a silent auction and live music by some incredible Berklee Musicians, Sune and dmGida! Check them out!
SUNE
Boston-based duo Sune combines electronic sound, processed live vocals and generative visuals into an immersive multimedia experience.

<h3>Hi! We are the APU Slam Team! </h3>
<p>As you might already know, we are a group of five women (and our coach Brian) who love to express ourselves through spoken word poetry.</p>
<p>We go to Azusa Pacific University and are really looking forward to competing in the College Union Poetry Slam Invitational this April.</p>
<p>This trip is, however, in New York this year... And you know how far Los Angeles is from New York...</p>
<p><strong>which is why we are asking for your help! :) </strong></p>
<p>We participated in a regional competition this past weekend, hoping to get our nationals registration paid for if we had won first. We, unfortunately, placed second, and lost to first by 0.1 points.</p>
<p>Despite how bummed we were about this, we are hopeful that there is a reason why that happened. So now, we are leaning on our beautiful friends, family, and communities to help us out. </p>
<p>As this is a national competition, we are representing our university on a pretty big scale. We are currently ranked 27th in the nation, are the only Christian university represented, and are hoping to do even better this year!</p>
<p>We are currently at $0.00...We just payed $200.00 worth of registration costs for regionals in Fresno out of pocket (which is ALOT, especially for broke college students :) ) and are hoping that you'll be able to help us out! </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $4000 to cover everything - registration fees, transportation, meals, lodging, etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>Registration Fee: $750.00</li>
<li>Transporation: Flight ($362) x 6 = $2172.00</li>
<li>Lodging: ($300 - 2 rooms/per night) x 4 = $1200.00 400</li>
<li>Meals for five days for six people </li>
</ul>
<p>We know it's a lot to shoot for, but whatever you are able to give right now would be so helpful! Now, we'll get to the good part... WHAT YOU GET! </p>

We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.</p><p><b>Gifting</b><br/>Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.</p><p><b>Decommodification</b><br/>In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.</p><p><b>Radical Self-reliance</b><br/>Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.</p><p><b>Radical Self-expression</b><br/>Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.</p><p><b>Communal Effort</b><br/>Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.</p><p><b>Civic Responsibility</b><br/>We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.</p><p><b>Leaving No Trace</b><br/>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</p><p><b>Participation</b><br/>Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play.

Listen to Music Rewards: PLUS be the first to get live recorded mixes of live performances from the Buddha Lounge stage at Burning Man 2014.http://soundcloud.com/soulfoodmusicBuddha Lounge Theme Camp Mission StatementThe mission of the Buddha Lounge is to gift to the citizens of the playa the experience of music, sound and visual delights on the Esplanade creating close, interactive and intimate transformative experiences to those who venture by for a smile and a hug.  and now.........Top 10 Reasons to Camp with the Buddha Lounge!!!!!!1. PRODUCER STATUS: Be a part of the production crew gifting the citizens of the playa with transformative musical productions, visualization display and amazing aerial and dance performances and Intergalactic Rocket Art Car. Live Performances by Govinda, Diva Danielle, ChrisB., Jobot, Buddha Bass & DJ Dakini.2. WELCOME HOME: Place your home on one of the most prime and central locations at Black Rock City, located approximately at 9:00 and Esplanade we are placed near non-sound camps with an unobstructed view of The Man out our front door.  3. HELP produce one of the most amazing musical line ups on the playa providing a high quality sound in a smaller more intimate space.  Your role is negotiable.  Not everyone has to work and there are many ways to contribute in the areas of video projection, trash clean up, feeding the workers, mediation/yoga guiding, performances, fashion, cooking, decorations, photography/videography, etc. 4. ELEVATE your experience by partnering with experienced veterans that can guide you through everything from preparation, to how to get the most out of your time on the playa. As veterans we believe our responsibility starts well before the burn to help prepare first timers on all aspects of their participation to elevate everyone’s experience. 5. ART CAR The Intergalactic Rocket Art Car is space crystal jet racing across the playa taking you and 14 others to faraway destinations. 6. PARTICIPATE and or lead workshops on Yoga, meditation, fashion or whatever you want to share with others.  7.  HOT SHOWERS!!!!  Take advantage of our shared shade space, shared shower stall with water evap, shared kitchen and communal breakfast supplies, plus several kegs of Modelo Especial on tap all week. 8.  CAMP with your new family and we will reserve your space and be there to help you orientate with you arrive.  We have Modelo on tap all week and a gourmet continential breakfast with organic granola, fresh fruit, vegan & gluten free options. You will know exactly where to go and how to find your space we saved for you.  24x7 power is also available per your arrangement with camp leaders. 9.  PARK your RV.  RV's are welcomed and will get reserved spaces, with accessible service lanes and 24x7 power is available per your arrangement with camp leaders. 10. Make your next best friends for life at the Buddha Lounge.  MUSICThe Buddha Lounge Sound Camp attracts international recording artists Emancipator, Desert Dwellers, Kaminanda, Pumpkin, ChrisB., Goldrush, Random Rab, The Human Experience, Quade, Jobot, Govinda, Sixis, Nico Luminous & Kalya Scintilla to perform inspiring & requiring us to offer impeccable Sound, Lighting & Video for the ""Free Concerts!""  It's important to state that no $ goes to individual people as the Buddha Lounge is managed 100% by volunteers. All funds go toward producing our camp for this event: rentals, equipment, transportation & hard costs. Buddha Lounge sound camp has played at festivals including Burning Man, LIB, Gem & Jam, Lucidity, Serenity, Firefly, Bass Star & Sonic Bloom. For those who can't camp with us or experience our sound stage at Burning Man, you can still contribute to the project, starting at $5 with ""Advance Digital Download"" of Buddha Bass featuring Burning Man music headliners Kaminanda, Kalya Scintilla, Govinda, Desert Dwellers, Pumpkin, Dela Moontribe, Quade, Sattva Ananda, Mutiny & Sinoeh.  The Label Soulfood Music has agreed to donate 100% of their music proceeds to the Buddha Lounge. Camp dues will provide for much of our budget on the playa this year but this campaign is meant to supplement those resources and provide some great tunes to those who either want to be reminded of the good times at Buddha Lounge and say thank you, or who can't make it and want the good vibes to travel with them wherever they are. Burning Man Budget $15,000 but this is just the minimum and we can make the camp even better as the camp fills out. 1. Stage, Sound & Lights $7k (Additional budget expands this plan) 2. Transportation, trailers, trucks, fuel,   $4k3. Power & Electrical  $3k (Additional budget expands this plan) 4. Camp Supplies $1k (Additional budget expands this plan) 10 Principles of Burning Man:Radical InclusionAnyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.GiftingBurning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.DecommodificationIn order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.Radical Self-relianceBurning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.Radical Self-expressionRadical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.Communal EffortOur community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.Civic ResponsibilityWe value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.Leaving No TraceOur community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.ParticipationOur community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.ImmediacyImmediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>CHI SIAMO</b></p>
<p>Il nostro progetto nasce dal parternariato tra
l’associazione Perda Sonadora di Seneghe e la Cooperativa Sociale CTR di
Cagliari e consiste nella pubblicazione di un libro di testi poetici prodotti
all’interno del laboratorio “La casa della poesia” ,condotto dalle poetesse
Azzurra D’Agostino e Francesca Matteoni e rivolto a persone in condizioni di
disagio psichico.</p>
<p>Perda Sonadora, attraverso l’animazione
culturale e sociale, ha come obiettivo la valorizzazione del proprio patrimonio
storico, culturale e artistico finalizzata a un confronto maturo con il mondo
contemporaneo e la realtà esterna. La cooperativa sociale <b>C</b>omunicazione <b>T</b>erritorio
<b>R</b>elazioni è articolata in diverse
aree d'intervento socio-sanitario, ma questo progetto nasce specificamente
dall’area dell’intervento per la Salute Mentale e vede coinvolti quattro
servizi di cui tre strutture residenziali per persone in condizione di disagio
psichico e un servizio diurno a struttura sovracomunale rivolto alla stessa
tipologia di utenza, tutti collocati ad Oristano e provincia.  </p>
<p><b>IL LIBRO</b></p>
<p>Il libro avrà come titolo “Un ponte gettato sul mare” e

Il nostro progetto nasce dal parternariato tra
l’associazione Perda Sonadora di Seneghe e la Cooperativa Sociale CTR di
Cagliari e consiste nella pubblicazione di un libro di testi poetici prodotti
all’interno del laboratorio “La casa della poesia” ,condotto dalle poetesse
Azzurra D’Agostino e Francesca Matteoni e rivolto a persone in condizioni di
disagio psichico.
Perda Sonadora, attraverso l’animazione
culturale e sociale, ha come obiettivo la valorizzazione del proprio patrimonio
storico, culturale e artistico finalizzata a un confronto maturo con il mondo
contemporaneo e la realtà esterna. La cooperativa sociale Comunicazione Territorio
Relazioni è articolata in diverse
aree d'intervento socio-sanitario, ma questo progetto nasce specificamente
dall’area dell’intervento per la Salute Mentale e vede coinvolti quattro
servizi di cui tre strutture residenziali per persone in condizione di disagio
psichico e un servizio diurno a struttura sovracomunale rivolto alla stessa
tipologia di utenza, tutti collocati ad Oristano e provincia.  
IL LIBRO
Il libro avrà come titolo “Un ponte gettato sul mare” e
costituirà la raccolta di tutta la produzione laboratoriale, circa 200 poesie. Gli
autori sono persone con serie compromissioni della sfera affettiva e relazionale
e bisognosi di interventi terapeutici ad alta protezione sanitaria e sociale
insieme ai loro Educatori professionali e Operatori Socio Sanitari. In tutto 18
persone.
Le poesie saranno accompagnate da illustrazioni, anch’esse
realizzate da uno degli ospiti di una struttura psichiatrica.
Il libro verrà presentato al festival “L’importanza di
essere piccoli “ad agosto 2016 sull’Appennino tosco emiliano. Sarà questo un
modo per andare oltre i confini e riattraversare quel ponte creato tra l’isola
e la terra ferma. La raccolta verrà inoltre presentata al prossimo Cabudanne de
sos poetas a Seneghe e deve essere pubblicato entro la metà di luglio.
PERCHE’ FINANZIARLO
Inutile dire che questo libro ha una forte valenza sociale e
culturale.  Un
ponte gettato sul mare vuole superare le barriere e gli stereotipi
culturali legati alla malattia mentale, vuole contribuire a un cambiamento nel
pensare e affrontare il disagio psichico così diffuso nel mondo contemporaneo.
Un ponte gettato sul mare nasce da un laboratorio in cui “normalità” e
“anormalità” non hanno costituito criteri di analisi o categorie di lettura
validi.
Insieme “pazienti” e “operatori” hanno guardato e tradotto
in versi emozioni, sguardi, ricordi e tutti si sono trovati a scoprire una
modalità espressiva comune di cui nessuno era esperto, in cui gli inevitabili
rapporti di potere si annullavano.
Forse questo è il valore maggiore di questa produzione
artistica: a parità di “incompetenza”, tutti siamo messi a nudo allo stesso
modo, con le stesse difficoltà personali; ma è proprio dalla comune
incompetenza che ci si può reciprocamente “curare”.

<span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Hello, my name is Riana Casas, and I am a recent college graduate from the College of Saint Rose in Albany, NY. I received my Bachelors in Fine Arts concentrating in Painting and Printmaking, with minors in Art History and Psychology in May 2014. Getting a job in the arts field is something that I have to admit, I wasn't quite prepared for in my previous schooling. Although I did get a job as a Gallery Attendant at Dia:Beacon and juggle waitressing while waiting for an opportunity to arise in which I can make art, or find a way into the art world. Residencies are the vehicle on which artists make the journey across the art world bridge that separates themselves from the galleries, and making a difference. Therefore, receiving a residency out of college is a big deal. Today, I found out that I was accepted into the Vermont Studio Center for a printmaking residency with some grant money and work exchange. I received a residency, AND I am being given some aid to help the residency occur. However, I do not make much money at the museum and waitressing combined and really need some help raising money to make my first big step into being an art student and a working professional artist! The remainder of my bill is $2,500 for a month in the Green Mountains, Johnson, Vermont. Therefore, this page will hopefully help me raise a majority of this remainder! This contribution would be making a dream come true, and giving this emerging artist my first big break. </span><br/>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Breathing
Peace mural campaign emerged from my experience of creating my first mural in
the Patterson Park community of Baltimore. The intention of this mural was
to connect the diverse community while sharing a message of unity, peace

<h4>How you can Support</h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are deeply

$4,500 by March 2014. The materials for each mural will cost an average of
$1,000 and the majority of your donation will go directly to purchase supplies
and the remainder to cover living expenses. The goal is to paint 4 to 5 murals,

additional murals will be created for other communities.</span></p>

powerful medium to inspire and transform public spaces. They provide

communities to their innate potential. Through this project, Pablo hopes
to use art as a tool to build and inspire a sense of collective responsibility,
encouraging people to take ownership of their space while building confidence

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Who we are?</span> Booktilla® is a product designed and developed by Sintegy®. We are a company that deals with enterprise strategic development (strategy, organization, corporate identity, innovation and business development, ...).
We believe in companies that - large or small - exist relying on a passion, on the willingness to undertake and engage with dedication and enthusiasm, to provide new and useful products that improve people's lives, stimulating and inspiring them.
Our purpose is to contribute to the development of this type of business ... DEVELOPING THE ESSENCE OF ENTERPRISES.

<br/>We do this, supporting and directing companies in their development. We also do research with the aim of creating tools and management approaches, source of inspiration and innovation for companies. Through books, training sessions, events, and more, we also want to help to develop a sound corporate culture.
Precisely for this reason (and because we like to undertake), we created, as a company, products that are source of inspiration ... Booktilla® wants to be an example in this direction.

<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Why?</span> Booktilla® is born:

<br/>- To help to reduce pollution and waste of resources generated by ""disposable"" bottles;

<br/>- To convert bottle in a design product that, with its different versions, can help to express ourselves;

<br/>- To be an example of how each product can be innovated;

<br/>- To raise awareness of how important it is to drink water;

<br/>- To support initiatives and social innovation projects.
<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Why support us?</span><br/>If you think that every single product, even traditional ones, can be subject to important developments and continuous improvement ...<br/>If you think every product is supposed to bring joy and benefit to the people ...<br/>If you think that every product should offer, in some way, an opportunity to support initiatives to improve and make more beautiful the context in which we live ...<br/>If you think it's right to choose those products that contain within themselves important messages and meanings ...
<br/>
If you think that a product can and should go beyond its basic function, contributing also and above all to create more responsible lifestyles ...

<br/>If you think that a product may be an opportunity to help to express yourself and your values ...

<br/>... then you have to support Booktilla®.
<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Booktilla<sup>®</sup> Story</span>: Booktilla® is the brainchild of Pierluigi Cupri, Strategic Developer and Head of the Development Center for a Social Role of Enterprises and Territory improvement, in Sintegy®.<br/>Noting the inconvenience of half-liter bottles, especially for people who travel with work bag, he thoughts: ""Why not create a bottle more convenient, more beautiful and reusable?"".
<br/>In about a year and a half, the idea has since moved to register the design model (April 2014), the search for partners in line with our values for development and production, materials research, development product and its meanings and values, trademark registration, coming to what today Booktilla® is.
<br/>A path that allowed us to explore, to grow and work with beautiful business realities.
<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Where are we now?</span>We are almost done: for months we have been working with our business partners on the development and production of Booktilla® and, with their help, we have created a first prototype production.
<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Why Booktilla<sup>®</sup> on Indiegogo?</span> There are different ways to finance a project.

<br/>We have chosen to design Booktilla® with an additive antibacterial. In collaboration with MaTech® of the Galileo Park of Padua, we have taken a Research in order to find the most suitable additive.

Several studies and investigations show that additives with silver can contribute to the reduction of the bacterial load.

In any case, be sure to use the same account you used for the first contribution(s), so that we'll be able to link them all to you.
<strong><br/><br/>Can I freeze water in my Booktilla®?</strong>
<br/>Sure! But, it is obviously a good idea to not fill full your bottle to the very top before freezing - as water will expand once frozen. <br/><br/><strong>In addition to Black, Green, Blue and Red, Booktilla® is available in other colors?</strong>
<br/>Not at the moment. The colors of Booktilla (each one with its own name, identity and related initiatives) are the only colors available.

In future, however, we will develop other versions of Booktilla®, related to events, or to the world of art, or limited editions, that could provide for other colors.<br/><br/><strong>What is the temperature range of Booktilla®?</strong>
<br/>The body of Booktilla is made of HDPE, which can withstand temperatures from -50 ° C (-58 ° F) to 110 ° C (230 ° F). <br/><br/><p><span><b>What is estimated delivery time of Booktilla®?</b></span><span><br/></span></p><p><span>October 2015.</span>
</p><br/><strong><span lang=""en""><span>Can I fill</span> <span>Booktilla®</span> <span>with</span> <span>beverages other than water</span>?</span></strong>

Of course! In passing from one drink to another, just remember to wash it well, otherwise it could be the taste or smell of earlier drinks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Siamo un’impresa che si occupa di sviluppo strategico dell’impresa (strategia, organizzazione, identità d’impresa, innovazione e sviluppo del business, …).
<br/>Crediamo in imprese che – grandi o piccole che siano –  esistono fondandosi su una passione, sulla voglia di intraprendere e di impegnarsi con dedizione ed entusiasmo, per offrire prodotti nuovi e utili, che migliorano la vita delle persone, stimolandole e ispirandole.
Il nostro scopo è quello di contribuire allo sviluppo di questo tipo di imprese … di SVILUPPARE L’ESSENZA DELLE IMPRESE.

<br/>Lo facciamo affiancando e indirizzando le imprese nel loro sviluppo. Facciamo inoltre attività di ricerca con l’intento di dare vita a strumenti e approcci di management fonte di ispirazione e innovazione per le imprese. Attraverso libri, momenti formativi, eventi, … ci proponiamo inoltre di contribuire a sviluppare una sana cultura d’impresa.<br/>Proprio per questo (e perché ci piace intraprendere), diamo vita, come impresa, a prodotti che siano fonte di ispirazione … Booktilla® vuole essere un esempio di questi.

<br/><br/><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: oswald; font-size: 25px;"">Why?</span> Booktilla® è nata:
<br/>
– per contribuire a ridurre l’inquinamento e lo spreco di risorse generato dalle bottiglie “usa e getta”;

<br/>– per trasformare la bottiglia da imballaggio a un oggetto di design che, con le sue diverse versioni, possa contribuire ad esprimerci;

BOOKTILLA® AND INDIEGOGO'S CAMPAIGN
Who we are? Booktilla® is a product designed and developed by Sintegy®. We are a company that deals with enterprise strategic development (strategy, organization, corporate identity, innovation and business development, ...).
We believe in companies that - large or small - exist relying on a passion, on the willingness to undertake and engage with dedication and enthusiasm, to provide new and useful products that improve people's lives, stimulating and inspiring them.
Our purpose is to contribute to the development of this type of business ... DEVELOPING THE ESSENCE OF ENTERPRISES.

We do this, supporting and directing companies in their development. We also do research with the aim of creating tools and management approaches, source of inspiration and innovation for companies. Through books, training sessions, events, and more, we also want to help to develop a sound corporate culture.
Precisely for this reason (and because we like to undertake), we created, as a company, products that are source of inspiration ... Booktilla® wants to be an example in this direction.

Why? Booktilla® is born:

- To help to reduce pollution and waste of resources generated by ""disposable"" bottles;

- To convert bottle in a design product that, with its different versions, can help to express ourselves;

- To be an example of how each product can be innovated;

- To raise awareness of how important it is to drink water;

- To support initiatives and social innovation projects.
Why support us?If you think that every single product, even traditional ones, can be subject to important developments and continuous improvement ...If you think every product is supposed to bring joy and benefit to the people ...If you think that every product should offer, in some way, an opportunity to support initiatives to improve and make more beautiful the context in which we live ...If you think it's right to choose those products that contain within themselves important messages and meanings ...

If you think that a product can and should go beyond its basic function, contributing also and above all to create more responsible lifestyles ...

If you think that a product may be an opportunity to help to express yourself and your values ...

... then you have to support Booktilla®.
Booktilla® Story: Booktilla® is the brainchild of Pierluigi Cupri, Strategic Developer and Head of the Development Center for a Social Role of Enterprises and Territory improvement, in Sintegy®.Noting the inconvenience of half-liter bottles, especially for people who travel with work bag, he thoughts: ""Why not create a bottle more convenient, more beautiful and reusable?"".
In about a year and a half, the idea has since moved to register the design model (April 2014), the search for partners in line with our values for development and production, materials research, development product and its meanings and values, trademark registration, coming to what today Booktilla® is.
A path that allowed us to explore, to grow and work with beautiful business realities.
Where are we now?We are almost done: for months we have been working with our business partners on the development and production of Booktilla® and, with their help, we have created a first prototype production.
Why Booktilla® on Indiegogo? There are different ways to finance a project. We thought we would do it on Indiegogo, because it gives us the opportunity to raise the necessary resources, allowing us already to promote and to share the values of Booktilla®.A development that involves excellent enterprises of Made in Italy

We want Booktilla® constitutes SOURCE OFTRIGGERS AND INSPIRATIONS for actions and lifestyles more and more passionate to themselves, the environment, small daily habits, ...

In any case, be sure to use the same account you used for the first contribution(s), so that we'll be able to link them all to you.
Can I freeze water in my Booktilla®?
Sure! But, it is obviously a good idea to not fill full your bottle to the very top before freezing - as water will expand once frozen. In addition to Black, Green, Blue and Red, Booktilla® is available in other colors?
Not at the moment. The colors of Booktilla (each one with its own name, identity and related initiatives) are the only colors available.

Attraverso libri, momenti formativi, eventi, … ci proponiamo inoltre di contribuire a sviluppare una sana cultura d’impresa.Proprio per questo (e perché ci piace intraprendere), diamo vita, come impresa, a prodotti che siano fonte di ispirazione … Booktilla® vuole essere un esempio di questi.

Why? Booktilla® è nata:

– per contribuire a ridurre l’inquinamento e lo spreco di risorse generato dalle bottiglie “usa e getta”;

– per trasformare la bottiglia da imballaggio a un oggetto di design che, con le sue diverse versioni, possa contribuire ad esprimerci;

– perché vuol essere un esempio di come ogni prodotto può essere innovato;– per sensibilizzare quanto bere acqua sia importante;

– per supportare iniziative e progetti di innovazione sociale.
Perché supportarci?Se pensi che ogni singolo prodotto, anche tra quelli più tradizionali, possa essere oggetto di importanti evoluzioni e miglioramento continuo…

Se pensi che sia giusto scegliere quei prodotti che racchiudono dentro di se importanti messaggi e significati…

 to be the soundtrack for your own artistic endeavors, along with 
opportunities to receive a postcard of one of the existing soundscape paintings or a
 newly created smaller painting on unstretched canvas. (Hear a track from Catalyst and view current soundscape paintings in the above video)The
 reward paintings are unstretched partly for shipping's sake, but also 
so that you may do whatever you wish with them! Book covers, pillows, 
bags, a patch for those pants you ripped, etc. You can even cut them up 
and I shall not be offended. On one condition: picture proof. ;)This series of paintings, titled Resonance, is a recent breakthrough in my visual release. For
 the first time in my life, I feel that I have found a cohesive series 
that is in line with the depths of my soul, interests and desires. The
 inspiration for these paintings is drawn from sound, galaxies, and the 
contrast of attention to detail yet free-form release.Many of you
 lovely individuals have expressed your excitement for these paintings 
and how they are developing, and that you wish you could support their 
progress financially. I completely sympathize that in our post-grad life
 and tight-budget economy, $100+ is quite the investment for a work of 
art. Also, many individuals have expressed that they would love to see 
these paintings go BIG (5x5').So, I thought it would be a 
good idea to put together a little crowd-funding project, where as much 
as you desire may be donated with rewards in return, and you can know 
that every penny is going to bring these paintings a larger life.Where did the $500 goal come from?A breakdown of supplies to go BIG:
60"" Stretcher bars = $40 per painting
6yd roll of 72"" wide canvas = $70
Paint = approx. $60 (large bottles of primary colors, metallics, and black)
Large brushes = $20 (set of four sizes)
Staple gun = $15
*Approximately $200 in initial supplies + $50 each painting after*I can make three 5x5' paintings out of the canvas roll I already purchased, so this first attempt is roughly a $300 project purely supplies-wise. My goal is to make at least five large paintings while continuing to
