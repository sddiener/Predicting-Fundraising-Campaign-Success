<p><strong>ABOUT SHIRA E</strong> </p>
<p>Hello wild &amp; beautiful people! My name is Shira E &amp; I am a Brooklyn-based musician, poet &amp; visual artist. I play electro-soul through the roaring mouths of electric guitars, a sampler, &amp; nutritiously thick beats. I've released albums independently for a decade &amp; opened for TuNe-YaRdS, Coco Rosie, &amp; Mirah. Music is what connects me to the hearts of strangers. There are times when I am writing a song that I am sent soaring, weightless, into utter aliveness. </p>
<p>I have been ferociously &amp; independently producing art on my own for over 10 years. While that’s meant an intimacy with my fans that is heart-nourishing, as well as complete control over my sound, it has also meant limited resources, lack of funding for production, promotion &amp; shipping, &amp; often, compiling CDs on my bedroom floor.</p>
<p>As an artist, I am in so many good ways never satisfied. From my core I feel a whisper: <em>evolve. </em>In the last year, I have taken numerous leaps, from learning a brand new instrument, to writing a new record swimming with sounds I had only dreamt of, to recording my first studio album “Shouts &amp; Sparks” decked with the care &amp; glitter it deserves.  </p>
<p>The album is done, &amp; it shines. “Shouts &amp; Sparks” is 7 bold tracks from the ocean floor of my chest to the tippy-rooftop of my imaginings. It is experimental &amp; gentle with its raw. </p>
<p><strong>I have no label. I need <em>your</em> help to get “Shouts &amp; Sparks” printed &amp; produced. I need your push to send me on my first solo cross-country tour (2 months from East to West &amp; back) to promote this music.</strong> I want to reach you, to sing to you in your living room as well as the ballrooms, in every city you desire. This tour is a step into the life I dream of, a life as a touring artist; it’s a commitment to push myself further than I’ve ever gone before.  </p>
<p><br/><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise $8,000 to put “Shouts &amp; Sparks” in your hands &amp; to send me out on the road. So much goes into making a record. I worked with the incredibly talented James Zaner of Blue Jay Studios &amp; I am buzzing with pride at our collaboration. Now I just need the funding to print, produce, ship, &amp; promote the album independently.</p>
<p>I also worked with the incredible photographer Alessandra Genovese &amp; the unparalleled visual artist &amp; designer (&amp; cousin!) Daniel Benayun on album art. What they've created is so delicious, so hot air balloon bright. I need to pay Daniel for his incredible promotional design, which includes posters &amp; a limited edition art book of my poems &amp; drawings.  </p>
<p><strong>To tour this great country requires funding. There are endless expenses on the road from lodging to gas to renting necessary transportation. But just imagine: a $40 donation fills the gas tank from Cincinnati, OH to Ann Arbor, MI. (Check out the map above to see where your donation could send me!) <em>You </em>will be adding shows to my tour, putting wind in my sails &amp; launching me for two brilliant months on the road.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PERKS</strong></p>
<p>Art guru Daniel and I have brewed up an array of shimmering treats to thank you for your financial support of this project. <strong>Everything from</strong> <strong>2-sided signed posters, to a limited edition art book of my poems alongside never-seen-before drawings (with a personalized fortune right from Shira E’s pen to you), to a “creativity party” on Skype where we can dance &amp; share a dream or two, to an unforgettable, intimate house show in your city!</strong></p>
<p>Every single donation, of any amount, is truly appreciated &amp; will be put to good use. In etymology, to inspire literally means “to fill (the mind, heart, with grace)” &amp; “to prompt or induce someone to do something” &amp;“to animate with purpose.” So often it is the artist that is seen as the inspiration, but within these definitions we can see the living symbiosis of giving. Your donation will fill me with grace, prompt me on my path, &amp; enliven me with purpose &amp; (literal) direction, as I head out on the open road with a sonic spark in my hands.  </p>
<p>This is it! Where I say, ""just one more thing."" Tell your friends. Tell your co-workers.  Dance to my tunes in the street. When people honk, yell ""It's Shira E's fault!"" Tell your lover, in every language you speak. Whisper it, Tweet it, post it on Facebook, spread the word. Know that your actions and love reverberate. This is one very large culmination of my life's work, and I just can't go it alone. This is where i say please, and I say thank you. And mean it from the bottom of my toes. </p>
<p>Yours in spirit,</p>
<p>Shira E</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>IN OTHER WORDS</strong></p>
<p><em> “Throughout my career no other artists has inspired me to create art more often than Shira E. No other artist has inspired me to fill up the rooms of my own echoing heart more often than Shira E. I can’t imagine better medicine for this world than her music. Supporting this project is building a lighthouse!”</em> <strong>- Andrea Gibson, poet</strong></p>
<p><em>""Shira E is a new type of artist. Or maybe it’s a very old type. It’s a style that I’m sure is going to take over the future. She is a generator of all media. Words, songs, clothing, movement, moments, she is an engine of these things and more. She is creating a world for herself and the rest of us to inhabit. A new universe seemingly brought from nowhere, which has appeared to have been there all along, as if by magic. I’ve heard people used that word, magic, in reference to Shira E many times. I think it couldn’t be more literal. Sometimes you meet someone or hear something and you understand in the animal way why the word magic was invented and the proper use of the tool that is that word. We made up the idea for magic just in case something like this happened. The laws of the universe need to be continually bent to make allowance for the continuance of the universe and that’s what Shira E does for us. She does all this while making it seem effortless, an act of humor, an act of joy. I truly believe that she is a genius.” </em><em> </em><strong>- Brian Ellis,</strong> Author of ""American Dust Revisited""</p>

We will be recording at Dimension Sound Studio with engineer Dan Cardinal. Along with the live CD, Big Old Big One and DeSant Prod. will be producing live videos of the production.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello Loves my name is Christine Nicole. I'm a pop songwriter/artist in Lubbock, Texas or as I like to call it, BuddyHollywood. My passion for my music is intense. I've been working on this album from the moment I graduated with my music degrees which has been since 2010. This project has been in the works for two years. It's been a crazy &amp; amazing journey. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I had decided a long time ago that pop music wasn't just going to be what I did but I would make it my lifestyle. In January 2010 I had all these songs I had written ready to go into recording but I wanted a writing session with my producer Teel Merrick of Polk Street Studios in Amarillo, Texas. It was supposed to be a quick session that turned into eight hours of pouring my heart &amp; soul into these songs. Teel helped me chisel away at the songs so that they would be exactly how I intended them to be. I write all my songs based on very personal experiences &amp; situations so I wanted them to be very telling &amp; very intimate. I wanted them to be able to be identified with. I wanted it to feel as though you are getting to know me through my music.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In April of that same year I went into the studio to start the recording process. I spent a lot of time in the studio making sure that each song was exactly how I had wanted it to be &amp; plus some. I had some of the best musicians working with me on the project so I knew I was in good hands. We finished the last song on the album in June 2011. I was sitting in the control room just in awe. I had put so much into every single song on the album. I went through every single emotion imaginable during the process of recording the album. I grew &amp; I learned &amp; I became a stronger person as well as artist. I am so incredibly happy with this album. I've been keeping things so hush hush but now it is time to get it into you all's hands!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So this is where you all come in...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I get the full $2000 all seven songs on the album will be able to be mixed/mastered &amp; ready to distribute on Itunes &amp; other paid music sharing sites. I am only $2000 away from getting the music to you in digital form at least! So the faster we raise the money the faster it gets to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Alright, so the easiest way to explain this is I am just trying to get the post production of mixing &amp; mastering my album completed. This is so I can digitally release/distribute the album online. If I were to want to do distribute the album physically I would need around $5000 but I figure to get the music to you guys lets start out by at least getting it online so that you all can get the music.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Whatever money I raise will go straight to mixing &amp; mastering the album in Charlottesville, Virgina. If I don't raise all the money the album will just take much longer to get done but it will somehow someway get done. I've put my heart into this project &amp; since it has been in the works so long I am so excited to get it into the public's hands!</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>Spread the word! The best way to get this fundraiser going is word of mouth. I believe that we can get this to spread like wildfire. If you feel like you can't give at the moment spread the word to your friends, family, neighbors, acquaintances, etc! Send out emails, post the link to your Facebook wall or in a message, tweet, &amp; blog it. Every time you mention this campaign you are helping me get closer to my goal. I can't do this without you all. I appreciate the love &amp; support.

<h3 class=""p1""><strong><em>How I got here</em></strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">Akory, my name is Marvin.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Three years ago I went on a journey to find something that I was missing in my life:<br/> a band that is like a family, experiences that broaden your horizon and a new way of making and living with music. I have always been a musician but wanted a different approach, maybe a way of doing the best thing in the world I did not yet know of. <br/> I brought with me some blues and experiences in rock and classical guitar, when I went to live with the folk and singer / songwriter of Australia, discovered the melodies and rhythms from South America and finally found happiness, drive and passion in Madagascar. <br/> I went there at the end of 2011 to work as a volunteer in a school („College d´enseignement general de Loukintsy“), teaching English and sports (physical education) to the children, when I met three brothers that have spent their lifetime only playing music.</p>

Each member understands what it takes to create quality music. For Awake the Atrium, quality music means, music you can relate to, feel, and be a part of. Music runs in our veins, pours into our hearts, and is finally exerted out our minds onto our instruments. <br/> The economy has hit everyone. Each member has done their best to support the band in every way they could, artistically, financially, and physically. Like you, Awake the Atrium has their responsibilities outside the band. Whether its diapers, mortgages, or utility bills, Awake the Atrium has fought for almost a year to keep itself afloat during these hard times.<br/><br/> Over the last year, Awake the Atrium has made great strides from being on the radio to playing a mainstream gig at Rams Head Live in Baltimore Maryland. Next on the agenda is our first CD release. For every musician, professionally recording music is one of the most fun yet stressful things to be a part of. It takes sacrificing time at work and with our families, along with a great deal of patience. For Awake the Atrium, this is something we’ve been doing for almost a year.<br/><br/> For our first EP, the only things that stand in our way are our stretched thin wallets. We don’t have merchandise to generate additional income or a ton of shows lined up, so it’s up to us to fine alternative solutions. <br/><br/> So here we are. We are asking you to help us record our first CD. This CD will help us generate fans, exposure, and income that will lead to merchandise. This is a business and without capital, you can’t take off. <br/><br/> To us, Awake the Atrium, isn’t just some weekend hobby and we aren’t some mediocre garage band your buddy is starting just to get popular at your local bar. We are here to bring you professional entertainment. All of us have been through bands with troublesome members and chemistry that just wouldn’t bind. For the members of Awake the Atrium, T-BO (Singer), Jordan (Guitar), Sherman (Bass), and Jesse (Drummer), this is the final push out of the struggle, out of uncertainty, and out of the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle. <br/> With your help, the next great band just may take off. <br/> Thank you for your time,<br/><br/> Awake the Atrium<br/>T-BO, Jordan, Sherman, and Jesse.</p>

</tbody></table></div>","Hailing from northern Calvert County Maryland, Awake the Atrium is band who deserves your attention. This rocking quartet has been together for less than a year and has already impressed many ears and picked up a rolling momentum. Each member understands what it takes to create quality music. For Awake the Atrium, quality music means, music you can relate to, feel, and be a part of. Music runs in our veins, pours into our hearts, and is finally exerted out our minds onto our instruments.  The economy has hit everyone. Each member has done their best to support the band in every way they could, artistically, financially, and physically. Like you, Awake the Atrium has their responsibilities outside the band. Whether its diapers, mortgages, or utility bills, Awake the Atrium has fought for almost a year to keep itself afloat during these hard times. Over the last year, Awake the Atrium has made great strides from being on the radio to playing a mainstream gig at Rams Head Live in Baltimore Maryland. Next on the agenda is our first CD release. For every musician, professionally recording music is one of the most fun yet stressful things to be a part of. It takes sacrificing time at work and with our families, along with a great deal of patience. For Awake the Atrium, this is something we’ve been doing for almost a year. For our first EP, the only things that stand in our way are our stretched thin wallets. We don’t have merchandise to generate additional income or a ton of shows lined up, so it’s up to us to fine alternative solutions.  So here we are. We are asking you to help us record our first CD. This CD will help us generate fans, exposure, and income that will lead to merchandise. This is a business and without capital, you can’t take off.  To us, Awake the Atrium, isn’t just some weekend hobby and we aren’t some mediocre garage band your buddy is starting just to get popular at your local bar. We are here to bring you professional entertainment. All of us have been through bands with troublesome members and chemistry that just wouldn’t bind. For the members of Awake the Atrium, T-BO (Singer), Jordan (Guitar), Sherman (Bass), and Jesse (Drummer), this is the final push out of the struggle, out of uncertainty, and out of the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle.  With your help, the next great band just may take off.  Thank you for your time, Awake the AtriumT-BO, Jordan, Sherman, and Jesse.

elementary school student, I was full of new and crazy ideas â€“ ones which were
unusual for the people in my village back then: I organized rock festivals,
theatre performances, I played in a rock band and at the same time I played a
Lithuanian traditional stringed instrument.<span style=""""> 
</span>As you can see, music has been my life from the very beginning.<span style="""">  </span>But rock and folk music were not enough. I
was seeking something that would contain improvisation, a strong harmony
system, and unlimited music language. So, I decided to study jazz. But people
kept telling me: you are a star here, but as soon as you leave this village
youâ€™re gonna be nothing, nobody. They just didnâ€™t believe in me. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">But I have

Soviet occupation, jazz was prohibited.<span style=""""> 
</span>This is why we still donâ€™t have an appropriate environment for studying
jazz music. This is where we study. But despite, all this Iâ€™ve achieved
unbelievable results. Because, <i style="""">I have

story
Hi, my name is Simona Smirnova. Iâ€™m a professional
jazz singer from a small Baltic country named Lithuania. And I want to tell YOU - my story. 
I grew up in the countryside. Even as a young
elementary school student, I was full of new and crazy ideas â€“ ones which were
unusual for the people in my village back then: I organized rock festivals,
theatre performances, I played in a rock band and at the same time I played a
Lithuanian traditional stringed instrument. 
As you can see, music has been my life from the very beginning.  But rock and folk music were not enough. I
was seeking something that would contain improvisation, a strong harmony
system, and unlimited music language. So, I decided to study jazz. But people
kept telling me: you are a star here, but as soon as you leave this village
youâ€™re gonna be nothing, nobody. They just didnâ€™t believe in me. But I have
always believed in my dream.
I was admitted to the Lithuanian Academy of Music
and Theatre in jazz vocals. I have worked really hard, practicing and studying
from 8 a.m to 10 p.m.  You might be aware
that Lithuania has been a free country for only 20 years - and during the
Soviet occupation, jazz was prohibited. 
This is why we still donâ€™t have an appropriate environment for studying
jazz music. This is where we study. But despite, all this Iâ€™ve achieved
unbelievable results. Because, I have
always believed in my dream. In these four years of my studies I
participated in different international jazz competitions
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kMyJ7iCoGE ) and made a lot of projects: main
stream jazz you heard at the beginning, theatre performances, video
performances, social experiments and lots of different concerts.
When I decided to apply for the Berklee College of
Music in Boston people told me it was impossible because Berklee is the best
jazz college in the whole world. For example in 2011, Berklee students and
alumni won 13 Grammys (http://www.berklee.edu/awards/awards-grammy.html).  
But
I have always believed in my dream. 
I have been accepted in jazz vocal department and
gotten a special scholarship of 16,000 dollars a year. But the whole tuition
for the year is almost 29,000 dollars. So, I need about 13,000 dollars for my
studies and beside this I also need money for the health insurance, the
mandatory laptop, for the flight, the visa and the living costsâ€¦ In total It
makes 30 000 dollars for the year that I need and donâ€™t have. In Lithuania it
is impossible to earn that muchâ€¦. The average salary in Lithuania is about 500
dollars a monthâ€¦.
Berklee College is arguably the best place in the
world for studying jazz music. My teachers and colleagues say that Iâ€™m a
talented and promising jazz singer, and that Iâ€™ll fit wonderfully into
Berkleeâ€™s learning environment.  However,
I wonder if the general public knows what it takes to rise to the top in the
field of jazz.  
Let me list for you some of the qualities that make
me stand out above and beyond the rest of my peers: Iâ€™m hard working and main
integrity while practicing and performing, I have an enormous amount of
professional experience within the Vilnius jazz scene, I have tremendous
flexibility and possibility within the capacities of my voice, Iâ€™m a fast
learner of music and technical concepts, Iâ€™m able to manage my time well, Iâ€™m
communicative, I work both as a composer of high level music as well as a
versatile performerâ€¦ never mind the fact that people enjoy my concertsâ€¦and hey,
Iâ€™m good looking, too!
If I have been able to develop my professional
skills to such a high extent in this small country, Lithuania, where jazz music
has been legal for only 20 years and where a jazz department exists at the
national conservatory for only 10 years, who can imagine how much I will
achieve when Iâ€™m a student at the best place for studying jazz internationally?  Think of the odds that have been stacked
against me:  Iâ€™ve been without a good
system and the necessary technical equipment for practicing and performingâ€¦ Who
can imagine how much I can improve my skills at a college where I will have
access to top-level teachers, will be surrounded by a community of fantastic
musicians, with the technical possibilities to make recordings and concerts?!?!

The
Impact
If my campaign doesn't happenâ€¦ The world will be
missing my voice and ideas.What
I Need 
I donâ€™t have any private funding sources as of yet:
my father is disabled, and my mother earns less than $500 a month. Iâ€™m applying
for other funds currently, and Iâ€™m trying to get international scholarships,
but Iâ€™ll get an answer only in September 2012, when I have start my studies -
and it will be too late. Now I donâ€™t have any money, even for my student visa
or plane ticketsâ€¦
So far, Iâ€™ve got a scholarship from Berklee for 16,000 USD for year.
Tuition for my studies is 28,850 USD per year (with scholarship, 12,850 USD per year).
Mandatory laptop: 2,985  USD.
Health insurance: 1,870 USD for year.
Plane ticket about $1,200 USD.
Housing, food about, visa: 13,000 USD per year.  Please
note that legally, I canâ€™t work or earn money during my studies in Americas.
For more information about the fees associated with
study at the Berklee College of Music, please click the Diploma Program at: http://www.berklee.edu/tuition/ 
TOTAL for the first year: 31,905 USD 
If I achieve my goal 30,000 USD  - the first year
of my studies will be guaranteed.
I can guarantee You, that all money goes to my
studies expenses.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Carol Sokoloff,  a jazz vocalist and songwriter who recently released ""Let Go!"" (Wild Song) a debut jazz album, comprised largely of originals in the style of the standards. Audiences, singers and musicians love my songs and I wish to make further in-roads in the music industry so my music receives widespread distribution and attention. ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (of music) holds an annual industry event called ""I Create Music"" in Los Angeles California, billed as the best of it's kind. I have registered, and now am scraping together the funds to attend. My husband Richard and I both work in the arts and have limited funds. This would be a great opportunity to find a place for jazz in the world and perhaps a larger exposure for my songs, one of which which Grammy winner Kurt Elling said reminded him of Hoagy Carmichael, and Grammy-nominee  Nancy King referred to as ""a new jazz standard"".  I am gratefiul for all help as this Canadian artist takes an important step. I am also an author and lyricist with published books of poetry, history, metaphysics and children's writing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This would help a Canadian artist take her work to next step. It is my hope that I will gain valuable information, connections and create exposure for my songs and lyrics. I am applying for all opportunities available at the conference to play or have my music played (in panels and performances.) The music does have 'legs"" and is well liked. This conference will allow me to meet other songwriters, possible colaborators, and importantly, to consider how best to publish my catalogue of songs, to meet with a 'mentor' and to have my music heard. I think all these factors are likely to have a significant impact in advancing my songwriting career!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to cover travel expenses to and from LA. I am thinking of taking the train, a favourite way to travel and an excellent source of 'song inspration' (ask Duke Ellington and Johnny Mercer).  I also need to cover conference registration and accommodation. </p>
<p>Travel to and from LA, $600</p>
<p>Accomodation: $500</p>
<p>Registration fee for the conference: $400</p>
<p>What I am most looking for is the energy of knowing that people support my efforts and wish me well... are behind me and rooting for me, are helping lend some of their energy to create some energy for putting these songs out into the world... (where they came from). It is all a large cycle...like the major scale. What goes around comes around (like the tonic and the octave).</p>
<p>I am offering every contributor merchandise or a service of equivalent or greater value including my CDs, books, magazine subscriptions (mailed anywhere) and Almost Free Advice!!!</p>

</p><p>CRASH—Erik Barsness, Heather Barringer, Peter O’Gorman, and
Eric Sundeen— has been invited to perform in Cuba as part of the Havana
International Festival taking place October 22-31, 2015. It’s a tremendous
honor to be invited to join other acclaimed artists from around the world at
this festival, and it’s an invaluable opportunity to bring our work to Cuban
audiences. However, the Havana International Festival cannot provide artist
fees or travel expenses, so we need to ask our friends, fans, and supporters
for the funds to make this important performance possible.</p><p>CRASH is a percussion group that embodies the concept of
music in motion. We perform the visual percussion works of composer and
artistic director Mary Ellen Childs. Childs has created a powerful body of work
that integrates music, dance and theater in fresh an unexpected and delightful
ways. Check out the video below to see what we mean. Every work is a masterpiece.</p>
<p>We’ve been performing as CRASH for decades (some of us since
1988), and in that time, we’ve polished the pieces in our touring repertoire to
perfection. We return to our work together year after year to bring these amazing pieces to as many people as we can. CRASH has engaged audiences at home
in the Twin Cities, throughout the nation (New York, Vermont, North Carolina,
San Francisco) and throughout the world (St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl). </p>
<p>Now we have the opportunity to edify and enthrall audiences
in Cuba. We’ll perform twice at the festival and once at the Ludwig Foundation. We’ll
even be taking our act to the streets, so that people from all walks of life
have an opportunity to experience CRASH. Festival organizers assure us that our

<br/></div>","CRASH—Erik Barsness, Heather Barringer, Peter O’Gorman, and
Eric Sundeen— has been invited to perform in Cuba as part of the Havana
International Festival taking place October 22-31, 2015. It’s a tremendous
honor to be invited to join other acclaimed artists from around the world at
this festival, and it’s an invaluable opportunity to bring our work to Cuban
audiences. However, the Havana International Festival cannot provide artist
fees or travel expenses, so we need to ask our friends, fans, and supporters
for the funds to make this important performance possible.CRASH is a percussion group that embodies the concept of
music in motion. We perform the visual percussion works of composer and
artistic director Mary Ellen Childs. Childs has created a powerful body of work
that integrates music, dance and theater in fresh an unexpected and delightful
ways. Check out the video below to see what we mean. Every work is a masterpiece.
We’ve been performing as CRASH for decades (some of us since
1988), and in that time, we’ve polished the pieces in our touring repertoire to
perfection. We return to our work together year after year to bring these amazing pieces to as many people as we can. CRASH has engaged audiences at home
in the Twin Cities, throughout the nation (New York, Vermont, North Carolina,
San Francisco) and throughout the world (St. Petersburg, Yaroslavl). 
Now we have the opportunity to edify and enthrall audiences
in Cuba. We’ll perform twice at the festival and once at the Ludwig Foundation. We’ll
even be taking our act to the streets, so that people from all walks of life
have an opportunity to experience CRASH. Festival organizers assure us that our
performances will sell out. We’re certain CRASH will make a big SPLASH.

homes in Eastern Europe and arrived in Canada with little more than the clothes
on their backs. Moyshe and Ida, of blessed memory, married in Montreal and
settled in a shtetl-like working-class neighborhood composed of new immigrants.
It was their dream to create a safe and comfortable life for their family in
which Jewish education and the preservation of the Yiddish language and culture
would be a top priority.

<p>I grew up in a home where Yiddish
was the only language spoken. My three siblings and I attended the local
Protestant school along with Peretz Shule, where I discovered and fell in love
with the vibrancy and raw emotionality of the Yiddish folksong. It was there
that I learned and performed each of the songs contained in this album. Melodies
of children, parents, grandparents, teachers, lovers, victims, survivors and
rebuilders are indelibly engraved in my heart and mind.</p>
<p>As a teacher, parent and
grandparent, I continue to sing and interpret Yiddish songs in the hope that
our stories of trials, tribulations, and victories of past generations, will
live on. It is now my endeavor and obligation to perpetuate the dreams of my
immigrant parents.</p>
<p>Zingt Zhe Kinder is dedicated to my

Although, as a group of like minded people we find common ground, and understand that we are all struggling toward the same goal. We identify ourselves as part of an ever growing, international, revolutionary movement continuously moving towards freedom, justice, and peace. We stand in firm solidarity with all working, and lower class peoples. We are anti-fascist, anti-hierarchical, and stand in direct opposition to all oppression. We hope that through art and action we can spread the word of revolutionary cause, in hopes that one day, together, we may achieve freedom, justice, and peace for all peoples. </span></p>
<p>Since December 2011 we've toured the U.S. multiple times, with the likes of Morning Glory and Urban Waste. We've also toured the UK and Europe with label mates Luvdump and Thee Infidels, respectively. We’re released a US E.P. which was distributed for free, and a European E.P. which we distributed whilst on tour. Due to rampant touring, and our “for the people” market strategy ( meaning we have a very thin profit margin, we really just want our art out there) we've left ourselves with a smoking crater where our war chest once was.</p>
<p>So we come to you, the people, to help us gather funds to record our first full length L.P. We have given ourselves a deadline in which we would like to see the album completed and sent to press by the end of November 2013. If we can finish recording the album, our label will help with the pressing and distribution, but we need to finish recording first! This is very much why we need your help, to afford the studio time and get back on tour, where we belong.</p>
<br/>We’re looking to raise $2000USD. That might not sound like a whole lot for recording, but trust us, we can do a lot with a little. About 1500 will go directly to studio time. The rest will go towards printing the album and getting the perks we promised out to you. Even if we don’t hit our goal, we will still do our best to get what we promise to those that do help. With a little luck, if we go over our goal, we’ll put any extra money towards making the album bigger and better than what we plan for now. <br/><p></p></span>

<p>My name is Walker
Pickens, and I am a singer-songwriter! I've spent my entire life in Central
Texas-- I grew up in a small town by the name of Wimberley (still near-and-dear
to my heart), and have spent the last six years living in Austin. Many of you
might be familiar with my music via my rowdy rock'n'roll band Mini Pony, but on
the side I've been nurturing a little crop of homespun, relatable folk songs,
inspired by the faces and places of my aforementioned hometown. You want a song
about football? I've got one of those. Small-town emergency management and
disaster response? Check. A little bit of heartbreak? You betcha. It's finally
time to dress these songs up real purty and send 'em out into the real world.</p>
<p>In mid-March, I'll be
going into Jumping Dog Studio with producer Pat Brooks and sound engineer Ron
Flynt to record my debut. I've miraculously managed to save up a significant
chunk of the money I need to do this, but at the end of the day I'm still a
broke musician working six days a week and putting myself through school. In

this record. You needn't worry about me using it for illegitimate purposes and

Though I sustained countless injuries, I was lucky enough to survive, however I fell into a deep state of depression. Soon thereafter, I was diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) and informed that I have a 0-5% change of naturally conceiving. Life, as I knew it, was over for me. In the past few years, I've been on a journey of self-love and self-discovery. Though I've accomplilshed many amazing things in the past seven years - including losing over 50lbs, placing 2nd in my first bikini compeition and living in St. Lucia for two years - I've yet to really figure out my purpose in this world - where do I ""fit in""? I feel that taking a this journey to Kenya to volunteer in an orphanage, might be the eye-opening experience I've been searching for. In my mind, maybe being around children with no mother, will help me redefine what it means to BE a mother...My Journey to KenyaMy plan is to volunteer in Kenya for a minimum of 2-3 weeks through an organization called Projects Abroad, however the costs are quite high. To spend 2-weeks volunteering at an orphanage, the cost is $2,490 CDN, plus the cost of flight will run me for approximately $1,500 - $2,000 CDN. After paying for a VISA, ensuring I have spending money and paying approximately $4,500 CDN on the formerly mentioned expenses, I expect the trip will run me close to $5,000 CDN. Though I'd love to be able to fund this alone, It is just far too expensive for me at this time - especially given that I just moved back from St. Lucia where my expenses with very high and my income was in Eastern Caribbean Dollars. What I Need & What You GetI need approximately $5,000 CDN (breakdown above in 'My Journey to Kenya' section), however my goal is to raise $2,500 CDN in order to at least cover the volunteer costs.The volunteer cost from Project Abroad includes accommodation, food, airport pick up and drop off, travel insurance, medical insurance, in-country induction with a staff member upon arrival, support and 24 hour back-up from staff, pre-departure support from Desk Officer by email and phone and visa application support. The funds will go to Project Abroad and towards my plane ticket (if I raise enough)In exchange for your contributions, I'm offering a few perks (see right) that include photos from my trip, journal/blog entries from my trip and access to my E-Book on Shedding Body Fat Through Dietary Modifications, which includes information on how I shed over 50lbs of body fat. The ImpactNot only will your contribution assist me in my personal journey to figure out my purpose in life - especially as an infertile 25-year-old - but it will also help me help some of the 700 children who are orphaned every day in Kenya - that's a child every two minutes!

Dovtedy som hrával iba na klavíri a rozbiehala sa mi s?ubná kariéra v stredoškolskej kapele. Žia?, nahrávky sa už nezachovali :) Ke? som  rozchodil tú nohu, sadol som si za bicie. Bicie a perkusie mi u?arovali nato?ko, že ovplynili aj štýl môjho hrania na ostatné nástroje. Aby bola moja “ONE MAN BAND” kompletná, tak som sa ešte dou?il hra? na basu. Postupne som vystriedal viaceré kapely..až som zakotvil v manželstve. Teraz hrávam hlavne doma de?om a manželke, ale predsa len ob?as aj ""naozajstne"" koncertujem s mojou srdcovou kapelou COSMIC DAYS. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>AKO TO VŠETKO ZA?ALO</b></p>
<p>Nikdy som nemal predstavu, že sa stanem detským pesni?károm. Vlastne by bolo vhodné poveda?, že by to ani nemali by? výhradne typické detské pesni?ky. Je to hudba, ktorú robím rád a zo srdca :) Pre všetkých. </p>
<p>Moje dve deti mi ob?as poži?ajú svoju detskú gitarku. No a práve pri takejto domácej jam session to celé za?alo - len tak si brnkám , a <b>Tadeáško (9r.)</b> mi hovorí: “mám text!” a už spieva..ide a nezastaví sa :) Tak vznikla naša prvá spolo?ná pesni?ka <i>Pánko</i>. Zrazu tu bola a ani neviem ako. Hne? na druhý de? som ju šiel nahra?. Nevedel som tú melódiu pusti? z hlavy, tak som ju musel vypusti? von. Moji domáci fanúšikovia boli nadšení a nevedeli sa do?ka? ?alšej pesni?ky. Tentokrát na podnet mladšieho <b>Joachymka (3r.)</b> vznikol <i>Kominár</i>. Tiež mi tento motív nedal pokoj, nahral som ho za jednu noc. No a odvtedy sa pesni?ky už len rodili a množili. Za?al som teda rozmýš?a? ako uchopi? tento „projekt“. Hudbu do týchto piesní som skladal ako pre dospelé publikum, tak mi napadlo, že by som mohol využi? <b>konkrétne piesne ako ukážky rôznych hudobných žánrov</b> a vnies? do projektu iný rozmer. Mojich domácich posluchá?ov nikdy nezaujímali detské odrhova?ky a už vôbec nie pou?né texty detských piesní. Nechcem podce?ova? vkus detí a týmto by som rád prispel k rozšíreniu ich hudobných obzorov. <b>Na albume nájdete ukážky swingu, punku, reagge, bosanovy ale aj skladby inšpirované orientálnymi vplyvmi…</b></p>
<p><b>Na textoch piesní sa podie?ali aj moje deti</b>, sú bu? vymyslené, alebo reflektujú skuto?né udalosti z našej domácnosti.:)  Niektoré texty sú prevzaté z detských ?udových piesní. .</p>
<p><b>Štúdio  NÁHODA NEEXISTUJE</b></p>
<p>Moja manželka je samé prekvapenie…a tak mi raz ve?er oznámila, že budúci víkend to?íme <b>klip k <i>Pánkovi</i></b>. Je pravda, že sme sa ob?as pri pohári vína rozprávali, že by sa k tejto pesni?ke hodil animovaný klip…ale bral som to iba ako našu fantáziu. Zrazu sa to ale malo udia? a ja som mal by? hlavný protagonista. </p>
<p> No, ale aby som šiel po poriadku. Moja manželka - Didi - sa totiž v meste náhodou po rokoch stretla so svojim spolužiakom Mišom zo  strednej školy, ktorý je dnes kameramanom a žije v Madride. Rozmýš?ali o tom, že by mali využi? 2 týždne, kým sa zas Michal vráti spä? do Madridu a nie?o spolu vytvori?..tak Didi navrhla urobi? klip k pesni?ke <i>Pánko</i>. Didi je maskérka, a tak si myslím, že sa hlavne tešila ako ma zma?uje :).</p>
<p>Tak sme si spolu sadli a za?ali vymýš?ali scénar ku klipu - to, že bude <b>animovaný</b> bolo isté - potrebovali sme zakry? moje herecké nedostatky :). Okrem kameramana nikto z nás nemal skúsenosti s animáciou, ale to nikoho netrápilo. Podstatné pre nás bolo, že sa nám nápad pá?i. <b>Náš “Pánko team”, ktorý ma „animoval“ to robil s neuverite?ným nasadením a o tri natá?acie dni sme boli v cieli.</b>  Všetko sa zomlelo tak rýchlo a pekne do seba zapadalo, že to nemohla by? náhoda - a preto : ""Štúdio Náhoda neexistuje"".:P</p>
<p>Nedá mi tu nespomenú? pracovitý “pánko team” - <b>Mišo, Lea, Didi, Wá?a a Ja :) - ?akujem vám :)</b></p>

<p><b>SOMETHING ABOUT Mr. Pánko</b></p>
<p>My name is Julián Ratica. When I was 15, I broke my leg and I couldn´t walk for a year. During that year, music totally consumed me. I listened to old jazz LPs and learned to play my father´s guitar. Until then, I had played the piano and a promising career in a high school band had been on the horizon. Unfortunately, the recordings were not saved. :) When I could walk again, I took up the drums. Drums and percussion cast such a spell on me that my style of playing the other instruments was influenced. To complete my “One Man Band” I learned bass guitar. Over the years I performed in various bands…until I was finally anchored in marriage. Today, I play for my wife and kids. However, occasionally, I play real concerts with a band called <i>Cosmic Days</i>.</p>
<p><b>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</b></p>
<p>I never thought I would become a kids´ songwriter. And actually, my songs aren’t exclusively for kids. It is music, which I enjoy and the music springs from the bottom of my heart. For everyone.</p>
<p>From time to time, my two kids lend me their kids´ guitar. It all began during one of these jam sessions. I was strumming the guitar and <b>Tadeáško (9 years old) </b>said to me: “I´ve got the lyrics!” and he sang and sang…he couldn’t stop :). That´s how our first song ´Mr. Pánko´ was created… Suddenly, the song was there, out of the blue . I recorded it in the following days. I couldn´t get the melody out of my head, so I had to “set it free”. My fan base at home was thrilled and demanded more songs. This time around the impetus came from my younger son <b>Joachym (3 years old)</b> and ´Chimney Sweeper´ saw the light of day. Again, the desire wouldn´t let me rest – I recorded it in one night. Since then, the songs have been born one after another, and now there are many. I started to wonder where to take this project. The music I composed was more suitable for adult audience. It occurred to me I could use <b>particular songs as samples of various genres</b> and the project would gain something, and have different twist. My audience at home was never interested in “classic” kids´ songs and disliked the instructional lyrics of kids´ songs. I wouldn´t ever want to underestimate the music taste of kids and I hope my music can widen their horizons. <b>You will find samples of swing, punk, reggae, bossa nova, and also songs with oriental influences on the CD</b>.</p>
<p><b>My children helped create the lyrics</b> of the songs: they are either made-up or they reflect real life situations from our household.:) Some lyrics are adapted from children’s folk songs.</p>
<p><b>´Coincidences do not Exist´ STUDIO</b></p>
<p>My wife is a constant surprise to me...one night she tells me we are <b>shooting a Mr. Pánko video</b> the next weekend. It’s true we would sometimes talk over a glass of wine about how a video would fit really nicely with this song, but I took it only as our fantasy. Suddenly, it was about to happen and I was to be the main protagonist.</p>
<p>Let´s take it bit by bit. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My wife, Didi, ran into her high school classmate Mišo in town, whom she hadn’t seen in years. Mišo works as a cinematographer and lives in Madrid. Mišo and Didi were wondering how to make use of the two weeks before Mišo flew back to Madrid.

NIE?O O PÁNKOVI

Volám sa Julián Ratica a hudba ma naplno opantala, ke? som si v pätnástich zlomil nohu. Rok som nemohol chodi?, po?úval som staré jazzové platne a nau?il sa hra? na otcovej starej gitare. Dovtedy som hrával iba na klavíri a rozbiehala sa mi s?ubná kariéra v stredoškolskej kapele. Žia?, nahrávky sa už nezachovali :) Ke? som  rozchodil tú nohu, sadol som si za bicie. Bicie a perkusie mi u?arovali nato?ko, že ovplynili aj štýl môjho hrania na ostatné nástroje. Aby bola moja “ONE MAN BAND” kompletná, tak som sa ešte dou?il hra? na basu. Postupne som vystriedal viaceré kapely..až som zakotvil v manželstve. Teraz hrávam hlavne doma de?om a manželke, ale predsa len ob?as aj ""naozajstne"" koncertujem s mojou srdcovou kapelou COSMIC DAYS.

I worked really hard, and today this album is ready! I did everything I could by myself, but I'm here today because I need your support to release and promote it. Thank you so much for taking 4mns of your time to watch the video I prepared to introduce myself to you in the most simple and sincere way; discover my journey from Paris to New York!;)</span></p>So here's a little bit of my story...<br/><p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;"">Before I moved here, I was very comfortable...I was signed at BMG Music Publishing, I was working with a great team and I collaborated with amazing artists all round Europe, but I just couldn't figure out my next level. <br/></span></p>

So when the US office of BMG Music Publishing listened to the songs and invited me to NY, I couldn't resist... I knew I had to go. And this is when </span><strong style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;"">the real fight started for me</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;"">!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;"">I dived in a world I thought I knew so well; I know, love, and understand music, but I realized I didn’t have any knowledge of the business really. It was evolving and changing so fast! It was scary sometimes, heartbreaking and frustrating too, but I never looked back. Today I understand how this journey was valuable. I learned so much along the way. The album is recorded, produced, ready...if you watch the video you will probably understand my journey a little more;) I actually named it Testify because </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; color: #1a1a1a;"">I desire to be a witness that if you pursue your dreams with certainty and tenacity, </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; color: #1a1a1a;"">anything can happen!</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;"">In January 2013, I met and partnered with a wonderful young woman named <strong>Christina Weber</strong>. She jumped on board with me and decided to make this mission hers. Together we started to branch out to industry people with the goal to build the same kind of strong team I had in Europe. The feedback has been amazing and today we're about to release the album worldwide with a great company!!! What does it mean? That it will be out soon, BUT I STILL NEED TO PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF THE ALBUM OTHERWISE NOBODY WILL KNOW THAT IT EXISTS!;)<br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt;""> So now that I financed everything I could by myself, now that the album is about to come out, I really need your help today! I know the time has come and this is a real opportunity!<br/></span></p>

<p>In my
lifetime I have been lucky enough to experience many different cultures,
customs and ways of life. I have lived abroad for most of my life; I was born
in Poland, grew up in Canada and currently reside in The
Netherlands. These international experiences made me feel comfortable in
different environments, helped me not to see boundaries and always keep an open
mind. All this has influenced and can be heard in my music. Although I am
classically schooled and studied Jazz for many years I have always been open to
all music. Blues, Funk, Hip-Hop, Rock and Pop have always been on heavy
rotation on my iPod and have all left an equal mark on my musical personality. The
colorful fusion of the different genres is the essence of the <b>Wojtek Justyna Tree… Oh!?</b> album <b><i>“</i>Definitely

<p>For this
record I decided to invite some of the finest musicians I know to join the <b>Wojtek Justyna Tree… Oh!?</b> and add their
personalities to the music. Legendary funk drummer Jamal Thomas (USA) showcases
the deepest Funk groove, saxophone colossus Frank Deruytter (BE) delivers a
fury of Jazz lines, singer Michael “Big Mike” Ventimiglia (USA) supplies the
essence of Blues, Coen Molenaar (NL) adds greasy organ grinding, Dela Botri
(GH) and Mame Balla (SE) bring the roots of African music, and vocalist Poliana
Vieira (PT) gives a taste of modern Soul. It was a true blessing to have these
artists collaborate on this album and give the music another dimension.</p>

80 TONS FANS! Not sure you realize it, but this is the song YOU GUYS helped write! We used YOUR lyrics, YOUR suggestions, even YOUR title! We hope YOU will help us record it. If you can give any amount, it would be appreciated. If you can't give, but could help spread the word among fellow music-lovers and dream-supporters who CAN give, we would be grateful. We want to make this album for YOU. Please help us reach our goal.
  80 Tons of Mercury is a little Alt Rock band from Michigan. We believe in our music, and we want to continue to create more. Making music is what keeps us all going - it's our passion.
   What We Need & What You Get This is what we are setting out to do:  We are trying to raise $1,000 to aid our next music project. Our mission is to record and package an EP disc. Money will help pay for recording, mastering, packaging, and distribution.    The Impact In concept, this EP will include a new 80 Tons song ""Gold"" and a few other tracks.  Keeping rock alive is what we are trying to do, and we don't want to stop. We previously funded and recorded a digital release of our first album OMINA that can be found on SoudCloud, ReverbNation, and our FB page. This time we are asking for fans help to reach our next goal.    Risks & Challenges  Money and time are the enemy, and we want to produce a memorable music experience with your help.   Together, this band has overcome personal downfalls, house fires, and medical conditions - but we keep rocking. It's when we unite that we feel the strength of our music and passion for creativity.    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help with a donation, we understand, but you can help spread the word and share this creative fundraising campaign.   Get the word out and make some noise about this 80 Tons campaign ""Going for Gold"". Use the Indiegogo share tools to help us along!

<b>Official Bio:</b>  <i>""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jordan Mitchell will not only drink you under the table but she'll write about it too. Her witty, yet heartfelt lyricism packs enough charm to win anybody over. It's a little bit folk, a little bit poppy and just a tad bit serious. In all honesty, she's the total package and then some! You would be a fool not to take notice.""  Born and raised in Las Vegas, Jordan naturally gravitated towards bright neon lights and entertainment. She grew up singing in the church choir where she developed her real love for music and singing. She has been influenced by artists like Patsy Cline, Ella Fitzgerald, Norah Jones, Bob Dylan, and Bonnie Raitt. Though music is Jordan's first love, she was brought up riding horses and competing in horse shows. She showed quarter horses at a very young age, and was eventually recruited by West Texas A&amp;M Universitys top ranked Equestrian Team. She went on to win the 2009 Collegiate National Championship in Reining.

Jordan blends country, pop and rock and sings with enough passion that will melt even the coldest of hearts. Her lyrics craft sweet with heartbreak, love with humor. It's not trying to be something its not; its trying to be something it is. Real. Shes easy to love and hard to forget.""</span></i>

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>I have been singing since I was a little girl when I found it was the best way to annoy my little
brother.  I wouldn’t shut up so my
parents finally decided to put me in singing lessons to ease their ears a bit.  From there I started performing at every contest,
talent show, county fair, and community event I could, and I haven’t stopped
since.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>I released my
first EP last spring and since then its been a big year of BIG opportunities.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the past year I
have been LUCKY enough to have played Austin City Limits Festival, Life is
Beautiful Festival, Wine Amplified Festival, and many others especially here in
Las Vegas like Container Park (and nearly every venue downtown), The Palms,
Vinyl at Hard Rock Hotel, Rock's Lounge at Red Rock, Brooklyn Bowl; and had 2 of
my songs played on Las Vegas radio station, Mix 94.1.  I’ve even
played a few shows at Whole Foods and Neiman Marcus, ha.  Vegas Rated, Vegas Seven, the Las Vegas
Review Journal, and other awesome publications; as well as local news media like My News 3, Fox 5, and Action News 13 have been kind enough to show me A LOT of love and support.</span></p>

<p>For big ""stars,"" a record label's budget for simply producing and manufacturing a record costs around $200,000.  Then the record label invests hundreds of thousands more in marketing and promotion.  Sometimes these amounts are nearly double.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">E</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ven though I have
great friends who thankfully don’t charge me near what they normally would, c</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">osts still include: </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">recording, distribution, photo shoots, music videos, marketing, website design, radio promotion, film and television licensing, and a lot of other necessary promotion for the songs. </span></p>
<b>My goal is $8,500 because, since we need to hit a MINIMUM goal, I believe this is the very minimum needed and an achievable amount based on my fan base.  It is VERY important I meet this goal!</b><b>  If I do NOT meet my goal, Indigogo takes a 9% cut plus additional fees.  </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As you can tell, I need much MUCH more, but $8,500 would sure give me a great start! </span>

finish the album and YOU will be part of it!  I want to make a great album of great songs and to do that, we need to reach THIS goal first.  </b><div>

<p></p>Since these songs will be part of a full album, distributed by a record label at a later date,  I'll also be printing AND signing EXCLUSIVE EPs just for you, my backers…with your pictures on them.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Its
only fair that you have the music you helped create!  I also have some other really fun incentives
like recording with me in the studio, appearing in my music video, a private
house concert….hell, I’ll even cook you dinner!  **If you don't see a ""perk"" that interests you, just tell me what you'd like instead.  Send an email to info@jordan-mitchell.com, and if I'm able to fulfill your request I will!**</span>

<div>I’m making you my record label for now.  With your help, I will have the materials I need to make the jump, and spread the music MUCH further. Your support means the world to me, and I truly believe that together we can show everyone that good, honest music and great fans are all that we need.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Thank you for taking the time to read this and boy if
you can help, I sure would appreciate it.

It's not trying to be something its not; its trying to be something it is. Real. Shes easy to love and hard to forget.""


I have been singing since I was a little girl when I found it was the best way to annoy my little
brother.  I wouldn’t shut up so my
parents finally decided to put me in singing lessons to ease their ears a bit.  From there I started performing at every contest,
talent show, county fair, and community event I could, and I haven’t stopped
since.

I released my
first EP last spring and since then its been a big year of BIG opportunities.  In the past year I
have been LUCKY enough to have played Austin City Limits Festival, Life is
Beautiful Festival, Wine Amplified Festival, and many others especially here in
Las Vegas like Container Park (and nearly every venue downtown), The Palms,
Vinyl at Hard Rock Hotel, Rock's Lounge at Red Rock, Brooklyn Bowl; and had 2 of
my songs played on Las Vegas radio station, Mix 94.1.  I’ve even
played a few shows at Whole Foods and Neiman Marcus, ha.  Vegas Rated, Vegas Seven, the Las Vegas
Review Journal, and other awesome publications; as well as local news media like My News 3, Fox 5, and Action News 13 have been kind enough to show me A LOT of love and support.





Why An Indiegogo Campaign?













WEBSITE . FACEBOOK . TWITTER . MUSIC . VIDEOS . SHOWS







Because, as you just read, I am “RIGHT THERE!” I CAN FEEL IT, AND I CAN DO THIS!……but only with your help.  Instead of waiting around to be “discovered,"" I want to involve you in the process to make the music I am passionate
about making for you. I’ve got a pretty good start so far, but the next step is
getting a few new good songs in the right hands.  In order to record these new songs, the right way, and
market them effectively……it takes money. 
That’s why I am doing this campaign, and that’s why I am asking for your
help.










What Are The Costs?













WEBSITE . FACEBOOK . TWITTER . MUSIC . VIDEOS . SHOWS





For big ""stars,"" a record label's budget for simply producing and manufacturing a record costs around $200,000.  Then the record label invests hundreds of thousands more in marketing and promotion.  Sometimes these amounts are nearly double.  Even though I have
great friends who thankfully don’t charge me near what they normally would, costs still include: recording, distribution, photo shoots, music videos, marketing, website design, radio promotion, film and television licensing, and a lot of other necessary promotion for the songs. 
My goal is $8,500 because, since we need to hit a MINIMUM goal, I believe this is the very minimum needed and an achievable amount based on my fan base.  It is VERY important I meet this goal!  If I do NOT meet my goal, Indigogo takes a 9% cut plus additional fees.  As you can tell, I need much MUCH more, but $8,500 would sure give me a great start! 





THE PLAN!














WEBSITE . FACEBOOK . TWITTER . MUSIC . VIDEOS . SHOWS






I have some great new songs I am really proud of and I know you guys will love.  I want to harness the power of my fans to fund the process.  Instead of trying to finance an ENTIRE album right now on my own,
we’ll pick the best songs to pitch to record labels (with the help of some cool peeps who believe in me), and also an agent to get my butt on tour.  As soon as I get a label behind me, we’ll
finish the album and YOU will be part of it!  I want to make a great album of great songs and to do that, we need to reach THIS goal first.  


Since these songs will be part of a full album, distributed by a record label at a later date,  I'll also be printing AND signing EXCLUSIVE EPs just for you, my backers…with your pictures on them. Its
only fair that you have the music you helped create!  I also have some other really fun incentives
like recording with me in the studio, appearing in my music video, a private
house concert….hell, I’ll even cook you dinner!  **If you don't see a ""perk"" that interests you, just tell me what you'd like instead.  Send an email to info@jordan-mitchell.com, and if I'm able to fulfill your request I will!**

I’m making you my record label for now.  With your help, I will have the materials I need to make the jump, and spread the music MUCH further. Your support means the world to me, and I truly believe that together we can show everyone that good, honest music and great fans are all that we need.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and boy if
you can help, I sure would appreciate it. 
Just think, when I’m famous soon, you can tell everyone you helped put me up there ;)

Love,
Jordan



FAQ:
Is it possible to make a contribution without accepting the perk?
Yes.  At checkout, you will be given the option of whether or not to accept a perk. 
Can I chip in for my own shipping costs?
Yes please! The cost of shipping is included in your perk contribution, but you're more than welcome to add a few dollars to contribution amount. Add your desired amount as you check out.
Can I give beyond the level of my desired perk?
Yes of course! Add whatever amount you wish as you check out. Every dollar helps us meet our goal!
What will you do with money made beyond the goal?
More time in the studio!  Higher quality music video production!  And there is ALWAYS more money that can be spent on marketing and promotion!  Thank you!",6.0,9,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! I am an independent artist from Florida. I've been making music since I was 15, and I've just finished my newest album Illuminate. I launched this campaign so that everyone who wanted to support my music, could easily grab a physical copy of my album. By backing this project, I'll be able to make sure everyone can get a copy!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As far as the funding goes, each backer will help with me with having enough funds to produce the physical copies. I wanted to keep the perks simple, so there's only two! You can buy the physical copy by itself, or you can grab a bundle that includes a: physical copy of the album, 11x17 poster and a sticker!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have released two physical copies of my albums. With each release, I've had more orders and it's been difficult producing all of the physical copies without knowing how many people would want one and just procuring enough funds. Through this campaign, it'll be immensely easier for me to get these albums to you as fast as possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As far as risks go, there really aren't any. The entire album is finished, and I will be posting various songs from it, up until the release of the album. :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford a physical copy, that's no biggie! But if you can, please spread the word about this campaign! I am so proud of this album and just sharing the word would be wonderful support. </p>

I've been writing music as Secret Tree Fort since this past April (2016) and have grown a very healthy following very quickly as of January 2017! I have recorded and released 2 singles and a 5 track EP with low quality free software and a $50 usb microphone. All set up within my bedroom...</p>
<p>NOW its time to go into the studio for my first REAL recording session!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2>

<p>As you probably know, studio sessions are VERY expensive! And being an unemployed, independent touring musician trying to chase his dream leaves you a little less than broke almost %100 of the time. </p>
<p>Thats where YOU come in!</p>
<p>Every penny you donate doesn't go unappreciated!!! I'm asking for $500 to fund my EP. On the right side of this page you will see perks I have available exclusively for only a few people! Shoutouts! Personal messages! One on one Skype calls! etc. Everything donated will go to supporting and funding the EP!</p>
<p>You help me =  I give you things + new music!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What kind of Music Will Be On The EP?</h2>
<p>Some say they think my sound/genre is Emo. Some suggest soft singer songwriter, and others think I sound Alternative. But this time around I'm going for straight up Acoustic driven Pop Punk vibes! If you like songs about Breakups, Sadness,falling in Love or depression, this EP is for you! Brutally honest &amp; forward lyrics from a heart broken boy from North Carolina.</p>

Every penny you donate doesn't go unappreciated!!! I'm asking for $500 to fund my EP. On the right side of this page you will see perks I have available exclusively for only a few people! Shoutouts! Personal messages! One on one Skype calls! etc. Everything donated will go to supporting and funding the EP!
You help me =  I give you things + new music!
 
What kind of Music Will Be On The EP?
Some say they think my sound/genre is Emo. Some suggest soft singer songwriter, and others think I sound Alternative. But this time around I'm going for straight up Acoustic driven Pop Punk vibes! If you like songs about Breakups, Sadness,falling in Love or depression, this EP is for you! Brutally honest & forward lyrics from a heart broken boy from North Carolina.

No Money? Thats Okay!
​I understand not everyone has a lot of money but has a heart to want to help.
Here's how you can help me at no expense! $0!

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>Hey friends, thank you for your interest in our work! I'm Sydney Wright, and I make songs and sounds as an artist and live sound engineer here in Austin. I've been working on this project for two years. I recorded the single, You Can Stay, in 2015 with my producer, Stefano Vieni, and the road to release has been long and arduous. I've been so lucky along the way to stumble into the most gracious teammates that teach, encourage, and prop me up on my leaning side. Monetarily, until now, I've worked really hard to fly solo and relied heavily on the generosity of my friends. Fortunately, the director, Lauren Bruno, is an ambassador in the art of asking. She levelled up this video in leaps and bounds simply by asking for help in getting what we have. She's inspired me to reach out to you all and ask if you could help us ice up this delicious cupcake. Your contributions go directly into funding the last stages of production and the release of this video. We're so close!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's what we need:</h3>
<p>$800 for 'post-production' to tie the bow around this labor of love:) </p>
<p>Post-production will include all of the film editing(selecting, sequencing, and timing each shot) and color-grading(enhancing certain aspects of the footage so the film 'pops')</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Honestly y'all, this project is more than a music video for me. This is my first step towards a dream that I've obsessed over since I wrote my first song at 15 years old. I love the hustle, and I want the option to do more of the work that I love - writing and recording songs. My hope is for this project to be a launchpad for a career that will allow me to create all day, everyday. Anything and anyway you can contribute is so very crucial and appreciated. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>More ways to help out</h3>
<p>Whether or not you're able to contribute financially, you can still support our project! We would love your help spreading the word about this campaign. Indiegogo has share tools to make it easy! </p>
<p>ALSO, when the video is complete and released, SHARE IT! You're support in reaching out to the people that you influence is INVALUABLE to helping us create and keep on creating. THANK YOU.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Stephie Grace.  I’m a singer/songwriter from London, and I write for Film, TV, established Artists and for myself as an Artist, as well as singing for my supper, teaching singing and getting my paints out once in a while.</p>
<p>Mental Health is a subject close to my heart, because I have suffered from, and still work through Mental Health issues, and I know many people who do too.</p>
<p>The idea for ""We're Not Meant To Do This Alone"" came in a moment of inspiration last year, when I was struggling.  I know that the power of words and, in particular, words with music, can have the ability to cut through the moment you’re stuck in; hearing someone else articulate what you’re experiencing can be an immense relief in times like these.  That’s what I want to do with the project.</p>
<p>I will write, record and release a song a month for 8 months, culminating in an album release in June 2018.  All the songs for the project will be inspired by Mental Health; they’ll be frank, honest, but positive, empowering.  (The last thing I want this to be is depressing.)  Ultimately, I want to bring hope, let people know they’re not alone, even if they think they are, and to get people to reach out and get help by connecting with others.</p>
<p><strong>This is where my Indiegogo campaign comes in!</strong></p>
<p>I am going to self-fund the actual project, BUT … I need to make a music video to launch the project with, (for the best impact.)  And that’s where I need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise £2.5K to make the video.  This will cover all the costs of:<br/>The Videographer/Director<br/>The Producer<br/>The Choreographer<br/>The Editor<br/>The Sound Engineer<br/>The Lighting Engineer<br/>The Stars /Performers<br/>The Make-up Artist<br/>Studio Hire<br/>The pre-design and storyboard, and re-drafts<br/>Props<br/>Costumes<br/>Cups of tea<br/>And maybe biscuits...</p>
<p><strong>Please have a look through the exciting, one-of a kind rewards you can have for your donations.  these include:</strong></p>
<p>A First listen and signed copy of the completed album<br/>Free tickets to We're Not Meant To Do This Alone gigs<br/>A signed limited edition print of the artwork for my song Heartbeats (painted by me)<br/>Handwritten lyrics with my doodles and drawings<br/>The actual, signed Original Artwork of the album cover (painted by me)<br/>A Skype singing lesson<br/>A cover song request - filmed, uploaded to Youtube and dedicated to you<br/>A live performance at your event or party<br/>A chance to appear in the music video itself<br/>An exclusive gift where I will write a song just for you, or for someone special to you</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With you help, I can make a video which will do justice to a project that has the potential to:</p>
<p><strong>* Truly help those who suffer from Mental health issues, by giving them connection, hope and the encouragement to reach out and not be alone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>* Raise funds for an amazing Mental health Charity (Re-think) which I am fundraising for.</strong></p>
<p><strong>* Support me in continuing to make music that will make a positive difference.  I truly feel that, if we have been given a gift, it is kind of our duty to use it for the greater good.  Cheesy, perhaps, but TRUE!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am totally aware that we are not always in a position to give financially.  If you aren’t, but feel strongly about what I’m wanting to achieve, I would ask for your support in sharing this campaign to as many people as you know whom this would speak to.  This could be done by emailing a bunch of people you think would be interested in this campaign, or simply by using the share buttons beside the video.</p>
<p><br/><strong>We’re Not Meant To Do This Alone.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>

Selvaganesh and Fareed Haque; as well as Vishal Nagar, tabla; Suhail Yusuf Khan, sarangi; and on the soon-to-be-released fourth movement (called The Return) Ujwal Nagar, vocals; and Neyveli Radhakrishna on double violin. Risks & Challenges and Ability to Accomplish the Goal of the ProjectI have the capacity to accomplish this project if I am able to secure the funding.  As mentioned above, I have worked with many of these artists, and produced several solo and group recordings and videos.I have played on many recordings and produced four records / CDs of my own.  But of course, now it is all about online views, not record sales.  My Youtube channel has over 60,000 views and about 250 subscribers. My Facebook artist page has over 1800 fans, and the average reach (market penetration) of my videos posted to Facebook is over 6000 people. My single video with the highest views is over 15,000.Other Ways You Can HelpObviously, I need cash to hire these artists and am glad to say that I have secured a fiscal agent so that donations can be tax-deductible (please contact me for info on how to do this).  If you can’t make a financial donation, don’t worry…you can still help out.  You can share this campaign with others who value music that brings people and cultures together.  You can also donate airline miles to that I can secure airfare at reduced cost to bring the artists to Seattle. If you are in Seattle, you could host a house concert where I can perform and talk about my project.  And finally, if you can’t do that, just listen and share my music.  It is not mainstream but it is me…and it is filled with love.Thank you so much!Jason",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Folks! My name is James Kasper. I founded Mighty Speck Records in December 2012 as a way of combining music and community. The decade prior to that, I had produced the Vancouver Island Music Awards, which was fulfilling and rewarding, but the inherent perception of competition left me in want of creating something wherein community was at the heart of both the goal and the public perception. Enter Mighty Speck.</p>
<p>My education is in linguistics and broadcasting and I've been a singer-songwriter for 20 years, so I am basically a word nerd with a passion for music.</p>
<p>This campaign is important because it is a first step in <strong>establishing a professional, productive space for emerging musicians on Vancouver Island (and beyond) to develop their craft and have an ambitious label give them the boost they need to take their music careers to the next level. </strong>Funding this studio/office space for the first 6 months will allow us time to build income streams so that we can then <strong>become a self-sustaining organization and empower emerging musical talents long-term.</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming to raise $10,000 to go to the following:</p>
<p>* Rental Costs for first 6 months of studio/office space: $7200</p>
<p>* Purchase of recording equipment: $1200</p>
<p>* Travel costs for upcoming BC/Alberta roster tour : $1000</p>
<p>* Mastering &amp; duplication costs for new roster album: $600</p>
<p>Total: $10,000</p>

<h3>The Goods:</h3>
<p>Here's the deal. You help us finish this album - we give you lots of cool stuff! If you aren't already a fan, here's a link to the website <a href=""http://www.bobbytmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bobbytmusic.net</a>. This new album promises to be Bobby's best yet, and we are really excited about how it is shaping up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details:</h3>
<p>Here's what's left to fund: </p>
<p><strong>Recording/Tracking:  $3,000</strong> - We have laid down most of the tracks, but this chunk will help get the rest of the instruments, backing vocals, etc. so that everything sounds great!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing: $1,750</strong> - A necessary step in the process. Skilled engineers will be making sure that all the levels are just right.</p>
<p><strong>Mastering: $2,500</strong> - This is where the album gets compressed, equalized, and gets its stereo enhancements, all so that it sounds awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Pressing &amp; Printing: $2,500</strong> - The album will be pressed on both CD and on vinyl (for you purists out there).</p>
<p><strong>Marketing: $250</strong> - This will go to getting the word out about the album.</p>
<p><strong>Music Video/Merchandise: $??? </strong>- IF we exceed our goal, any additional funds will go to making a music video of the title track. </p>

<h3>The Why:</h3>
<p>""It's pointless for me to make this album for myself, the purpose of this album is to communicate emotion and share it with people. Human connection is paramount in the world as we become more inundated with information and pummeled with . The crazier the world gets, the more art we need.

<p>Hi! I'm raising money to film a music video for 'Adios Maria,' my debut single that was released on January 17th. Adios Maria' is a call to action for a more humane immigration system, and a love song to immigrant mothers everywhere. We want to visually tell this powerful story and bring awareness to the experiences of immigrant single mothers in New York. We plan to shoot next week in upstate New York, and every dollar will go towards production costs-- especially ensuring that our talent, who are immigrants themselves, gets fed and paid properly. Shouldering costs as a 20 year-old independent artist has been difficult, and I would truly appreciate any help in bringing awareness to this cause. </p>
<p><a href=""http://almagrace.hearnow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Listen to Adios Maria here</a></p>
<p>About the song:</p>
<p>The pop-soul anthem honors a past generation of immigration advocates while activating a new one. After working to defend immigrants as young as 18 from deportation at the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, Alma Grace knew that she needed to meld her activism with her art. Born to a family of Mexican-American immigrants and raised by a bad ass single mother, her debut single seeks to honor her roots and give back to the community she comes from.</p>
<p>About the artist:</p>
<p>Alma Grace is a 20 year-old activist, artist, and actress born and raised in New York City. Her mixed musical influences are reflective of a globalized upbringing— she learned how to love from Selena, make witty comebacks from Shania Twain, and turn pain into art from Miss Lauryn Hill. As an activist, she attended her first protest at the age of 13, has volunteered with community-based organizations in Harlem, and has worked in both the Bronx and the U.S. Senate to defend immigrants facing deportation. As a solo artist, Alma Grace is no less impressive— she has performed on Broadwayand Lincoln Center stages, and has been a featured soloist at the Tribeca Film Festival for years. Finally, her acting career has taken her across the world on tours, films with Toby Maguire and Ed Zwick, and TV shows on HBO and Discovery. She is currently collaborating with Universal Music Group writers to create a full-length album centered on Frida Kahlo’s life— a woman with a mission to redefine boundaries placed on race and  gender, just like Alma Grace.</p>

<li>The expressive, ornamented music of Bach’s sons is comparatively little known to modern day listeners, who are more familiar with the father’s austere counterpoint. Tragically even lesser known are the virtuoso compositions of their talented colleagues also working for Prussian king Frederick the Great - Graun, Janitsch, and Benda. Their chamber music thrilled audiences both at court and in the private salons of eighteenth-century Berlin. We hope to bring this tradition out of the obscurity in which it has been undeservedly shrouded for the past two and a half centuries. The six trios and obbligato sonatas included in this project – by <strong>Johann Gottlieb Graun, Johann Gottlieb Janitsch, Franz Benda, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, and father J.S. Bach</strong> – straddle the transition between the Baroque and Classical styles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Where is it from? </strong>These pieces were once part of an important collection of music manuscripts gathered by <strong>Sara Levy</strong>. Notable for being a Jewish female musician and patron in Berlin during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, she took keyboard lessons with W.F. Bach and was the great-aunt of composer Felix Mendelssohn. Sara Levy hosted a musical salon in her home, where amateur and professional musicians gathered regularly to play from her collection, some of which she may have commissioned.</li>
</ul><h3>Why is this recording important?</h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Three of our selections remain unpublished, and none has been recorded in the forms that we plan to present.</strong> All will be performed in historically informed manner on period style instruments in new editions created especially for this recording together with new cadenzas and keyboard parts realized according to the practices of the period. Particularly intriguing is a reconstruction of a work revealed by recent scholarship to be probably a joint effort of J.S. and C.P.E. Bach. We are excited to have the opportunity to bring this music to light, and you play a big role in making this possible!</li>
<li>
<strong>Viola: </strong>This music is particularly unique for its instrumentation, including some of the first music that places the viola on an equal footing with the violin. Sara Levy's collection is impressive for its wealth of good viola parts, and W.F. Bach might have adapted two of the Graun sonatas for her to play with her brother, thought to have been a violist.The Franz Benda sonata is one of the first viola sonatas ever written.</li>

<h3>The Project...</h3>
<p>I have been working on this record for the last two+ years and it is now at the final stages of completion.  My name is Ricardo Lopez-Aguilar, and I wanted to make an album about my expriences at the end of my marriage, and of the personal struggle and growth that came after that.  I wanted it to be positive.  I wanted to find a path to forgiveness and acceptance.  That path was through the 10 songs on the record.  </p>
<p>With your help, Oldfolks Home can release the most uplifting and happiest divorce album!  </p>
<p>I should say that a donation of any amount, you will be mentioned in the thank you video for the album.  It would be impractical to list all the names on the record, so I will make a video where the world will hear of you and your generosity!  </p>

<li>Mastering the finished mixes, also through our local talent</li>
<li>The reproduction of the album to CDs and Vinyls to sell at our shows</li>

<h3><strong>About Oldfolks Home...</strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, mere days before departing for a Canadian tour, Ricardo Lopez-Aguilar’s marriage fell apart. At the time, I was the other half of his musical outlet Oldfolks Home, and saw firsthand how this shattered his world. I was right to expect that this would spell the end of our imminent touring, but what I couldn’t know is that this event was about to trigger the start of the most insightful, self-aware, and honest divorce album I have ever come across: Black and Blue.</p>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">The album's opening lyric, “Lately I feel like I want to kill / and I’m trying so hard to say something right” gives the listener a front row seat to the post-traumatic stress Lopez-Aguilar experiences as he tries to come to terms with his current situation. While some of Black and Blue’s most telling moments come on stand-out track (and letter to ex-wife Kerri) ‘It Scares Me’, Oldfolks Home is at his best on the heartbreaking ‘Sleeper’ where the lasting effects of the dissolution become clear to him “You know there’s no going back on this / it’s permanent…”<br/><br/>I wondered about Lopez-Aguilar’s thoughts on Black and Blue’s potential to be summed up as just another break-up album. “I’ve been told that I may become known as the Taylor Swift of indie rock,” he joked. “But this isn’t an album about placing blame, or gaining sympathy, or saving face. This is the product of allowing myself to grow out of my darkest moments, while patiently waiting for the good to come through.”<br/><br/>Oldfolks Home, who is no stranger to festivals like the Halifax Pop Explosion and Pop Montreal, looks forward to revamping what already is a highly reputable live show. “There were a few shows in the aftermath of 2010 where I didn’t have the courage to say much,” says Lopez-Aguilar. “I half-joked at the time that I would have been happy to prerecord all my stage banter.” <br/><br/>So will he be able to turn this negative energy into a positive? “That’s an understatement. I have never felt more free to experiment in a live setting. While I’ve always been interested in a fusion of digital and acoustic, the live show is about to get far more… three-dimensional, so to speak.”<br/><br/>Oldfolks Home has a bright vision for his hometown of Winnipeg. Like several of his musical peers, it was important for him to write and record Black and Blue in Winnipeg, and wanted its elements to stay local. He recruited a cast of current and former hometown players such as Keri Latimer (Nathan), Michael P Falk (Les Jupes), and Shaun Gibson (The Details) to contribute, and, what might be Black and Blue’s most shocking twist, the album’s cover art and name are taken from a piece donated by Lopez-Aguilar’s Winnipegger ex-wife, Kerri-Lynn Reeves. <br/><br/>There’s no doubt that many of the beautifully crafted tracks on this LP will find perfect homes on television and film soundtracks, and I can say with great certainty that if John Cusack’s character in High Fidelity could do a present-day “top 5 divorce albums” list, Oldfolks Home’s Black and Blue would easily earn top spot. <br/><br/>-Shaun Gibson, 2012.</div>

....but the heart of Gypsy Jazz is right there. Help Patrus to travel to his homeland and find the warm Irish welcome and wonderful Gypsy Jazz that's waiting for him.

Cloughtoberfest is Ireland's festival of Gypsy Jazz.  Now in our third year, we've worked hard to bring together some of the finest musicians from Ireland and around the world to promote this wonderful genre in our country.  Run by a small and very dedicated team of volunteers, Cloughtoberfest is full of Irish warmth and gypsy spirit.... and just like gypsies, we know how to create a feast on a tiny budget!

Patrus KC is the chronicler of modern Gypsy Jazz, a true lover of the genre who is interested not only in the music, but in the people who create it... if you don't know about him, visit his website here.  He has interviewed the great masters and the new rising stars from Samois to New England, but he's never been to Ireland... even though it's his ancestral home!  Now, with a Gypsy Jazz festival to visit and a wealth of Irish bands to meet, he can't resist any longer, he just has to come home!  The trouble is, like we said, it's a long way.....

From our experiences we have learned that since it is their money, they would want to control the look, sound and direction of our music. That's why we're reaching out to you guys to get backing so that together we can bring back the spirit that made music great through promotion, marketing, mastering and aiding us in a tour that will empower us to come see you.April  29th 2014 AKNU Debut EP DropsWhere will the money go?

<span>And we still have 3 weeks of our campaign left...so
with nearly 900 backers so far we hope some of you who still haven't had the

an incredible experience from start to finish.  </span><br/></p><p>Our direct partnership
with you allowed us to make the record we always dreamed of making.  The
songwriting process was groundbreaking for us, as a brand new energy was
breathed into this band. The recording environment was incredibly satisfying,
and we were able to collaborate with many of our long-time friends and
peers-from Brian ""Head"" Welch of Korn/Love and Death, to Bruce
Fitzhugh of Living Sacrifice, to Blake Martin of a Plea for Purging.  The
reception to the album was amazing to witness.  Crowds at our shows
swelled and both fans and critics alike gave the album rave reviews. <i>Wait
For the Siren</i> garnered multiple #1 singles, including the smash-hit
""Fall, Goliath, Fall,""-a song that delivered one of our most
high-profile placements in the history of the band, as the basis for Jim
Nantz's monologue during primetime of the opening rounds of the NCAA Basketball
tournament.  </p>
<p>We are truly proud of
all that was accomplished...</p>
<p>So, we are <i>more</i> than excited to announce we are
writing a new album as we speak. And we are upping the ante this time in every
way.  If <i>Wait for the Siren</i> proved anything to us, it is that the
sky is the limit...</p>
<p>We learned a lot from our last project, and though we
raised nearly $40,000.00 to produce the album, create artwork, press cd's,
vinyl, print books, t-shirts, and mail everyone their orders worldwide, it was
necessary for us to spend more than what we raised.  In addition to
producing the album/fulfilling your packages, we spent additional funds on
publicity, marketing (including a music video), and a distribution team.
Because we want to not only deliver the best album possible but do it on the
best level possible we set our goal for this project at $50,000.00. </p>
<p>And there's more: Perhaps our favorite part of this
last album cycle was our VIP acoustic performances.  These sets were
special because they presented the songs in a more personal way.  So we
will be recording four original, ""unplugged"" songs, in addition to
the P86 album.    </p>
<p>We have put together
some great incentives that are meant to allow you to be a part of this project
as much as possible; The greater your backing, the closer you will be to the
process of making this record.</p>
<p>And as an added incentive, every backer of $40 and
above will receive a digital copy of Andrew Schwab's first single from his
brand new solo project (title TBA).  You will be the first to hear this
new music, as it will not be released to the public until later in the spring.
 You will receive the song as a special thank you for backing (again, $40
and above), as soon as the funding period of this project ends.</p>

So, it's time
for YOU friends of P86, to partner with us like never before.
 Join us in making another special P86 <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">masterpiece.</span><p><br/></p><p>Thank you, in advance,
for being an integral part of this new project.</p>

For the Siren garnered multiple #1 singles, including the smash-hit
""Fall, Goliath, Fall,""-a song that delivered one of our most
high-profile placements in the history of the band, as the basis for Jim
Nantz's monologue during primetime of the opening rounds of the NCAA Basketball
tournament.  
We are truly proud of
all that was accomplished...
So, we are more than excited to announce we are
writing a new album as we speak. And we are upping the ante this time in every
way.  If Wait for the Siren proved anything to us, it is that the
sky is the limit...
We learned a lot from our last project, and though we
raised nearly $40,000.00 to produce the album, create artwork, press cd's,
vinyl, print books, t-shirts, and mail everyone their orders worldwide, it was
necessary for us to spend more than what we raised.  In addition to
producing the album/fulfilling your packages, we spent additional funds on
publicity, marketing (including a music video), and a distribution team.
Because we want to not only deliver the best album possible but do it on the
best level possible we set our goal for this project at $50,000.00. 
And there's more: Perhaps our favorite part of this
last album cycle was our VIP acoustic performances.  These sets were
special because they presented the songs in a more personal way.  So we
will be recording four original, ""unplugged"" songs, in addition to
the P86 album.    
We have put together
some great incentives that are meant to allow you to be a part of this project
as much as possible; The greater your backing, the closer you will be to the
process of making this record.
And as an added incentive, every backer of $40 and
above will receive a digital copy of Andrew Schwab's first single from his
brand new solo project (title TBA).  You will be the first to hear this
new music, as it will not be released to the public until later in the spring.
 You will receive the song as a special thank you for backing (again, $40
and above), as soon as the funding period of this project ends.

So, it's time
for YOU friends of P86, to partner with us like never before.
 Join us in making another special P86 masterpiece.Thank you, in advance,
for being an integral part of this new project.

One of the most important affirmations for any artist is to be seen and heard. Please, with humility I ask you to share this campaign across all your social networks (both online and offline). My motivation to keep pushing against the odds has as much to do with the resources to produce as with having friends to support me by becoming part of my music world. - with most sincere thanks, Rani.",3.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<div>Have you ever had a passion that was so strong for something that you'd be willing to do ANYTHING to make your dream a reality? While going on tour this Fall, we will be playing clubs all across America, meeting people that have sacrificed everything just to pursue their dream. We will show the very uncomfortable sleeping situations, the terrible food and the 15 hour drives through the middle of the night just to make it to the next venue.

Have you ever had a passion that was so strong for something that you'd be willing to do ANYTHING to make your dream a reality? While going on tour this Fall, we will be playing clubs all across America, meeting people that have sacrificed everything just to pursue their dream. We will show the very uncomfortable sleeping situations, the terrible food and the 15 hour drives through the middle of the night just to make it to the next venue. Along the way we will be playing with some of the most talented artists in the country and hearing some of their stories on what they have sacrificed in order to pursue their dreams.

Cleveland Presents:</b></p>
<p><b>The Sweet Sounds of the Holidays.....In Cleveland!</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Rebecca Brady and I
am the Community Leader of L’Arche Cleveland.  L’Arche
Cleveland, as you may already know, has been a part of the Cleveland community for forty years,  We  have four loving homes – one in Cleveland Heights, one in Maple
Heights, and two in Cleveland near Shaker Square – in which “core members”
(persons with developmental disabilities who are at the “core” of our
community) live and share their lives with assistants and volunteers.  I am excited to tell you about our  2015 holiday project that will be funded by this campaign: “The Sweet Sounds of the Holidays...In Cleveland!”  </p><p>As the holiday season
approaches we often reflect upon all of the things we are grateful for and how we can show our gratitude through giving back; this holiday fundraiser may be
exactly what you are looking for!</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to reach out
to people in the community for collaboration, raise money through a CD full of holiday music that we will be creating, and we also want to spread the
word about L'Arche.  The more people we can get to fund
the project, the more CDs we will be able to produce upfront.  Keep reading to learn the background
information on what we are doing and how you can help make this happen.   We encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get
involved.  We developed this campaign for
everyone in Cleveland and those that support L'Arche.. so enjoy!  We believe
creating this CD and singing together with other groups from around our city will create an even deeper
bond; one that no other activity can replicate.</p>
<p><b>This
CD is more than Music..... it is about Cleveland </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442948610/jdpeyivyjph5guzadpnc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The feeling of connection that comes
from singing together goes hand in hand with our mission to help
people with developmental disabilities share their gifts with others while
building transforming community relationships. To connect with others in our city, we have reached out to a variety of choral groups and musicians and asked them to support L'Arche and learn more about us by singing with us. The response has been overwhelming! We are so grateful for the generosity of these talented individuals in their willingness to share their gifts in the creation of this CD to support our organization.  CDs will be sold to help raise
funds to support the L’Arche Cleveland homes. Empower us to make
this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>More about the Project</b></p><p><b><i>Update!!!! Our community is in the studio singing along to our favorite holiday songs! Soon we will be able to share them with you! Visit the gallery for more pictures and videos!</i></b></p>
<p>We are collaborating with Cleveland State University music therapy students, as well as other

all know and love will create a unique and memorable experience for our core members and all other participants, as well as those who will purchase the CD
to enjoy during the holiday season.  </p><p><b>The Tracks</b></p><p></p><p>Deck the Halls</p><p>O Holy Night</p><p>Up on the Housetop</p><p>We Wish You a Merry Christmas</p><p>Reading of- The Eight Days of Chanukah</p><p>Silent Night</p><p>Go Tell It On The Mountain</p><p>Jingle Bells</p><p>Reading of- Twas the Night Before Christmas</p><p>12 Days of Cleveland Christmas!</p><p>Auld Lang Syne</p><p>*If we add additional tracks we will update this site.</p><br/>

<h3>My 1st Solo Piano CD</h3>
<p>My discography contains over 50 recordings. The main thrust of my career has been collaborations with extremely talented songwriters (mostly based in NYC and Toronto). My playing on these records is strongly influenced by my passion for American Roots Music especially Memphis soul, New Orleans R&amp;B and funk, Chicago blues, Nashville folk/country and New York City jazz. These recordings have often included a significant personal investment on my part - commitments of extensive touring in support of finished recordings, often months or years of developing material in club performances and 100's of hours of rehearsal. I have learned so much from this collaborative process with so many amazingly gifted writers and performers. The magic of the 1st take, listening more than playing, the value of space, embrace of minimalism, less notes equals more soul, the chemistry of personalities that creates the magic. I cherish the wonderful musicians I have shared the bandstand or live off the floor recording sessions with. I have learned my most important lessons from all of you. </p>
<p>Decades of<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> traveling the world touring and recording other peoples's music has brought me to a new stage of music making. I feel a strong calling to share my own personal  musical story. I have been composing my own songs for many years and finally feel like I have a worthy collection of material to produce and promote with live performances.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I am celebrating over 55 years of playing the piano with the release of my 1st CD ""Every Time I See You""</li>
<li>Featuring all original songs - Instrumental Piano Songs</li>
<li>I have had so many requests for CD's at my performances over the last few years</li>
<li>I love how this material has been received at my shows and hope this recording will lead to more solo concerts</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donation to my project will allow me to continue to grow and develop my own music. I can't wait to share this personal music with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Production Stages</h3>
<p>I have a great group of recording sessions to choose the final takes. Between edits and post-production mixing and mastering I have 3 to 4 weeks of final preparation to finish my project. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your pre-orders and donations will give me the resources to finish up this year long project</li>
<li>I spent the 1st two months of this year composing new material and arranging older songs</li>
<li>An organic unified set of music gradually came together</li>
<li>I recorded this material in early summer and then spent almost 2 months living with the recordings</li>
<li>Several of the songs were then rearranged as well as 2 new compositions </li>
<li>I went back in the studio for another week and a half of very fruitful recording </li>
<li>All recording is finished. Thanks to my inspired design team in Seattle my artwork is ready and looks fantastic </li>
<li>All that remains is final edits, mastering and manufacturing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The music: ""Every Time I See You""</h3>
<p>My solo piano songs are instrumental music with lots of room for improvisation. That being said this is not a jazz record. These are largely songs - without words, but very tuneful compositions with a definite lyrical melodic character. I would describe them as personal intimate glimpses into my inner musical landscape. Mixed in with these songs are several groove oriented pieces with my own approach to blues, boogie woogie and Memphis soul. I love the variety of tuneful introspection to foot tapping celebration.</p>

</div></div>","My 1st Solo Piano CD
My discography contains over 50 recordings. The main thrust of my career has been collaborations with extremely talented songwriters (mostly based in NYC and Toronto). My playing on these records is strongly influenced by my passion for American Roots Music especially Memphis soul, New Orleans R&B and funk, Chicago blues, Nashville folk/country and New York City jazz. These recordings have often included a significant personal investment on my part - commitments of extensive touring in support of finished recordings, often months or years of developing material in club performances and 100's of hours of rehearsal. I have learned so much from this collaborative process with so many amazingly gifted writers and performers. The magic of the 1st take, listening more than playing, the value of space, embrace of minimalism, less notes equals more soul, the chemistry of personalities that creates the magic. I cherish the wonderful musicians I have shared the bandstand or live off the floor recording sessions with. I have learned my most important lessons from all of you. 
Decades of traveling the world touring and recording other peoples's music has brought me to a new stage of music making. I feel a strong calling to share my own personal  musical story. I have been composing my own songs for many years and finally feel like I have a worthy collection of material to produce and promote with live performances.  

I am celebrating over 55 years of playing the piano with the release of my 1st CD ""Every Time I See You""
Featuring all original songs - Instrumental Piano Songs
I have had so many requests for CD's at my performances over the last few years
I love how this material has been received at my shows and hope this recording will lead to more solo concerts

Your donation to my project will allow me to continue to grow and develop my own music. I can't wait to share this personal music with you!

Production Stages
I have a great group of recording sessions to choose the final takes. Between edits and post-production mixing and mastering I have 3 to 4 weeks of final preparation to finish my project. 

Your pre-orders and donations will give me the resources to finish up this year long project
I spent the 1st two months of this year composing new material and arranging older songs
An organic unified set of music gradually came together
I recorded this material in early summer and then spent almost 2 months living with the recordings
Several of the songs were then rearranged as well as 2 new compositions 
I went back in the studio for another week and a half of very fruitful recording 
All recording is finished. Thanks to my inspired design team in Seattle my artwork is ready and looks fantastic 
All that remains is final edits, mastering and manufacturing


The music: ""Every Time I See You""
My solo piano songs are instrumental music with lots of room for improvisation. That being said this is not a jazz record. These are largely songs - without words, but very tuneful compositions with a definite lyrical melodic character. I would describe them as personal intimate glimpses into my inner musical landscape. Mixed in with these songs are several groove oriented pieces with my own approach to blues, boogie woogie and Memphis soul. I love the variety of tuneful introspection to foot tapping celebration.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings from Featherwest! We are an Indie-lectro duo currently based in Glasgow, Scotland where we found our home and place to develop our unique sound.</p>
<p>We are really excited to be able to announce the release of our debut album Home At Sea.</p>
<p>We are launching this crowdfunding campaign to help raise the funds needed to get the album on a beautiful 12"" see through red Vinyl Record. Please donate, contribute or pre-order items and you will receive some lovely perks for your help :-)</p>
<p>What have we done so far?</p>
<p>The album is recorded, mixed and mastered to high professional standards. We are now in the process of ordering  CD and Cassette copies of the album. It is also available in the digital realm.</p>
<p>You can listen to tracks from the Album by <a href=""http://www.featherwest.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">clicking here</a> </p>
<p>So why Crowdfunding?</p>
<p>Recording, producing professional sounding album doesn't come cheap. Studio time, engineering fees, production costs, all of this costs loads of money and time spent. Producing a Vinyl doesn't come cheap either and for independent musicians like ourselves often is just a dream. We believe that a campaign such as this, can help make this dream a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the album</h3>
<p>Our 10 song album is like us, full of opposites and yet harmonious in it’s diversity.</p>
<p>The songs are all original material composed and arranged by us therefore they are very close to our hearts.</p>
<p>On this album you will hear our playful, often harmonious vocals, soaring synthesizers with the deepest and fattest bases, not to forget about intriguing guitars and witty samples. On top of that you will  hear some outstanding Live drums by the very talented Melanie, who greatly contributed to the creation of the album of which we are extremely proud. All of that put together by amazing recording producer Paul Savage. </p>

If you're here, you're likely already a fan of my work. But for those of you that don't know me, I'm Pedro Silva and I write music under the name Slime Girls.</span><br/></p><br/>For the past 3 years I've been releasing music, and steadily developing myself artistically and turning that into a career for myself. <p>I've been able to accomplish so much I never thought possible via my music with the help of everyone that has ever purchased my music, merchandise, or gone to a show. It's been an amazing ride so far and I try to work hard every day to be worthy of that, and produce art that I'm proud of, that I also hope you will enjoy.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm in the middle of writing and recording brand new music for Slime Girls, composing music for OMORI (an independent RPG by OMOCAT that went through an extremely successful kickstarter period, that you may have heard about!) and a small handful of other projects that I can't talk about quite yet!<br/><br/>I have always (and will continue to for the foreseeable forever) offered my music for free and made it available through as many means possible, and accessible to as many people as possible. While I think my music is absolutely worth something and every purchase of my music helps me out tremendously, I would never strictly ask money for it.<br/><br/>But right now, I am dearly in need of your support!<br/><br/><b>MY PREDICAMENT:</b><br/><br/>My laptop has served me well for the past 7 years. I take good care of my belongings, especially my musical equipment. Because without them, it is impossible to create my art. I rely on my laptop for live shows alongside production (not to mention literally any other task in 2015)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, right before a live show a few days ago my laptop met its end, past the point of which I would consider it able to be revitalized. <br/>I'm the type of person that tries my hardest to repair what I can, and get more life out of it, and I consider myself very tech savvy.<br/>It's been through 2 batteries, 2 chargers, 2 screens (prior to it completely dying I've had to take an external monitor with me to all live shows in order to use the laptop!), numerous internal wire components that have been replaced and a broken CD drive. My laptop's time is well past, and there's no use putting more money into a machine that doesn't cut in the current climate of music production. </p><p>As a musician, I've been living in a world severely setback by technical limitations of the hardware I have access to and the inability to really do anything portable (see above about the reliance on an external monitor). Without a laptop I am currently severely dead in the water when it comes to many aspects of what I do. I've already had to cancel an out of state performance because of my fears of not being able to rely on my laptop, which as you can see, turned out to be a sad but wise decision. As it stands, until I can afford a new laptop, I'm not going to be able to play any live shows, among many other things!<br/><br/>So with your help I'd like to invest in a Macbook so I can finally have a decent piece of hardware that will last me hopefully another 7 years or (likely way way way)more. I feel like at this point in my life it is an absolute necessity in regards to my musical output. <br/><br/>But, as it turns out! MacBooks are really really expensive! So that's where you come in.<br/><br/>So if you're a fan of my music, or even a new fan that has just discovered my work please consider donating whatever you can to this fund. This will go a tremendously long way in the short term and long term for my musical and artistic output, and my ability to provide you with content not only for Slime Girls, but additional projects I am a part of. So please consider helping me out, every dollar counts.<br/><br/><b>How Will The Money Be Used?<br/></b>The money will be used to purchase myself a new laptop, depending on how successful this campaign is, I would ideally like to grab a MacBook Pro. Not trying to grab the most ultimate unnecessary specs, but something that is capable of running what I need is required. The more money I get, the more I can spend on getting something nice.<br/><br/>The rest of the money will be spent on the small handful of rewards that require some outside money. Along with accounting for fees from indiegogo.<br/><br/>Should this be wildly successful for whatever reason, there are some definite stretch goals that I can put in place. Mainly dealing with making my next EP and future music releases as amazing as possible. But we can get to those if they come up at all.<br/><br/>This indiegogo has unfortunately been put together much more hastily than I would have liked my first foray into crowdfunding to be. But that is only because the situation I have found myself in is one that needs a fix immediately. I'm running this campaign for less time than I should because I have obligations and live events that I do not wish to miss or cancel, such as a performance in San Jose in early September!  I hope that with your help I can pick myself up from this very quickly.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a really good opportunity to do some really fun things for backer rewards!<br/><br/><b>BRAND NEW SONG ADVANCE DOWNLOAD: WARPSTAR (WITH YOU)<br/></b>This song will be featured on the EP that I am planning on releasing, but I want to share it with backers 2 months early as a thank you for your support.<br/><br/><b>MELONMINT BEAT SERVICES MIX</b><br/>My good friend melonmint will be providing a special mix  just for this campaign!<br/>You can preview their work on their soundcloud at <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/melonmint"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/melonmint</a><br/>Be sure to check out and download their new ""sour plum EP"" as it is phenomenal.<br/><br/><b>SLIME GIRLS SONG COVERS/REMIXES/ARRANGES<br/></b>For the $10 and above backers, you will receive a handful of exclusive covers/remixes/arranges by some super buddies.

</h3> <p>My name is Ben McClintock.  I am a musician creating music in San Francisco.  Sometimes an album is made piece by piece in a recording studio of some sort and then arranged for a live setting, and other times the music is composed, rehearsed and performed a hundred times before a note is recorded.  Both methods can be great, but this album is a case of the latter.  I recruited two of the most talented and original musicians I know, Tom Smith and Cameron Bateman, and convinced them to learn my songs and help in their arrangement to make a power trio record with one foot in tradition and the other in whatever sonic ideas were inspiring throughout the writing.  <br/><br/>After a year of playing the music live we went into the studio to record with John Karr at Ear Relevant Recordings in San Francisco (production credits with Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Eric McFaddin, The Mermen) and then had the music mixed by Phil Manley at El Studio in SF (Trans Am, The Fresh and Onlys, Moon Duo, Kelley Stoltz).  Extreme care was taken to ensure that this music was fully realized and recorded with no corners cut.  This music soothes me and it was created to do the same for you.  Now it just needs to be pressed to vinyl.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why vinyl records?<br/>
</h3>These days people seem to primarily listen to music on their phones and from streaming websites.  I do this as well and really enjoy the accessibility of listening to my favorite tunes wherever I am.  Nevertheless, a vinyl record is a thing unto itself.  You can hold it, look at the finite details of the artwork, read the credits, put the record on and do nothing else for 40 minutes except flip the record when A side is over.  There are no distracting associations outside of the music and art of a record.  No banner ads, no phone calls in the middle of a song, no ""similar artists"" to put you down a rabbit hole inevitably ending on U2's new record.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Costs<br/>
</h3>
All of the music and artwork have been created, recorded and paid for already.  The reason for this fundraising campaign is simply to pay for 
vinyl and packaging production.  If I reach my goal, 250 copies 
will be made at San Francisco's own Pirates Press 
(<a href=""http://www.piratespressrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.piratespressrecords.com</a>).  The cost for the production is $1750.  The remaining $250 will go towards lyric sheet inserts, paying the cover art artist and paying for postage.  <br/><br/>

So far we have finished recording at a studio in Milwaukee. Before we can continue, we need to raise money to cover that as well as printing and distribution costs. We cannot do this on our own, however, and are excited to ask for your support!</p><p><br/></p>

<h1 style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; margin: 60px 0px 50px;"">How does it work?</h1>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Skoog is like a games controller for making music; it's a squashy foam cube that acts as a controller for our bespoke software running on your iPad, Mac or PC. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The sensor living at the heart of the Skoog detects how you squeeze and deform the foam - its not just sensitive to <i>how hard</i> the Skoog is being touched, but <i>where</i>  and <i>how</i> it's being touched. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This unparalleled sensitivity means that our sensor translates your actions - the things you do to and with the cube - into <i>meaningful</i> musical sounds. It is uniquely expressive.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When you are using it as an instrument, you choose a sound (guitar, say),  it has a different note on each side (giving you the option of 5 notes at a time), and when you touch a side you play the note. The expressive bit comes from how you touch it:  if you touch it gently, it will be a quiet, soft note, press hard and it will be loud and brash.<br/></p>

<br/><p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Whilst you can choose to aim for the buttons, when you're playing the Skoog you don't have to: the whole surface area of the cube is responsive.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When you are using it as a ‘controller’ you can assign different notes, effects and parameters to up to 17 different playable areas of the Skoog so that you can customise to your heart's content.<br/></p>

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Physical modelling captures the nuances of each particular instrument; play the Skoog as a flute and you'll get the different notes, sounds, tones and timbres determined by ""embouchure"" and breath noise, depending on how you physically manipulate your Skoog.  Subtractive synthesis gives a classic analog synth sound with full on bass, crisp mids and highs.</p>

</span>
</div>
<p>For all the electronic musicians, producers, sound designers and sonic adventurers out there, Skoog 2.0 gives a new hands-on way to manipulate sound.  With it you can vary multiple parameters at once to perform musical gestures that might require a third hand with standard controllers. Powerful sensors detect how and where the body of the Skoog is deformed in 3D.  By mapping sonic parameters to the sensor data, a single gesture can be used to produce complex musical expression.</p>
<p>All Skoog perks come with Skoogmusic software for iPad, Mac and PC included, so you can have fun exploring the musical possibilities with the physical modelling and subtractive synthesis sound engines that we've designed to work with Skoog.</p>
<p>If you'd like to take things further, in May 2015 we'll be launching our <a href=""#developers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ableton plugin</a>, so you can setup your Skoog to control pretty much anything your imagination can conjure up using Ableton Live.   On top of that we'll be releasing an <a href=""#developers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">API</a> in summer 2015 that will mean that you can start integrating Skoog into your own software.</p>

<p>At Skoogmusic we love experimenting with new ways to combine Skoog 2.0's  tactile-sensing capabilities with audio software.  Tactile interfaces connect you directly to your sound in a way that other interfaces simply cannot, and the possibilities are limited only by your imagination.   
</p>
<p>Use Skoog to control panning in your quadraphonic sound system, for real-time lighting or video editing, for driving your car, or for tactile control of your frickin' toaster if that is what floats your boat.  With Skoog 2.0 we have unlocked a new level of hands-on control and we want to see what you can do with it.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, we'll be putting together a multi-platform API for Skoog 2.0, as well as external objects for Max/MSP and a Max4Live Device for Ableton users.   Want to see what you can do with it?  Check out the initial spec:</p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>We're ready to get tooled up and otherwise prepared for production of Skoog 2.0.</p>
<p>We have talked extensively with potential partners to manufacture our new self-designed electronics and contracted with our preferred supplier. We're about to sign off tooling design for our injection moulded plastic components,  and we've conducted numerous trials on materials and production techniques for our expanded foam parts, have finalised the design of the tools and they are ready to go into production.</p>

<div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>By pre-ordering a Skoog, you'll be playing an essential role in helping us fulfil our 
mission of enabling anyone to play and make music.  Hardware 
products are tricky to get off the ground; they're real, not virtual, so they need to 
be manufactured, which means significant sums have to be spent upfront on tooling.  On top of that,  to keep the costs as low as possible they need to be manufactured at volume.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The good news is that we've just received a loan from company shareholders that will cover the initial tooling costs, meaning that all that remains is to find the funds to pay for our first production run and to complete the final CE/compliance testing process. This is where we need your help.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you will be providing the working capital that we need to pay for our first production run.  And the more we raise, the bigger order we can place, meaning that we can keep the end user price as low as possible.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our work with Skoog 1.0 in education is our proof that we can deliver. We have 
already managed the entire production process necessary to produce a Skoog and 
manufactured a limited number of instruments for the SEN (Special Educational Needs) 
sector. Now we're applying everything we've learned to the fully-realised wireless 
iOS-compatible consumer Skoog.</span><br/></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We could fail to reach our funding targeting; </b><br/></p>
<p>We have reached our funding target so it is full steam ahead with the production of Skoog 2.0.  The only question now is how many to make! </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We may have underestimated the costs of getting 
production up-and-running; </b>We have done extensive 
iterative prototyping and testing, have costed every single component and process that's 
involved and have confirmed quotations from all our suppliers, so we are confident that 
our estimates are accurate.<br/></p>
<p><b>What if we don't have the necessary skills and experience to execute on our plan? </b></p>
<p>Well, the team has been together for four years and has already successfully designed, 
engineered, manufactured, launched and sold its first product. It works.</p>
<div>What is certain is that Skoogmusic is a lean team of talented and skilled individuals 
who share a passion for music, technology and for making the tools for creative expression 
available to as many people as possible. We couldn't have got this far without passion, 
determination and expertise.</div>

<p>Skoog is compatible with iPad models that support Bluetooth Low Energy - this
includes iPad 3rd Generation, iPad 4th Generation, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini,
iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3; and running iOS 7 or 8.</p>
<p>Our iOS apps are not compatible with iPhone.
</p>
<p><b>Can I use the Skoog with Ableton Live?
</b></p>
<p>Of course! Skoog can connect to Ableton via MIDI using Skoogmusic iOS or OSX, but for extra features and
customisation we are also offering an Ableton specific plugin as a Perk, which will
allow you to connect your Skoog to Ableton via Max for Live.
</p>
<p><b>Is the Skoog compatible with Android devices?
</b></p>
<p>Not yet.  We will be staging the release of the Android versions of our software, but they won't be available until late 2015/early 2016.   Please email info@skoogusic.com if this is something you would like us to prioritise.   </p>
<p><b>Does the Skoog output Standard MIDI?
</b></p>
<p>Skoog isn’t MIDI class-compliant, but with the Skoog app, it can output MIDI
and connect the Skoog to other applications.
</p>
<p><b>What can I do with MIDI?
</b></p>
<p>MIDI is an easy way to connect different electronic musical instruments and allow
them to ‘talk’ to each other. This is also how you can connect the Skoog to other
synth apps on your iPad and record it in Garageband!
</p>
<p><b>What do I need to send MIDI from the Skoog to an external MIDI device?
</b></p>
<p>You can connect your Skoog to an external MIDI device using the Skoogmusic
OSX software, via any sound card that has a MIDI output.
</p>
<p><b>Which iOS audio apps can the Skoog ‘play’?
</b></p>
<p>Skoog can talk to any app that supports MIDI In via Inter-App Audio.
Examples are Garageband, Nanologue, Orphion, ThumbJam...
</p>
<p>It is also compatible with Network MIDI, which will allow you to connect your
Skoog to apps on any compatible device via your WiFi network.
</p>
<p><b>How does the Skoog work with a laptop/desktop computer?
</b></p>
<p>Skoog works with laptop/desktop computers, both Windows PCs
and Apple Macs, via the Mogo OSX or Skoogmusic OSX software.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>Can I use my own sensor/controller with the app?
</b></p>
<p>No. The Skoogmusic app and the Skoogmusic/Mogo OSX/Windows software only
work with the Skoog.
</p>
<p><b>Does the Skoog only work with Apple devices?
</b></p>
<p>No, our desktop software runs beautifully on Mac and handsomely on Windows.  Linux users, get in touch.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I get the Skoog apps?
</b><p></p>
<p>The Skoogmusic app will be available via the iTunes App Store. The
Skoogmusic and Mogo software for mac and windows will be available for download from
our website.
</p>
<p><b>Does the Skoogmusic app produce its own sounds?
</b></p>
<p>Yes it does. The main ‘voice’ of the Skoog is generated by physical modelling,
with a range of instrument sounds available including strings, percussions,
woodwind, brass etc.
</p>
<p><b>Where does the sound output come from?
</b></p>
<p>The sound from your Skoog will be routed through the audio output of your tablet/laptop/desktop computer. You can of course enhance the sound of your Skoog by connecting
some high quality loudspeakers/headphones.
</p>
<p><b>Can the Skoog be used to record and sample audio through a microphone?
</b></p>
<p>The Skoogmusic OSX offers extensive sampling and audio recording
functionality for the Skoog.
</p>
<p>We are working towards providing the same functionality for the Skoogmusic iOS app,
although you can also utilise other readily available sampling apps and connect
your Skoog to it via MIDI.
</p>
<p><b>Can you change the sounds on the Skoog?
</b></p>
<p>You certainly can! Both the Skoogmusic iOS app and Skoogmusic OSX software boast a
range of ultra expressive and dynamic physical modelling instruments. With its
MIDI functionality and sampling on the Skoogmusic OSX, your choice of Skoog
sounds is limitless!
</p>
<p><b>How many notes can I play with one Skoog?
</b></p>
<p>With our standard software you can play 5 notes at a time, with the ability to pitch bend between each to
produce microtones. You can also assign different notes to different parts of the
Skoog. You can also change key or individual notes on the fly.  Our API will allow you to assign notes to corners and edges fur a maximum of 17 notes.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>Can it sound like a trumpet?
</b></p>
<p>Yes it can! The main ‘voice’ of the Skoog is generated by physical modelling, with
a range of instrument sounds available including strings, percussions, woodwind,
brass etc.
</p>
<p><b>Can I connect two Skoogs to the same iOS device?
</b></p>
<p>No, only one Skoog at a time on an iOS device I’m afraid! Skoogmusic
OSX/Windows will allow you to connect up to two Skoogs at a time, to the same computer.
</p>
<p><b>What else do I need to play sounds with the Skoog?
</b></p>
<p>Nothing! Just the Skoog, your iPad/computer, and you are good to go!
</p>
<p><b>Does the Skoog need to be tuned? Can it be tuned to acoustic instruments?
</b></p>
<p>By default, the Skoog is tuned to concert pitch with A4=440Hz. You can tune/detune the Skoog with the fine tuner, so that it’s in tune with any acoustic instrument that you might be
accompanying.
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>HARDWARE</b></p>
<p><b>Where does the Skoog get power from?
</b></p>
<p>Skoog 2.0 gets its power via USB when connected to a desktop computer or laptop using a USB cable, or from its internal rechargeable battery (which charges via USB) when operating in wireless mode.
</p>
<p><b>How sensitive is it? If I had to press hard on one side, wouldn’t that just knock the
Skoog over?</b></p>
<p><span>Skoog 2.0 is more sensitive than ever, needing just under 100g of pressure to activate - so if you keep knocking it over, you are pushing too hard!</span></p>
<p><b>Are those just buttons?
</b></p>
<p>The buttons act as a visual ""lure"" and give you better directional control whilst playing.  The Skoog  is in fact touch sensitive all over (with the exception of the base).
</p>
<p><b>Isn’t it just a MIDI controller?
</b></p>
<p>Definitely not! The Skoog is so much more than a MIDI controller - the core sounds
available are dynamically generated by physical modelling synthesis, which translate your expressive
gestures into musical sounds. The new Mogo software uses dynamic subtractive synthesis to make Skoog 2.0 more expressive than ever!</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>How is Skoog 2.0 different from the old Skoog?
</b></p>
<p>For this new version of the Skoog, we have completely redesigned our sensor to fully exploit the opportunities for dynamic control, our
manufacturing process, tooling...everything! We have listened to our users, and
are answering some of our most popular requests: it’s wireless, iOS compatible,
and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> more affordable.</span></p>
<p>The new sensor has a much higher polling rate than the old Skoog, and the Bluetooth LE  firmware has been reengineered to give the minimum possible  wireless latency (official figure TBC when we have production prototypes in-hand for testing), so Skoog 2.0 is overall much more responsive.  Skoog 2.0 can also  communicate with your Mac/PC using HID.  For those who want to get straight to the source
    data,  we'll be releasing an api very soon so you can start using Skoog 2.0 in your own applications.  We can't wait for developers to start exploring different
    uses for Skoog 2.0!  If you are interested in getting your hands on the API, please email support@skoogmusic.com.</p>
<p>
    Oh yeah, and we think the new look is pretty darned awesome as well.</p>
<p><b>What is the Skoog’s wireless range?
</b></p>
<p>Skoog 2.0 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, and has a range of approximately
10 metres.
</p>
<p><b>How long is the battery life?
</b></p>
<p>The Skoog can be used for up to 10 hours between charges.
</p>
<p><b>Can the Skoog connect by USB as well as Bluetooth?
</b></p>
<p>It certainly can - your wireless Skoog can also connect to the computer via USB,
the same way as when you connect it to charge up its battery.
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>LEARNING &amp; EDUCATION
</b></p>
<p><b>Can I still buy Skoog for education?
</b></p>
<p>Yes you can, and the wired Skoog 1 is still available to buy from our partners
Douglas Stewart and their reseller network.
</p>
<p>You can also purchase Skoog 1 from the Apple store online.</p>

<div>
<div>
<p><b>Will this teach me how to play a ‘normal’ instrument?
</b></p>
<p>The Skoog helps people new to playing music to learn about music and sound
as they experiment with musical expression - from pitch, timbre and dynamics
through to scales, instruments, recording and editing.
</p>
<p><b>Do I need to be a musician to use the Skoog?
</b></p>
<p>No. The Skoog is really easy to learn and helps people new to playing music to
learn about music and sound as they experiment with musical expression - from
pitch, timbre and dynamics through to scales, instruments, recording and editing.</p>

What is Skoog?
Skoog is an uber-cool, app-ready, hands-on musical cube that brings your creativity to life.  Skoog sets the standard for tactile control and redefines the musical landscape for novices and experts alike. 



For aspiring musicians it is an easy to learn musical instrument that you can play within seconds.



For families it is a fun way to explore sound and music together with the kids and grandparents with no need to master complicated music theory or playing techniques.



For electronic musicianit is a hackable, real-time, multi-parameter expressive controller that can bring life to your compositions, live sets and synth jams. 

For educators Skoog has a range of applications in Special Education and inclusive music provision. Designed with accessibility in mind, Skoog can be used by musicians of all abilities, making it the go-to instrument for music therapists and assistive technologists, too.

There's nothing like Skoog out there. No other digital musical instrument or music software controller is this tactile, flexible or naturally expressive.








How does it work?
The Skoog is like a games controller for making music; it's a squashy foam cube that acts as a controller for our bespoke software running on your iPad, Mac or PC. 

The sensor living at the heart of the Skoog detects how you squeeze and deform the foam - its not just sensitive to how hard the Skoog is being touched, but where  and how it's being touched. 
This unparalleled sensitivity means that our sensor translates your actions - the things you do to and with the cube - into meaningful musical sounds. It is uniquely expressive.
When you are using it as an instrument, you choose a sound (guitar, say),  it has a different note on each side (giving you the option of 5 notes at a time), and when you touch a side you play the note. The expressive bit comes from how you touch it:  if you touch it gently, it will be a quiet, soft note, press hard and it will be loud and brash.



Whilst you can choose to aim for the buttons, when you're playing the Skoog you don't have to: the whole surface area of the cube is responsive.
When you are using it as a ‘controller’ you can assign different notes, effects and parameters to up to 17 different playable areas of the Skoog so that you can customise to your heart's content.



What sounds can it make?
Skoogmusic software's sounds are made by a processes called 'physical modelling' and 'subtractive' synthesis. That's not sampling, no sir.
Physical modelling captures the nuances of each particular instrument; play the Skoog as a flute and you'll get the different notes, sounds, tones and timbres determined by ""embouchure"" and breath noise, depending on how you physically manipulate your Skoog.  Subtractive synthesis gives a classic analog synth sound with full on bass, crisp mids and highs.

""The modelled instruments provided by the application are expressive and sound pretty wonderful"" - Nick Rothwell, Sound On Sound 'On Test'



It connects to MIDI, too. Skoog can also work as a MIDI controller, which means that you can connect to GarageBand, Logic and other compatible MIDI devices and applications to open up a whole new world of sounds.  


Check out our ""Skoog Jams"" playlist for examples of the sounds and instruments available: SKOOG JAMS PLAYLIST

Or watch this montage below:



 
Who is it for?
Skoog can be used by everyone; young and old, from novices right through to music teachers and sound designers.   With a range of easy to use software/apps and a FREE developer kit in the pipeline, Skoog can be a fun introduction to music making; or it can be a serious piece of kit for on the fly-soundscaping.  It's up to you.




Skoog is for aspiring musicians.
Skoog removes the technical barriers to playing an instrument so that you can focus on your sound. You can be expressing yourself musically in less than a minute.  With a different note on each side, Skoog knows its scales so you don't have to - all you have to do is get in key and start jamming.

What can you play?

Skoog lets you play along with your favourite tunes and tracks; play bass lines and melodies; improvise and jam; create your own parts and your own sounds; set up loops and layer them; add and control effects on the fly; remix live; compose and record your own music.

You can take it to the next level by hooking it up to other music apps and software, like Ableton, Logic or Garageband, and using it as a uniquely tactile and flexible multi-touch, multi-dimensional controller.





Skoog is for parents and teachers.
Skoogmusic was honoured to be a finalist at this years Music Teacher Awards for Excellence in the Best SEN Resource category.   Skoog 2.0 brings new opportunities to the classroom.


Kids are musical. They sing and dance without being taught.  
But traditional instruments can be intimidating for younger children.  Skoog gives children (of all ages!) a fun, playful way to explore musical creativity and expression without the need for prior instrumental skills or specialised musical knowledge. Tactile, musical, play.
Using the pentatonic presets you can start making music with kids straight away and each of the sides is colour coded (with a ring around the button). You can use colour coded scores and learning materials to help children play tunes and even compose their own music.
Our first product, Skoog 1, was developed in partnership with teachers and it has been successfully put through its paces over the last four years in schools across the world.  We've applied everything we learned over that time to designing a Skoog for everyone: an affordable, wireless, iOS compatible digital musical instrument and controller that lets you start expressing yourself musically from the moment you pick it up.





 

The Skoog 2.0 Education Bundle - Applications in Special Ed.
Skoog 2.0 (early bird edition) is in production and now we are delighted to announce that our new education bundles are available via Indiegogo as well. 
During the course of the last 4 years we have developed a software package and range of resources to help teachers and students get the most form Skoog in the classroom. This bundle, which includes the Skoogmusic PC/Mac software, is now available on this campaign!
The education bundle includes the wireless Skoog 2.0 interface (in black), Skoogmusic PC/Mac software, Skoogmusic App and a range of teaching material and resources which include:



Support for over 150 popular songs and tunes


20 Lesson plans


14 sample packs


Backing tracks/loops




The bundle includes the iPad App and the skoogmusic software for PC and Mac. 


To find out more about the features and benefits of Skoog that are relevant to children with special needs visit the Skoogmusic website.  For specific student populations and applications see:


Cerebral Palsy

Autism

PMLD


Speech and language therapy

Music therapy
Inclusion
Down's Syndrome
Visual Impairment

You can support a range of different music making activities using Skoog.  The interface can be customised to suit a wide range of physical abilities. Here is a short film illustrating how the Skoog concept was developed to address the barriers faced by children with physical and learning difficulties. 


Skoog is for electronic musicians.


For all the electronic musicians, producers, sound designers and sonic adventurers out there, Skoog 2.0 gives a new hands-on way to manipulate sound.  With it you can vary multiple parameters at once to perform musical gestures that might require a third hand with standard controllers. Powerful sensors detect how and where the body of the Skoog is deformed in 3D.  By mapping sonic parameters to the sensor data, a single gesture can be used to produce complex musical expression.
All Skoog perks come with Skoogmusic software for iPad, Mac and PC included, so you can have fun exploring the musical possibilities with the physical modelling and subtractive synthesis sound engines that we've designed to work with Skoog.
If you'd like to take things further, in May 2015 we'll be launching our Ableton plugin, so you can setup your Skoog to control pretty much anything your imagination can conjure up using Ableton Live.   On top of that we'll be releasing an API in summer 2015 that will mean that you can start integrating Skoog into your own software.







Mogo in action (on OSX):


   



What software is included?
Every Skoog perk comes with Skoogmusic software for iPad, Mac and PC, and access to our Ableton Plugin.  As you develop in skill you can choose to expand your sonic options with Mogo (Mac/PC), or even augment your Skoog performances using eyegaze technology with ii-Music (PC only as per Jan 2015).   We have other music-making apps, games and an API in development, and Android versions in the pipeline, so your Skoog experience will continue to grow:

1. Skoogmusic: this is the sound engine and control room for your Skoog. 
It's all you need to connect, customise and play. Available for Mac, PC and iPad.
2. Mogo: a dedicated virtual analogue synth app designed to work 
exclusively with the Skoog. Awesome retro-futuristic sounds that you shape and bend - literally.








What've you got for tweakers?

At Skoogmusic we love experimenting with new ways to combine Skoog 2.0's  tactile-sensing capabilities with audio software.  Tactile interfaces connect you directly to your sound in a way that other interfaces simply cannot, and the possibilities are limited only by your imagination.   

Use Skoog to control panning in your quadraphonic sound system, for real-time lighting or video editing, for driving your car, or for tactile control of your frickin' toaster if that is what floats your boat.  With Skoog 2.0 we have unlocked a new level of hands-on control and we want to see what you can do with it.
Over the coming months, we'll be putting together a multi-platform API for Skoog 2.0, as well as external objects for Max/MSP and a Max4Live Device for Ableton users.   Want to see what you can do with it?  Check out the initial spec:

Who are Skoogmusic?



The Skoogmusic team brings together expertise in music learning and performance, 
hardware and software design, coding, music technology & psychology, branding and business.   What started as a post-doc research project at the University of Edinburgh has turned into a mission to liberate the musician inside everyone.


 







The story so far...


We're ready to get tooled up and otherwise prepared for production of Skoog 2.0.
We have talked extensively with potential partners to manufacture our new self-designed electronics and contracted with our preferred supplier. We're about to sign off tooling design for our injection moulded plastic components,  and we've conducted numerous trials on materials and production techniques for our expanded foam parts, have finalised the design of the tools and they are ready to go into production.










Production Timeline:



How You'll Be Helping


 



By pre-ordering a Skoog, you'll be playing an essential role in helping us fulfil our 
mission of enabling anyone to play and make music.  Hardware 
products are tricky to get off the ground; they're real, not virtual, so they need to 
be manufactured, which means significant sums have to be spent upfront on tooling.  On top of that,  to keep the costs as low as possible they need to be manufactured at volume.
The good news is that we've just received a loan from company shareholders that will cover the initial tooling costs, meaning that all that remains is to find the funds to pay for our first production run and to complete the final CE/compliance testing process. This is where we need your help.

By contributing to our campaign you will be providing the working capital that we need to pay for our first production run.  And the more we raise, the bigger order we can place, meaning that we can keep the end user price as low as possible.
Our work with Skoog 1.0 in education is our proof that we can deliver. We have 
already managed the entire production process necessary to produce a Skoog and 
manufactured a limited number of instruments for the SEN (Special Educational Needs) 
sector. Now we're applying everything we've learned to the fully-realised wireless 
iOS-compatible consumer Skoog.





What Could Possibly Go Wrong?


We could fail to reach our funding targeting; 
We have reached our funding target so it is full steam ahead with the production of Skoog 2.0.  The only question now is how many to make! 
We may have underestimated the costs of getting 
production up-and-running; We have done extensive 
iterative prototyping and testing, have costed every single component and process that's 
involved and have confirmed quotations from all our suppliers, so we are confident that 
our estimates are accurate.
What if we don't have the necessary skills and experience to execute on our plan? 
Well, the team has been together for four years and has already successfully designed, 
engineered, manufactured, launched and sold its first product. It works.
What is certain is that Skoogmusic is a lean team of talented and skilled individuals 
who share a passion for music, technology and for making the tools for creative expression 
available to as many people as possible. We couldn't have got this far without passion, 
determination and expertise.





FAQ: What else can we tell you?







APP COMPATIBILITY
Which iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad models does the Skoog support?
Skoog is compatible with iPad models that support Bluetooth Low Energy - this
includes iPad 3rd Generation, iPad 4th Generation, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini,
iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3; and running iOS 7 or 8.
Our iOS apps are not compatible with iPhone.

Can I use the Skoog with Ableton Live?

Of course! Skoog can connect to Ableton via MIDI using Skoogmusic iOS or OSX, but for extra features and
customisation we are also offering an Ableton specific plugin as a Perk, which will
allow you to connect your Skoog to Ableton via Max for Live.

Is the Skoog compatible with Android devices?

Not yet.  We will be staging the release of the Android versions of our software, but they won't be available until late 2015/early 2016.   Please email info@skoogusic.com if this is something you would like us to prioritise.   
Does the Skoog output Standard MIDI?

Skoog isn’t MIDI class-compliant, but with the Skoog app, it can output MIDI
and connect the Skoog to other applications.

What can I do with MIDI?

MIDI is an easy way to connect different electronic musical instruments and allow
them to ‘talk’ to each other. This is also how you can connect the Skoog to other
synth apps on your iPad and record it in Garageband!

What do I need to send MIDI from the Skoog to an external MIDI device?

You can connect your Skoog to an external MIDI device using the Skoogmusic
OSX software, via any sound card that has a MIDI output.

Which iOS audio apps can the Skoog ‘play’?

Skoog can talk to any app that supports MIDI In via Inter-App Audio.
Examples are Garageband, Nanologue, Orphion, ThumbJam...

It is also compatible with Network MIDI, which will allow you to connect your
Skoog to apps on any compatible device via your WiFi network.

How does the Skoog work with a laptop/desktop computer?

Skoog works with laptop/desktop computers, both Windows PCs
and Apple Macs, via the Mogo OSX or Skoogmusic OSX software.










Can I use my own sensor/controller with the app?

No. The Skoogmusic app and the Skoogmusic/Mogo OSX/Windows software only
work with the Skoog.

Does the Skoog only work with Apple devices?

No, our desktop software runs beautifully on Mac and handsomely on Windows.  Linux users, get in touch.


FUNCTIONALITY
What do the different software packages compare?
Skoogmusic is available for iPad, Mac and PC.  Mogo is currently available in desktop version only, with an iPad version available in September 2015.  Version 1.0 of ii-Music launched in January 2015 and lets you set up and add effects to your Skoog performance using eyegaze hardware (purchased separately) or to explore sound and music using just your eyes.

* ii-Music spec as at Jan 2015.  Features in the pipeline for 2015 include backing tracks, looper, custom tunings and analog synth instruments. 

What is the hardware specification for Skoog 2.0?






How do I get the Skoog apps?

The Skoogmusic app will be available via the iTunes App Store. The
Skoogmusic and Mogo software for mac and windows will be available for download from
our website.

Does the Skoogmusic app produce its own sounds?

Yes it does. The main ‘voice’ of the Skoog is generated by physical modelling,
with a range of instrument sounds available including strings, percussions,
woodwind, brass etc.

Where does the sound output come from?

The sound from your Skoog will be routed through the audio output of your tablet/laptop/desktop computer. You can of course enhance the sound of your Skoog by connecting
some high quality loudspeakers/headphones.

Can the Skoog be used to record and sample audio through a microphone?

The Skoogmusic OSX offers extensive sampling and audio recording
functionality for the Skoog.

We are working towards providing the same functionality for the Skoogmusic iOS app,
although you can also utilise other readily available sampling apps and connect
your Skoog to it via MIDI.

Can you change the sounds on the Skoog?

You certainly can! Both the Skoogmusic iOS app and Skoogmusic OSX software boast a
range of ultra expressive and dynamic physical modelling instruments. With its
MIDI functionality and sampling on the Skoogmusic OSX, your choice of Skoog
sounds is limitless!

How many notes can I play with one Skoog?

With our standard software you can play 5 notes at a time, with the ability to pitch bend between each to
produce microtones. You can also assign different notes to different parts of the
Skoog. You can also change key or individual notes on the fly.  Our API will allow you to assign notes to corners and edges fur a maximum of 17 notes.









Can it sound like a trumpet?

Yes it can! The main ‘voice’ of the Skoog is generated by physical modelling, with
a range of instrument sounds available including strings, percussions, woodwind,
brass etc.

Can I connect two Skoogs to the same iOS device?

No, only one Skoog at a time on an iOS device I’m afraid! Skoogmusic
OSX/Windows will allow you to connect up to two Skoogs at a time, to the same computer.

What else do I need to play sounds with the Skoog?

Nothing! Just the Skoog, your iPad/computer, and you are good to go!

Does the Skoog need to be tuned? Can it be tuned to acoustic instruments?

By default, the Skoog is tuned to concert pitch with A4=440Hz. You can tune/detune the Skoog with the fine tuner, so that it’s in tune with any acoustic instrument that you might be
accompanying.



HARDWARE
Where does the Skoog get power from?

Skoog 2.0 gets its power via USB when connected to a desktop computer or laptop using a USB cable, or from its internal rechargeable battery (which charges via USB) when operating in wireless mode.

How sensitive is it? If I had to press hard on one side, wouldn’t that just knock the
Skoog over?
Skoog 2.0 is more sensitive than ever, needing just under 100g of pressure to activate - so if you keep knocking it over, you are pushing too hard!
Are those just buttons?

The buttons act as a visual ""lure"" and give you better directional control whilst playing.  The Skoog  is in fact touch sensitive all over (with the exception of the base).

Isn’t it just a MIDI controller?

Definitely not! The Skoog is so much more than a MIDI controller - the core sounds
available are dynamically generated by physical modelling synthesis, which translate your expressive
gestures into musical sounds. The new Mogo software uses dynamic subtractive synthesis to make Skoog 2.0 more expressive than ever!









How is Skoog 2.0 different from the old Skoog?

For this new version of the Skoog, we have completely redesigned our sensor to fully exploit the opportunities for dynamic control, our
manufacturing process, tooling...everything! We have listened to our users, and
are answering some of our most popular requests: it’s wireless, iOS compatible,
and more affordable.
The new sensor has a much higher polling rate than the old Skoog, and the Bluetooth LE  firmware has been reengineered to give the minimum possible  wireless latency (official figure TBC when we have production prototypes in-hand for testing), so Skoog 2.0 is overall much more responsive.  Skoog 2.0 can also  communicate with your Mac/PC using HID.  For those who want to get straight to the source
    data,  we'll be releasing an api very soon so you can start using Skoog 2.0 in your own applications.  We can't wait for developers to start exploring different
    uses for Skoog 2.0!  If you are interested in getting your hands on the API, please email support@skoogmusic.com.

    Oh yeah, and we think the new look is pretty darned awesome as well.
What is the Skoog’s wireless range?

Skoog 2.0 connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, and has a range of approximately
10 metres.

How long is the battery life?

The Skoog can be used for up to 10 hours between charges.

Can the Skoog connect by USB as well as Bluetooth?

It certainly can - your wireless Skoog can also connect to the computer via USB,
the same way as when you connect it to charge up its battery.



LEARNING & EDUCATION

Can I still buy Skoog for education?

Yes you can, and the wired Skoog 1 is still available to buy from our partners
Douglas Stewart and their reseller network.

You can also purchase Skoog 1 from the Apple store online.









Will this teach me how to play a ‘normal’ instrument?

The Skoog helps people new to playing music to learn about music and sound
as they experiment with musical expression - from pitch, timbre and dynamics
through to scales, instruments, recording and editing.

Do I need to be a musician to use the Skoog?

No. The Skoog is really easy to learn and helps people new to playing music to
learn about music and sound as they experiment with musical expression - from
pitch, timbre and dynamics through to scales, instruments, recording and editing.




What if I don't know what key a piece of music is? 
Don't worry, there are loads of websites that can help - check out the Top Tunes section of the Skoogmusic website, Echords or a good old fashioned google search.

<p>Hello! I'm Duke Otherwise and I have been entertaining children my entire life — even when I was a kid myself!  I love to write songs that bring joy and feature clever wordplay and ideas. Songs with unexpected twists and turns along the way.  </p>
<p>Over the years I’ve found that it’s hard to find music that adults and kids can enjoy together — leaving both parties annoyed and frustrated. I believe adults and children should be able to share the music they enjoy and create a connection while listening to it! </p>
<p>When I compose music and lyrics I always write with these two things in mind:  </p>
<p>1.   KIDS ARE SMART!  </p>
<p>2.   Adults should be able to enjoy this music just as much as the kids.   </p>
<p>I love to challenge children to think outside of the box, introduce them to new words to expand their vocabularies, and package the lyrics in music that doesn't sound ""canned"" or ""kiddie.""  Kids like ""real music,"" and it is my aim to make real music that adults can enjoy with them.   When parents and kids can put on a Duke Otherwise album, laugh together, dance together, and discuss the story and/or wordplay together, I have achieved my goal!</p>
<p>I have never been more excited about a new collection of songs than I am about this one!</p>
<p>We are raising $15,000.  This covers our recording costs, studio musicians, mixing, mastering, artwork, and manufacturing of the first batch of CDs.  When you contribute to the campaign you will receive a perk. The best part is you get to pick what you want:  our brand new album ""Kith and Kin"" on CD,  a personalized song about a child in your life,  a house concert, a guitar once played by Duke, a private Skype concert, and more! </p>
<p>I’m excited that we’re doing this together!</p>

<p><a href=""https://norcalnoisefest.com/index19.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Norcal Noisefest 2019</a> is the 23rd annual Northern California Experimental Music Festival, a national gathering of noise musicians that takes place every year in Sacramento, California. This year's Noisefest is scheduled for October 4, 5 and 6, Friday through Sunday, at Luna's Cafe and Cafe Colonial/The Colony. We are seeking funds in order to pay for pre-event promotion expenses that help to spread the word about the Norcal Noisefest, increase festival attendance, and provide more funds to pay musicians.</p>
<p>Current Noisefest details can always be found at <a href=""https://norcalnoisefest.com/index19.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">norcalnoisefest.com</a></p>
<p>Your contributions will help pay the travel expenses of noise musicians from across the United States and around the world. We gather in Sacramento every fall to participate in the Norcal Noisefest, the longest running festival of its kind in North America. Funds are also used to spread the word about Norcal Noisefest throughout the western United States.</p>
<p>Your Contribution Helps Spread the Noise!</p>
<p>  We are seeking a total of $1500 in revenue to promote the Noisefest and pay the musicians, to pay a larger number of musicians more money, and reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>  We are offering a wide variety of perks--including Noisefest tickets and merchandise, one-of-a-kind artwork, music and experiences, effects pedals provided by our sponsors NOISEFX, reserved tables at Noisefest nights, and even the chance to perform on stage, with your own group or as a member of INSTAGON or UBERKUNST, the only performers to play every single Norcal Noisefst since 1995! This year, we are introducing a new perk--the AVALANCHE OSCILLATOR effects pedal kit, as a way to promote electronics education along with musical education, in the ""do it yourself"" tradition of the Noisefest.</p>
<p>  Indiegogo campaign funds will be divided between marketing and performer payment. If we don't reach our funding target, we have that much less to spend on marketing and musician payment. If we exceed our goal, all additional revenue will be used to pay visiting bands more money. We pride ourselves on breaking even on the Fest--all profits beyond basic festival expenses goes to the bands! Our festival also supports two independent, all-ages local music venues; the Noisefest is one of the busiest nights a year for Luna's Cafe, and one of the largest and most consistent annual events at Cafe Colonial/The Colony. Promotion helps bring visitors and music aficionados to these great venues, supporting them and encouraging them to book more outsider and experimental music.</p>
<p>Keep a Sacramento Noise Tradition Alive!</p>
<p>  The funding campaign for Norcal Noisefest 2018 was a huge success thanks to our Indiegogo supporters--we raised $1755 with a goal of $1500. After adding the revenue generated at the Noisefest, we spent $1012 on promotion and paid performers $1980.</p>

<h3>Hello everyone!  We are Slyde - an independent rock band based out of Ottawa and Toronto, Canada.  Since late-2009, we have self-released three records, and self-booked and promoted six tours throughout Eastern Canada - comprising almost 100 gigs, including two performances at the high-profile Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest in 2010 and 2011.  We incorporate elements of progressive rock, pop, European metal, and Japanese video game music into our sound, and we are often compared to such bands as RUSH, Dream Theater, and Coheed and Cambria.</h3>
<h3>Our current story:</h3>
<p>Slyde usually works on a write/record/tour cycle.  We are currently in the second stage of this cycle, recording a brand new EP with Ottawa-based musician/producer Eric Disero, who produced our last 2011 concept record, ""Feed The Machine"". </p>
<p>As a 100% independent band, we assume the management, booking agent, promoter/publicist, and distribution roles to ourselves.  In other words, we generally have no financial support from other third parties, and have always funded all band expenses out of our own pockets to date. </p>
<p>This is where you come into the equation.  We need your help in funding this upcoming EP, ""New World Sympathy"", which will be released on June 12th, 2012.  It builds upon the sound achieved in ""Feed The Machine"":  a distinctive form of alternative and progressive hard rock with a pop sensibility, in combination with lyrical content discussing political and enviromental issues. </p>
<p>""New World Sympathy"" focuses on music with lyrical substance, presenting current issues such as the geological destruction of the Alberta tar sands, society neglecting the need for social awareness in environmentalism, and seeking worldwide change in how we negatively treat our world.  With your help and support, you can be a part of this message!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Slyde's Mission for ""New World Sympathy"":</h3>
<p>We are organizing this campaign to raise roughly $2000, which is just a portion of what we need for this new EP to be as successful as it can be.  A rough financial breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p> - Production, tracking, editing, mixing, and mastering of four songs:  $2000<br/> - Manufacturing of 200 physical copies of the EP, using FSC-certified cardboard slips, CD-Rs, and CD labels:  ~$400<br/> - Production of 5000 business cards for digital distribution of the EP:  $300<br/> - Production for a 3-month campus radio campaign across Canada - 80 CDs with jewel cases and spine, CD labels, postage costs:  $350</p>
<h3>If you can contribute to this campaign, we will give you:</h3>
<p>A ""special thanks"" to you in our online liner notes for ""New World Sympathy"", a pre-release of a digital copy of ""New World Sympathy"", a signed pre-release physical copy of ""New World Sympathy"", signed copies of our back catalog, online piano/guitar lessons by members of Slyde, and much more!  Please see our perks on the right side of the page.<br/><br/>If we do not succeed in reaching our $2000 goal, any contribution will still be put towards the funding of this record, and you will still receive the perk associated with your donation.  So any help is very much appreciated!<br/><br/>If you cannot help us financially, you can still help us spread the word!  Share this campaign with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
