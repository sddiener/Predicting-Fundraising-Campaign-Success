interesting and creative projects, and our main goal is to bring fun and joy to
players. Funny movies, cartoons, comics about ghosts, afterlife, and fearing – it’s not the complete list of things, that
inspired us to create Ghosts’ Joy. We see a
Scary movies genre as a way to entertain players, and have a good laugh over
funny situations. Core idea of this project as a parody of ghost theme was born
during one of discussions of most absurd ideas for our next project. We did not
wish to create an ordinary “farm”, filling the market with clichéd product, we
wish anyone finds something interesting for
him personally in this game, fill game world with funny and charming
characters, create simple, but original good-working gameplay, that would have
fascinated players for lots of hours. Thus we came up to a free-to-play model:
anyone can play Ghosts’ Joy for free, and get dozens of fun, without thinking,
that everything will end at an interesting place. We hope you will play this
game happily, getting boost of energy, fun and good mood, because we wish that
the most. All our creativity is focused at entertaining
our players. Well, fellows, it’s time to show who is the boss in this town! Are
you ready to scare? Leave all doubts behind and go on! You’re not afraid of ghosts, aren’t you?</span></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

man-hours and budget. The total cost of production of this game is much bigger
than we’ve asked from you in this campaign. Due to this difficulties, we had to
cut some features, ideas, additional content that made this game a little
worse, but with your help we’ll create everything that was planned. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">In addition, if this campaign is  successful, we’ll add a

Currently there’re up to 100 objects with up to 6 spells in each. But in the

animation and art. The more spells and objects will be in this game, the more
diverse and interesting game will be. Same
story with characters – the more characters with unique funny animation there
will be in this game, the more interesting it will be to play this game. You

Ghosts’ Joy is much harder to make work smoothly on both computers and devices.

the same rate of fps at all platforms. In short – via this campaign we need

more interesting to play, will add tons of diversity and of course Joy for YOU!

Blam! Games is based in Odessa, Ukraine. We have five
year experience in creating engaging casual games, released on PC, MAC, as well as mobile devices – iOS,
Android. Our team unites professional game designers, programmers, 2D and 3D
artists.

While developing Ghosts’
Joy we pay attention to great emphasis on thorough of elaboration of game
mechanics, reverent attitude to detail, seamless and harmonious of all elements
to our games. We wish to give players many hours of fun and unforgettable stay,
give them bright impressions and full immersion in the game world of Ghosts’
Joy. We develop our games with soul and love and do our best to satisfy most
discerning players. We’ve chosen a free-to-play model for this game because we
wish you to play this game ABSOLUTELY FREE!

       
Our team is passionate about developing
interesting and creative projects, and our main goal is to bring fun and joy to
players. Funny movies, cartoons, comics about ghosts, afterlife, and fearing – it’s not the complete list of things, that
inspired us to create Ghosts’ Joy. We see a
Scary movies genre as a way to entertain players, and have a good laugh over
funny situations. Core idea of this project as a parody of ghost theme was born
during one of discussions of most absurd ideas for our next project. We did not
wish to create an ordinary “farm”, filling the market with clichéd product, we
wish anyone finds something interesting for
him personally in this game, fill game world with funny and charming
characters, create simple, but original good-working gameplay, that would have
fascinated players for lots of hours. Thus we came up to a free-to-play model:
anyone can play Ghosts’ Joy for free, and get dozens of fun, without thinking,
that everything will end at an interesting place. We hope you will play this
game happily, getting boost of energy, fun and good mood, because we wish that
the most. All our creativity is focused at entertaining
our players. Well, fellows, it’s time to show who is the boss in this town! Are
you ready to scare? Leave all doubts behind and go on! You’re not afraid of ghosts, aren’t you?
               
         
As we’ve already mentioned above, we’ve been developing
Ghosts’ Joy for quite a while, but now we’re
lack of funding to finish this game. Ghosts' Joy is a unique game, that has no analogues among millions of games, released or being under development. IndieGoGo is a unique place, where such indie projects have to start their campaigns and proceed till the release date! We need more money to finish this project, and thanks to you to make it more
interesting and exciting, with more characters, houses, NPCs, in-house
objects, spells, etc.  Your support will
help us to make this game much better and awesome. Your support will help us to make this game much better and awesome. We apologize for not including the PayPal payment method in this campaign because this system doesn't work properly in our country. Sorry for this inconvenience.                Do we have Stretch Goals for this campaign? Yes we do! In addition to our
goal of a multi-platform release, we have plans for additional content and
features that we would like to offer our players.Our first two Stretch Goals are simple: to release Ghosts’ Joy on PC, MAC, iOS, Android and
make it even cooler, than it is now. If this campaign reaches a funding goal we complete the game and release it in the way it had been conceived
plus all additional content, added during the campaign. We'll
talk about other goals as the campaign gets closer to the full funding goal.
Please wish us luck!              To support our campaign, we
added some rewards for everyone who backed us. Here’s the list of individual
rewards we’re offering:                                                                                                                                PACK OF GEMSGhosts’ Joy is a free-to-play game, where you

The cost of production – Ghosts’ Joy has a significant cost in terms of
man-hours and budget. The total cost of production of this game is much bigger
than we’ve asked from you in this campaign. Due to this difficulties, we had to
cut some features, ideas, additional content that made this game a little
worse, but with your help we’ll create everything that was planned. In addition, if this campaign is  successful, we’ll add a
new district in this game, where it will be much more fun and joy for
you. Shortly, we always finish our games,
and the more support we receive in this campaign from you, the more we’ll add in
this game! And we’ll make these improvements
quickly and efficiently. That is the difference your support makes, and it is a
big one.


Objects’ spells – You rule three ghosts in
this game. Each of them can cast a spell over any object in the house.
Currently there’re up to 100 objects with up to 6 spells in each. But in the
scale of this game, that’s not so many. With your help we’ll add lots of new spells with unique and fun
animation and art. The more spells and objects will be in this game, the more
diverse and interesting game will be. Same
story with characters – the more characters with unique funny animation there
will be in this game, the more interesting it will be to play this game. You
will never get bored in this game, because each time you will see something new
in each house.


Multiple Platforms – Another challenge is to release this game on
multiplatform. We’ve already released our games on PC, MAC, iOS, Android, but
Ghosts’ Joy is much harder to make work smoothly on both computers and devices.
Due to lots of objects, characters, animations it’s a great challenge to keep
the same rate of fps at all platforms. In short – via this campaign we need
your help to port and optimize this game.


What happens if we don’t meet our goal? 

We have a long-standing and well-earned reputation
after up to five years of game development. We support our players for as long
as possible. We listen to our players, and we implement every suggestion they
give us. When we have secured enough funding to proceed, you will help us to
get closer to the release date – fall 2014 with all content, that we declared. 
Of
course, there is the possibility that we may not meet our goal. In that case
we’ll finish this game, but much more later then it’s declared and with a
limited amount of content.
               

1. 
Q:
Will this game be free or paid?
     A: Ghosts’ Joy is a free-to-play game, which you can
play totally free. Of course             if you want to
move forward much faster you’ll need to make in-game                           purchases, but that’s not
necessary at all.
2. 
Q:
When do we get perks?
      A: You’ll get your perks after the release of this
game. The release date will be                announced after
the finish of this campaign.
3. 
Q:
How do I tell you my t-shirt size and tell which postcard\fridge magnet I’d
like            to get?
      A: In your comment please leave the t-shirt size (S,
M, L, XL) and the                                  postcard\fridge magnet you’d like to get.
4. 
Q:
Is the shipping cost included in the perk price?
      A: No, you should add a shipping cost in amount $20 to
the amount of money                  you fund in this project.
5. 
Q:
Can I upgrade my donation to get a higher tier?
     A: Yes. Just donate
the additional amount to bring you up a tier level if you want.           Then, you’ll
receive everything in that tier as well as all of the tier sizes below.",53.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I'm John D. Moore.  I've been making video games for most of my life, first on paper in the form of strategy guides for fictitious NES games, then in QBASIC and ZZT in the nineties, and lately in Game Maker.  In my lifetime, I've released over 70 games to the Internet.  I'm strictly a hobbyist, and making games is a real passion for me.  My most major project to date is CAVERNS OF KHRON, a challenging, freeware action-puzzle platformer with several dozen levels, released in its first form in November 2012.   I spent most of my free time last year working on it.  </p>
<p>It's available on my website for free.  The game has received an overall positive (sometimes enthusiastic) reception, but hasn't taken off yet.  I'd love to get CAVERNS OF KHRON into this year's <a href=""http://www.indiecade.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""IndieCade"">IndieCade</a>, a festival for independent games of all stripes.  I can't guarantee it'll get in, but I think having it showcased or competing would be a great thrill, and I think my game's focus on level design has some amount of something to offer the current world of independent games. However, at the moment, I don't quite have the $80 submission fee ($110 if I pay in June).  This is the main focus of this IndieGoGo campaign.  </p>
<p>The game is already completed (though I may make it more complete if I can get a bit of funding--see goals below!).  Please feel free to download it <a href=""http://khron.bombdotcom.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">at its website</a>.</p>
<p>Any contribution, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated!</p>
<h2>Help Me With Living Expenses (and Game-Making!)!</h2>
<p>My priary occupation when I'm not working on my game making hobby is as a student of Japanese language, literature, and cinema.  Currently, I'm finishing the last few months of a year studying abroad in Tokyo.  This is a very expensive city (and the exchange rate was terrible until recently) and though I'm okay right now, doing the math, I'm going to have a pretty difficult time of it making my rent and other payments up to my leaving in August, as well as my airfare.  Anything I can raise above the submission fees will give me some much-desired financial relief.  And, instead of spending all my time trying to figure out how to make a little extra money in Tokyo, I will consciously spend more time making games both small in size and large in scope.</p>
<h3>Ghost Witch and Other Projects</h3>
<p>I've been wanting to expand <a href=""http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/3059"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Witch</a>, a game I made for Pirate Kart V, to a larger game.  I haven't had much time to work on it, but I feel like a large amount of funding would free me up to develop it more.  I can't promise a delivery date for Ghost Witch, but I want to make it as fine and polished a product as Caverns of Khron is.  I've also got a Little Mermaid-inspired open-world action game that I'm having trouble developing that may one day see the light.</p>
<h2>Goals and Stretch Goals!</h2>
<p>The main thing I'm looking for here is $80-$110 for the IndieCade submission fee.  However! if the campaign reaches its $500 goal or somehow, bizarrely, manages to exceed it, I will add new things to the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter what: <strong>Caverns of Khron 1.2 with Native Gamepad Support.</strong> Currently, Caverns of Khron recommends using a free program called JoytoKey to use gamepads, but in the next release, I intend to include native gamepad support, bypassing external programs and hopefully improving responsiveness.  <strong>Also possible</strong>, a Japanese translation of the game.</li>
<li>~$100: <strong>Submission to IndieCade.</strong>
</li>
<li>$500: <strong>Caverns of Khron 1.3</strong><strong> with New Action Gameplay Mode</strong>. The game already contains 5 boss fights, but there was an extra boss fight that I cut right before release because it wasn't quite ready.  I want to add this and a small, accompanying set of action-focused levels or extra bosses.</li>
<li>$1,000: <strong>Caverns of Khron 1.4 with New Game World</strong>.  Already, after beating Caverns of Khron, the player has access to the Cloud Realm and the Special Stages, but I want to add another environment with a new set of environments and levels, to run at least 10 stages.  Most likely, this will take a few cues from my old Lemmings-influenced ZZT game, <strong>Zem! X</strong>
</li>
</ul><p>I'm open to other suggestions for stretch goals and perks, so feel free to contact me if you have an idea!</p>
<p>If I raise some money (or no money), I'll see if I can make up the difference for the submission fee.  If I can't, it will buy me a few meals, and that is also very valuable.</p>
<h2>More About Me</h2>
<p>About me!  As I said, I've published over 70 games over the last 17 years.  You can find most of them and my other creative projects at my <a href=""http://thesycophant.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website/blog</a> and at <a href=""http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/user/1144"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glorious Trainwrecks</a>, where I've submitted over 50 games in 3 years. Lately, I released <a href=""http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/super-stone-ball/14522/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Super Stone Ball</a>, a platform puzzler I put together in a few hours that has received some positive attention.  Every game I've made has been released as freeware.</p>
<p>In truth, I don't expect to raise much here, but I thoguht it'd be nice to take a few minutes to make some plans if the unexpected happens.</p>
<p>It's very likely that there are people and games and projects you feel deserve more support.  I appreciate this!  I will survive, and if you find yourself in a place where you, for some reason, are choosing between helping me spend my time working on games and taking them to festivals and feeding starving children, I would urge you to go the starving children route! This may sound like a narcissistic, entitled campaign.  I don't personally think it is (forgive my bias), but I begrudge no one for passing on this!  I don't really enjoy feeling like asking for money, but I could just use a little help.  Thanks.</p></div>","Get Caverns of Khron to IndieCade 2013

However, at the moment, I don't quite have the $80 submission fee ($110 if I pay in June).  This is the main focus of this IndieGoGo campaign.  
The game is already completed (though I may make it more complete if I can get a bit of funding--see goals below!).  Please feel free to download it at its website.
Any contribution, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated!
Help Me With Living Expenses (and Game-Making!)!
My priary occupation when I'm not working on my game making hobby is as a student of Japanese language, literature, and cinema.  Currently, I'm finishing the last few months of a year studying abroad in Tokyo.  This is a very expensive city (and the exchange rate was terrible until recently) and though I'm okay right now, doing the math, I'm going to have a pretty difficult time of it making my rent and other payments up to my leaving in August, as well as my airfare.  Anything I can raise above the submission fees will give me some much-desired financial relief.  And, instead of spending all my time trying to figure out how to make a little extra money in Tokyo, I will consciously spend more time making games both small in size and large in scope.
Ghost Witch and Other Projects
I've been wanting to expand Ghost Witch, a game I made for Pirate Kart V, to a larger game.  I haven't had much time to work on it, but I feel like a large amount of funding would free me up to develop it more.  I can't promise a delivery date for Ghost Witch, but I want to make it as fine and polished a product as Caverns of Khron is.  I've also got a Little Mermaid-inspired open-world action game that I'm having trouble developing that may one day see the light.
Goals and Stretch Goals!
The main thing I'm looking for here is $80-$110 for the IndieCade submission fee.  However! if the campaign reaches its $500 goal or somehow, bizarrely, manages to exceed it, I will add new things to the game.

No matter what: Caverns of Khron 1.2 with Native Gamepad Support. Currently, Caverns of Khron recommends using a free program called JoytoKey to use gamepads, but in the next release, I intend to include native gamepad support, bypassing external programs and hopefully improving responsiveness.  Also possible, a Japanese translation of the game.
~$100: Submission to IndieCade.

$500: Caverns of Khron 1.3 with New Action Gameplay Mode. The game already contains 5 boss fights, but there was an extra boss fight that I cut right before release because it wasn't quite ready.  I want to add this and a small, accompanying set of action-focused levels or extra bosses.
$1,000: Caverns of Khron 1.4 with New Game World.  Already, after beating Caverns of Khron, the player has access to the Cloud Realm and the Special Stages, but I want to add another environment with a new set of environments and levels, to run at least 10 stages.  Most likely, this will take a few cues from my old Lemmings-influenced ZZT game, Zem! X

I'm open to other suggestions for stretch goals and perks, so feel free to contact me if you have an idea!
If I raise some money (or no money), I'll see if I can make up the difference for the submission fee.  If I can't, it will buy me a few meals, and that is also very valuable.
More About Me
About me!  As I said, I've published over 70 games over the last 17 years.  You can find most of them and my other creative projects at my website/blog and at Glorious Trainwrecks, where I've submitted over 50 games in 3 years. Lately, I released Super Stone Ball, a platform puzzler I put together in a few hours that has received some positive attention.  Every game I've made has been released as freeware.
In truth, I don't expect to raise much here, but I thoguht it'd be nice to take a few minutes to make some plans if the unexpected happens.
It's very likely that there are people and games and projects you feel deserve more support.  I appreciate this!  I will survive, and if you find yourself in a place where you, for some reason, are choosing between helping me spend my time working on games and taking them to festivals and feeding starving children, I would urge you to go the starving children route! This may sound like a narcissistic, entitled campaign.  I don't personally think it is (forgive my bias), but I begrudge no one for passing on this!  I don't really enjoy feeling like asking for money, but I could just use a little help.  Thanks.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Since then, during my free time I've been teaching myself to code, planning, designing, building and rebuilding Carnal Souls.</p>
<p>After so long spent on it, I can safely say that this is what I want to do. I want to make Carnal Souls a professional, polished game, full of sexy, fun, and enjoyable content.

<p>There's no reason an adult-rated game can't be a polished indie production as well.

You can see some more detailed posts about planned features on <a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our site</a>, but here's a breakdown:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>RPG essentials: Experience and leveling, skills, perks, generated loot, spells, <a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-bounties-random-and-emergent-quests/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quests</a>, and exploration.</li>
<li>An open world containing large cities, small settlements, ruins, caves, and <a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-dungeons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dangerous dungeons</a>.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-battles-skills-and-gear/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turn-based combat with a wide range of unique enemies, tactics, and bosses. Fight your foes toe-to-toe, blast them with spells, or seduce them.</a></li>
<li>A powerful <a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/feature-feature-character-transformation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">character-morphing system</a> that allows you to change <i>every</i> feature of your body, in small or <a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/character-transformation-2-building-a-better-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">massive</a> ways.</li>
<li>An awesome Parser/Dictator system that allows us to make dynamic content and scenes, not only changing words to suit your description, but changing how entire scenes play out.</li>
<li>Unlockable, high-quality adult artworks that get added to your collection as you progress, as well as background location artwork.</li>
<li>Tons of races and peoples, any of which you can either play as or become - fully or partially. These include humans, demons, elves, orcs, satyrs/fauns, and lots of furry races as well. We'll be adding more and more as development continues.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and inflation, as well as possibly hundreds of status effects -  some good, some not so good.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.carnalsouls.com/lets-talk-about-sex/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Highly interactive sex scenes that offer you choices before and during the act, so you can bang how you want to.</a></li>
<li>Origin stories - begin as a mage, thief, merchant - the choice is yours, and your choice will affect your starting gear, perks, and stats, as well as how the game begins for you.</li>
<li>Titles and nicknames that you can earn as you play by completing quests, uncovering secrets, or completing achievements. NPC's will call you by the title of your choice, where they can.</li>
<li>Alignments of Gender and Stature. Gender will be governed by how you look, how you dress, and any perks or status affects that'll make you more/less feminine/masculine. Stature will work the same way, but will be on a scale of vulnerable to intimidating, meaning massive armoured warriors won't get mugged by petty bandits, and delicate beauties may find NPC's to be much more generous.</li>
<li>Fluid gender identification means NPC's will address you as they see you. They may mistake your gender if it's difficult to tell, and alternatively a fixed pronoun preference can be set in the options as well.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448657111/w6uxasv9ql9lcj3johv2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<p>No. I've invested too much time and had too much fun to stop now! I also take planning very seriously. Many of these features are functionally planned out in detail, some with their frameworks in place and working already, and some are almost entirely built. Even the documentation and tag directory for the Parser/Dictator system is written, and over 100 pages long. Carnal Souls is happening, come Hell or high water.</p>
</div><p></p>
<p></p>
Furthermore, if this campaign does well, there are even more features we plan to add using those funds:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
A customisable player home. Add an alchemy lab, a library to store your collected books, an extra bedroom to house more followers, and storage for your phat loots.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Followers who will stay at your home, providing services and bonuses to you, as well as many, many sexytimes.
</li>
<li>
Begin the game with a direct relative or housecarl, who will keep your home tidy, look after any offspring you might have, and remind you to put on something warm when it's cold out.
</li>
<li>
This one's possible in theory, but if we do <i>really</i> well, I will look into getting static 3D models made, like dioramas or statues, which backers will be able to look at in detail in-game.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448657498/ibu7kcmudalgvojk47nu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Carnal Souls will target WebGL and Unity; anywhere you can run a WebGL browser should also be capable of running the game! (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) Releases will be made available through the CarnalSouls.com website, and we plan to provide at least three primary versions:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
A downloadable version that contains all of the games content, and doesn't communicate with the CarnalSouls.com services at all.
</li>
<li>
A web-based version that hooks into additional services provided through CarnalSouls.com, such as cloud saves, save editing, and a number of other extras that we have planned. Many of these services will only be available to players with appropriate backer access.
</li>
<li>
A packaged version that will be suitable for running on portable devices, such as Apple and Android smartphones and tablets. Apple devices will need to be jailbroken to run the packaged game, but the web-based version should work just fine; the package is only intended to save mobile users from heavy data bills whilst on the go.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448657602/vbtanwd5zsjtwkihnqe6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div> <p>Despite so long teaching myself programming, one thing is clear: I need a professional's help if Carnal Souls is gonna be awesome. The main body of our target funds will be directed towards hiring Crimson - a software developer with almost 20 years experience. I have no doubt he'll make Carnal Souls a lean, mean machine that we'll be able to add to and expand for years to come.<br/></p>
<p>The next chunk will be to support myself during development, so I can stop taking commissions and focus entirely on making art assets, writing scenes, and building the game's world full-time.</p>
<p>The last part will be to hire Stereo to work on the website itself, giving us a fast, reliable platform to deliver the game to you, as well as managing the forums and promotional arts - like our cute chibis here! She's got years of experience as an admin on <a href=""https://www.weasyl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weasyl</a>, so she'd be a great fit for this role.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448657725/u3avey35jldko7cn2dlt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Carnal Souls will be free for everyone to play. No paywalls, no microtransactions or anything like that. Whether you contribute to us or not, you will be able to play the full game. We want to make rewards a thank-you to our supporters, not reserve the meat of the game for only those who can afford it.</p>
<p>The full game, its world, characters and quests will be available to everyone. The unlockable in-game X-rated artworks, as well as additional features in the online version, will be available to backers, and higher-tier backers will be able to directly influence the game's content! Here are the account types, but check out the perks for more bonuses:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448658349/mtgcuzc5fvd3j5agvz97.png"" src="""" style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"",Helvetica,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;'/></p>

<p>I've made a living in the furry and erotica fandoms for nearly ten years. I didn't do that by fleecing people, and I certainly don't plan to start now. That being said, you should read everything carefully to make sure you are happy to back this project.</p><p>
</p><p>With all projects come risks. We have spent a great deal of time and effort meticulously planning each of our features, but these can all change during development. Either for gameplay decisions, allocating people to other systems, or simply thinking of better ideas. The 6-8 month timeframe to get an initial release should be taken with a pinch of salt, and hitting stretch goals, while meaning we can make the initial release even better, may mean waiting a little longer for the extra stuff to get put in.</p>
<p>We plan to put all the money to good use, so that Carnal Souls can be everything I want it to be. Here are our plans for any extra funds we make here:</p>
<p><b>$47,000</b> - We have everything we need to make the game happen. Woo!</p>
<p><b>$68,000</b> - Hire on an extra programmer to assist Crimson. This will mean we can aim to get the more complex systems in place for the initial release, such as player homes and followers.</p>
<p><b>$80,000</b> - This will give us a healthy budget to spend on the best artists and writers for character artwork, unlockable X-rated artworks, backdrops, quests, and scenes.</p>
<p><b>$90,000</b> - We will pursue the best 3D artists we can find willing to work on high-quality erotic dioramas and character models for viewing in-game. If for some reason we cannot implement these in the game, these will be available to view on the site for Enchanted accounts and above.</p>
<p><b>$100,000</b> - At this point, all extra funds will be allocated to getting more art, more scenes, more 3D models and assets made for the game. If it goes much higher than this, aside from my brain exploding, we will look into expanding the team even further to make the initial release as excellent as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448658323/onog0nicklq8m4jmhusj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Q</b>: How long will it take?<br/><b>
A</b>: We aim to have the first release ready roughly 6 to 8 months after this campaign ends, but this should be taken as a rough estimation.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: Do I need a subscription to play?<br/><b>
A</b>: No. The game will be free. Unlockable artwork, 3D models, and online extra features will require applicable account types. After release, these accounts can be purchased, possibly with a subscription. More details will follow closer to release.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: Why don't you accept paypal for pledges?<br/>
<b>A</b>: Paypal is a massive risk, especially for projects that involve adult content. I simply won't put a large chunk of the money we raise at the mercy of them and just hope they don't decide to freeze the account for any number of reasons. I'm afraid it's credit/debit cards only.</p><p><b>Q</b>: 18 months is a long time. Why no playable demo or alpha?<br/><b>A</b>: I began making one some time ago, in Unity, and dropped it for a while to experiment with CreateJS, Haxe, and other frameworks. We've since decided to return to my original Unity build and target the new WebGL platform.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q</b>: What will the initial release be like?<br/><b>
A</b>: It's hard to say, but we aim to have as many of the bullet points listed above (under 'Yeah? What's so great about Carnal Souls?') implemented as we can.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: Can I play offline?<br/><b>
A</b>: Yes. There will be a downloadable version to play.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: Will there be a mobile version?<br/><b>
A</b>: Also yes. Perhaps not ready at release, but it will happen.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: How hardcore is the smut in this game going to be?<br/><b>
A</b>: Carnal Souls is a videogame first and porn second. To me, making the game fun to play is paramount. However, we plan to have very hardcore scenes, featuring a wide array of fetishes, excluding none but the most extreme. Excluded themes include, but are not limited to: gore, scat, vore, or anything underage.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: If I give you loads of money, can I have my fursona/OC in the game?<br/>
<b>A</b>: No. We're giving extremely high-tier backers some creative influence over the game, but I draw the line there. I have the last word when it comes to Carnal Souls' content - nothing goes in unless I feel it is appropriate and adds to the game's quality. We will, however, be happy to read people's suggestions for characters on the forums, once they're up (but again, no owned OC's or fursonas).</p><p>
<b>Q</b>: How often will you update the game?<br/>
<b>A</b>: We'll post progress news near constantly, initial releases will be infrequent as the core game comes together, but we'll start to build up to a regular schedule over time with releases probably coming more and more frequently.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>: Will Backers/Supporters/etc get more frequent updates?<br/>
<b>A</b>: No. Everyone will get the latest version, even the free member accounts.</p><p><b>Q</b>: I'm still not convinced...<br/><b>A</b>: Then please, hold off on supporting us until you're sure you're okay with the risks.

I've been around on the adult furry art scene for about ten years, doing commission work as well as art for ClubStripes.com, including my previous successful Indiegogo campaign for my all-male art book.About 18 months ago, I made the decision to develop my own game, along the lines of Trials in Tainted Space with influences from The Witcher 3 and Skyrim. Since then, during my free time I've been teaching myself to code, planning, designing, building and rebuilding Carnal Souls.
After so long spent on it, I can safely say that this is what I want to do. I want to make Carnal Souls a professional, polished game, full of sexy, fun, and enjoyable content. This is why we're doing Flexible Funding - the game will be made whether we get $100 or $100,000, but more money means more features, better content, and in your hands sooner!This campaign is to fund the initial release. After that, Carnal Souls will be a continuing project, growing and growing for the foreseeable future. We're estimating between 6 to 8 months from the end of this campaign until the initial release, and after that, we'll be looking to Patreon or something similar for ongoing funding as we expand and update the game for years to come.
There's no reason an adult-rated game can't be a polished indie production as well. With your help, we can prove it.
You can see some more detailed posts about planned features on our site, but here's a breakdown:


RPG essentials: Experience and leveling, skills, perks, generated loot, spells, quests, and exploration.
An open world containing large cities, small settlements, ruins, caves, and dangerous dungeons.
Turn-based combat with a wide range of unique enemies, tactics, and bosses. Fight your foes toe-to-toe, blast them with spells, or seduce them.
A powerful character-morphing system that allows you to change every feature of your body, in small or massive ways.
An awesome Parser/Dictator system that allows us to make dynamic content and scenes, not only changing words to suit your description, but changing how entire scenes play out.
Unlockable, high-quality adult artworks that get added to your collection as you progress, as well as background location artwork.
Tons of races and peoples, any of which you can either play as or become - fully or partially. These include humans, demons, elves, orcs, satyrs/fauns, and lots of furry races as well. We'll be adding more and more as development continues.
Pregnancy and inflation, as well as possibly hundreds of status effects -  some good, some not so good.
Highly interactive sex scenes that offer you choices before and during the act, so you can bang how you want to.
Origin stories - begin as a mage, thief, merchant - the choice is yours, and your choice will affect your starting gear, perks, and stats, as well as how the game begins for you.
Titles and nicknames that you can earn as you play by completing quests, uncovering secrets, or completing achievements. NPC's will call you by the title of your choice, where they can.
Alignments of Gender and Stature. Gender will be governed by how you look, how you dress, and any perks or status affects that'll make you more/less feminine/masculine. Stature will work the same way, but will be on a scale of vulnerable to intimidating, meaning massive armoured warriors won't get mugged by petty bandits, and delicate beauties may find NPC's to be much more generous.
Fluid gender identification means NPC's will address you as they see you. They may mistake your gender if it's difficult to tell, and alternatively a fixed pronoun preference can be set in the options as well.

No. I've invested too much time and had too much fun to stop now! I also take planning very seriously. Many of these features are functionally planned out in detail, some with their frameworks in place and working already, and some are almost entirely built. Even the documentation and tag directory for the Parser/Dictator system is written, and over 100 pages long. Carnal Souls is happening, come Hell or high water.


Furthermore, if this campaign does well, there are even more features we plan to add using those funds:



A customisable player home. Add an alchemy lab, a library to store your collected books, an extra bedroom to house more followers, and storage for your phat loots.


Followers who will stay at your home, providing services and bonuses to you, as well as many, many sexytimes.


Begin the game with a direct relative or housecarl, who will keep your home tidy, look after any offspring you might have, and remind you to put on something warm when it's cold out.


This one's possible in theory, but if we do really well, I will look into getting static 3D models made, like dioramas or statues, which backers will be able to look at in detail in-game.

Carnal Souls will target WebGL and Unity; anywhere you can run a WebGL browser should also be capable of running the game! (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) Releases will be made available through the CarnalSouls.com website, and we plan to provide at least three primary versions:



A downloadable version that contains all of the games content, and doesn't communicate with the CarnalSouls.com services at all.


A web-based version that hooks into additional services provided through CarnalSouls.com, such as cloud saves, save editing, and a number of other extras that we have planned. Many of these services will only be available to players with appropriate backer access.


A packaged version that will be suitable for running on portable devices, such as Apple and Android smartphones and tablets. Apple devices will need to be jailbroken to run the packaged game, but the web-based version should work just fine; the package is only intended to save mobile users from heavy data bills whilst on the go.
 Despite so long teaching myself programming, one thing is clear: I need a professional's help if Carnal Souls is gonna be awesome. The main body of our target funds will be directed towards hiring Crimson - a software developer with almost 20 years experience. I have no doubt he'll make Carnal Souls a lean, mean machine that we'll be able to add to and expand for years to come.
The next chunk will be to support myself during development, so I can stop taking commissions and focus entirely on making art assets, writing scenes, and building the game's world full-time.
The last part will be to hire Stereo to work on the website itself, giving us a fast, reliable platform to deliver the game to you, as well as managing the forums and promotional arts - like our cute chibis here! She's got years of experience as an admin on Weasyl, so she'd be a great fit for this role.
Carnal Souls will be free for everyone to play. No paywalls, no microtransactions or anything like that. Whether you contribute to us or not, you will be able to play the full game. We want to make rewards a thank-you to our supporters, not reserve the meat of the game for only those who can afford it.
The full game, its world, characters and quests will be available to everyone. The unlockable in-game X-rated artworks, as well as additional features in the online version, will be available to backers, and higher-tier backers will be able to directly influence the game's content! Here are the account types, but check out the perks for more bonuses:
Member: Requires no pledge. You'll have access to the game, including cloud saves on the online version when you register on the site. Once the game is launched you'll have access to the basic forums as well, for bug reporting and discussions.
Backer: Has full access to all of the art in the game, as well as online extras like save editing and achievements once they go live. You'll also have access to the site and Backer forums before release, where we'll post updates and sneak peaks on what's being done. Also includes the Backer badge and title on the forums.Supporter: Has all privileges of Backer status, as well as Supporter forum section where you can vote on polls for content. Also includes the Supporter badge and title on the forums.Enchanted: Includes all privileges of Supporters, as well as the Enchanted badge and title for the forums, and your name in the credits. Enchanted accounts will also have access to the high-fidelity 3D models, if we reach that stretch goal (see below).
Legendary: Includes all privileges of Enchanted, as well as the Legendary badge and title for the forums, and your name in the credits. Legendary accounts have lifetime full access to everything.
Mythical: Includes all privileges of Legendary, as well as the Mythical badge and title for the forums, and your name in the credits. Mythical accounts have lifetime full access to everything.
I've made a living in the furry and erotica fandoms for nearly ten years. I didn't do that by fleecing people, and I certainly don't plan to start now. That being said, you should read everything carefully to make sure you are happy to back this project.
With all projects come risks. We have spent a great deal of time and effort meticulously planning each of our features, but these can all change during development. Either for gameplay decisions, allocating people to other systems, or simply thinking of better ideas. The 6-8 month timeframe to get an initial release should be taken with a pinch of salt, and hitting stretch goals, while meaning we can make the initial release even better, may mean waiting a little longer for the extra stuff to get put in.
We plan to put all the money to good use, so that Carnal Souls can be everything I want it to be. Here are our plans for any extra funds we make here:
$47,000 - We have everything we need to make the game happen. Woo!
$68,000 - Hire on an extra programmer to assist Crimson. This will mean we can aim to get the more complex systems in place for the initial release, such as player homes and followers.
$80,000 - This will give us a healthy budget to spend on the best artists and writers for character artwork, unlockable X-rated artworks, backdrops, quests, and scenes.
$90,000 - We will pursue the best 3D artists we can find willing to work on high-quality erotic dioramas and character models for viewing in-game. If for some reason we cannot implement these in the game, these will be available to view on the site for Enchanted accounts and above.
$100,000 - At this point, all extra funds will be allocated to getting more art, more scenes, more 3D models and assets made for the game. If it goes much higher than this, aside from my brain exploding, we will look into expanding the team even further to make the initial release as excellent as possible.
Q: How long will it take?
A: We aim to have the first release ready roughly 6 to 8 months after this campaign ends, but this should be taken as a rough estimation.
Q: Do I need a subscription to play?
A: No. The game will be free. Unlockable artwork, 3D models, and online extra features will require applicable account types. After release, these accounts can be purchased, possibly with a subscription. More details will follow closer to release.
Q: Why don't you accept paypal for pledges?
A: Paypal is a massive risk, especially for projects that involve adult content. I simply won't put a large chunk of the money we raise at the mercy of them and just hope they don't decide to freeze the account for any number of reasons. I'm afraid it's credit/debit cards only.Q: 18 months is a long time. Why no playable demo or alpha?A: I began making one some time ago, in Unity, and dropped it for a while to experiment with CreateJS, Haxe, and other frameworks. We've since decided to return to my original Unity build and target the new WebGL platform.

The main character Alan White is a former military man who was at war in Iraq, who received a lot of experience in the army, but after many injuries he decided to resign. Many years have passed – Alan had his own business and was in to hunting. Once he decides to take his faithful friend, Doberman named Junior, to go hunting and stay at his deceased grandfather in the village called Brightwood where once was a sect called ""Witnesses of the Second Coming"". In the evenings, Alan listened to the radio and once heard an announcement about strange objects moving towards the Earth. After the third news release it turned out that it was alien’s spaceships. Later on, they began to report that the enemy had attacked, the cities were being destroyed and thousands of people died. Alan decided that he did not have any reason to return home, and it is better to stay here and consolidate, find weapons and provisions to survive. Perhaps he will even manage to save the Earth…What would you do in his place? But, perhaps, sometime in the future, theoretically, an invasion of aliens (if they exist) could occur.  What will they look like? For what purpose they are invading? - We will try to answer these and other questions in the game ''WHEN THEY ARRIVED''.SOME SCREENSHOTSBattle bow.Portal.You have your own ATV and garage.​You have your own big house and doberman Junior.Aliens are experimenting with people and releasing mutants to hunt survivors.​ WHAT IS READY OR PLANNED

<li>
<strong>Beacons</strong><br/>You will be able to buy and place beacons during gameplay. Teammates can use the beacons to spawn at the beacon locations. <br/> </li>

<strong>Party System</strong><br/>You will be able to invite your friends to a party in order to play in the same team. In a game there will be no difference between your party members and other teammates.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Voice Chat</strong><br/>Using proximity-based voice chat is a key factor for success in PROXIMA. Communication with your team is crucial! You will be also able to use pre-recorded voice commands to communicate with you team.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Core Pillars of PROXIMA</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility</strong><br/>We design the game with cross-platform matchmaking and play in mind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Responsiveness</strong><br/>Experience intuitive character movement and gunplay. A good balance between realism and convenience is part of our design philosophy!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimization</strong><br/>We think about optimization in early stage of development! We will not start optimizing the game post-launch! Also you will be able to choose from a wide variety of settings to get the desired balance between quality and performance.</p></li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Modding Support &amp; Dedicated Servers</h3><p>We want to empower all humans around the globe to make their own versions of PROXIMA and  provide a space for creativity. There is no limitations. You will be able to create your own maps and game modes and host a server with them.</p><p>Dedicated servers will be available alongside the official servers and matchmaking. We pre up PROXIMA to have cross-platform matchmaking and play across all platforms.

A ground-breaking experience with infinite matches, dynamic weather system, seasons and a real 24-hour day/night cycle.Play the official game modes or unleash your creativity by creating your own mods!Join the Universe now and experience a new era of multiplayer games! Action in PROXIMA UNIVERSE takes place on an Earth-like planet called Alterra, but unlike our planet it's populated by robotic life forms. Big Realistic Open WorldMaps in PROXIMA are big in scale and rich in detail! Our first map Haven for the game mode Terra Control has a size of 4x4 km. Maps in the other game modes will be even bigger!Stay tuned for news! We at Vulkanic are going to push real-time rendering to the next level! Dynamic Weather SystemThe weather system of PROXIMA will be based on seasons and will be highly influenced by real weather conditions of the planet Earth.Spending a day in PROXIMA means you will see how fog appears in the early morning and how it spreads or disappears after some time. You will be able to see how puddles appear as it's raining or how they fill up over time. If there is a Winter season you will see how the environments start to freeze. If it's snowing for many hours or days you will be seeing how the snow spreads and transforms the environment in a Winter-resort-looking place!We are in love with realism and small details! We will make the most realistic and best-looking weather system of all time! Real 24-Hour Day/Night CycleWhen we say real 24 hours then we really mean 24 hours! We are simulating a whole day of war and the war never stops unless you leave the game! Terra Control – An Infinite Never-Ending Game Mode!In our first game mode called Terra Control all players are divided in 4 teams. You need to capture and control areas in order to have success with your team. After a certain time of early- and mid-game the round's Final Phase starts, in which the winning team is decided.The cycle repeats without reloading the map or losing any progress made in the previous round! Will you put all your efforts into winning the round or plan a long-term strategy? Decide it together with your team! Character Classes & AbilitiesThe game features three classes: Gunner, Mechanic and Protector. The main purpose of the classes is to set predefined roles for players in a team. This makes the gameplay highly tactical and diverse.All classes have unique special abilities ranging form offensive to defensive ones. While offensive abilities can affect/damage enemies or reduce their stats, defensive ones can grant additional movement speed or special effects to you and nearby allies.There are health, shield and energy stats which differ depending on what class you play. Energy is used to cast abilities and refills over time.All classes have a signature weapon which will not require ammo but use energy instead. These weapons are very useful in extreme cases where you don't have any other equipment to protect yourself.We're planning to add more classes in the future. However if we achieve the third stretch goal we will implement an additional class on launch! Character CustomizationThe appearance of your robot is not bound to the class you play! You will be able to choose from different looks. You will also be able to replace the head, add additional elements to the body, change colors etc.We will regularly release new robotic characters, body elements and other cosmetics after launch! There will be both female- and male-looking characters in the game. Gear Shopping & EconomyM.A.I. (stands for Multiplayer Artificial Intelligence) will play a big role in how war scenarios will unfold! Every action can mean the loss of your hard-earned points. Dying isn't cheap in PROXIMA. Playing good will be rewarded and playing not careful enough or light-minded will punish you. There is a constant economy running. You don't have unlimited ammo. Well, yes and no.M.A.I. will charge you for every shot you make! M.A.I. has an asking price for all gear you desire! M.A.I. is effectively balancing the game and it's economy! Selling or buying gear from M.A.I. is one of the key elements of PROXIMA.M.A.I. can even talk to you... sometimes. Weapons & EquipmentPROXIMA will feature a wide variety of weapons and equipment. Weapons differ depending on ammo type (bullets, plasma, arrows etc.) but also are grouped in series such as Horizon (HR) or Stellar (SI).Each weapon has different stats such as damage, fire rate, shield penetration value, projectile speed etc. All of those make different weapons more or less useful depending on the situation.We implemented realistic damage models as well as bullet drop and travel time for projectiles. Damage is calculated based on the body part the projectile hits as well as the current amount of shield the opponent has.Horizon series: high damage, lower projectile speed.Stellar series: lower damage, high projectile speed. Other types of gear in PROXIMA include:
Weapon upgrades such as scopes, extended mags etc.
Various types of grenades.

Cores, which are used to regenerate health, energy, shield or boost speed.

Utility gear, which is used to spawn beacons or to change your class. 
You will be able to buy and sell gear in M.A.I.'s shop. AircraftsIn the Terra Control game mode all players will spawn in a team base located on the edge of the island.Take your aircraft, fly to a desired destination and drop. While you are dropping the aircraft leaves the simulation. Keep in mind, your aircraft can be shot down and force you to drop on that exact location. So be carefull! Switch from FPP to TPPIn PROXIMA you'll be able to freely switch your camera perspective!We developed a system that shares the same animations in FPP and TPP (how others see you). This will solve a common issue of multiplayer games when you appear slightly different to your enemies compared to how you see yourself. For example, when you think you are hiding behind a rock an enemy still can see the edge of your body uncovored. In PROXIMA you not gonna have such a problem. Realistic PhysicsThe game will feature realistic character ragdoll. When you die from a shot or explosion the impact force is taken into account in order to simulate a realistic death animation. Easy to Learn, Hard to MasterPROXIMA gameplay is understandable and comfortable for a player but still provides a wide space for improving your skills, experimenting and discovering the small nuances that make it so unique. You will learn the base game mechanics in the first minutes after joining the game, but the path of improvement will be long, motivating and rewarding.On the surface the game can seem casual but due to its complex design it's highly strategic and it can be a true hardcore experience at times. A war scenario can be completely quiet in one minute and in the other everyone is fighting for territory. Other Features

BeaconsYou will be able to buy and place beacons during gameplay. Teammates can use the beacons to spawn at the beacon locations.  

Party SystemYou will be able to invite your friends to a party in order to play in the same team. In a game there will be no difference between your party members and other teammates. 

Voice ChatUsing proximity-based voice chat is a key factor for success in PROXIMA. Communication with your team is crucial! You will be also able to use pre-recorded voice commands to communicate with you team.
 Core Pillars of PROXIMA
AccessibilityWe design the game with cross-platform matchmaking and play in mind.
ResponsivenessExperience intuitive character movement and gunplay. A good balance between realism and convenience is part of our design philosophy!
OptimizationWe think about optimization in early stage of development! We will not start optimizing the game post-launch! Also you will be able to choose from a wide variety of settings to get the desired balance between quality and performance.
 Modding Support & Dedicated ServersWe want to empower all humans around the globe to make their own versions of PROXIMA and  provide a space for creativity. There is no limitations. You will be able to create your own maps and game modes and host a server with them.Dedicated servers will be available alongside the official servers and matchmaking. We pre up PROXIMA to have cross-platform matchmaking and play across all platforms. Server files for the game will also be released in case you are wondering!You will be able to play the official game modes by Vulkanic or to unleash your creativity with custom servers or mods, or both! Cross-Platform Matchmaking & PlayWe believe in a future where cross-platform features enable players around the world to play together! Our goal is to unite players no matter on what platform they originally bought our game! Deadly Mangos!M.A.I. told us about a terrifying mango grenade that will be available in her shop.

I'm <strong>Nick Roger</strong>, CEO and Co-Founder of <strong>Rightstick Studios</strong>.

We've been working on small homemade video games for several years, but have rarely had the chance to finish or publish our games. This year, I'd like to break that streak by publishing Rightstick's first commercial video game: Wonder Wickets.This is a special campaign, because actually, Wonder Wickets is already funded! We've saved up a small budget ourselves, and ANIM-ACE is acting as our producer and publisher for Wonder Wickets, provided the additional funds we needed to afford enough music and sound effects. However, the budget we have now is only the minimum amount we needed for a ""quality yet affordable"" product. We're launching this campaign in hopes that we can raise more funds, and make Wonder Wickets the game we really want to make.Wonder Wickets is a game inspired by our love of mini-golf, with a twist in mechanics to make it a fresh and exciting experience. It features a colorful cast of playable characters and high-resolution graphics that anyone can enjoy, and simple, versatile controls that anyone can pick up and play.Wonder Wickets is a small and simple game, but we're still injecting it with love and the Rightstick devotion to quality and innovative design.Wonder Wickets' base game features:
1920 x 1080 Resolution + 60 fps

Single Player Campaign and Two-Player Modes


Destrucible objects, that can be overcome by pure force!
A variety of enemies with different behaviors.

Power-ups to turn your foes upside down.
Play as 6 colorful characters, with alternate color options for a variety of choices
Cavort about 30+ levels, spread through 6 thematic worlds:
Open Plains
Sprawling Forests
Star-Struck and Shipwreck-Strewn Beaches
Fiery Fossil Fields
Icy Mansions and Spooky Graveyards
Mysterious Planet


Local and Online 2-Player Versus

3 Versus modes, with multiplayer stages:
Collect stardust and smack enemies in a scurry to achieve the higher score
Race to the end in the least amount of strokes
Aim for moving enemies and targets in a driving range



Level Builder, allowing you to make and share single and multiplayer stages.

Adjustable Controls, with support for keyboards/mouse and all standard PC controllers.
Wonder Wickets is being developed for PC on Steam, Itch.io, and other selling platforms. We have plans for possible ports after the PC release.These extra features require more music and sound effects, which costs much more money. The budget for each goal also includes a little bit more to cover time and effort needed to create new assets.Each goal reached will also push the release date further back, but not by much more than a couple of weeks each.

+2 More Characters, making a total of 8 Characters

3 More World Themes: (which also includes more assets for level editor!)

​Gizmo & Toy Land
Crystalline Caves & Dark Grottos
Windy Temples



More Music, with enough music to have a unique theme for each world.


+2 More Characters, making a total of 10 Characters

Bonus Levels, 1 special level for each world, unlocked through certain conditions.

2 More World Themes:
Golden Castle
Secret UFO




2 More World Themes:

​Mega Metropolis & Busy Highways
?????



More Versus Modes:

​Fortress Siege: Topple the defenses of your opponent's castle and defeat their king. The player with the most amount of damage after either king is defeated wins!

Party Mode: Play a randomly generated set of matches, with random modes, rules, etc. with each match.

And More? -- We'll experiment with more multiplayer mode ideas, and see what sticks!

<h3>Campaign UPDATE: we reached the campaign goal! Now on to the Stretch Goals!!!</h3>
<h3>THANK YOU!<br/><br/>Who exactly are we?<br/>
</h3> <p>Hello, world!</p>Well we finally came to IndieGoGo after months of ""Is it the right thing to do?""<br/>Let's cut the chase and introduce ourselves: we are a smaaall company located in Japan (Osaka, to be precise) and we make games (mostly...but more on that later...please do not stop reading ;_; )<br/><br/>Still reading? Good!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453782674/uo9qwk0dhfq370u7eleg.jpg"" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=""1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>We have always wanted to do games in our lives and that became our job (why didn't we become doctors? WHY??!?!?!?). <br/>We played games from the Atari 2600 onwards and that has always been our biggest, most beloved passion....and now we want to give some of that to you all.<br/><br/>We came to IndieGoGo to make our project come to life, in the hope that we can bring something new, fresh and funny to play to every game lover (and not) out there :D<br/><br/><h3>What exactly are we.....doing?</h3>Good question!<br/>We are doing a new kind of game....a mix between a golf game (yes, you read it correctly...GOLF) and an RPG.<br/>So you might be wondering...<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439837949/iadxcolwr7tjxyokaykc.png"" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=""1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Have you ever played a golf game? Well...we did. And what bothered us the most was seeing amazing courses, amazing surroundings and...not being able to see any of it.<br/>It was just a shot, being teleported to the ball's location over and over...we wanted to explore and see...THINGS!<br/><br/>And that is why one night after one beer too many we came up with the crazy idea of making the FIRST (yep.) open-world golf RPG game.<br/>And it will be available for iOS, Android, PC and Mac.<br/><br/>Excited? Well..WE ARE!!!<br/><br/><h3>What exactly is RPGolf?</h3>As previously said and as the name suggests, RPGolf is an open-world-golf-roleplaygame.<br/>But it's not all. We took particular care to make sure that  the two genres are not just something slapped together to make some ""innovative"" game.<br/><br/>We are taking particular care into mixing the aspects of both games together to give you a unique, fulfilling and incredible experience :)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453782702/uyqjaoloqojhaemmkou2.jpg"" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=""1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>You want an example? Of course!<br/>Well for starters...you will have to walk to your ball. No more ""teleporting"" and finally some healthy walks immersed in nature and surrounded by...monsters. And you will have to fight them if you want to free your path and become stronger. Because by becoming stronger not only your level will go up, but also you will make more damage while fighting and you will shoot farther while playing golf!<br/>Of course all the main stats of your character will affect both aspects of the game, so that you will have to decide how to power up your character depending on your gameplay style.<br/><br/><h3>What exactly are you not telling us?</h3>Well, nothing in particular but we can surely tell you more about the game!<br/><br/><ul>
<li><p>9 (or 18? help ussss!) hole open-world map featuring different environments.</p></li>
<li><p>Character will grow as more experience is gained. Every stat will influence both golf and RPG aspects of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Handicap
 System: to increase replayability, the HCP of the player will be 
recorded play after play. Lower HCP levels will unlock areas in the game and give you access to unique quests, features and items!<br/></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Club house, practice field, shops and many other buildings to explore</p></li>
<li><p>Clubs “forging” system: grip, head and shaft, combine them in different ways when visiting workshops around the world to create the ""ultimate club""!<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Multiplayer mode* (see below)<br/></p></li>
</ul>Like what you read? Then go on!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453782539/ct2biyobxwvfi6zla9oa.jpg"" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=""1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>What exactly are we paying for?</h3>Artworks. The artist that works with us already owns our houses, laptops, souls and any material possession we have.<br/>Also we need to eat while we work on the game (or we will starve and there is no way we can complete RPGolf. And that would be sad...no?), and let's not forget about our amazing soundtrack! (we will soon post a preview in the updates!)</div><div>With your help we can work full time on RPGolf without having to work on other projects to ""survive"" ourselves.<br/><br/>We want to develop this game more than anything, and with your help we can really make it happen!<br/><br/><h3>What exactly are the STRETCH GOALS?</h3>We are glad you asked!<br/>here is what we plan to do if we reach enough funding:<br/><br/><b><strike>25.000</strike> 15.000 USD: </b>WE MADE more than we expected...lol! And to celebrate this goal we will make the game a full 18 holes course. Yep, instead of 9 holes you will get a fully featured golf club. More monsters, bosses and more anything will double the fun!<br/><br/><b><strike>50.000</strike> 40.000 USD: </b>Class system. Wizard, warrior or thief. Choose your path. Unique skills, weapons, and clothes will make you want to play the game over and over just to enjoy all three different styles!<br/><br/><b><strike>75.000</strike> 65.000 USD: </b>Multiplayer. Yes you will be able to play online and challenge all other players around the globe in an unique game! Fight the monsters or wait for the others to do it? Focus on the golfing? You choose!<br/><br/><h3>What exactly are the risks?</h3>Like every other project in the world there will be problems. But that's only part of the fun, right?<br/>The game is already in development, the core mechanic of the game is there, what we need is the ""stability"" and reassurance to really put our full time into this and complete it.<br/>And you have our word that we will make the impossible and more to deliver what we promise here!!!<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What exactly can I do to help?</h3>Well...if you are still reading, why not contribute to the campaign? (big grin :D)<br/>If you cannot or simply do not like games at all, don't worry...we love you anyway &lt;3. But please help us spread the word and share this project with all your friends on Facebook, Twitter, whateverisyourfavouritesocialnetwork!<br/><br/>And...well...thanks for reading until the end!<br/>

We played games from the Atari 2600 onwards and that has always been our biggest, most beloved passion....and now we want to give some of that to you all.We came to IndieGoGo to make our project come to life, in the hope that we can bring something new, fresh and funny to play to every game lover (and not) out there :DWhat exactly are we.....doing?Good question!We are doing a new kind of game....a mix between a golf game (yes, you read it correctly...GOLF) and an RPG.So you might be wondering...
Have you ever played a golf game? Well...we did. And what bothered us the most was seeing amazing courses, amazing surroundings and...not being able to see any of it.It was just a shot, being teleported to the ball's location over and over...we wanted to explore and see...THINGS!And that is why one night after one beer too many we came up with the crazy idea of making the FIRST (yep.) open-world golf RPG game.And it will be available for iOS, Android, PC and Mac.Excited? Well..WE ARE!!!What exactly is RPGolf?As previously said and as the name suggests, RPGolf is an open-world-golf-roleplaygame.But it's not all. We took particular care to make sure that  the two genres are not just something slapped together to make some ""innovative"" game.We are taking particular care into mixing the aspects of both games together to give you a unique, fulfilling and incredible experience :)
You want an example? Of course!Well for starters...you will have to walk to your ball. No more ""teleporting"" and finally some healthy walks immersed in nature and surrounded by...monsters. And you will have to fight them if you want to free your path and become stronger. Because by becoming stronger not only your level will go up, but also you will make more damage while fighting and you will shoot farther while playing golf!Of course all the main stats of your character will affect both aspects of the game, so that you will have to decide how to power up your character depending on your gameplay style.What exactly are you not telling us?Well, nothing in particular but we can surely tell you more about the game!
9 (or 18? help ussss!) hole open-world map featuring different environments.
Character will grow as more experience is gained. Every stat will influence both golf and RPG aspects of the game.
Handicap
 System: to increase replayability, the HCP of the player will be 
recorded play after play. Lower HCP levels will unlock areas in the game and give you access to unique quests, features and items!


Club house, practice field, shops and many other buildings to explore
Clubs “forging” system: grip, head and shaft, combine them in different ways when visiting workshops around the world to create the ""ultimate club""!
Multiplayer mode* (see below)
Like what you read? Then go on!
What exactly are we paying for?Artworks. The artist that works with us already owns our houses, laptops, souls and any material possession we have.Also we need to eat while we work on the game (or we will starve and there is no way we can complete RPGolf. And that would be sad...no?), and let's not forget about our amazing soundtrack! (we will soon post a preview in the updates!)With your help we can work full time on RPGolf without having to work on other projects to ""survive"" ourselves.We want to develop this game more than anything, and with your help we can really make it happen!What exactly are the STRETCH GOALS?We are glad you asked!here is what we plan to do if we reach enough funding:25.000 15.000 USD: WE MADE more than we expected...lol! And to celebrate this goal we will make the game a full 18 holes course. Yep, instead of 9 holes you will get a fully featured golf club. More monsters, bosses and more anything will double the fun!50.000 40.000 USD: Class system. Wizard, warrior or thief. Choose your path. Unique skills, weapons, and clothes will make you want to play the game over and over just to enjoy all three different styles!75.000 65.000 USD: Multiplayer. Yes you will be able to play online and challenge all other players around the globe in an unique game! Fight the monsters or wait for the others to do it? Focus on the golfing? You choose!What exactly are the risks?Like every other project in the world there will be problems. But that's only part of the fun, right?The game is already in development, the core mechanic of the game is there, what we need is the ""stability"" and reassurance to really put our full time into this and complete it.And you have our word that we will make the impossible and more to deliver what we promise here!!!

What exactly can I do to help?Well...if you are still reading, why not contribute to the campaign? (big grin :D)If you cannot or simply do not like games at all, don't worry...we love you anyway <3. But please help us spread the word and share this project with all your friends on Facebook, Twitter, whateverisyourfavouritesocialnetwork!And...well...thanks for reading until the end!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>As you will see I am not the best photographer but I am a huge fan of 6mm and 10mm gaming, having been playing war games for well over two decades..  I love the huge scale battles that this miniature size allows you to fight over but I have found that the one thing that is often lacking from these monumental conflicts is the terrain to really make it feel as epic as my vision of the background.</div>
<div>I always enjoyed modelling projects but terrain of the scale I had envisioned often eluded me as it requires such accurate replication.  However, when I began to learn digital 3D modelling I realised this was how I could bring my ideas to life.  After a year of different smaller projects I eventually began work on my first set of truly epic terrain!</div>

<li>I am using a caster called Sebitar Workshop (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshop)%C2%A0that"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshop) ...</a> has taken part in crowd funding campaigns before and he has reliably helped to bring those campaigns to realisation with some great feedback from the backers.  Having received some of his products and the test casts I can attest to how good quality  they are.</li>
<li>The most time consuming aspects (3D printing and mold making) have already been completed.  In fact the pictures you have seen are of the first casting that have been painted up.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><h3>Postage</h3><div>I want to mention (again) is that the postage is not included in the prices above.  I have done this to allow for orders from other countries as easily and so that if people purchase multiple perks (like when the stretch goals are added) the postage will work out as cheap as possible.</div><div>But as uncertainty can be a concern for the majority of us I thought I should give an idea of what to expect.  A completed set of the City Walls is approximately 2kg and is being sent from central Europe.  This should give you an idea of how much postage is likely to cost, but as an estimate to Europe I expect the insured postage for a single City Wall set to be approximately £20 due to the size and weight of the package.</div><div><br/></div><h3>Standard Resin Warning</h3><div>The City Wall set is made from resin.  As is typical with resin products the models will need to be washed in warm soapy water before they are painted.  There is also a chance of some small air bubbled that will need to be fixed with a modelling putty such as Greenstuff.  Finally some of the finer parts can break in transit despite all effort being taken to package them thoroughly, these can be easily fixed with superglue.</div><div>The model comes unpainted and requires some assembly.</div><div><br/></div><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>How can I help get this funded?</h3><div> </div><p>Understandably this isn't going to be for everyone or affordable for every individual with a gaming table but you may want to see what I bring out in the future (smaller bunkers are planned as well as a range of buildings.  So what can you do in this case?  Well, this is my first crowd funding project and not being an expert in publicity any you can give will always be massively appreciated.  So please spread this campaign far and wide and share it with anyone you feel may be interested.</p><p><br/></p><h3>More Shiny Pictures</h3><p>(apologies again for my mediocre camera skills)</p><p>As the Ork hoards continue their assault on the city the cowardly Imperial commander attempts his escape as the dual suns begin to set.  His breakout is spearheaded by the cities finest defenders and equipment leaving far too few to protect the remaining civilians.  Attempting to plug the gap in the defences and the gate that the commander orders opened the brave Emperors finest take up vigil on the wall and form a barrier in front of it while the gate is closed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441222400/buoaomvraksw8tct6hpn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441222421/poiy18wlpoltzjtjvn5y.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 511px;""/></p><p>Yep, that's a gate wide enough for a Baneblade to comfortably fit through or two tanks side by side with room to spare.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441222668/xeal9bjw3heuvqzprbty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441222716/lx3wnzddedkglzghds57.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The walls are designed so that 6mm infantry on standard bases can fire through the gap, offering them the best protection possible.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441222808/la7oeaxuprcwmre0zaph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

<div> </div></div>","A bit about me
As you will see I am not the best photographer but I am a huge fan of 6mm and 10mm gaming, having been playing war games for well over two decades..  I love the huge scale battles that this miniature size allows you to fight over but I have found that the one thing that is often lacking from these monumental conflicts is the terrain to really make it feel as epic as my vision of the background.
I always enjoyed modelling projects but terrain of the scale I had envisioned often eluded me as it requires such accurate replication.  However, when I began to learn digital 3D modelling I realised this was how I could bring my ideas to life.  After a year of different smaller projects I eventually began work on my first set of truly epic terrain!

   The Project This campaign is to put my resin City Wall project out into the world and help me to:
Judge interest in terrain on this scale to decide if it is worth setting up an online store.
Allow me to gain some money back from the 3D printing of the City Wall originals (I don't expect to get the entire cost of everything I have spend but I have learnt a lot from the project and that in its self has been great for me).
Any money recouped from the project will allow me to fund future projects so that they can come to a crowd funder in a well developed state (as this one is) with the printing done and the moulds made.
So why should you back the project?
First and foremost it allows you to get some awesome terrain cheaper than it will be sold if I can set up an online store. For a crowd funding campaign the project is quite far along so there are very few risks; the moulds are already made and have been used to cast the test set you can see pictures. Because of the point above this will be flexible, meaning that you will get the perks you pay for even if we don't hit the target (basically the amount for the first stretch goal).
You can customise what you want if we reach the first stretch goal, adding extra walls, changing the bastions out for the taller ones, having more than one gate, etc.  It is unlikely I will be able to offer this even if I can set up a shop.
Even if I don't set up a shop as a campaign backer you will be able to contact me to add to your walls.
Its about time to show off some pictures I think!  Below is the 3D sculpting of the walls.  I think it shows off the details nicely (also as I have mentioned my photography isn't the best).The above shows one ""set"" of the City Walls.  It is modular so can be put together with the straight sections by the gate should you wish, or one corner but the gate and one straight section or with the gate over to one side.  Whatever the scenario you are playing demands.In terms of size the City Wall set measures just over 3 foot in length.  The platform at the back is 4 inches high and wide enough for three 20mm infantry stands to be placed side by side along the straight or corner sections and the gate towers are a massive 11 inches high (well just over actually).Now onto some pictures of the real deal!In the pictures above, the doors have been modeled closed.  If we reach the £1000 you will be able to buy extra sections as well as extra doors so you can have one set open and one set closed should you want to.So not as to take up too much space with pictures and have some text get lost at the bottom of the page for the other pictures, with some 6mm models so you can get a better idea of the scale, just scroll down.    Where is my money going?The obvious aside (mould making and resin) by far and away the biggest cost for this project is the actual 3D printing of the pieces.  Anyone who has who has done this themselves will have already guessed this from the size of the City Walls but I wanted to give everyone a clear idea that the majority of the money is going towards getting some of the cost of this.Risks & Challenges Possibly the only risk for you has to be that I have not run a crowd funding campaign before and I can understand that as a concern.  However, I have done everything I can to make this as risk free as possible.  How I hear you ask.
I am using a caster called Sebitar Workshop (https://www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshop) ... has taken part in crowd funding campaigns before and he has reliably helped to bring those campaigns to realisation with some great feedback from the backers.  Having received some of his products and the test casts I can attest to how good quality  they are.
The most time consuming aspects (3D printing and mold making) have already been completed.  In fact the pictures you have seen are of the first casting that have been painted up.
PostageI want to mention (again) is that the postage is not included in the prices above.  I have done this to allow for orders from other countries as easily and so that if people purchase multiple perks (like when the stretch goals are added) the postage will work out as cheap as possible.But as uncertainty can be a concern for the majority of us I thought I should give an idea of what to expect.  A completed set of the City Walls is approximately 2kg and is being sent from central Europe.  This should give you an idea of how much postage is likely to cost, but as an estimate to Europe I expect the insured postage for a single City Wall set to be approximately £20 due to the size and weight of the package.Standard Resin WarningThe City Wall set is made from resin.  As is typical with resin products the models will need to be washed in warm soapy water before they are painted.  There is also a chance of some small air bubbled that will need to be fixed with a modelling putty such as Greenstuff.  Finally some of the finer parts can break in transit despite all effort being taken to package them thoroughly, these can be easily fixed with superglue.The model comes unpainted and requires some assembly.   How can I help get this funded? Understandably this isn't going to be for everyone or affordable for every individual with a gaming table but you may want to see what I bring out in the future (smaller bunkers are planned as well as a range of buildings.  So what can you do in this case?  Well, this is my first crowd funding project and not being an expert in publicity any you can give will always be massively appreciated.  So please spread this campaign far and wide and share it with anyone you feel may be interested.More Shiny Pictures(apologies again for my mediocre camera skills)As the Ork hoards continue their assault on the city the cowardly Imperial commander attempts his escape as the dual suns begin to set.  His breakout is spearheaded by the cities finest defenders and equipment leaving far too few to protect the remaining civilians.  Attempting to plug the gap in the defences and the gate that the commander orders opened the brave Emperors finest take up vigil on the wall and form a barrier in front of it while the gate is closed.Yep, that's a gate wide enough for a Baneblade to comfortably fit through or two tanks side by side with room to spare.The walls are designed so that 6mm infantry on standard bases can fire through the gap, offering them the best protection possible.




Stretch GoalsFunding reaches £1,000 - REACHED - Postage will be combined on your perks even though you have to buy them perk at a time.  Postage will be paid after the campaign as explained above.Individual components will be added to the perks list allowing you to buy individual parts of the set.  It will still work out cheaper to buy a full set if you want to have the standard wall system.The photos below show each of the individual components:DoorStraight Wall SectionCorner Wall SectionA quick note that each of these is a 45 degree turn.  So obviously two (with a bastion between should you choose to) makes up a full 90 degree turn.Gate Wall SectionSmall Bastion SectionTall Bastion SectionBastion ""Pointed Roof""Funding reaches £1,500 - REACHEDHere is a pictures of the Forward Bunker.  As you can see it is very much designed to match the bunkers on top of the Bastions.The 3D printed is completed and it is being sent off this weekend to the caster to begin pre-production (basically getting the mould made).But remember!  Each full set already purchased gives you one for free! (S if you have gone for the double perk you of course get two!)Funding reaches £2,000 - REACHEDGun mounts added to the perk list so you can add some AA defences to your City Walls.  These fit onto the smaller Bastion roofs or the Forward Bunkers.Just waiting on a quote from the guy doing the casting and this will be up (shapeways have been a bit slow getting this sent off to me).Funding reaches £2,500 - REACHEDStraight and Corner Breached Wall Sections now allow you to show damage during campaigns or scenarios.  Just be sure there are enough big guns to do the damage!The pictures below show the original sculpts, as you can see they have detail of the internal walkway that has the firing point on the straight wall section or allows soldiers to move along the system immune to attack.Breached Straight Wall SectionBreached Corner Wall SectionFunding reaches £3,000 - REACHEDAn ""inside"" corner will be added as a perk, adding even more options to how you can construct your fortifications.A quick note that each of these is a 45 degree turn.  So obviously two (with a bastion between should you choose to) makes up a full 90 degree turn.



Funding reaches £3,500 - REACHED - Damaged Bastion 

Thanks for everyone's support!  I really wasn't expecting to get to this point.  The last goal would be a damaged bastion (top section destroyed to show the inside stairwell and connecting corridor).IMPORTANT:  This goal will take more time to reach you as it has not yet been fully designed and will need additional sculpting work.  For this reason it would not be able to be sent out until after Christmas.  If this goal is reached you will need to get this part POSTED SEPERATLY.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

What matters here is the fact that some of those resources are scarce in some continents while some are abundant. Some states have comparative advantage in producing certain resources; some has absolute advantage, etc.</p>

<h2>PLAY THE NEXT GENERATION OF LASER TAG<br/>
</h2>
<p>Video games have evolved enormously over the last 20 years, but live gaming - paintball, laser tag and airsoft - has not. We love paintball and airsoft, and we love playing video games, but there was nothing out there that let us combine the physicality of sports with the interactive experiences we’ve come to expect from video games.</p>
<p>Battlegrounds is an advanced laser tag gaming platform and facility inspired by our love of video games. We’ve spent the last three years building a running, shooting, weapon-changing, shield-breaking, nemesis-making, flag-capturing real life video game. After hosting over 800 testers at our beta facility and Toronto Mini Maker Faire, we’re now ready to open our first playing field.</p>
<p>We're very excited to grow out of our beta test facility and into a full-size field, and are currently in lease negotiations to open a location near Downsview Park, close to the 401 and Yorkdale Mall.</p>
<p>As a backer on Indiegogo you will get first access to play the game and at our new field, meet the team and give us your feedback on what you think would make the game better. We've built an incredibly flexible gaming system and your ideas and input will help shape the future of this game.</p>
<p>If we reach our funding goal you will also get - in addition to any perks you’ve purchased - a Battlegrounds Player ID band unique to Indiegogo backers and you will get to compete in the first-ever Battlegrounds Team Elimination Tournament.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

During the game, you can see how your scores, kills, assists and accuracy stack up to your allies’ and enemies’. Awards are handed out based on players’ individual play styles, including “Indecisive” for switching weapons too often and “Regicide” for racking up kills on the opposing point leader.</p>
<p>Spectators can watch live scores and field camera video feeds in the lounge, and detailed recaps after the game.</p>

<h2>FUTURE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p>What we’ve made so far is just the tip of the iceberg. Our goal is to be constantly expanding and refining the game. Deciding what to work on next is fun but also very challenging, and we want to hear from players about what they want to see in the game.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the features we have in the development pipeline:</p>
<p><b>Customizable weapons and player classes<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Weapons and equipment can be digitally customized to create a huge range of different effects and play styles. Tweaks range from pure numerical buffs (increasing the magazine size of your SMG) to state-based debuffs (a shotgun that temporarily disables your opponent’s weapon) to customized sound sets (a suppressed sniper rifle). Custom class builds will make some awesome perks possible, like faster control point capture, stronger shields, or even stealing health from other players. The possibilities for weapon and class customization are enormous; as such, it will require a significant amount of testing and lots of engagement from players to ensure proper gameplay balance.</span></p>
<p><b>New physical gun models<span><br/></span></b>At launch we will have one gun model, an assault rifle. We are planning models for shotguns, submachine guns and sniper rifles. New gun models can be purely ergonomic/aesthetic in nature or can unlock certain specific weapon effects such as high accuracy at long range or special shot spread physics. Emplaced weapons such as player-operated turrets are also planned.</p>
<p><b>Interactive, objective-based props<span><br/></span></b>Hackable mainframes, defusable bombs, or destroyable ammo caches. This can also be extended to cameras or lights that can be shut down by firing or interacting with them. Props will be networked and can serve as central mission objectives in their respective game modes.</p>
<p><b>Campaign mode<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Multi-stage campaigns where the results of one game carry forward into subsequent games. For example, if the first stage is an assault on an armoury, the winning team is granted access to laser shotguns in the next stage, and the losing side would play a base defence. This could also be extended to a branching campaign structure in which entirely different games are played depending on how the campaign unfolds.</span></p>
<p><b>Unlockable achievements</b><span><br/></span> We will be constantly analyzing cumulative stats from games and building out an achievements system. Correct balance (to make them challenging, fair and interesting) is crucial to ensure that an achievement actually means something, which will take many months worth of game data and player feedback. </p>
<p><b>Laser grenades<span><br/></span></b>We would be crazy NOT to make them.</p>

We'll be providing updates as we move ahead through Facebook and our Battlegrounds mailing list. The next few months will be an exciting time for the Battlegrounds team and we're very happy to be working towards this goal. Keep in touch, we always love hearing from our supporters and new voices alike.
Battle your friends across a dynamic and objective-based playing field, with multiple weapon types, intense force feedback and persistent stat tracking





PLAY THE NEXT GENERATION OF LASER TAG

Video games have evolved enormously over the last 20 years, but live gaming - paintball, laser tag and airsoft - has not. We love paintball and airsoft, and we love playing video games, but there was nothing out there that let us combine the physicality of sports with the interactive experiences we’ve come to expect from video games.
Battlegrounds is an advanced laser tag gaming platform and facility inspired by our love of video games. We’ve spent the last three years building a running, shooting, weapon-changing, shield-breaking, nemesis-making, flag-capturing real life video game. After hosting over 800 testers at our beta facility and Toronto Mini Maker Faire, we’re now ready to open our first playing field.
We're very excited to grow out of our beta test facility and into a full-size field, and are currently in lease negotiations to open a location near Downsview Park, close to the 401 and Yorkdale Mall.
As a backer on Indiegogo you will get first access to play the game and at our new field, meet the team and give us your feedback on what you think would make the game better. We've built an incredibly flexible gaming system and your ideas and input will help shape the future of this game.
If we reach our funding goal you will also get - in addition to any perks you’ve purchased - a Battlegrounds Player ID band unique to Indiegogo backers and you will get to compete in the first-ever Battlegrounds Team Elimination Tournament.
LASER TAG STRIPPED DOWN AND REBUILT FROM THE GROUND UP




Battlegrounds isn’t like any laser tag you’ve ever played. From the moment you put on your wireless vest and heft your assault rifle you feel like you’re in a first person shooter. When you squeeze the trigger, the booming speaker and kicking vibration motor make a big impression on friends and foes alike.
THE GUN


Multiple weapon modes each with their own shot capacity, rate of fire, damage type, with unique shot spread and range

Rail-mounted holosight aligned with our proprietary emitter package

115G vibration motor

Embedded Linux running on 800MHz ARM Cortex A8

OLED gun screen showing your ammo, shield level and health







THE VEST


Customized MOLLE tactical vest

Team colour and hit feedback LEDs

Multiple sensors for reliable hit detection

Three vibration motors

XBee wireless connection to the gun








LIVE SCOREBOARD AND PLAYER STATS
Just like a video game, everything you do from pulling the trigger to camping control points is tracked, recorded and analyzed in real time by the Battlegrounds game server. During the game, you can see how your scores, kills, assists and accuracy stack up to your allies’ and enemies’. Awards are handed out based on players’ individual play styles, including “Indecisive” for switching weapons too often and “Regicide” for racking up kills on the opposing point leader.
Spectators can watch live scores and field camera video feeds in the lounge, and detailed recaps after the game.





GAME MODES


Team Deathmatch, Free For All - Band together with your team or go it alone to take down your opponents and score the most points.
King of the Hill, Control Points - Work with your team to secure and hold one or more control points throughout the field.
Attack & Defend, Capture the Flag - Rush forward to steal the enemy’s flag and make it back in one piece while simultaneously protecting your own. Flag capture points are projected around the playing field. No more guessing at who has the blaze orange ribbon.
Juggernaut, Captains, VIP Protection - Supercharged shields and health, special weapons and the real life version of infuriating escort missions.


 King of the Hill game at our beta facility


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
What we’ve made so far is just the tip of the iceberg. Our goal is to be constantly expanding and refining the game. Deciding what to work on next is fun but also very challenging, and we want to hear from players about what they want to see in the game.
Here are a few of the features we have in the development pipeline:
Customizable weapons and player classesWeapons and equipment can be digitally customized to create a huge range of different effects and play styles. Tweaks range from pure numerical buffs (increasing the magazine size of your SMG) to state-based debuffs (a shotgun that temporarily disables your opponent’s weapon) to customized sound sets (a suppressed sniper rifle). Custom class builds will make some awesome perks possible, like faster control point capture, stronger shields, or even stealing health from other players. The possibilities for weapon and class customization are enormous; as such, it will require a significant amount of testing and lots of engagement from players to ensure proper gameplay balance.
New physical gun modelsAt launch we will have one gun model, an assault rifle. We are planning models for shotguns, submachine guns and sniper rifles. New gun models can be purely ergonomic/aesthetic in nature or can unlock certain specific weapon effects such as high accuracy at long range or special shot spread physics. Emplaced weapons such as player-operated turrets are also planned.
Interactive, objective-based propsHackable mainframes, defusable bombs, or destroyable ammo caches. This can also be extended to cameras or lights that can be shut down by firing or interacting with them. Props will be networked and can serve as central mission objectives in their respective game modes.
Campaign modeMulti-stage campaigns where the results of one game carry forward into subsequent games. For example, if the first stage is an assault on an armoury, the winning team is granted access to laser shotguns in the next stage, and the losing side would play a base defence. This could also be extended to a branching campaign structure in which entirely different games are played depending on how the campaign unfolds.
Unlockable achievements We will be constantly analyzing cumulative stats from games and building out an achievements system. Correct balance (to make them challenging, fair and interesting) is crucial to ensure that an achievement actually means something, which will take many months worth of game data and player feedback. 
Laser grenadesWe would be crazy NOT to make them.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>People have been asking for an Android version of this game since like forever, as well as the Daily Challenge tournament which is in the online Ultra version. Unfortunately, to get these functionalities to mobile, the game has to be rewritten from scratch. I don't have the budget for that, so this is where you can help!</p>
<p>I have lots of great ideas and plans to improve and extend the game! How far I get along, and how fast I can do this, will depend on YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS! Here's what I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for iPad and brand new retina display graphics!</li>
<li>Port the game to Android!</li>
<li>Multiplayer support (GameCenter), challenge your friends to play the exact same game as you!</li>
<li>Tournaments, similar to the Daily Challenge from the online version!</li>
<li>Power-ups and gameplay variations!</li>
</ul>
<div>The image above has the current iPhone version of the game on the left, and a mockup of a possible improved version on the right. It's just a teaser, but updates will be posted here as the project goes along.</div>
<p>The money I collect here will be used to compensate me for my time, and possibly hire a programmer and an artist (depending on the amount of contributions).</p>

<h3>Roleplaying for kids</h3>
<p>Myrskyn sankarit (""Heroes of Storm"") is an entry-level tabletop roleplaying game for kids. Nothing like this has been available in Finnish for a generation, so it's up to us to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Myrskyn sankarit is a fantasy adventure for kids 9-13 years old.

<h3 class=""il"">Mistä on kyse</h3>
<p class=""il"">Myrskyn sankarit on 9-13-vuotiaille suunnattu aloittelijaystävällinen suomenkielinen seikkailuroolipeli. Se sijoittuu kutakuinkin samaan maailmaan kuin Myrskyn aika ja kertoo seikkailijoita, jotka haluavat palauttaa oikean kuninkaan Nathariin. He etsivät muinaisen kaupungin raunioita, kohtaavat hirviöitä ja keisarin sotajoukkoja, piiloutuvat ja juoksevat, loitsivat ja taistelevat.</p>
<p class=""il"">Inspiraation lähteinä ovat ainakin Robin Hood, Kuningas Arthurin tarinat, Narnia, Tähtien sota ja Hiidenpata.</p>

<h3>Mitä tarvitaan</h3>
Jos minimibudjetti 10 000 € ($12500) ei tule täyteen, projekti hautautuu ja kukaan ei menetä mitään. <br/>Jos kymppitonni tulee täyteen, pelistä tehdään tuhannen kappaleen painos, ja kaikki yli 20€ maksaneet saavat oman painetun kappaleensa.

<p>Kirjastoille tarkoitettu Belle-etu sisältää mainosten, neljän pelin ja julisteen, sekä 50 flaierin lisäksi myös kaksi kirjailijavierailua.

<p>Postikulut on nyt ilmaistu euroissa, mutta maksu tapahtuu dollareissa. Kun joidenkin Perkkien kohdalla lukee ""Kotimaan postitusta varten lisää viisi euroa hintaan, seitsemän Eurooppaan ja kymmenen muualle"", se tarkoittaa siis ""Kotimaan postitusta varten lisää seitsemän dollaria hintaan, yhdeksän Eurooppaan ja kolmetoista muualle.""</p></div>","Kampanja ohi!

Roleplaying for kids
Myrskyn sankarit (""Heroes of Storm"") is an entry-level tabletop roleplaying game for kids. Nothing like this has been available in Finnish for a generation, so it's up to us to remedy the situation.
Myrskyn sankarit is a fantasy adventure for kids 9-13 years old. The story is about a group of brave rebels who live in the forest and fight against an evil witch emperor, in the vein of Robin Hood, Star Wars and Knights of the Round Table. And yes, it will have lots of strong female characters, as well!

<p>I'm Phillip Meyer the creator of the upcoming PC game King Voxel.  I am creating an action adventure game that captures the magic of some of my favourite classic games ""Adventure"" on the Atari 2600 and ""The Legend of Zelda"".  King Voxel features a unique cel shaded voxel graphics engine, a world generator, and dynamic camera controls.</p>
<p>I'm giving you the opportunity to immortalize yourself or anything interesting or important to you with a photo that goes into the Voxelot Royal Art Museum located in the king's castle at the start of the game.  This picture will be a part of the game forever!</p>

<h3>Who am I ?</h3>
<p>I am a freelance graphic designer and illustrator. I started my own company in 2010, drawing <a href=""http://pageeasy.com/NICOLASCHAUSSOISDRAWINGS/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comics </a>and design products before I turned towards eSport. After realizing a few Starcraft fanarts like the <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/7aF1k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Propaganda serie</a>, my style catched the professional eSport world's attention. I now create posters, logos, T-shirts... for official tournaments, progaming teams and websites, with prestigious partners like the GSL, Fnatic, Startale, FXOpen,<span>Millenium</span>, The Meltdown and Team Liquid. Now eSport is both my passion and my job. </p>

<h3><span>What's my project ?</span></h3>
<p>I still draw for my own pleasure and from my personal inspiration: portraying my favourite players, designing posters for fun...

<p><span>Why not sharing my creations with all the eSports fans ? I decided to open a gear online shop to produce boys and girls shirts, players jerseys, clothing, mouse-pads, bags, phone cases... anything a goog geek need ! You'd like a Grubby shirt ?

The game will be a third person shooter, using mechanics of hacking in order to move easy on the enviroment and incapacitate enemies, the main idea of the game, is showing the hacking via a variety of minigames, that are hard and entertaining. 

 
The history is about Clint Blackmount, better know as Citizen 404, who after losing his family, joins a team of ""Heroes"" and get training, that way, he can fight any type of danger on his way. On the history, you will see how he and his team lose the control of the situation, and he's forced to take decisions and make missions against his will, and avoid things go worse. 

 
We need to make this game awesome, and here is when you enter. Your help is extremely important, we don't have the resources to make a project like this. 

 
You define if this game see the light, is your collaboration what give us the needed resources to make the game. 

 
Also, we have planned that if we find extra money, we will use it to add more content to it, so who knows what content we will add on the future, after all, the sky is the limit!
 RewardsWe've planning the rewards for a long time, we think on what could be good for the collectors, gamers, and others, we made a lot of rewards for those who want to see how is the game going, people who wants personalized characters, and all type of stuff, some of them are limited because is hard to make it, so go for them before they get claimed! The inversionWe know that you care about where's your money going, so we made this diagram for you

As you can see, there is a lot of money that is going to the payment, this payment is for the professionals that are working with us, the software is for the licenses of the software that we are going to use, after, there is ""Emergency Money"" this money will be used to replace any damaged computer or other that can appear, and the equipment is furniture and hardware that we need

<p>QANDA</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>HOW MANY OF US GET TO REALIZE OUR DREAMS?</em></strong></p>
<p>According to a recent study of lifelong ambitions, most of us will only ever fulfil five of our dreams. What’s on your bucket list? Which 5 will become real for you?  Would you like to help others while staying out of the limelight?  Can you imagine the impact on someone’s life by allowing them a little more happiness; a little more money; a little more freedom; a little more enjoyment?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dream is to help other people to achieve more of their dreams.  A phrase attributed to a motivational speaker struck a chord with me; he said, ‘<strong>You Can Get Everything You Want In Life If You Will Just Help Enough Other People Get What They Want</strong>’.  Believe it to be true, and our goal is within reach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another beacon, is a short poem attributed to an anonymous author; it reads, ‘<strong>We Have Each Been Given A Bag Of Tools, A Formless Rock And A Book Of Rules, And Each Must Make, ‘Ere Life Has Flown, A Stumbling Block Or A Stepping Stone</strong>’. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We all have a passion for something; people, places, ideals and things in life:  In small but meaningful ways, we benefit by enriching the lives of others through anonymous giving; often nothing more than doing a selfless act of kindness for a deserving fellow human being without any recognition or glory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can’t fix all of the world’s problems but what if we  believe that helping as many people as possible will cause a ripple effect, and what if those who we are able to help will pay it forward and help someone else, then maybe, in time, we will all live in a better place.  To do this, not for the recognition, but to make the world a better place by leaving a legacy of a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a request for a “helping hand”; to improve lives, by making a contribution to build an enterprise that will become self-sustaining, and capable of benefitting countless others.  Structured properly it will self-perpetuate and continue to do good.  It is a fundamental concept used by every government in the world; collect a small amount of money from the many and apportion it based on a redistribution plan. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The social conscience component of this enterprise is critical to its DNA, since it is a concept built on humanity and capitalism.  We have already acted as the catalyst with a contribution of £30,000 to acquire the hardware and software; we are seeking £25,000 from the followers of Indiegogo, which will be supported with another £30,000 of bank debt financing and a final £30,000 of equity investment from a third party.  This completes the budget of £115,000 to launch the venture on solid footing.  Now that you have grasped the philosophical soul of the enterprise; let me share the mechanics and nuances of the business model with you.</p>

<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Can't donate, but still want to help out? There are plently of ways that you can support QANDA through your social media connections; just start spreading the word.</p>
<p><strong>TO MULTIPLY YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE</strong></p>
<p>Some might say that heading doesn’t make sense, but taken in context it’s a sound statement.  The Internet gives us a platform to reach much further than was possible a generation ago; allowing us to connect with far more people in an entertaining and positive manner.  <strong>Our product is a knowledge based game using a question format with multiple choice answers and a cash prize as the incentive.</strong>  QANDA  is a simple acronym for Question and Answers and is the essence of the idea behind <a href=""http://www.qanda4cash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.qanda4cash.com</a><a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a> , a fun, educational and  entertaining online version of the popular game featured on TV, radio and printed media.  QANDA has some subtle differences; it has a charitable component; it offers small, meaningful cash prizes; it uses a low multiple to achieve its target goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basically a player registers and pays a small fee (£1) to submit an answer chosen from the five multiple choice answers provided to the question (only one entry per player).  Example:<strong><em> Where is the Eiffel Tower located?</em></strong><em>  [<strong>a</strong>] London [<strong>b</strong>] Dublin [<strong>c</strong>] Paris [<strong>d</strong>] Rome [<strong>e</strong>] Cairo</em>  A winning entry is randomly chosen from the correct entries and the prize is paid out; prize values vary from £20 to £1,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You’re familiar with this concept because it is widely used by conventional media such as TV, radio and newsprint; their approach being that people phone or text their answer in response to seeing the question in one of the aforementioned mediums.  The cost associated with them answering the question is usually £1 plus carrier charges and can run into a few pounds subject to the amount of time and levels of complexity.  The theory is that a large number of people will contribute a small fee (nominally £1-£2), which in turn funds the cost of the enterprise and the prize incentive (usually hundreds sometimes thousands of pounds).  The drawback to using Telecom providers is that they collect 60% of the fee, requiring the company to attract much greater numbers of callers to realize the goal and that goal can expand to accommodate infinite response, earning huge profits without reflecting an increase in the prize.  They make no reference as to how many people may be participating.  We introduce a new transparent paradigm by using the Internet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, general knowledge is only a click away; however even the notion of looking up the correct answer still involves the person with acquiring new information, so the game has a subtle educational aspect to it.  It is a very basic game; a level playing field equally available to one and all.  It is a simple, intuitive and informative game that poses one question and offers a choice of answers; oftentimes the answer is obvious through general common knowledge.  Prizes are not life-changing values but rather life-enhancing values.  Prizes range from £20 to £1,000; this mirrors the amounts that most people find they are short on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and unlike gambling alternatives, they only spend £1 per game (entries are limited to one per entrant).  Because the draw is made from a finite pool of real entrants, there is always a guaranteed winner and the mathematical algorithm provides for a target figure to close the game i.e. 5 times the value of the prize, for example, £100 prize would attract £500 in turnover to cover the cost of the prize and the operational costs with the remainder being allocated to charity and profit for long term sustainability. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.qanda4cash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.qanda4cash.com</a> (functionally complete but not currently live) will host two question formats side by side and will replace them each time they are won.  Question #1 might be: <strong><em>Where is the Eiffel Tower located?</em></strong><em>  [a] London [b] Dublin [c] Paris [d] Rome [e] Cairo </em>and question #2 (with a graphic component) might be: <strong><em>Which flag represents Canada?</em></strong><em> [a] picture of flag of Chile [b] picture of flag of India [c] picture of flag of Germany [d] picture of flag of Canada [e] picture of flag of Australia</em>   A player simply chooses and submits their answer with credits previously purchased and valued at £1.  Using the 5x multiplier, it is easy to calculate the likelihood of a win for any one entrant i.e. £20 prize will generate £100 turnover, which equates to 100 entrants.  Because of the small number of participants required to complete a game, very quick turnaround times allow for numerous winners everyday. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using Andrew Carnegie’s approach to charity; rather than passively giving money to a worthy charity, we listen to their priorities and needs and purchase the thing they need and present it to them, reducing the chance of cash funds being slowly eroded through day to day expenses.  For example, a hospice may need ten new mattresses valued at £3,500; we advocate offering to buy the mattresses on their behalf using their specifications and from their preferred supplier, as opposed to donating £3,500 and assuming that they act quickly and acquire ten mattresses rather than delay a month or two, and only be able to buy seven mattresses.  Subject to public response to our games, we choose a new charity on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis.</p>
<p>Because of the relatively small number of participants required to complete any of these games, there is a minimal loss for non-winners and a guaranteed winner in a short time frame.  This means more games can be won by more people on a daily basis; we see this as an entertaining distraction with an educational benefit for people, win or lose and for those who win it has a positive impact while some of the surplus funds benefit unknown persons through various charities.  Even our share of the proceeds (&lt;10%) will be used in anonymous philanthropic gestures attributed to the company since it is the collective and not the individual who has made this possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Already you can see the ripple effect: firstly we contribute to the betterment of the game winner without it being to the detriment of the non-winners (remember, they only spent £1), the second beneficiary is the charitable benefit to the community in a tangible form, and the third beneficiary is the deserving soul who is helped anonymously without condition other than encouragement to help another when the opportunity presents itself. An added benefit is the new gainful employment of some unemployed people. Our motivation is to create something awesome and give back on various levels and this business does that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By ensuring the sustainability of anonymous giving, perhaps we create a movement that will be joined by other businesses in establishing a more giving and compassionate world.  Prove the viability of this concept and we will have built a legacy that may outlast us all as it continues to be self-perpetuating and offers the chance of support to anyone who needs a little help along the way.</p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>
<p>We are three individuals and an advisor with a common interest in business and philanthropy and a desire to incorporate the two into a viable and sustainable enterprise.  We three have used our own disposable resources and contributed £30,000 to buy the hardware and software necessary to run this venture.  Now we need to raise funds for the marketing budget of £25,000; subject to achieving this goal, our bank will provide us with a debt loan of £30,000 and a private third party will make up the last £30,000 to cover our operating costs for the first quarter and complete the £115,000 budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our experienced business leader will take a full time role while the rest of the team will dedicate time and effort in a support role using their proven expertise.  We will employ new hires; contribute to the infrastructure of the community by renting office space and using utilities and amenities; pay taxes; fund small bona fide charities with direct tangible benefits and make important contributions to new entrants on a daily basis.  In order for this to be a reality, we need your support and in return for your support you will receive self-satisfaction plus a range of really interesting perks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a philosopher by nature and a businessman by vocation, I believe we can deliver everything we’ve shared with you. Your contribution is going to help us build a better tomorrow, but the benefit to you of your pledge is priceless; change lives for the better.  Thank you for your support and contribution; together we will multiply our reach by dividing the cost amongst us so that many, contributing little, can allow the few to help many more.</p>

HOW MANY OF US GET TO REALIZE OUR DREAMS?
According to a recent study of lifelong ambitions, most of us will only ever fulfil five of our dreams. What’s on your bucket list? Which 5 will become real for you?  Would you like to help others while staying out of the limelight?  Can you imagine the impact on someone’s life by allowing them a little more happiness; a little more money; a little more freedom; a little more enjoyment?
 
My dream is to help other people to achieve more of their dreams.  A phrase attributed to a motivational speaker struck a chord with me; he said, ‘You Can Get Everything You Want In Life If You Will Just Help Enough Other People Get What They Want’.  Believe it to be true, and our goal is within reach.
 
Another beacon, is a short poem attributed to an anonymous author; it reads, ‘We Have Each Been Given A Bag Of Tools, A Formless Rock And A Book Of Rules, And Each Must Make, ‘Ere Life Has Flown, A Stumbling Block Or A Stepping Stone’. 
 
We all have a passion for something; people, places, ideals and things in life:  In small but meaningful ways, we benefit by enriching the lives of others through anonymous giving; often nothing more than doing a selfless act of kindness for a deserving fellow human being without any recognition or glory.
 
We can’t fix all of the world’s problems but what if we  believe that helping as many people as possible will cause a ripple effect, and what if those who we are able to help will pay it forward and help someone else, then maybe, in time, we will all live in a better place.  To do this, not for the recognition, but to make the world a better place by leaving a legacy of a stepping stone instead of a stumbling block. 
 
This is a request for a “helping hand”; to improve lives, by making a contribution to build an enterprise that will become self-sustaining, and capable of benefitting countless others.  Structured properly it will self-perpetuate and continue to do good.  It is a fundamental concept used by every government in the world; collect a small amount of money from the many and apportion it based on a redistribution plan. 
 
The social conscience component of this enterprise is critical to its DNA, since it is a concept built on humanity and capitalism.  We have already acted as the catalyst with a contribution of £30,000 to acquire the hardware and software; we are seeking £25,000 from the followers of Indiegogo, which will be supported with another £30,000 of bank debt financing and a final £30,000 of equity investment from a third party.  This completes the budget of £115,000 to launch the venture on solid footing.  Now that you have grasped the philosophical soul of the enterprise; let me share the mechanics and nuances of the business model with you.

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't donate, but still want to help out? There are plently of ways that you can support QANDA through your social media connections; just start spreading the word.
TO MULTIPLY YOU HAVE TO DIVIDE
Some might say that heading doesn’t make sense, but taken in context it’s a sound statement.  The Internet gives us a platform to reach much further than was possible a generation ago; allowing us to connect with far more people in an entertaining and positive manner.  Our product is a knowledge based game using a question format with multiple choice answers and a cash prize as the incentive.  QANDA  is a simple acronym for Question and Answers and is the essence of the idea behind www.qanda4cash.com[1] , a fun, educational and  entertaining online version of the popular game featured on TV, radio and printed media.  QANDA has some subtle differences; it has a charitable component; it offers small, meaningful cash prizes; it uses a low multiple to achieve its target goal.
 
Basically a player registers and pays a small fee (£1) to submit an answer chosen from the five multiple choice answers provided to the question (only one entry per player).  Example: Where is the Eiffel Tower located?  [a] London [b] Dublin [c] Paris [d] Rome [e] Cairo  A winning entry is randomly chosen from the correct entries and the prize is paid out; prize values vary from £20 to £1,000.
 
You’re familiar with this concept because it is widely used by conventional media such as TV, radio and newsprint; their approach being that people phone or text their answer in response to seeing the question in one of the aforementioned mediums.  The cost associated with them answering the question is usually £1 plus carrier charges and can run into a few pounds subject to the amount of time and levels of complexity.  The theory is that a large number of people will contribute a small fee (nominally £1-£2), which in turn funds the cost of the enterprise and the prize incentive (usually hundreds sometimes thousands of pounds).  The drawback to using Telecom providers is that they collect 60% of the fee, requiring the company to attract much greater numbers of callers to realize the goal and that goal can expand to accommodate infinite response, earning huge profits without reflecting an increase in the prize.  They make no reference as to how many people may be participating.  We introduce a new transparent paradigm by using the Internet.
 
Nowadays, general knowledge is only a click away; however even the notion of looking up the correct answer still involves the person with acquiring new information, so the game has a subtle educational aspect to it.  It is a very basic game; a level playing field equally available to one and all.  It is a simple, intuitive and informative game that poses one question and offers a choice of answers; oftentimes the answer is obvious through general common knowledge.  Prizes are not life-changing values but rather life-enhancing values.  Prizes range from £20 to £1,000; this mirrors the amounts that most people find they are short on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and unlike gambling alternatives, they only spend £1 per game (entries are limited to one per entrant).  Because the draw is made from a finite pool of real entrants, there is always a guaranteed winner and the mathematical algorithm provides for a target figure to close the game i.e. 5 times the value of the prize, for example, £100 prize would attract £500 in turnover to cover the cost of the prize and the operational costs with the remainder being allocated to charity and profit for long term sustainability. 
 
www.qanda4cash.com (functionally complete but not currently live) will host two question formats side by side and will replace them each time they are won.  Question #1 might be: Where is the Eiffel Tower located?  [a] London [b] Dublin [c] Paris [d] Rome [e] Cairo and question #2 (with a graphic component) might be: Which flag represents Canada? [a] picture of flag of Chile [b] picture of flag of India [c] picture of flag of Germany [d] picture of flag of Canada [e] picture of flag of Australia   A player simply chooses and submits their answer with credits previously purchased and valued at £1.  Using the 5x multiplier, it is easy to calculate the likelihood of a win for any one entrant i.e. £20 prize will generate £100 turnover, which equates to 100 entrants.  Because of the small number of participants required to complete a game, very quick turnaround times allow for numerous winners everyday.

<p>
</p>
<p>Hi! I’m Ahmed (alias Turupawn) and I've been developing this bullet hell engine for Ouya licensed as GPL so everybody is free to use it, study it, share it and modify it.</p>
<p>I've loved video games since I was a child, especially competitive and action games. I used to play so much and I really liked some of it that I wanted to change the mechanics, modify the story, special effects and many other things. Altough sometimes technically possible, this is illegal due to proprietary licensing applied all over the game industry. Out of annoyance I decided to make GPL games so it doesn't have this sort of issues. So that's how I set sails on my quest to make it true, first step: Learn how to code, study computer sciences at the university. Somewhere in the middle John Mackay and I crossed paths and it was awesome because we decided to teamwork out this thing, so we submitted as graduation project a GPL fighter engine which is still under development by others students of the university that are making more characters and backgrounds so we can later polish it, add gameplay and release a full game (small demo video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcbhrweTsBc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcbhrweTsBc</a> sorry for the music we recorded at a KFC t.t). We successfully got our degree, and immediately grouped up Rosalila Studio (former student group name) coding to build games for Ouya, an open console.</p>
<p>So far at Rosalila Studio we've released  a demo of the bullet hell engine we've been developing. You can already download Maximum Overkill from the Ouya market and give it try. With your help we can improve this game in many aspects and nurture the GPL game development community. Hope you like it and have fun beating the 3 difficulty levels included.</p>

Hi! I’m Ahmed (alias Turupawn) and I've been developing this bullet hell engine for Ouya licensed as GPL so everybody is free to use it, study it, share it and modify it.
I've loved video games since I was a child, especially competitive and action games. I used to play so much and I really liked some of it that I wanted to change the mechanics, modify the story, special effects and many other things. Altough sometimes technically possible, this is illegal due to proprietary licensing applied all over the game industry. Out of annoyance I decided to make GPL games so it doesn't have this sort of issues. So that's how I set sails on my quest to make it true, first step: Learn how to code, study computer sciences at the university. Somewhere in the middle John Mackay and I crossed paths and it was awesome because we decided to teamwork out this thing, so we submitted as graduation project a GPL fighter engine which is still under development by others students of the university that are making more characters and backgrounds so we can later polish it, add gameplay and release a full game (small demo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcbhrweTsBc sorry for the music we recorded at a KFC t.t). We successfully got our degree, and immediately grouped up Rosalila Studio (former student group name) coding to build games for Ouya, an open console.
So far at Rosalila Studio we've released  a demo of the bullet hell engine we've been developing. You can already download Maximum Overkill from the Ouya market and give it try. With your help we can improve this game in many aspects and nurture the GPL game development community. Hope you like it and have fun beating the 3 difficulty levels included.

Licence and distribution


This game and the engine are licensed under GPLv3. You are free to use, modify, study and distribute it. You can already download a demo from the Ouya platform and when the new content is available you may unlock it with $1 to access the updates trough the Ouya platform and you will be directly contributing to get further in Ouya's game development. If you don't feel like it because reasons, you can always sideload the.apk file or compile it from source.

<p>Launched in August of 2010, The Gaming Gang (TGG) has become a destination site for the latest news regarding tabletop gaming, video games, comic books, movies and TV, and well as review and opinion. Our main focus is on tabletop games (Miniatures, Wargames, RPGs, Board Games, Family Gaming and more!) but over the past twelve months we've expanded our coverage by bringing in contributors who tackle many other areas of crossover appeal to our audience.</p>
<p>Currently TGG features over 3000 articles, 300+ reviews, 180+ podcasts and nearly 50 videos!</p>
<p>As with most people who dig the sorts of things we do, all of the Gang have daytime jobs and responsibilities which financially prevent us from hitting every show or convention we receive invites or media credentials to attend. Even if we held the most amazing and successful project of this kind there'd still be positively no way we could make it to every event we'd like. That said, TGG was invited to report on over 30 various cons last year (large and small) and we were only able to scratch the surface of a fraction of those shows.</p>
<p>This year the requests are coming fast and furious once again!</p>
<p>That's why we've turned to Indiegogo in order to keep our website up and running (we'll use the goal funds to pay for the site hosting through the end of 2013) as well as making it out to more shows, with more correspondents and higher quality coverage. I tackled enough events all by my lonesome to know there's only so much a single person can do and even with two people, at a larger convention, so much is going on most of it flies under the radar. The best scenario is three or four individuals providing coverage because that allows us to fan out a bit while still getting plenty of audio and video of the event.</p>
<p>As with many of the conventions we'd like to bring to you, the cost to travel and stay at that location varies depending on the location; heading to Pennsylvania is one thing while jetting to Germany is something else completely. By creating the various stretch goals you'll telling us what you'd like for us to cover and what's important to you. Plus, if there's a con you're heading to, and you'd love to have TGG in attendance, this is your opportunity to ensure we're there!</p>
<p>You've probably seen other projects of this nature where the aim was to attend a single particular show for ""X"" number of dollars as the goal. Rather than take that approach we'll utilize our project to pay for the hosting of The Gaming Gang website through the rest of 2013 as well as build a convention ""warchest"" - as it were in - order to provide you with as much fun and excitement from as many events as possible!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/70318846@N04/9025357179/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""IWhy by Jeff McAleer, on Flickr""><img alt=""IWhy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3723/9025357179_823a38d3fa_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s very true my personal stance, since founding TGG in 2010, was to make the website completely self-sufficient so you’d never see donation badges on the site or hear about pledge drives on the podcasts. To this point we’ve never asked for a single dime from anyone coming to the site. Unfortunately, I recently underwent treatment for early stage cancer of the kidney and the medical expenses to this point have completely wiped out any funds which were set aside to attend conventions this Summer and Fall. Thankfully, I’m doing well and the prognosis is for a complete recovery; the toughest part of the treatment is behind me and there are no concerns about being able to attend any of the shows in which we reach funding goals to attend by myself and other gang members.</p>
<p>Also, to keep the website up and running through the remainder of 2013 will cost just over $600 so this project will also go a long way to keep the site humming along until things settle down for me as far as medical expenses. Even if we don’t reach our initial goal, whatever we raise will go a long way toward making sure The Gaming Gang doesn’t ride off into the sunset! </p>
<p>So without any further ado...</p>

<p>Simply enough $600 will cover the cost to keep The Gaming Gang website up and running through the end of 2013. This is sort of the ""mini goal"" of the project as the average monthly operating cost of the site is $100 or more. Hitting this level insures TGG stays solvent until I've got a handle on the multitude of medcal bills which have begun to arrive.</p>

<p>This is what we're aiming to achieve as the main goal of the project and everything beyond that will be icing on the cake! Unfortunately we're already going to miss out on Origins Game Fair. Yes, 2013 will be the year we DIDN'T go to Origins. *Sigh*</p>
<p>Yet there's plenty of other goodness out there and if we're able to achieve our base funding the Gang will provide coverage for...</p>

<p>Obviously, <strong>The Gaming Gang Guide to Great Game Mastering</strong> PDF (yes the title was conceived firmly tongue-in-cheek) is simply my thoughts on making any roleplaying game a memorable experience for the players in your own gaming gang and I’m sure plenty of folks won’t agree with my personal gaming style I’ve maintained over thirty years of running RPGs – GMs who simply grab some dice without any sort of gameplan in mind, and believe they craft memorable experiences, will probably despise how I run a game. Yet, I believe there are some tips which can be utilized by GMs (regardless of their experience) to ratchet up the excitement level of their games as well as provide sessions your players will remember years from now and look back on fond memories of hours of fun with their pals.</p>
<p>Of course I’m not an author nor was I looking to put together some vast treatise on the state of role playing in the 21st Century but just wanted to share some thoughts on how I normally put together games in which a lot of people seemed to enjoy.</p>

You'll even receive the hard to find 24 card bonus pack which was only available to PvsP Kickstarter backers!</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href=""http://thegaminggang.com/2013/01/unboxing-nature-of-the-beast-prairie-vs-polar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>video of what's in the box</strong></a> as well as our <a href=""http://thegaminggang.com/2013/04/the-daily-dope-from-the-gaming-gang-april-22th-2013-featuring-a-review-of-notb-prairie-vs-polar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>review</strong></a>. I have to say if you haven't checked out Nature of the Beast you really need to give it a try!</p>
<p><em>Nature of the Beast is a non-collectible card game. That means no need to buy booster packs. We give you all the cards. No rarities. Just a sweet self-contained game for two people (or four if you buy another box).</em></p>
<p><em>Race to fill your playing field by shifting your animals around. Animals’ movement is governed by differing combinations of arrows on each card, so as you play the puzzle changes!</em></p>
<p><em>Winning means playing smart to fill your field, not playing ‘whack-a-mole’ against your opponent. With each attack, you risk driving your army into the sinister region of ‘Dark Nature’. While an easy path to more power, this can lead to the destruction of your army if allowed to go too far!</em></p>
<p><em>The ONLY game where a hamster can take out her opponent’s playground with a gasoline can!  Nature of the Beast is a serious strategy game that you can actually get a couple chuckles from while playing and it won’t cost you a fortune to play.</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Mummy: The Curse</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Imagine being both dead and deathless at the same time. Imagine being cradled in the arms of death for years, sometimes decades on end, but all the while knowing that you will eventually not only arise again, but awaken to an unfamiliar world that mostly fears and hates you. Now imagine that your purpose, your entire existence, is bound within this cycle -- that you are chained to it for all eternity. You sleep, you wake, your serve your Judge's will in the lands of the living, and you return to the death-sleep once more. The ancient culture that empowered you is gone, lost to the sands of time... yet you endure.<br/><br/>In Mummy: The Curse, a Storytelling game set in the World of Darkness, you play one of these beings. Those who know they exist, from the cultists who serve them to the dark forces arrayed against them, call them the Deathless.<br/><br/>We call them mummies.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Edition</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Werewolf the Apocalypse roared into hobby games in 1992, inspiring a generation of fans to stand up and howl their defiance at a corrupted world in a battle they knew they were doomed to lose. WtA presented the Garou: creatures at once both man and wolf, and filled with a Rage against the evils that would destroy and corrupt both the natural and spirit worlds. Capable of transforming into a variety of forms and blessed with Gifts that enabled superhuman and supernatural powers, the Garou fought many foes, always knowing that in the end they would fall. But what stories would be told and what songs sang of their exploits!</em></p>
<p><em>This epic tragic story, combined with the unwavering dedication of an unparalleled fan base, is the reason this book is being published. Werewolf: The Apocalypse – 20th Anniversary Edition brings the entire World of Darkness experience full circle and will serve as the perfect anniversary milestone to celebrate two decades of gaming the epic sagas of the Garou.</em></p>

The world has gone crazy – a deadly virus has turned ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. The undead, nicknamed ""Zeds,"" are now converging on your corner of the world. You have been left to your own devices to stop them while the National Guard organizes a relief column and fights its way to you – but that could take days, or even weeks, before they arrive.</em></p>
<p><em>At the town of Farmingdale and its surrounding villages, you must coordinate its defenses. Regular citizens may emerge as heroes as you work to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, discovering and implementing a cure to this vile scourge, and preserving the area and its inhabitants as much as possible. In addition to this madness, the crazy Doctor Marteuse has been working in the underground tunnels and unleashing his uber-deadly Super Zeds, a nasty bunch of beasts that give havoc a whole new name. Bring him to justice, destroy the infectious Zeds, and save your city from peril!</em></p>
<p><em>In a game that requires the utmost test of skill and nerve, will you survive long enough? Will you be able to fight hordes of Zeds while protecting the townspeople? Test your heroics and unearth Dawn of the Zeds, a game that will keep you on your toes!</em></p>

Score some cool goodies, one of a kind rewards, or even hang with the Gang behind the scenes at your favorite con!
If you can't help fund the project please show support by liking us on Facebook and/or following TGG on Twitter.

Launched in August of 2010, The Gaming Gang (TGG) has become a destination site for the latest news regarding tabletop gaming, video games, comic books, movies and TV, and well as review and opinion. Our main focus is on tabletop games (Miniatures, Wargames, RPGs, Board Games, Family Gaming and more!) but over the past twelve months we've expanded our coverage by bringing in contributors who tackle many other areas of crossover appeal to our audience.
Currently TGG features over 3000 articles, 300+ reviews, 180+ podcasts and nearly 50 videos!
As with most people who dig the sorts of things we do, all of the Gang have daytime jobs and responsibilities which financially prevent us from hitting every show or convention we receive invites or media credentials to attend. Even if we held the most amazing and successful project of this kind there'd still be positively no way we could make it to every event we'd like. That said, TGG was invited to report on over 30 various cons last year (large and small) and we were only able to scratch the surface of a fraction of those shows.
This year the requests are coming fast and furious once again!
That's why we've turned to Indiegogo in order to keep our website up and running (we'll use the goal funds to pay for the site hosting through the end of 2013) as well as making it out to more shows, with more correspondents and higher quality coverage. I tackled enough events all by my lonesome to know there's only so much a single person can do and even with two people, at a larger convention, so much is going on most of it flies under the radar. The best scenario is three or four individuals providing coverage because that allows us to fan out a bit while still getting plenty of audio and video of the event.
As with many of the conventions we'd like to bring to you, the cost to travel and stay at that location varies depending on the location; heading to Pennsylvania is one thing while jetting to Germany is something else completely. By creating the various stretch goals you'll telling us what you'd like for us to cover and what's important to you. Plus, if there's a con you're heading to, and you'd love to have TGG in attendance, this is your opportunity to ensure we're there!
You've probably seen other projects of this nature where the aim was to attend a single particular show for ""X"" number of dollars as the goal. Rather than take that approach we'll utilize our project to pay for the hosting of The Gaming Gang website through the rest of 2013 as well as build a convention ""warchest"" - as it were in - order to provide you with as much fun and excitement from as many events as possible!

 
It’s very true my personal stance, since founding TGG in 2010, was to make the website completely self-sufficient so you’d never see donation badges on the site or hear about pledge drives on the podcasts. To this point we’ve never asked for a single dime from anyone coming to the site. Unfortunately, I recently underwent treatment for early stage cancer of the kidney and the medical expenses to this point have completely wiped out any funds which were set aside to attend conventions this Summer and Fall. Thankfully, I’m doing well and the prognosis is for a complete recovery; the toughest part of the treatment is behind me and there are no concerns about being able to attend any of the shows in which we reach funding goals to attend by myself and other gang members.
Also, to keep the website up and running through the remainder of 2013 will cost just over $600 so this project will also go a long way to keep the site humming along until things settle down for me as far as medical expenses. Even if we don’t reach our initial goal, whatever we raise will go a long way toward making sure The Gaming Gang doesn’t ride off into the sunset! 
So without any further ado...

Simply enough $600 will cover the cost to keep The Gaming Gang website up and running through the end of 2013. This is sort of the ""mini goal"" of the project as the average monthly operating cost of the site is $100 or more. Hitting this level insures TGG stays solvent until I've got a handle on the multitude of medcal bills which have begun to arrive.

This is what we're aiming to achieve as the main goal of the project and everything beyond that will be icing on the cake! Unfortunately we're already going to miss out on Origins Game Fair. Yes, 2013 will be the year we DIDN'T go to Origins. *Sigh*
Yet there's plenty of other goodness out there and if we're able to achieve our base funding the Gang will provide coverage for...
San Diego Comic-Con - July 18-21, 2013 in San Diego, CA
MaricopaCon 2013 –  Aug. 3-4, 2013 Mesa, AZ (not much of a stretch since I live here...)

Receive a personal ""Thank You"" postcard (designed by our own Dion Long) signed by Jeff and mailed directly to you as well as having your name placed on the Founder Member Roll Call.
Sorry Dion doesn't have the artwork available as of yet...


Obviously, The Gaming Gang Guide to Great Game Mastering PDF (yes the title was conceived firmly tongue-in-cheek) is simply my thoughts on making any roleplaying game a memorable experience for the players in your own gaming gang and I’m sure plenty of folks won’t agree with my personal gaming style I’ve maintained over thirty years of running RPGs – GMs who simply grab some dice without any sort of gameplan in mind, and believe they craft memorable experiences, will probably despise how I run a game. Yet, I believe there are some tips which can be utilized by GMs (regardless of their experience) to ratchet up the excitement level of their games as well as provide sessions your players will remember years from now and look back on fond memories of hours of fun with their pals.
Of course I’m not an author nor was I looking to put together some vast treatise on the state of role playing in the 21st Century but just wanted to share some thoughts on how I normally put together games in which a lot of people seemed to enjoy.
The PDF and audio book are presented as a bundle.


Get your copy of a limited edition mini-poster of the cover artwork for Victory Point Games'Dawn of the Zeds autographed by our good buddy, the title's designer Hermann Luttmann! And if you haven't played the game already, shame on you. It rocks!

Knights and Magick from long defunct Heritage USA. There was just something about the rules which were easy enough yet had extra flavor to the make battles unique and interesting.
Now I’m happy to say you can get your hands on the complete classic rule set from TGG! Although we’re talking about the original edition of K&M, the digital PDFs are bookmarked and completely searchable, making them perfect to bring along on the go with a laptop or tablet. Of course, you can put them on your phone too but I think you’d have some issues with the screen size… Higher level pledges are for the soft cover and hard cover editions.
This 197 page rules set hasn't seen the light of day since it was originally published in 1980 and we're actually working on an updated and streamlined edition of K&M for release in late 2013 - early 2014! You'll also receive all the Soldato rewards too.


Your choice of a TGG Badge Wallet or Custom Dice Bag! 
If you're a convention goer then you know sometimes those badges you get can be pretty flimsy, especially it you just pin it to your shirt, and  easily get lost. Show you're a veteran of the con scene - as well as a supporter of TGG - with your very own badge wallet! Plus, you can keep your valuables safe around your neck too! These badge wallets will only be available through this project.
Gamers love their dice bags as there's nothing worse than digging through your pockets for your tried and true lucky D20. Keep all your loaded *ahem* dependable dice on hand and easily accessable with out custom Dice Bag! As will all our custom accessories, this is only available through our project and will never be produced again.
Youll get your choice and receive the Soldato rewards as well.



Nature of the Beast Special. A strategy card game which really deserves a lot more coverage is Eye Level Entertainment's Nature of the Beast and we're able to provide you with the latest boxed edition: Prairie vs Polar signed by Eye-Level's very own Mark Anticole for a $40 pledge. You'll even receive the hard to find 24 card bonus pack which was only available to PvsP Kickstarter backers!
You can check out the video of what's in the box as well as our review. I have to say if you haven't checked out Nature of the Beast you really need to give it a try!
Nature of the Beast is a non-collectible card game. That means no need to buy booster packs. We give you all the cards. No rarities. Just a sweet self-contained game for two people (or four if you buy another box).
Race to fill your playing field by shifting your animals around. Animals’ movement is governed by differing combinations of arrows on each card, so as you play the puzzle changes!
Winning means playing smart to fill your field, not playing ‘whack-a-mole’ against your opponent. With each attack, you risk driving your army into the sinister region of ‘Dark Nature’. While an easy path to more power, this can lead to the destruction of your army if allowed to go too far!
The ONLY game where a hamster can take out her opponent’s playground with a gasoline can!  Nature of the Beast is a serious strategy game that you can actually get a couple chuckles from while playing and it won’t cost you a fortune to play.
This special reward also includes the Soldato rewards as well!


At the $40 dollar level get your choice of a TGG T-Shirt or Baseball cap. At $55 you get both! These accessories will be produced for this Indiegogo project only. Once we get near the completion of the project we'll send out the color options available for all our custom accessories.
Of course, the Soldato rewards are included too.



Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle Gen Con Special! Limited to 20 backers. The Wizards of the Coast D&D Next preview will be available at Gen Con 2013 as an exclusive con item and will be found nowhere else. That is unless you decide to back our project for $45! 
Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle is a D&D Next preview and mini-campaign comprised of four thrilling adventures designed to advance characters from 1st level to 10th level. The book also contains everything a Dungeon Master needs to run the adventures, including D&D Next game rules developed during the massive public playtest, monster statistics, spell descriptions, magic item descriptions, and background information on the coastal town of Daggerford, where the campaign is based.
If you can't make it to the show, we'll get you a copy (as well as the exclusive Gale Force 9 mini) and ship it directly from Indianapolis. Don't let this opportunity pass you by! This pledge is only available to backers in the U.S. and also includes the Soldato level of rewards as well.


World of Darkness Pack. A limited number of specials are available for the World of Darkness Pack! Only 20 available at a $45 pledge.

Mummy: The Curse
Imagine being both dead and deathless at the same time. Imagine being cradled in the arms of death for years, sometimes decades on end, but all the while knowing that you will eventually not only arise again, but awaken to an unfamiliar world that mostly fears and hates you. Now imagine that your purpose, your entire existence, is bound within this cycle -- that you are chained to it for all eternity. You sleep, you wake, your serve your Judge's will in the lands of the living, and you return to the death-sleep once more. The ancient culture that empowered you is gone, lost to the sands of time... yet you endure.In Mummy: The Curse, a Storytelling game set in the World of Darkness, you play one of these beings. Those who know they exist, from the cultists who serve them to the dark forces arrayed against them, call them the Deathless.We call them mummies.
Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Edition
Werewolf the Apocalypse roared into hobby games in 1992, inspiring a generation of fans to stand up and howl their defiance at a corrupted world in a battle they knew they were doomed to lose. WtA presented the Garou: creatures at once both man and wolf, and filled with a Rage against the evils that would destroy and corrupt both the natural and spirit worlds. Capable of transforming into a variety of forms and blessed with Gifts that enabled superhuman and supernatural powers, the Garou fought many foes, always knowing that in the end they would fall. But what stories would be told and what songs sang of their exploits!
This epic tragic story, combined with the unwavering dedication of an unparalleled fan base, is the reason this book is being published. Werewolf: The Apocalypse – 20th Anniversary Edition brings the entire World of Darkness experience full circle and will serve as the perfect anniversary milestone to celebrate two decades of gaming the epic sagas of the Garou.
The World of Darkness Pack reward also includes everything in the Soldato level as well.

Arising once again from the grave, from designer Hermann Luttmann and lavishly illustrated by Vinh Ha, arises Dawn of the Zeds Second Edition as you've never seen it before. In this States of Siege solitaire game of horror and survival, your strategies will be put to the test. The world has gone crazy – a deadly virus has turned ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. The undead, nicknamed ""Zeds,"" are now converging on your corner of the world. You have been left to your own devices to stop them while the National Guard organizes a relief column and fights its way to you – but that could take days, or even weeks, before they arrive.
At the town of Farmingdale and its surrounding villages, you must coordinate its defenses. Regular citizens may emerge as heroes as you work to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, discovering and implementing a cure to this vile scourge, and preserving the area and its inhabitants as much as possible. In addition to this madness, the crazy Doctor Marteuse has been working in the underground tunnels and unleashing his uber-deadly Super Zeds, a nasty bunch of beasts that give havoc a whole new name. Bring him to justice, destroy the infectious Zeds, and save your city from peril!
In a game that requires the utmost test of skill and nerve, will you survive long enough? Will you be able to fight hordes of Zeds while protecting the townspeople? Test your heroics and unearth Dawn of the Zeds, a game that will keep you on your toes!

<h3>What are Video Game Comics? How do they encourage kids to read?</h3>
<p>Finally a comic that rewards kids for the more they read, by giving them achievement points they can cash in to get discounts, to free prizes, such as merchandise and other video game comics!</p>
<p>And encourages them to read more with fun interactive video games within the digital comic, which changes the outcome of the story. Giving each issue multiple outcomes, adding value to comic, being able to read the comic more than once and getting more out of the story. Similar to a choose your own adventure book, but it's your performance that changes the story. Kids can have experiences unique to them and share their different comic experience with their friends who are also reading The Adventures of Shadow Cat.</p>
<p>The Adventures of Shadow Cat Video Game Comics series is ideal for both home use and designated computer time for students at schools.</p>
<p>The Adventures of Shadow Cat is a kid safe comic, but with interesting story lines that teens and adults can enjoy as well. The Adventures of Shadow Cat and the concept of Video Game Comics received a great reception at this year's Wizard World Chicago Comic Con from kids, parents, and teachers. We even had a Disney representative come up to us liking the idea.</p>
<p>Shadow Cat versions of Video Game Comics can also test reading comprehension, by the optional comprehension quiz at the end of each comic. Kids also get achievement points based on how they do on this quiz.</p>
<p>Parents frustrated that they're kids aren't reading enough and playing too many video games, and kids that don't want to read and would rather play video games, now have a happy medium!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About The Adventures of Shadow Cat series</h3>

application that allows the user to capture a plant's image, and identify that
plant in seconds. </p>
<p>We spent 3 months proving the concept, and are now ready to
develop the application!</p>
<p>Our plant identification app for mobile devices not only
identifies over 200,000 types of plants worldwide, but the data gathered by
users can be used for education, gaming, safety, gardening, landscaping and
much more.  We have a partner company
with experience creating a similar app for light bulbs, and now all we need is
help with our funding!</p>
<p><b>What has been done:</b></p>
<p>RedOrbit has developed a conceptual application capable of
classifying images of leaves. The mobile app user captures an image of a leaf
on a white background, and the application displays the most probable species
and plenty of relevant scientific information about the plant.  </p>
<p>The selected algorithm for this project is shown to be
working despite some limitations.  From
the programmers: </p>
<p>“We tested the classifier on a limited selection of leaves
images. A set of images for each species was divided into training and testing
samples. Training sample is used to generate a recognition algorithm for each
species and testing sample was passed to the classifier input. Our algorithm is
able to detect some species with 100% accuracy. So basically we are feeding
new, unknown images to the classifier and it's still able to recognize the
species by image. “</p>
<p>The initial results do not ensure absolute quality of
recognition in real-world usage, due to some limitation: </p>
<p>•  Small
sample size </p>
<p>•  Images
made with professional cameras, not with iPhone </p>
<p>•  Only good
quality images are selected </p>
<p>•  Images
are slightly preprocessed </p>
<p>•  The
species used for demonstration have different looking leaves making it easy to
classify them </p>
<p><b>Plans</b></p>
<p>Simply, creating this application will take a lot of hard
work!  </p>
<p>Creating a full-featured mobile application will require
further work. We will have to implement iOS application itself, API server,
classifying server and a web backend. API server is intended to handle requests
from mobile applications. It include all the business logic, species database,
user management etc. Classifying server is a stand-alone application with a
single responsibility – images processing and classifications. Making it a
stand-alone solution will allow us to scale the service for larger userbase in
the future. Web backend will allow administrators to manage users' data,
species data and tune classification by reviewing new images and adding them to
a training samples.</p>
<p><b>Things to keep in mind: </b></p>
<p>During the research we figured out some limitations: </p>
<p>•  A lot of
species have very similar leaves which makes it difficult to classify them
between each other. To solve this issue we plan to group such species together
and show the user a list of possible options after recognition. We can also
make use of comparing geographical data for given species and current GPS
location. </p>
<p>•  Training
and classifying images can is a CPU-heavy operation. We will probably have to
set up multiple servers and make a scalable servers</p>
<p>•  Classification
quality can be improved in many ways. There are a lot of options to try and we plan
to reserve some budget funds for research with time &amp; material</p>

experienced composite engineers, material scientists, and professional lacrosse
players.</p>
<p>      Joule Lacrosse was Co-founded by two multi-disciplinary
athletes, JJ Lee, and Jake Lynn.  Jake and JJ found that they share a
strong and unique passion for both athletic competition and manufacturing.
 By joining forces and diving into the world of Lacrosse, all the
ingredients to develop something amazing for sport were there.</p>

<p>      For the past several decades, hundreds of
millions of dollars have been spent on R&amp;D for shaft technology in other
major stick sports, such as hockey and golf. We have taken many of these design
concepts and applied them to the unique mechanics and motions of lacrosse.</p>

<h1>The Technology</h1>
<p>     Joule Lacrosse has created two innovative
and patent pending design features in the first generation of Lacrosse handles.</p>
<p>     The Oval.  The Oval was designed in
concept theory to create a more natural feel, and improved accuracy. Players
testing the prototypes have begun to validate this theory through countless hours
of game play, both Box and Field.</p>

<span>Cross-section of the Gen. 1 handle near </span><span>the base of the shaft</span>
</blockquote><p></p>
<p>      The second key design feature is extremely
innovative, having an adaptive or non-uniform internal hollow core.  The
faceted sidewalls internally are tapered away until there is a section with a
smooth oval core. This section creates an area which by nature will promote
additional flex. This is our “Kick-point” by engineered design, even before any
composite materials are implemented. Brilliant!</p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/314813/files/20140117162711-Lacrosse_Adaptive_Core.png?1390004831"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote><span>Adaptive Core: An exaggerated drawing

<p>
</p><h2><b><span><br/></span></b></h2><h2><b><span>FLEX</span></b></h2>
<p>     Along with the kick-point engineered by
structural design, we have created optimized flex profiles along the length of
the shaft and at every axis orientation.</p>
<p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/314816/files/20140117162731-FEM_Flex_Measurement.png?1390004851"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote><span>FEM Model Analysis
of Flex</span></blockquote><p></p>
<p>     First, we measure how the handle flexes at
the neck with weight on the head-end simulating ball and head momentum during a
speed shot. The fulcrum (point in which the shaft pivots against when flexed)
is positioned by two stabilizing clamps which simulating the hands of where the
player typically holds the handle during a speed shot).</p>

shaft at both major and minor axis</span></blockquote><p></p>
<p>      Secondly, we measure how much the
shaft deflects along the complete profile of the handle.  You can see that
the standard aluminum/Ti (and almost all current carbon fiber shafts on the
market) design handles have even/level deflection throughout.  With our
unique patented core geometry (octagon to oval to octagon) coupled with the
unlimited design possibilities of composites fibers, we have been able to
create handles that deflect more in areas that are needed to flex, and less in
areas that should be stiff.  This creates a ""kick-point"" in the
shaft.  This kick-point will allow for more optimal energy transference
from your body to the ball during a shot or pass.  In the graph below you
can clearly see the difference in our handles, and the standard lacrosse
handles in the market today (including almost all carbon fiber, will all be a
flat-line EI curve with no kick-point).</p>

and accuracy. Making the game more about the athlete, and less about product
limitations!
                     
Who We Are
     At Joule Lacrosse we are focused on
improving the game.  We do this by pairing together the world's most
experienced composite engineers, material scientists, and professional lacrosse
players.
      Joule Lacrosse was Co-founded by two multi-disciplinary
athletes, JJ Lee, and Jake Lynn.  Jake and JJ found that they share a
strong and unique passion for both athletic competition and manufacturing.
 By joining forces and diving into the world of Lacrosse, all the
ingredients to develop something amazing for sport were there.
Co-Founders JJ Lee, and Jake Lynn @ the 2014 US Lacrosse Convention
     Our
ultimate goal is to make the game more about the athlete and his/her
capabilities, and less about how that athlete adapts to equipment limitations
in design.
Battle Tested:
Speed & Strength
The Handle
      Over the past year, we have been
developing a NEW REVOLUTIONARY DESIGN in Lacrosse shaft
technology. 
      For the past several decades, hundreds of
millions of dollars have been spent on R&D for shaft technology in other
major stick sports, such as hockey and golf. We have taken many of these design
concepts and applied them to the unique mechanics and motions of lacrosse.
      Why should the fastest growing sport in the
world be held back by sub-par equipment?  ...It shouldn't!  
This is a true game changer!
Prototypes in
manufacturing process and quality check

       Composite materials help make
the world lighter, faster, stronger, safer, and more accurate.  These
feats are not easily accomplished, it takes educated and specialized
scientists, engineers, and industry professionals to do so.  This is why
we are working side by side in partnership with one of the world's most
advanced and experienced Composite technology and manufacturing company's in
the world!

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), colloquially known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot on board. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by computers in the vehicle or under the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method or ""Pop and Stop"" of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.

our goal is to create and modify some Rc airplane jet plane and by linking the remote system                we can manage to control the planes from any were in the world.  A standard match has 6 players arranged in 3 teams each controlling there own JET fighter. Each team has a mission plan assigned to both, they must reach a destination on the map while entering a dog fight ; The first team to reach destroyed and finish  the goal wins. when reached, the goal moves to another random location.
this is multiplayer online game with real life impact and will change the way games are played through this new platform we will begin a new era in gaming. virtual reality on speed. 

unlike rocket racer this will be an unmanned vehicle rc jet that will allow every person with an adventurist spirit on earth to be a part off and have some fun. 
Each team logs on the website, and will be assigned to a chosen team and enter the race for each race another team will enter ext. 

 Players are invulnerable but when hit they will loose control of the individual jet returning to the start base. 




A typical race would take about 10 to 20 min, and other competitors and fans would be able to see multiple camera views, including cockpit, ""on-track,"" ""side-by-side"" and wing-angle views.






The operation site fly through the canyon dog fight.


What We Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:

What is THE GUN BOX?

The Gun Box keeps guns safe, and It allows gun owners to quickly access their firearms when they need them most. 


The Gun Box is built tough. It is die cast using aircraft strength aluminum alloy, which has a tensile strength of over 24,000 lbs per square inch and a melting temperature of over 1000 degrees. 
The Gun Box opens one of 2 ways. The first is a radio frequency (RF) signature in a ring or wristband which is included with every box. The second is a biometric fingerprint reader which can store multiple fingerprints. The box can also be programmed to open with a combination of both the RF signature and the fingerprint reader.
The Gun Box Premier Model has the added safety feature of alert notifications.  Notifications will be sent to your phone when the box is opened, moved, or tampered with. Using GPS technology, you will know the exact location of the box while it is moving. We’ve also added a few bonus features to the box for convenience. On the back of the Gun Box you will find 2 USB ports for charging phones and tablets or connecting other devices such as Bluetooth speakers. 
The Gun Box has a battery backup so you can unplug The Gun Box and take it with you. When you turn off the battery switch on the bottom of the box the battery will last for days. 

The Gun Box has mounting holes on the bottom of the box, it can be mounted under a cabinet on a wall, to a nightstand or in any orientation. It can also be secured using a Kensington lock and cable.

<h3>""WILL WORK FOR E3""</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Oded Sharon and I'm an independent game developer from Israel. I've made a bunch of games in my life, like Pizza Morgana and Star Shipping Inc.</p>
<p>I was in E3 in 2003  while working for Majorem who were exhibitor and i was there showing off Ballerium and haven't had a lot of time to myself there.<br/>Ever since 2003, I've wanted to go to E3 again, but couldn't find a business excuse to spend the money it costs to travel. Every year for the past 10 years, I've been telling to myself ""Next year"", and this year, again, I couldn't justify the costs.</p>
<p>So I decided I will work for it. Or rather work FOR YOU.</p>

<h1>Hi my name is Smebb <span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"">and I'm the project lead and designer for Crazy Maisys, a game in development by TwistedPlanet Interactive.</span>
</h1>
<p style=""color: #ff0051; font-weight: bold;"">Follow us to receive notifications when the prototype is available and when we post updates.

<img alt=""About the project creator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/MiiM/TitleBG_About.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""About the project creator""/><p>Many people who know me personally will know I've been passionate about games ever since I was a child. Not just computer games, but games in general. I've designed and made games since I was 4 years old. The first computer game I designed was for the ZX Spectrum which my Dad programmed for me, and the first table top game I made was a like Ludo where I made my own ""dice-popper"" with springs I took out of some action figures.</p>
<p>I've always had an idea or two floating about and even if I didn't have one, I could pluck them out of thin air. I was always thinking of creative ways to solve problems and I had a huge imagination. That imagination grew up with me.</p>
<p>I'm here to ask for support to get our studio launched and our first game developed, tested and distributed. None of our team have ever released a game commercially before, but we are confident that this game idea is something that people want to play and get involved with.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;"">Even small companies and businesses <a href=""#businesses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">will want to get involved with what we have planned!</a></span></p>
<img alt=""TwistedPlanet Interactive?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/MiiM/TitleBG_TPI.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""TwistedPlanet Interactive?""/><p>TwistedPlanet Interactive is an independent game development team that was formed by a handful of people who were very interested in gaming and the games industry back in 2010. Most of us became students in game design, programming and server operations in 2011. </p>
<p>In late 2012 we decided and started to plan on setting up our own company. The thing is, we don't have the funds to get out of our bedrooms and living rooms and into a working environment. Or at least enough funds to last until our first game is complete.</p>
<p>We want to be an independent company free from publishers and working directly with our customers, receiving feedback, and developing the kinds of games we and our customers like instead of first person shooters and ""what works"". We are aiming to develop at least 1 full game a year, at least 1 social game and projects involving small businesses.</p>
<img alt=""So what is Crazy Maisys?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/MiiM/TitleBG_Sowhat.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""So what is Crazy Maisys?""/><p>Crazy Maisys is a 3/4 top-down management role-playing game. (<a href=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/CrazyMaisys/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> play the prototype here (23Mb)</a>)</p>
<p>You play as a traveller looking for work, coming across a sign saying ""JOB VACANCY &amp; LODGINGS"". After deciding to go and enquire about the job vacancy, you come across an old lady milking (and talking to) a cow...</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There's a fair bit of humour in the game, as well as drama.</li>
<li>You have to keep  your relationship with Maisy amiable as well as running a successful farm.</li>
<li>It has a few role-playing elements in it like skills you have to work at (cooking, animal husbandry, growing crops...)</li>
<li>You have to manage the farm, and budget your costs</li>
<li>You have freedom to do what you want</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be updating the game regularly with new content for free, which will introduce new products, actions, objects and events.</p>
<p>We plan on making more games about the epic saga of Maisy Powers (the elderly lady in the game) when she was younger and the events leading up to the time Crazy Maisys is set. We want to start near the end of her life, then go back to when she was a child, then a teen, then young adult, etc back up to her elderly life. We do not have a set number of games we are going to release, but we plan on telling her whole story.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/645852/pictures/full/20130203151646-MainConceptArt.jpg?1359933411"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We're working on a <a href=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/CrazyMaisys/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prototype</a> right now for people to get an idea of the kind of game we're developing toward and how <a href=""#businesses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">small companies and businesses could be involved</a>.</p>
<img alt=""Why do we need our goal?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twistedplanet.co.uk/MiiM/TitleBG_Where.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why do we need our goal?""/><p>All of the money we raise from this will go toward the development of Crazy Maisys:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: #0066cc; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"">£540</span> is for developer and software licenses (so we can release the game on the Mac and iOS App Stores, and develop for iOS, Android and Windows 8 devices and phones)</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: #0066cc; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"">£10,200</span> Paying the artists, studio time for recording voices, music composition, audio engineer and an extra programmer, legal advice and documents, distribution and marketing and other labour costs (administration, web programming)</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: #0066cc; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"">£1,900</span> is for equipment and software (Operating Systems, low end server for live testing and web operations, the cheapest iPad and Android devices we could find, software for virtual machines for testing)</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: #0066cc; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"">£2,000</span> is for office space, bills (servers, electric, secure data storage, etc) and hiring furniture</li>
</ol>
<p>The other <span style=""color: #0066cc; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em;"">£2,000</span> is to cover IndieGogo and PayPal fees.</p>
<p>All of the other costs of development (including our own time) we will cover ourselves which includes development and our own equipment.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, our priorities will be in the order above. We really want to get the game into as many hands as possible, so mobile development and Mac compatibility is a must. Even if it takes longer for us to develop for those platforms, we still want to be able to get the game into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>We really want to develop for Linux so if we make enough we'll develop the game for that too, but that is only achievable if we make over our goal. An optional extra if you will.</p>

<h2>Businesses</h2>
<p>Businesses who would like to invest in our project could benefit from it in at least 2 possible ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could have your company logo on a banner, billboard, or on the side of a cart/wagon that appears in the game. Or you could have your product in the game like branded seeds, soda, tins of soup, invites to certain events with ""Photography services provided by &lt;YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE&gt;"" on them or whatever your product is. All of the logos, products and services will be clearly in view or readable. Examples of products and services that will be seen a lot are:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Seeds, hay/straw</li>
<li>Tools, Signs, crockery and cutlery, cooking utensils</li>
<li>Soda/pop, condiments, soup</li>
<li>Animal feed, dairy distribution, </li>
<li>Photography, transportation, animal husbandry, paving and maintenance, radio stations<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
Even if your company has a product or service not listed above, we could probably find a creative way to fit it into the game.</li>
<li>Once the game is developed, you could have your very own licensed version of our first game (Crazy Maisys) to use on your web site with Facebook integration and your own theme (instead of a farm environment, it could be an ice cream parlour, a resteraunt, or an off-roading site). Once the game is complete it's yours to do what you like with it! We'll work with your web developers to explain how to communicate with the game. <br/> All of this of course would be custom made to your business and would require consultation and extra artwork to be created (which will be costly and time consuming) but your customers would have something extra to keep them visiting your web site and sharing with their friends, which could mean more exposure for your products and services!</li>
</ol>
<p>The businesses who invest and want to get their product or service placement in Crazy Maisy will also receive several copies of the game (as mentioned above) to play and the option to play the game while it's in development so you can give us feedback or see how it's progressing. Also, the products will never get removed from the game so as time goes on and more people play and see the game, the more people will see your product!</p>
<p>Also any small businesses, entrepreneurs, communities or small companies who support us, will receive either a 50% or 33% off <strong>any</strong> of our Web Presence packages when we launch. The package details are still being written up but all of them include a domain, web site with content management system, and plugins for your industry. <br/>There will be of course packages that include Social Media integration, managed web sites, cross-promotion, Facebook Adverts, Google Adwords, Search Engine Analysis, information packs, PayPal Integration, eBay Intergration, web apps, your own custom promotional/educational game for your web site... plus much more.</p>
<p>If you own a small business or company and would like to have your product or service in Crazy Maisys but have questions, feel free to send us a message with any queries you might have before investing.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Hi my name is Smebb and I'm the project lead and designer for Crazy Maisys, a game in development by TwistedPlanet Interactive.

Follow us to receive notifications when the prototype is available and when we post updates. The link is above, or you can follow us on Facebook and Twitter.
Many people who know me personally will know I've been passionate about games ever since I was a child. Not just computer games, but games in general. I've designed and made games since I was 4 years old. The first computer game I designed was for the ZX Spectrum which my Dad programmed for me, and the first table top game I made was a like Ludo where I made my own ""dice-popper"" with springs I took out of some action figures.
I've always had an idea or two floating about and even if I didn't have one, I could pluck them out of thin air. I was always thinking of creative ways to solve problems and I had a huge imagination. That imagination grew up with me.
I'm here to ask for support to get our studio launched and our first game developed, tested and distributed. None of our team have ever released a game commercially before, but we are confident that this game idea is something that people want to play and get involved with.Even small companies and businesses will want to get involved with what we have planned!
TwistedPlanet Interactive is an independent game development team that was formed by a handful of people who were very interested in gaming and the games industry back in 2010. Most of us became students in game design, programming and server operations in 2011. 
In late 2012 we decided and started to plan on setting up our own company. The thing is, we don't have the funds to get out of our bedrooms and living rooms and into a working environment. Or at least enough funds to last until our first game is complete.
We want to be an independent company free from publishers and working directly with our customers, receiving feedback, and developing the kinds of games we and our customers like instead of first person shooters and ""what works"". We are aiming to develop at least 1 full game a year, at least 1 social game and projects involving small businesses.
Crazy Maisys is a 3/4 top-down management role-playing game. ( play the prototype here (23Mb))
You play as a traveller looking for work, coming across a sign saying ""JOB VACANCY & LODGINGS"". After deciding to go and enquire about the job vacancy, you come across an old lady milking (and talking to) a cow...

Features:

There's a fair bit of humour in the game, as well as drama.
You have to keep  your relationship with Maisy amiable as well as running a successful farm.
It has a few role-playing elements in it like skills you have to work at (cooking, animal husbandry, growing crops...)
You have to manage the farm, and budget your costs
You have freedom to do what you want

We will be updating the game regularly with new content for free, which will introduce new products, actions, objects and events.
We plan on making more games about the epic saga of Maisy Powers (the elderly lady in the game) when she was younger and the events leading up to the time Crazy Maisys is set. We want to start near the end of her life, then go back to when she was a child, then a teen, then young adult, etc back up to her elderly life. We do not have a set number of games we are going to release, but we plan on telling her whole story.

We're working on a prototype right now for people to get an idea of the kind of game we're developing toward and how small companies and businesses could be involved.
All of the money we raise from this will go toward the development of Crazy Maisys:


£540 is for developer and software licenses (so we can release the game on the Mac and iOS App Stores, and develop for iOS, Android and Windows 8 devices and phones)

£10,200 Paying the artists, studio time for recording voices, music composition, audio engineer and an extra programmer, legal advice and documents, distribution and marketing and other labour costs (administration, web programming)

£1,900 is for equipment and software (Operating Systems, low end server for live testing and web operations, the cheapest iPad and Android devices we could find, software for virtual machines for testing)

£2,000 is for office space, bills (servers, electric, secure data storage, etc) and hiring furniture

The other £2,000 is to cover IndieGogo and PayPal fees.
All of the other costs of development (including our own time) we will cover ourselves which includes development and our own equipment.
If we don't make our goal, our priorities will be in the order above. We really want to get the game into as many hands as possible, so mobile development and Mac compatibility is a must. Even if it takes longer for us to develop for those platforms, we still want to be able to get the game into as many hands as possible.
We really want to develop for Linux so if we make enough we'll develop the game for that too, but that is only achievable if we make over our goal. An optional extra if you will.

Every person who supports our project will receive a personal thank you eCard (or digital postcard) from the TwistedPlanet Interactive Team no matter how small, every little helps! If you really want to support us or just want a personal message, your Twitter/Facebook URL on the side of a wagon or on a banner in the game, then there are options for you so long as they aren't obscene or offensive.
We've decided to name the perks after ranks in a space mission aboard the SS Pervidi (StarShip Explorer), the mission being to explore TwistedPlanet and make it habitable and create an economy... in other words, helping us get our game developed and set the foundations for our company.
The perks you can receive for supporting us are as follows:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>PHOE·NIX [fee-niks]</strong><br/>""A mythical bird that never dies, the phoenix flies far ahead to the front, always scanning the landscape and distant space. It represents our capacity for vision, for collecting sensory information about our environment and the events unfolding within it. The firey bird rising from the ashes is a classic symbol of life and freedom and self-determination: nothing in this world can ever stop the phoenix. The phoenix gives us strength to carry on, and the will to succeed. The phoenix, with its great beauty, creates intense excitement and deathless inspiration.""</p>

<p>The Carolina Phoenix rose from the ashes in 2007 with 15 dedicated players and a coach who would not accept anything but their best.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I desperately am seeking your HELP! This campaign is designed by me to be a fundraiser to help Phoenix players like myself raise money to cover the cost of our player league dues. These dues are composed by many factors such as training fee, equipment, travel, lodging, and uniform costs. Consistent with IWFL requirements, anyone who makes the team pays a player training fee to the Carolina Phoenix. Many prospective players seek community and family patrons help to pay their players training fee and support the team, thus why I am reaching out to you!</p>

<h3><strong>Why a Campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>Jeklynn Heights is an indie game that started in 2010.  Our team is made up of developers from all around the world with one single goal in mind - creating innovative and fresh new games.  As of now this project has been entirely self funded, so now we are asking for your support as we start to move this game into beta testing!  We are using the Unreal Development Kit to power this game</p>
<p><img alt=""Cave Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jeklynnheights.com/images/content/media/screenshots/mushroom_cave.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cave Screenshot""/></p>
<h3><strong>What is the essence Jeklynn Heights?</strong></h3>
<p>Jeklynn Heights is a multiplayer game that incorporates a multitude of genres and themes including 1st and 3rd person combat, RPG, strategy, and adventure. The game takes place entirely at night, a time when violence and peculiarity are at their peak.</p>
<h3><strong>Gameplay:</strong></h3>
<p>The town of Jeklynn heights is separated into two sides:</p>
<p>                  <strong><em>The Slums (Poor) </em></strong>                               <em><strong>The Square (Rich)</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""Town Split"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jeklynnheights.com/images/content/gameplay/whatisjh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each team starts out on the opposite side of the map. Both teams have several unique characters you can play as throughout the duration of the match. Each character has a different attack rotation, ranged weapon, and various special abilities.<br/><br/><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Primary Objective</span></strong><br/> The goal of the game is to acquire the Orb of Egression located in the other team's base. In order to capture the orb, the teams will need a portion of their overall players channeling it based on the team size.  Successfully capturing the orb is your ticket out of this crazy town, but it comes with high risk.</p>

Capturing a Sanity Post will give the acquiring team a forward position and more sanity; a resource used to level up your character to gain special attacks. Capturing Ability Orbs will give the acquiring team a huge advantage by making various passive and active abilities accessible. Sanity Posts and Ability Orbs can be recaptured by the enemy team however, so it is crucial to defend them and brainstorm which ones would benefit your team.</p>

<h3><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></h3>
<p>As mentinoned earlier, all of the money spent on this project has been self funded.  Additional funds will help us tremendously as our focus redirects into expanding our company and our content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing/Advertising of our game once we enter beta</li>
<li>Hiring additional developers in animation, programming, artwork, customer support, design, etc.</li>
<li>Creating new characters, weapon, and other content (goes hand in hand with expanding our team size)</li>
<li>Continued development beyond beta and release.</li>
<li>Server Costs</li>

<h3><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>
<p>This project has been a labor of love and we can't wait to share it with everyone.  If you think our project looks cool, please consider a donation of any amount to help an upcoming indie game!  We are very close to entering beta - so this is a perfect opportunity to get involved with our community and support this project.  Aside from donating, spread the word about our project to friends and make sure to register on our website.</p>

My dream is to create an insanely successful game application for the iPhone/iTouch/iPad (iDevice) community.I love serving people, I love iDevices, and I’m committed to achieving my goal. By doing so I believe I will inspire others to pursue their dreams too. I’m so excited about Arcade Extravaganza because I want to use my creativity to provide the iDevice community with an incredibly fun and extremely addictive new application.</p>
<p>In March 2010, when I turned 13 years old, I was acknowledged for my online success with ItouchTechTalk.com by a very successful internet marketing guru who became my mentor. I’ve really enjoyed helping the iTouch community through my blog. Upon asking him how I could better serve the iDevice community, he responded “Create an iDevice application.” And the first thing that went through my mind was “Wow, that’s a great idea!” and I thought it would be really easy. Now that I’ve been working on this project for a little while, I’ve come to realize that it may be a simple idea; however it’s not as easy as I first thought it would be.</p>
<p>I’ve been working really hard building a team to help realize my dream. I have application developers who are waiting to begin the work and other support people. The success of our main menu artwork has been amazing and inspiring, see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Extravaganza is really cool, but we haven’t forgotten our humanitarian side either. We’ve decided to donate 10% of all Arcade Extravaganza sales to organizations who fight hunger/malnutrition. When you support our project or buy Arcade Extravaganza, you’ll also be contributing to making the world a better place to live for all.</strong></p>
<p>I’m at the point where my piggy bank is empty. I’m asking the iDevice community, to help me complete my Arcade Extravaganza application. Please donate now by clicking the “FUND MY PROJECT” button to the right. <br/><br/><strong>What is Arcade Extravaganza?</strong><br/><br/>
Arcade Extravaganza will consist of six games that you might find in an arcade or carnival. Over the last eight years or so of my life, I’ve always enjoyed the special times I spent with my family at carnivals and arcade rooms. I was unable to find an application that would give me those same great feelings, so I decided to create one.</p>
<p>We are going to begin by creating the application framework along with the first game called Stack Em Up (based on Stacker). Our research has shown there are similar games available, but don’t be fooled because our game will consist of 10 brand new creative and enhanced levels along with a prize redemption area. The remaining five games will be just as incredibly creative and enhanced as Stack Em Up. They are similar to: slam-a-winner, whistle stop, mountain ski ball/capsule craze, flaming finger, and carnival duck shoot game.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have a number one winning application among iDevice users. So we know we’ll have to create an application that blows the community away. To achieve this goal we will be focusing on quality, reliability, stability, creativity, and fun.</p>
<p>Any additional funds will be used to complete the remaining five games. Arcade Extravaganza full version owners will get the 5 additional games through free updates. We are also considering community improvements and suggestions. As a result, Arcade Extravaganza will be an iDevice community effort.<br/><br/><strong>How You Can Help</strong><br/><br/>
First and foremost, we need your gracious donation to help make Arcade Extravaganza real. Now it’s your turn. We will provide you with regular updates as we progress. Our intention is to continue development of Arcade Extravaganza for as long as needed.</p>
<p>The bottom line is we want our dream to become your dream too. Please help us to create a #1 winning application called Arcade Extravaganza. I want to make a difference in the way applications are developed. I believe if we all work together, we will build and create an iDevice application that’s never been as much fun or creative, and exhibits a more wonderful experience than what we can create together.</p>
<p>I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your help in making the new Arcade Extravaganza application. Not only am I thankful and appreciative for your support, but I’m at your service too. I will create Arcade Extravaganza resulting in an application that we will love and enjoy for years to come. I’m in the business of serving the iDevice community for life. Go to the right side of the page and help fund our cause now. You’ll be glad you did, I promise. <br/><br/><strong>Please spread the word to all you friends and co-workers, on all your social networks, at your iTouch/iPhone/iPad groups, and church gatherings.

USD was the most cost effective option for us.</p><p><i><strong>Q: If I order a toy, what will I get in the box?</strong></i></p><p>A: You will receive a construction toy and a story book to go with it.</p><p><i><strong>Q: What is the age group for the first toy?</strong></i></p><p>A: This toy is ideally suited to children from 4 to 9 years of age. We recommend an upper age limit of 12 years.</p><p><i><strong>Q: What is the cost for shipping?</strong></i></p><p>A: Shipping anywhere in South Africa is free. International orders will have an additional shipping fee, which will automatically be added to your cart at checkout. For international orders, we have opted for Airmail as it is the most effective method. You are welcome to request Surface Mail, but please be advised that Surface Mail will take 8 to 12 weeks AFTER we have shipped (sometimes longer from our experience).</p><p><strong><i>Q: How long will it be before I receive my order?</i></strong></p><p>A: We plan to start shipping all toy orders towards the end of March, 2017, InshaAllah. This delay is largely due to the manufacture of tooling. The tooling manufacturer is awaiting go-ahead. The sooner I give them the go ahead - the sooner we start shipping. Toys will be shipped on a first-come-first-served basis. Approximate shipping time for local (South African) orders is 5-7 business days and 14-20 business days for international orders.</p><p><i><strong>Q: Do you have any Islamic Qualifications?</strong></i></p><p>A: I, along with my team members have all been through an Islamic Education System of some form. We have seen first-hand where the system can be improved as we have noticed a major gap in Qur'aanic education. By the grace of Almighty Allah, Ahmed and I have completed the memorization of the Qur’aan, but I am merely a student in Arabic. We are constantly learning and we hope to, one day, recruit creatives who are as enthusiastic as ourselves. As a company, we will always strive to maintain a corporate culture of continuous learning, especially in Qur’aanic Studies.</p><p><i><strong>Q: What will the funds be used for?</strong></i></p><p>A: This chart gives you an overview of how the funds will be spent.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477838535/hikmstaebyanw2uqtevl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Note: We have excluded costs related to development, marketing, administration as well as a trip to commission tooling at the manufacturer in China (this is necessary, in order to provide you with a quality product).</i></p><p><i><strong>Q: What toy was used in the video?</strong></i></p><p>A: At the moment, we have a working prototype, which has been 3D printed (yes, we see the irony) and performs core functions. We have put this prototype through extensive product testing. It differs from the finished product in terms of material (the prototype is resin based while the actual toy will be manufactured from a high quality, durable plastic). The colour of the finished product will also differ from the model shown in the video.</p><p><i><strong>Q: Where will the toy and book be manufactured, and by whom?</strong></i></p><p>A: We will try our utmost to use local manufacturers, where preference has been given to Muslims. Although expensive, I believe that local manufacture is the better option, which will allow me to closely monitor quality. The tooling for the plastic components, however, will be manufactured in China, which I will personally commission before it departs from the factory. We have partnered with an exceptional, local, plastic products manufacturer, with over 31 years of manufacturing experience. I will personally oversee the manufacture and ensure that the toys are shipped as soon as reasonably possible, with the highest quality standards. </p><p><i><strong>Q: What happens if you do not reach your funding goal?</strong></i></p><p>A: We have opted for Fixed Funding, which is an all-or-nothing funding model. This means that if we do not reach the goal amount before our time runs out, you will receive a full refund from Indiegogo and this campaign will not go ahead. So please help spread the word!</p></div>","The CompanyBinaye is a toy company, based in Durban, South Africa, focused on providing kids with a holistic learning experience.

The TeamFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Q: What does ""Binaye"" mean?A: It is a derivation of the 3-letter Arabic verb ""to build"".Q: Why are you raising funds in USD?A: Unfortunately, at this stage, Indiegogo only allows you to raise funds in USD, GBP, CAD, AUD or EUR. USD was the most cost effective option for us.Q: If I order a toy, what will I get in the box?A: You will receive a construction toy and a story book to go with it.Q: What is the age group for the first toy?A: This toy is ideally suited to children from 4 to 9 years of age. We recommend an upper age limit of 12 years.Q: What is the cost for shipping?A: Shipping anywhere in South Africa is free. International orders will have an additional shipping fee, which will automatically be added to your cart at checkout. For international orders, we have opted for Airmail as it is the most effective method. You are welcome to request Surface Mail, but please be advised that Surface Mail will take 8 to 12 weeks AFTER we have shipped (sometimes longer from our experience).Q: How long will it be before I receive my order?A: We plan to start shipping all toy orders towards the end of March, 2017, InshaAllah. This delay is largely due to the manufacture of tooling. The tooling manufacturer is awaiting go-ahead. The sooner I give them the go ahead - the sooner we start shipping. Toys will be shipped on a first-come-first-served basis. Approximate shipping time for local (South African) orders is 5-7 business days and 14-20 business days for international orders.Q: Do you have any Islamic Qualifications?A: I, along with my team members have all been through an Islamic Education System of some form. We have seen first-hand where the system can be improved as we have noticed a major gap in Qur'aanic education. By the grace of Almighty Allah, Ahmed and I have completed the memorization of the Qur’aan, but I am merely a student in Arabic. We are constantly learning and we hope to, one day, recruit creatives who are as enthusiastic as ourselves. As a company, we will always strive to maintain a corporate culture of continuous learning, especially in Qur’aanic Studies.Q: What will the funds be used for?A: This chart gives you an overview of how the funds will be spent.Note: We have excluded costs related to development, marketing, administration as well as a trip to commission tooling at the manufacturer in China (this is necessary, in order to provide you with a quality product).Q: What toy was used in the video?A: At the moment, we have a working prototype, which has been 3D printed (yes, we see the irony) and performs core functions. We have put this prototype through extensive product testing. It differs from the finished product in terms of material (the prototype is resin based while the actual toy will be manufactured from a high quality, durable plastic). The colour of the finished product will also differ from the model shown in the video.Q: Where will the toy and book be manufactured, and by whom?A: We will try our utmost to use local manufacturers, where preference has been given to Muslims. Although expensive, I believe that local manufacture is the better option, which will allow me to closely monitor quality. The tooling for the plastic components, however, will be manufactured in China, which I will personally commission before it departs from the factory. We have partnered with an exceptional, local, plastic products manufacturer, with over 31 years of manufacturing experience. I will personally oversee the manufacture and ensure that the toys are shipped as soon as reasonably possible, with the highest quality standards. Q: What happens if you do not reach your funding goal?A: We have opted for Fixed Funding, which is an all-or-nothing funding model. This means that if we do not reach the goal amount before our time runs out, you will receive a full refund from Indiegogo and this campaign will not go ahead. So please help spread the word!",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

I've made a few mildly successful games online in my spare time, such as <a href=""http://joezeng.github.io/144/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">144</a> and <a href=""http://joezeng.github.io/goomyclicker/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Goomy Clicker</a>, the latter of which has received over 360,000 hits since I created it back in October 2013.</p><p>But both of those creations have in common the fact that they're both clearly derived from other, already-popular works - 144 is a spinoff of 2048, and Goomy Clicker is a spinoff of Cookie Clicker involving a Pokémon.</p><p>Pushe is the first original work that I've put out to the public.</p><p> </p><h3>Why I'm raising funds</h3><p>I won't lie, this game took quite a while to polish up a demo for.

Putting this proposal out there to see how many people would help crowdfund a mobile version of this game is an awesome way to gauge interest and see if people are interested enough in playing it for a revenue stream to exist.</p><p> </p><h3>What the app will have</h3><p>You may be wondering what the mobile app would have to make it better than the version I've posted online as a demo.<br/><br/>The app will have the 5 animals you see in the demo as defaults, plus 20 unlockable animals. (As a bonus, four of those unlockables will appear in the top image of this Indiegogo campaign as time goes on.)<br/><br/>It will have three modes of play:</p><ul>
<li>Classic Mode: clear as many rows as you can in 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Arcade Mode: the more rows you clear, the more time you get.</li>
<li>Endless Mode: just shift animals and clear rows. The game never ends.</li>
</ul><p><br/>It will have two levels of difficulty - four columns and five columns - in case you want to make the game a little easier by playing with one less column.</p><p>It will have a high scores table, as well as a global scoreboard to compare your scores to other players.</p><p> </p><h3>Goals</h3><p>The $2,000 I'm asking for in this campaign is bare-minimum funds for a basic, ad-supported Android version (although all funders will get an ad-free version as thanks). Supposing you managed to collectively raise more than that, here's what I'd use it towards.<br/> </p><ul><li>If you raise at least <b>$5,000</b>, then I will also make an iOS version of this game. The extra $3,000 will go towards buying an iOS development system and toolkit and an Apple developer license, as well as the extra work that it would take to make that iOS version.</li></ul><ul><li>If you raise at least <b>$8,000</b>, I will make the game entirely ad-free for everybody, and convert the perk of an ad-free version into the perk of a special funder-only edition with bonus material.</li></ul><ul><li>If you somehow manage to raise more than that, I will make more stuff up as stretch goals.</li></ul><p>Also, for every <b>$200</b> you raise past the initial goal, I will put one more unlockable animal into the game.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks, Challenges, and Contingency Plans</h3><p>Originally I wanted to do this campaign as all-or-nothing funding. So that if the first goal of $2,000 wasn't met, nobody would be charged anything.</p><p>But the fact that fixed funding on requires people to commit through PayPal was enough to make me choose the flex funding campaign instead. Supposing that this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal, here's what I would use the funds toward that were raised:</p><ul><li>Improving the web game. Right now the game is a completed but tiny demo of what I have envisioned for the mobile app.</li></ul><ul><li>Starting other, better games. Pushe is my first serious venture into crowdfunding and commercial game development, and I'd like to work on more of these games in the future, potentially even in teams with other people.</li></ul><ul><li>Building the mobile app more slowly. I'd have to work on it in my spare time only, which, for anyone who's done game development before knows, takes a very long time to accomplish.</li></ul></div>","Pushe (pronounced push) is a very simple game.

Putting this proposal out there to see how many people would help crowdfund a mobile version of this game is an awesome way to gauge interest and see if people are interested enough in playing it for a revenue stream to exist. What the app will haveYou may be wondering what the mobile app would have to make it better than the version I've posted online as a demo.The app will have the 5 animals you see in the demo as defaults, plus 20 unlockable animals. (As a bonus, four of those unlockables will appear in the top image of this Indiegogo campaign as time goes on.)It will have three modes of play:
Classic Mode: clear as many rows as you can in 90 seconds.
Arcade Mode: the more rows you clear, the more time you get.
Endless Mode: just shift animals and clear rows. The game never ends.
It will have two levels of difficulty - four columns and five columns - in case you want to make the game a little easier by playing with one less column.It will have a high scores table, as well as a global scoreboard to compare your scores to other players. GoalsThe $2,000 I'm asking for in this campaign is bare-minimum funds for a basic, ad-supported Android version (although all funders will get an ad-free version as thanks). Supposing you managed to collectively raise more than that, here's what I'd use it towards. If you raise at least $5,000, then I will also make an iOS version of this game. The extra $3,000 will go towards buying an iOS development system and toolkit and an Apple developer license, as well as the extra work that it would take to make that iOS version.If you raise at least $8,000, I will make the game entirely ad-free for everybody, and convert the perk of an ad-free version into the perk of a special funder-only edition with bonus material.If you somehow manage to raise more than that, I will make more stuff up as stretch goals.Also, for every $200 you raise past the initial goal, I will put one more unlockable animal into the game. Risks, Challenges, and Contingency PlansOriginally I wanted to do this campaign as all-or-nothing funding. So that if the first goal of $2,000 wasn't met, nobody would be charged anything.But the fact that fixed funding on requires people to commit through PayPal was enough to make me choose the flex funding campaign instead. Supposing that this campaign doesn't reach its funding goal, here's what I would use the funds toward that were raised:Improving the web game. Right now the game is a completed but tiny demo of what I have envisioned for the mobile app.Starting other, better games. Pushe is my first serious venture into crowdfunding and commercial game development, and I'd like to work on more of these games in the future, potentially even in teams with other people.Building the mobile app more slowly. I'd have to work on it in my spare time only, which, for anyone who's done game development before knows, takes a very long time to accomplish.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>WHAT THIS IS...</strong><br/><br/>In the spirit of “Grim Fandango” and ""Discworld Noir"", but with the classic look of golden era point and clicks such as “The Secret of Monkey Island”, “The Big Sheep” is a dark, twisting murder mystery conspiracy story based on the idea that all nursery rhymes are fractured, confused accounts of events in the same twisted story. It will provide a treat for fans of old school adventures and mystery lovers alike.<br/><br/>The Big Sheep was a concept created from a love of point and click adventure games, folklore, and classic hardboiled noir detective stories and films. It recasts Bo Peep as Bo the Peeper, and teases out the dark edges of these beloved childhood poems by pairing them with the shadowy overtones of the noir genre.</p>

<p>The player takes the role of Bo the Peeper, private detective and one of few surviving believers in justice in a town gone bad. What seems like a  straightforward case for her leads to clashing heads with Duke York, the chief of The Town's police force, and the Jacks, a sinister mafia-type organisation that seems to be running The Town from beneath. As Bo gets entrenched deeper and deper in the swirling, bloody pot of mysteries, can she get out alive? Maybe you can even help her solve the mystery that is still closest to her heart - Where HAS her sheep gone?</p>
<p><br/>The game will feature over thirty unique and painstakingly drawn interactive rooms, a huge cast of characters, and a complex, involving mystery that will keep you guessing and gasping up to the very end.</p>

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE...</strong></p>
<p>We are a dedicated two person creative team based in England UK consisting of Davy and Kimberleigh Malay. Davy is an artist from the North of England whose work includes comics and point and click adventure games. His large scale installation piece “This is only this” was recently displayed at the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Arts. He is working as main writer and background artist on “The Big Sheep”. He has been active in the indie adventure game scene for more than a decade, and his previous adventure games include “The Day That Nothing Happened” and the forthcoming “Teardrop”.  <br/>Kimberleigh is a folklorist from Michigan USA who gives the project a strong backbone of support; editing, voice acting, play testing, and giving the occasional hand with coding, animating, or concept art.  </p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>THE IMPACT...</strong><br/><br/>By funding “The Big Sheep”, you are allowing us the opportunity to work full time on this project, giving us the chance to fully devote our energies toward creating the most polished and most professional game we can. With this money, we will also be able to employ an animator to take some of the load of the graphics work from Davy, and to pay for the moody, bluesy noir soundtrack that Bo's world deserves. It will also allow us to hire actors to fully voice the game, and feed and support ourselves while we work on it. We have already poured countless hours into this project, and would love to be able to work on it full time on this project, and with this funding, we can do so. With full funding, we aim to have the game completed by the new year.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bowlofserial.net/OtherImages/TheBigDesktopsmall.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Donating also gives you the chance to receive the incentives packages detailed in the sidebar. Higher levels of donation come with more exciting perks, including the opportunity for yourself or a friend to have a character in the game based on their likeness, or even provide a voice for a character.   </p>
<p>If we don’t make goal: The people who donated will still get their incentives, and we will still make the game, but it may take longer to be finished for release, and the overall polish of the finished game probably won’t be as high. <br/>If we make goal: The game will get made, hopefully finished for release by coming new year, with voice acting, music, and an offbeat noir story. <br/>    If we make 5k: The game release will include special features. <br/>    If we make more than that: MockPuppet games will be able to fund other game projects we have planned. <br/><br/>If we exceed our goal the game will have more special features and over all polish. Depending how much more, we may also have the opportunity to launch other projects.<br/><br/>You can also lend your support to this project by sharing it with your friends and helping us reach a wider audience. We’re grateful for everyone’s enthusiasm and encouragement!<br/><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>""Coco"" is a puzzle style game based on the mazes´s classical video games, with a funny cartoon graphic style that remind us to video games like Pacman.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You play Coco, a young spirit trapped on his fears, your mission is guiding to Coco to find the gate towards the freedom. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">But take care, many dangers will await you: different types of enemies, transporters, secret doors, sliding blocks... </span></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Reach the exit and escape!</b></span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The origin of ""Coco"" game comes from an amateur free video game created by Raúl Hernández, you can find further information on our website (and even download the old version). Because of this reason we also call the game ""Coco returns"".</p>
<p>We have evolved this old version with new great features:</p>

<h3>Where are all the great games?</h3>
<p>Hi there, my name is Xanther Logan and I'm here to ask for your help in getting my first game app financed so that I can create even more great and exciting game apps. Iâ€™ve got a number of really fun apps planned, but such is life, I just donâ€™t have enough capital to get the ball rolling. I can get the designs done for the first app, but actual coding costs a bit and I just donâ€™t quite have the funds for it :(</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm like you. I want to know where my money goes if I give it to someone or some cause. It's only natural. Without going into too much detail I can tell you that by helping to get my app created, you will have helped start something great and fun. Once this first app is created, the revenue from it will allow me to develop the rest of the games I have planned.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm not asking for a lot because, frankly I don't need a lot. I've got most of the funding myself through savings but I need just that little bit extra to get everything rolling. I'm needing $5000.00 and all of this will be going towards paying a fantastic team of designers and developers to create my first mobile game app for IOS and Android. If I don't get all of the funding, I'll have to skip the Android development initially until the IOS app brings in revenue and then I will get the app ported to Android devices once I have the funds for it. Both myself and the developers are excited about these projects, and I personally can't wait to see people enjoying my first app...</p>
<p><br/></p>The first app we're making is a bit of a mixture of genres from old school games that I know everyone will enjoy. Think Super Mario Brothers meets Crash Bandicoot meets Street Fighter. This is going to be a truly epic game that has a really cool, cartoonish design similar to that you see in the Halfbrick games and Angry Birds. For every $5 donated, I will ensure that you get a free copy of not only this app gifted to you for you to enjoy but every app I do this year (there are currently half a dozen planned and more to come â€“ each will be $0.99/Â£0.69 per download.) and for every $10 donated, I will gift this first app to you and all of your friends (plus you'll still get every app I do this year free too!)<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to help me out financially, that's ok. I know times are tough. But if you can't lend a buck, please could you tell everyone you know about my campaign as maybe they can provide some funding or know someone who can. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and hopefully this will be the start of something really amazing. </p>

You can see who we are at the very bottom of the campaign page. If you wish to contact us, you can easily do so on facebook. Check out our website: <a href=""http://www.operationsand.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.operationsand.com.</a> Our email and facebook are referenced there.</p><p>The core team of Operation SAND goes way back, we have been good friends since school times. In the past we never had the possibility to work on a project that we really loved, without any constraints. Our talent got wasted, because in the field of graphics and programming people often want the cheapest possible solution. So we were making money, but never felt like a project pushed our limits or was really something to be proud of. With crowdfunding becoming more popular, we decided to take our chances with it - being our own client and setting our own quality standards.</p><p>With such an ambitious project we can't expect to be able to finish it alone. Ideally, several people should be working on the game full-time, for at least a year. Every developer deserves a decent wage for their talent, time and commitment, so our goal is set quite high. Anyone who will work on our team later, will benefit from it. We need more people on our team and this is the reason, why our campaign exists. Our funding target is ambitious, but we also feel its fair. Help us reach it and remember: every bit counts, we can work with much less than the 100%.

Now there are only two sides that can claim total world dominance – the Atlantic Federation and Eurasian Union. The AF consists of all of North America, together with most parts of western Europe. The EU, at it's core, is a fusion between Russia and China, together with all the Arabic countries and Turkey.</p><p>The catalyst for this conflict is not a desire for world dominance, but a very simple fact – the natural resources of our planet are almost exhausted and cannot support the existence of both global political powers. Operation SAND is an initiative of the AF. It's main objective is to conquer the last remaining natural resources, mainly oil, somewhere in the middle East. The last war of humanity thus begins.</p><p>Atlantic Federation and Eurasian Union are very different when it comes to their military. Both sides have a large number of different units and a variety of special super-weapons.</p><p><a href=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/797360/files/20140819015634-7-____1_1920_1080____.jpg?1408438594"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/797360/files/20140819015634-7-____1_1920_1080____.jpg?1408438594"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 id="""">Information about the factions</h3><p><br/><b>The Atlantic Federation:</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul>
<li>Powerful, modern army that utilizes robotized units heavily.</li>
<li>Units have no fear, their accuracy and speed range from very good to outstanding.</li>
<li>Production cost per unit is relatively high, production time is long.</li>
<li>Units are limited with low reserves, but if AF succeed in capturing resources and factories, they can build more.</li>

<li>The troops are based on much older technology and lack the firepower of AF units.</li>
<li>Main objective is the protection of oilfields and mines.</li>
<li>Tanks and airplanes are not robotized and often use outdated technology. Everything has to be repaired often.</li>
<li>Thanks to more generous resources behind the lines, units are mass produced there and delivered by plane almost instantly.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><b>Overall:</b></p><p> </p><p>AF has more powerful, modern weapons and units. In comparison, the Union has less firepower, their armor is lighter and accuracy and speed are subpar.

It will feature massive maps for up to 8 players (4v4 or variants of) and whilst the main focus is on multiplayer, the events in the game will follow an engaging story. We plan to have a singleplayer campaign, but the extent to which that is achieved depends on the funds we raise!</p><p>Every game session will provide a certain degree of randomness, so that the outcome is always difficult to predict. The main objective – survival, demanding the destruction of enemy forces – is impossible to achieve without the secondary objective – building and/or protecting the base, mining for resources and maintaining a steady energy supply for your buildings. A very important task is the placement of mines, oil rigs and traps on the battlefield. This makes sure that even repeat battles between the same armies on the same map will be different every time.</p><p><a href=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/797379/files/20140819020739-10-____4_1920_1080____________.jpg?1408439259"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/797379/files/20140819020739-10-____4_1920_1080____________.jpg?1408439259"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><br/><b>Gameplay Features:</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><ul>

<p> </p>
<p>Absolutely massive maps that have resources distributed randomly every match and require exploration.</p>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Both sides in this war are inherently different. Changing your side means learning entirely different tactics and changing your approach to the conflict.</p></li>
<li><p>Different win conditions – while the EU will win if they just protect their resources long enough, the AF needs to capture all the resources and destroy the enemy.</p></li>
<li><p>Resources play a central role in this conflict – their scarcity is the reason this war started and their location on the map has to be taken into account while coming up with your strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>To maximise the immersion and feeling of realism, a physics engine will be used. Tanks roll back due to recoil; every unit has weight; many objects on the map are moveable (and destructible), which allows you to quickly build roadblocks or fortify a position.</p></li>
<li><p>Units can gain experience and improve combat effectiveness. Thin walls and corners can be shot through, but the units have a restricted viewing angle – once something is behind a wall it is not visible any more. Accuracy decreases with distance as well.</p></li>

Concentration is key when battling against human opponents, and with a next-gen approach to interaction and immersion, Operation SAND puts you in the hot seat of humanity’s final battle for resources, domination and survival.What is it that makes online multiplayer games so fun and enjoyable? The essential fight between factions, boiled down to a realistic, unpredictable experience, that still puts you in control of every aspect. We want to bring this same feeling of realistic tension, that binds you to the edge of your seat, to real time strategy:
Unpredictable, realistic battles at different locations.
Innovative resource management.
Each faction has unique abilities and units that trump each other.
Compelling and engaging story.
The initial planing and development phases are over, but there is still much more to do. We want to work on this project as much we can, full-time if possible, to ensure the final product lives up to our dream for it, and to produce a new breed of RTS for our supporters and all fans of the struggling genre.We are a small group of dedicated independent developers from all over the world, so in order to really bring this project to life, we need more help - your help!        What will you get Built in a modern, sophisticated engine. The game will be available in digital form only, with no DRM, initially for the PC platform. You can also buy the full soundtrack as a digital download with no DRM or copy protection. Once we’ve successfully supported and made the game, we just want people to enjoy it. There are a load more rewards, including contributing directly to the content of the game, so check out the rewards and perks and be as generous as you can!Index:

   Information about the developersOperation SAND is currently being developed by a small but dedicated and experienced team. You can see who we are at the very bottom of the campaign page. If you wish to contact us, you can easily do so on facebook. Check out our website: www.operationsand.com. Our email and facebook are referenced there.The core team of Operation SAND goes way back, we have been good friends since school times. In the past we never had the possibility to work on a project that we really loved, without any constraints. Our talent got wasted, because in the field of graphics and programming people often want the cheapest possible solution. So we were making money, but never felt like a project pushed our limits or was really something to be proud of. With crowdfunding becoming more popular, we decided to take our chances with it - being our own client and setting our own quality standards.With such an ambitious project we can't expect to be able to finish it alone. Ideally, several people should be working on the game full-time, for at least a year. Every developer deserves a decent wage for their talent, time and commitment, so our goal is set quite high. Anyone who will work on our team later, will benefit from it. We need more people on our team and this is the reason, why our campaign exists. Our funding target is ambitious, but we also feel its fair. Help us reach it and remember: every bit counts, we can work with much less than the 100%.

Listen to some of the awesome tracks he has composed so far on Soundcloud.This is just a demo of the high quality, interactive soundtrack that will get your blood rushing when playing the final game!         StoryEven though the main focus lies on multiplayer, the events in the game do follow an involving story. The war takes place in the near future, at a time when the geopolitical map of the world has been largely simplified by the forces of globalization. Now there are only two sides that can claim total world dominance – the Atlantic Federation and Eurasian Union. The AF consists of all of North America, together with most parts of western Europe. The EU, at it's core, is a fusion between Russia and China, together with all the Arabic countries and Turkey.The catalyst for this conflict is not a desire for world dominance, but a very simple fact – the natural resources of our planet are almost exhausted and cannot support the existence of both global political powers. Operation SAND is an initiative of the AF. It's main objective is to conquer the last remaining natural resources, mainly oil, somewhere in the middle East. The last war of humanity thus begins.Atlantic Federation and Eurasian Union are very different when it comes to their military. Both sides have a large number of different units and a variety of special super-weapons.   Information about the factionsThe Atlantic Federation:     
Powerful, modern army that utilizes robotized units heavily.
Units have no fear, their accuracy and speed range from very good to outstanding.
Production cost per unit is relatively high, production time is long.
Units are limited with low reserves, but if AF succeed in capturing resources and factories, they can build more.
  The Eurasian Union: 
The troops are based on much older technology and lack the firepower of AF units.
Main objective is the protection of oilfields and mines.
Tanks and airplanes are not robotized and often use outdated technology. Everything has to be repaired often.
Thanks to more generous resources behind the lines, units are mass produced there and delivered by plane almost instantly.
 Overall: AF has more powerful, modern weapons and units. In comparison, the Union has less firepower, their armor is lighter and accuracy and speed are subpar. They try to outsmart or outnumber their enemy – the EU stands almost no chance otherwise.        Gameplay plansOperation SAND will be a real-time strategy game currently targeted at PC. It will feature massive maps for up to 8 players (4v4 or variants of) and whilst the main focus is on multiplayer, the events in the game will follow an engaging story. We plan to have a singleplayer campaign, but the extent to which that is achieved depends on the funds we raise!Every game session will provide a certain degree of randomness, so that the outcome is always difficult to predict. The main objective – survival, demanding the destruction of enemy forces – is impossible to achieve without the secondary objective – building and/or protecting the base, mining for resources and maintaining a steady energy supply for your buildings. A very important task is the placement of mines, oil rigs and traps on the battlefield. This makes sure that even repeat battles between the same armies on the same map will be different every time. Gameplay Features:   
Intuitive controls leaving the screen uncluttered with confusing interface elements so gameplay can flow uninterrupted.

 
Absolutely massive maps that have resources distributed randomly every match and require exploration.
 

Both sides in this war are inherently different. Changing your side means learning entirely different tactics and changing your approach to the conflict.
Different win conditions – while the EU will win if they just protect their resources long enough, the AF needs to capture all the resources and destroy the enemy.
Resources play a central role in this conflict – their scarcity is the reason this war started and their location on the map has to be taken into account while coming up with your strategy.
To maximise the immersion and feeling of realism, a physics engine will be used. Tanks roll back due to recoil; every unit has weight; many objects on the map are moveable (and destructible), which allows you to quickly build roadblocks or fortify a position.
Units can gain experience and improve combat effectiveness. Thin walls and corners can be shot through, but the units have a restricted viewing angle – once something is behind a wall it is not visible any more. Accuracy decreases with distance as well.
      
All units have a large number of properties, motorized vehicles use up fuel and may need to recharge, everything has an armor level, all units differ in speed.
The AF needs to build their own base and start production of units, while the EU starts the game inside a fully constructed and fortified town that has to be protected, along with mines and oilfields all over the map.
Instead of building new units, EU orders them to be delivered from behind thelines, or repairs already destroyed ones.

    
Unit properties will affect each other. The closer the target, the higher the damage inflicted upon it. The higher the weight of a unit, the better the accuracy can become, because recoil is reduced.
It is very important to keep an eye on your ammo. Each unit can only carry a limited amount and it would be really risky to run out of ammo just before you invade the base of your enemy.
Units can receive significant upgrades. For example: Tanks of the AF can carry small flying drones. The drones can work wonders for map exploration and even carry a small gatling gun, or one rocket to use against units with heavier armor. 
  
In order to refuel or recharge their ammo they have to land on their mother tank (the tank's supplies are distributed between the tank itself and it's drone).
All units are accessible through a development tree. At the beginning you can only produce a limited number of unit types, but with time you can purchase updates and open up entirely new units.
Both sides have a super-weapon that can be used once per game, due to an enormous cost factor.
    
An important part of the game is maintaining a steady energy supply for your buildings, while trying to sabotage the energy supply of your enemy. When energy supply has been shut down, every building can keep working on solar power, which will reduce the functionality down to 20% (figure not final), slowing down production or research.

 
In order to get more resources, you have to build oilfields, oil rigs or mines. Not all places are equally well suited for this! Some places are worth to fight for, others are hardly worth the money you will need to start mining there.

Over the last two years, we developed a smartphone-based disaster alerting and management system for Laos. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Our partner in Laos, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), plans to deploy a pilot installation of mobile4D covering a whole province of the country. To realize that, at least two of us need to travel to Laos - to install the system, distribute hardware, and train government staff to use the software.<div>
<span><br/></span>The mobile4D system is ready to be deployed - all we need now is the money to realize travel from Germany to Laos. </div><div>
<h2>Why do we need funding?</h2>
<p>For the pilot installation, we will distribute smartphones in all the districts of a province in Laos and train government staff to use our system. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The pilot installation will be running for at least two months and will provide important insights about the use of the </span>system<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and the requirements for scaling the system up to the country level.</span></p>
<p>It is of critical importance that we can be on site in Laos to provide installation and training. </p>
<p>While the cost for hardware and running mobile4D is secured by a grant of the German Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF), the only missing link is the money for travel. This is what we are asking for:</p>

<p>This covers the minimal requirements for a successful deployment  of the system. However, if we raise more money, we could bring a third student to Laos, which would help considerably. mobile4D is a distributed system running at various different places, and every additional person will make training and deployment more effective. </p>
<h2><b>About the mobile4D System</b></h2>
<p>In case of natural disasters such as floods, draughts, and animal diseases, a fast and secure flow of information is essential to be able to cope with the situation. mobile4d is a disaster information and alerting system for Android smartphones to allow both for timely notification of affected stakeholders and easy and barrier-free crowdsourcing of disaster information on the local level. It is tightly connected into administrative and provides a bi-directional communication channel: from reporters on the ground level to the administration, and vice versa.<br/></p>
<p>Our system basically consists of three parts:<br/></p>
<ul>
<br/><li><p>An Android app which allows people in the villages to send and receive information about natural disasters in Laos.    </p></li>
<li><p>A web frontend which allows different administrative layers to send out warnings and provide further information, such as safety advice and contact information for questions.         </p></li>
<li><p>The disaster management server, which handles incoming disaster warnings and sends out notifications to the people who are affected.</p></li>

<h1>Thank You!</h1>
</div></div>","Hi, we are mobile4D, a student project at the University of Bremen in Germany. Over the last two years, we developed a smartphone-based disaster alerting and management system for Laos. Our partner in Laos, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), plans to deploy a pilot installation of mobile4D covering a whole province of the country. To realize that, at least two of us need to travel to Laos - to install the system, distribute hardware, and train government staff to use the software.
The mobile4D system is ready to be deployed - all we need now is the money to realize travel from Germany to Laos. 
Why do we need funding?
For the pilot installation, we will distribute smartphones in all the districts of a province in Laos and train government staff to use our system. The pilot installation will be running for at least two months and will provide important insights about the use of the system and the requirements for scaling the system up to the country level.
It is of critical importance that we can be on site in Laos to provide installation and training. 
While the cost for hardware and running mobile4D is secured by a grant of the German Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF), the only missing link is the money for travel. This is what we are asking for:



Description
Costs


Flight & Transport from Germany to Laos           

1,000 € / person



Health and Accident Insurance
50 € / person


Visa for Laos
25 € / person


Accommodation for two weeks 
300 € / person            


Total: 
2,750 €


plus 4% fees for Indiegogo
110 €


Funding Goal: 
2,860 €


This covers the minimal requirements for a successful deployment  of the system. However, if we raise more money, we could bring a third student to Laos, which would help considerably. mobile4D is a distributed system running at various different places, and every additional person will make training and deployment more effective. 
About the mobile4D System
In case of natural disasters such as floods, draughts, and animal diseases, a fast and secure flow of information is essential to be able to cope with the situation. mobile4d is a disaster information and alerting system for Android smartphones to allow both for timely notification of affected stakeholders and easy and barrier-free crowdsourcing of disaster information on the local level. It is tightly connected into administrative and provides a bi-directional communication channel: from reporters on the ground level to the administration, and vice versa.
Our system basically consists of three parts:

An Android app which allows people in the villages to send and receive information about natural disasters in Laos.    
A web frontend which allows different administrative layers to send out warnings and provide further information, such as safety advice and contact information for questions.         
The disaster management server, which handles incoming disaster warnings and sends out notifications to the people who are affected.


The system uses state-of-the-art technology to ensure a reliable workflow:

    barrier-free disaster reporting at local level and open for everyone

     mobile application

  enables crowdsourced communication

  allows real-time notifications

    location-based information

mobile4D has been successfully tested in a large field study in Luang Prabang, Laos, in April 2013. After another year of development, deployment of the pilot installation is also supposed to be the final stage of our student project. Please support us to bring the project to a successful finalization.

<p dir=""ltr"">My name is Kit LaHaise, and I'm a game master.  Anima: Beyond Fantasy is a thematically stunning and incredibly detailed roleplaying game released through Fantasy Flight Games.  Unfortunately, there can be a lot that needs to be kept track of, both for the players and the game master.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I'm teaming up with coder H.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>I know what a good character editor can do to help make a game easier and faster to play, so I decided to make one.  I would be grateful for anyone who would be willing to contribute to this project and see it through to completion.</span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We're asking for $500, which is about the cost of the program needed to build the GUI.  That's really all we're asking for - the cost of getting the program to build this character editor.  Anything beyond that will help to cover personal time and effort - data entry, programming, and the time we're taking away from other projects to get this done.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Having the project fully-funded will keep this at the top of our priority list and ensure the project gets completed.  If we do not meet our goal we will continue the effort at our own pace with an aim to release the project “eventually”.  Help us and help the community by making ACE possible!</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>For $25, we'll put your name into the special thanks in the program, showing our gratitude for the donation.  Every little bit helps, of course!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For $50, I'll make a character to be included with the program, made to your specifications.  It has to be a legal character, designed using the Anima game system, and can include rules from any of the English-released rulebooks.  The character will be built using the ACE generator, and a piece of original art for the character will be created and used for the character's icon. I'll be paying for this art out-of-pocket, so we're limiting this to ten people.  Of course, we'll also add you to the special thanks!  You will also be given a digital copy of the character art, independent of the editor, for personal use.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For $100, not only will you get the chance to have a personalized character included with the generator, along with a unique character portrait, you will also get original music inspired by the character!  This piece of music will be unique to your character, and sent only to you - to keep for yourself or share with anyone you wish.  This music will not be released with the editor - it will only go to those who donate at this level.  To keep this a special treat, only five people are allowed this perk.  The music will be composed by H.

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Anima: Beyond Fantasy is a wonderful blend of Final Fantasy-esque and anime-inspired themes, but character creation and creature generation can slow the action down.  The ACE generator intends to make character creation much faster and easier.

This is an excellent course for the mature believer and the spiritual “infant” alike.  I went into it thinking it might be a little too elementary for me.  It is very elementary, and yet profound.  I loved the course and plan to use it in my own discipleship ministries. – J. N.

I am over 50 years old and have been a Christian all my life.  As a layperson, I have been delighted by the depth this class has taken me to.  It’s incredible in its depth, and ability to take even mature Christians to the next level of devotion and commitment. – J. H.
The subject is compelling, the product is groundbreaking, and the results are confirmed. All that remains is to make it available to the world in an acceptable and affordable format. Your contributions will help make that possible.I was once a new Christian, and for years had to slog my way through mountains of hard-to-understand information before I was able to see the forest for the trees.  But after 12 years of higher education, forty years of ministry and thousands of hours of research and development to create The Brave New Discipleship System, I have done much of the hard work for others, making this one of the most valuable and effective Bible teaching tools available. This is not talking-head instruction.  Rather, it includes eye-popping pictures, creative visuals, graphics and effective use of on-screen text, with riveting teaching that makes a 25-minute lesson seem like 10 minutes!  It uses the latest in educational methodology to drive home truth in a groundbreaking way, and reaches the heart as well as the head. See samples in this 12-minute video.Because the material has already been created and field-tested, risk is modest.  The money is being raised simply to create the Internet presence necessary to allow those interested to know about it, and to make it affordable for an average person, as well as to make it available worldwide. If you have a heart for discipleship, for life transformation in Christ, for new believers being established, and growing Christians being strengthened in the their faith, then jump in to help.  You'll notice some of the perks we are offering for your participation.If you can help - and even if you can't - please share this opportunity with your friends… Facebook… Twitter… personal contact.   Indiegogo has share tools you can use as well.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Earth, sky, living in the times that all the residents, Synthetic filled with the greatest vitality of the times. Compared to the world now, has become very simple. That is - hunting, or hunting. In Dragons Hunter , the player can act as a hunter, and enjoy the different hunting life.continue to complete the task, access to money and equipment with a wide range of material, and to their increased level of hunters. The game system are colorful, such as: hunger, can kill monsters, access to raw meat, can the Kao Shu added that the stores do not have to go look at the boss's face . The type of task is more. Owners. Collection. Crusade. Catch. No level of the game set.'s General Naiwan degrees for the game is very good.Adding the concept of game time, players at different times will be out for different kinds of monster, the monster's activities during the day temperature than pure, and at night appear to be more ferocious monster of the main carnivorous monsters.a large number of new elements, players will bring both familiar and new hunting experience. So first let’s see some picture. Aren’t they cool?
                                  DragonsDragons are the central aspect of the Game series. Dragons are creatures in the World of Game. Many look natural, but some of them have a mythical appearance, and some of them possess mystical, supernatural, and even divine powers. Each of these Dragons have abilities that can make them pose a challenge to any hunter. Dragons provide materials, success, fame and glory as hunting them progresses the hunter through the game.
                                  Weapon Types
As for now, according to four generations accumulation , there are 6 kinds of weapon for players to choose.They are:Great Sword：It is large, slow weapons. Whilst charging an attack, Hunters are hard to knock over with low-damage monster attacks. Tachi：long, slender blades designed for elegant movements. Sword and Shield：it is very quick ,small and accompanied by a shield that allows the Hunter to block most attacks they are very quick.Dual Swords:  it is similar to Sword and Shields but with a stronger focus on .Like Sword and Shields, individual Dual Sword attacks cause a small amount of damage, but they are fast and flow easily into combos.Hammers:  it is large, heavy weapons which are capable of dealing the vast amounts of damage in a single combo. The Bow:  it is a fast, unique ranged weapon. An infinite quiver of arrows is automatically provided, although each individual doesn't do a great deal of damage.                                   ArmorMany players on the suit of armor to create and collect great interest.                                  ElementsElements are the secondary damage done by a Weapon's or a Monster's attack. Like raw damage, it is done directly. How much the Element effects a Monster or a Hunter is dependent on the monster's weaknesses, resistances, or the Hunter's equipped Armor Pieces or Armor Sets. Specific parts in a Monster's body may have differing Elemental Weaknesses and Resistances.The Elements in the game are Fire, Water, Thunder and Ice.  Fire is a common element found in nature. Many species of wyverns are imbued with it. Using Flame Sacs or other flammable materials, hunters can forge weapons with fire element, as well as armor. Water is an element that is extremely abundant in nature. Weapons and armor can be imbued with the element of water.Thunder is an element that is rarely found in nature.Ice attributed attack induces Iceblight, which causes the hunter's Stamina to be depleted rapidly while sprinting or other similar actions.                                    Status EffectsPoison:  A common status effect that causes a gradual loss of health over a period of time. Depending on the monster and the rank of the quest, the Poison can drain the health bar at a faster rate than normal. The duration of Poison can be increased, decreased, or negated altogether with an appropriate skill. Poison is indicated visually by purple bubbles emitted by the victim.
Paralys:  It is A dreaded status effect that completely immobilizes for a certain period of time, leaving the victim helpless. Upon being Paralyzed, the Hunter will fall down on their face (or remain motionless in an arched position underwater) and yellow sparks of lightning will be seen passing through their body. 

Sleep:  Some monsters have the potential to put Hunters to Sleep. It is similar to Paralysis in that it leaves the Hunter unable to do anything. However, damage taken when asleep is greatly increased and will end the status after one hit. The duration of Sleep can be increased, decreased, or negated altogether with an appropriate skill.

Stun:  Occurs when a Hunter receives many attacks in a short period of time. When Stunned/Knocked Out, movement, attacking and items are completely disabled. The visual indication is a ring of yellow stars spinning above the affected target's head. All monsters can inflict Stun by means of repeated physical attacks, but some can inflict it immediately by emitting an extremely bright flash of light, or another special technique. 


                                   Boss site damage
Some boss of specific parts, such as the head, tail or wings, can be destroyed.














                                   Life & Hunting


 Life is just like a dragon hunting , the big dragon is our aim in life, it’s also the things we want or we dream. But the way to success is long and rigor, because in our daily life, we always meet many problems, just like the small monsters which always disturb you when you are on the way to search the boss.


Now,do you want to be a brave hunter?not only in game ,but also in life, when I meet challenges, I could face them bravely. And I also want to say, Dragons Hunter is an endless game, life is an endless hunting, a hunting is over and a new one is start. Of course we sometimes fail again and again, but we can’t give up.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, and thank you for checking out my project!  My name is Becca Carr and, with your help and contributions I will open what we have termed a “barcade” – my partners and investors are opening an arcade, dance floor, and bar called The Arcade Asylum, LLC.   This arcade will be located in the downtown area of Birmingham, AL, close to where I currently live. <strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I am extremely excited to be owner and operator of The Arcade Asylum, LLC.  I feel that this is a chance to give back to the city that has helped shape me and has given me a future in a business that I love and frequent.  I want Birmingham, AL to grow and prosper its entertainment sector and one day I hope that this city will rival nearby Atlanta and New Orleans with a thriving interest in culture, history, fun, and atmosphere.  To be a part of this exciting time in Birmingham is an amazing opportunity of which I want to take full advantage.</span></p>
<p>My ultimate goal for funding is $250,000.  I will utilize grants, bank and SBA loans, investor and angel contributions, personal loans and gifts to reach this goal.  The money I make will go into start up costs for The Arcade Asylum, LLC, including but not limited to building and lease fees, employment, renovation, and inventory.  Any and all donations are welcome and even if I should not reach $250,000 immediately, I will still be able to use all funds given to further the business.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Birmingham, AL is a beautiful city, but sometimes I fear that it gears itself more to small children and families.  The Arcade Asylum, LLC is an outlet for the adults to let loose and be a kid again.  We cater to those aged 21 and up who have a love for video gaming and remember how it felt to step into the arcade on Saturday once the mall opened up and game the day away.  To keep my patrons refreshed during their time spent at The Arcade Asylum, LLC I will provide adult beverages and invite patrons to order food from nearby establishments.  When patrons tire of video gaming they can hop on the dance floor and groove to the local DJ spinning records for the masses.  I also invite patrons to lounge on the patio and engage in a rousing board game with friends.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In this economy, not everyone will be able to give financially.  That's ok!  Your moral support is much appreciated, and would you also consider spreading the word about my endeavor so that more people can share in the fun?  </p>

 Hace dos años, desde Questron [[[ http://www.questrongroup.com ]]] iniciamos un proyecto de la nada para empezar a sacar ediciones limitadas en español de las nuevas ediciones de juegos de rol clásicos. Hoy en día, ya hemos sacado una edición limitada de la edición 25 Aniversario del juego rol ""Paranoia"" [Mongoose, 2009] y actualmente, queremos hacer lo mismo con el juego de rol clásico ""Traveller"" [Mongoose, 2008]




[de la wikipedia]
""Traveller es el primer título de una serie de juegos de rol de ciencia ficción, publicada inicialmente en 1977 por Game Designers' Workshop. Originariamente se pretendía que Traveller fuera un sistema de juego para aventuras de ciencia ficción con temática genérica de space opera, de la misma forma que Dungeons & Dragons
 es un sistema para aventuras de fantasía genérica. Sin embargo, una 
ambientación denominada El Tercer Imperio fue desarrollada con la 
publicación de diversos suplementos y a partir de entonces se ha identificado con el juego, de forma que para los seguidores el nombre Traveller y Tercer Imperio son sinónimos.

Las reglas de Traveller permiten construir una sociedad del futuro lejano que extrae su inspiración de las historias de la Fundación de Isaac Asimov, Dune de Frank Herbert, Espacio conocido de Larry Niven, CoDominio de Jerry Pournelle, la Liga Polesotécnica de Poul Anderson
 y varias otras obras de literatura de ciencia ficción. Se espera que 
los personajes viajen entre sistemas estelares, luchen en batallas 
terrestres y espaciales y se involucren en la economía interestelar. Los
 personajes de Traveller se definen en menor medida por la 
necesidad de incrementar las habilidades y capacidades iniciales. En

<div><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><p>Hello All,</p>
<p>We have decided to start a bit of a contest for everybody!</p>
<p>The rules are:</p>
<p>1. You must have pledged a minimum of $5</p>
<p>2. You must use your unique indiegogo link found under the video on the main page</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>We want you to try to get as many people to this campaign as possible! This means that we will pick the person that has referred the most amount of people to our campaign and bump them up to the next highest perk pack for free as well as have a completely free downloadable copy of OBSUDO for you when it comes out.</p>
<p>Lets start referring! </p>
<p>Thank you for all your help to make this a reality!</p>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><br/></span></div>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><p></p>Summary</span></h2>
<p>OBSUDO is a multiplayer hacker game which provides you with an immersive virtual environment for which you play. This game is a perfect mix between Uplink, The Sims &amp; MMORPG game structure. Bringing together a fully simulated metropolis, with full network structure, and a built-in progression system that is actually meaningful to players.</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence (AI) of the OBSUDO servers are highly advanced and built from the ground up specifically for the game. The way we have it laid out allows for 1 000 000 completely unique, low impact NPC's with fast lookups so you feel like you are playing with real people. On top of this, the state of the art AI is so advanced that the politics and economy of the game will continue to grow and evolve despite any player activity. Yeah, that's right, OBSUDO still plays itself, even without any players online.</p>
<p>OBSUDO is a virtual world with cities, people, companies, politics, hangouts along with a full economic and political system. And what makes everything better, just like the world today, everything is hackable!</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>At this time OBSUDO will run soley on Computers but is cross platform! OBSUDO is being designed to run on Windows, Mac OSX &amp; Linux!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2>
<h3>Where the money is going</h3>
<ul>
<li>7-12%   - Indiegogo &amp; related fees</li>
<li>10%      - Perks &amp; shipping of perks</li>
<li>20%      - Game servers &amp; related services</li>
<li>58-63% - Support of staff salaries</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We have had fun developing our perk packs and hope you enjoy them just as much as we did. Our perks offer you one-of-a-kind merchandise and opportunities all directly related to OBSUDO.</p>
<p>**NOTE: Any and all customs fees are your responsibility as the receiver of the product. Also, for those pledging from outside of Canada and the U.S., shipping fees may apply to perks. </p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't end up reaching our goal we will still use funds raised for game development. Of course game development will be much slower as we will have to dedicate more of our time and resources to other jobs in order to pay our bills.</p>
<br/><h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img alt=""Stretch Goal Meter"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://hackersafe.homelinux.net/obsudo/Gauge.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>$45,000 ~ We Will Build It</h3>
<p>This is the minimum amount we require to build OBSUDO. With this amount we will build OBSUDO to a fully operational state.</p>
<h3>$50,000 ~ Custom Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the game is procedurally generated. If we raise this level of funding, we will manually go in and create custom puzzles to challenge the ambitious players and keep the game interesting.</p>
<h3>$60,000 ~ More Game Content</h3>
<p>We will develop much more ""in-game content"". This will include, but is not limited to, easter eggs, services, global companies, operating systems, hardware, software, and minigames.</p>
<h3>$75,000 ~ Graphical Mod Support</h3>
<p>Up to this point, the game is limited to what we as developers have decided the graphics should look like. If we reach this goal we will develop extra graphic options that will make the game much more immersive. We will also add the option to mod your operating system graphics with in game tools so that you can have a very personalized gaming experience.</p>
<h3>$80,000 ~ Signed Copy of Game</h3>
<p>If we reach this goal we will give everyone that donated from tier 3 ($50) or higher a promo code for the OBSUDO website. This code will, upon purchase of the downloadable copy, give you a free CD copy that has been signed by the lead developers.</p>
<h3>$100,000 ~ Single Player Mode</h3>
<p>We will develop a full single player campaign that can be played offline. This will be complete with as many features from multiplayer as are appropriate.</p>
<h3>$110,000 ~ Request Based Extras</h3>
<p>This is where the fun begins! We will take feedback from YOU and fit in as many realistic feature requests as possible to make the game more interesting and fun for you to play.</p>
<h3>$140,000 ~ Expansion Pack</h3>
<p>We have tons of ideas that just aren't economically feasible for the first version of OBSUDO if we want to get it to you in a reasonable time. At this level we will begin development on an expansion pack for OBSUDO as soon as production of the main game is completed.</p>
<h3>? ~ Overkill Development</h3>
<p>Anything over $140,000 we will use to add features, support, server improvements and anything else we can do to make OBSUDO a much more entertaining game for you to play!</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h3>STEAM</h3>
<p>Yes, we do mean the popular gaming community used by over 30 000 000 gamers worldwide. We have plans to develop into the Steam system to give you an environment that you know and love! You will be able to more easily chat with friends, get subscriptions, game vouchers etc. in the friendly and easy to use Steam environment. Due to the steam acceptance process we can't guarantee that OBSUDO will be on Steam at this time, but as game development progresses we will have a better grasp of whether it will actually be on Steam or not. We of course will keep you posted on updates about Steam and when we have it in the Steam consideration process we will need your help to get the word out so it is accepted for distribution by Steam.</p>
<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
<p>No, this is not a subscription based game! We are going to offer many opportunities in the game to add levels of immersion. One of which will be subscription packs. These subscriptions will allow for added functionality and convenience. One thing we do NOT want to do is to weigh the game in favor of those who are paying more money, so we are not adding advantages, merely conveniences. We have not fully laid out what our subscription packs will include as we will need a almost completed game in order to fully develop these packs but I have put an example of one of the features below.</p>
<p>In OBSUDO, you will obviously be able to log out of your game. The catch is that you will be able to log out in one of two ways. </p>
<p>1. Disconnect your system from the OBSUDO network leaving your computer safe from attack while you are not physically there.</p>
<p>2. Leave your system connected to the OBSUDO network allowing for programs to continue auto hacks, password decryption, contribute to your clans network etc.</p>
<p>One of the features of the subscription pack will allow you to get a warning directly to your phone via SMS (text message) or to email in the event that your OBSUDO system is under attack while you are not physically there.</p>
<p>This is just one of the many features that will be added into the subscription packs. We will release more as it comes available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>

<h2>Interested, But Don't Have the Cash?</h2>
<p>That’s okay! You can still do so much to help us out and we appreciate every bit of help you can give us.  Because of you, our dreams aren't so farfetched. Below are some awesome ways you can help us without donating money directly.</p>
<h3>Share Share Share</h3>
<p>Tell everyone you know about this campaign and ask them to do the same. You can use the Indiegogo Share tool or for your convenience we have made an easy to remember link to this campaign - <a href=""http://www.obsudo.com/indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.obsudo.com/indiegogo</a></p>
<h3>Join our affiliate program.</h3>
<p>We have an extensive affiliate program that we are very excited about! Basically, you tell people about OBSUDO and we will give you OBSUDO FREE! After you have the game you have the option of continuing to tell people about our game and getting cool stuff such as game subscriptions and more all for FREE. To learn more go to <a href=""http://www.obsudo.com/affiliate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.obsudo.com/affiliate</a></p>
<h3>Blog, Facebook &amp; Twitter</h3>
<p>Another excellent way to help us out is by sharing our game on social networking sites. This includes Facebook, Twitter, Blogspot and any other social networking sites you might be part of. If you do blogs please write a good review with a link to the campaign and the OBSUDO website. Again, we really appreciate any help you can give us. Remember, you can sign up for our affiliate program and post your affiliate link to get a little extra for yourself.</p>

<p>The <strong>Last Train</strong> is an <strong>Alternate History Survival Strategy Game</strong>, set in North America post the Atomic Bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is currently being developed by Smash Game Studios.</p>
<p>You will begin your journey on the West Coast. As one of the last few survivors of post World War II America, you will have to help and guide the remaining survivors through the catastrophe that happens during the war. You will be given rewards everytime you help someone, use the rewards gained to cook a good meal for yourself or you could offer it to one of the survivors waiting in the station. However cooking is not the only thing you will be doing,  use the items to craft different tools which you can use to scavenge items upon entering each city. Almost every object within the city will be interactive.</p>
<p>When released the game will be launching on <strong>PC and Mac on Steam</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501978844/nj529h33tfkiqlexb4wy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We love survival adventure games a lot, so we asked ourselves this pressing question, what would we want to create if we had a chance to do something crazy? The answer was what ended up being <strong>The Last Train</strong>. As huge World War history nerds we absolutely loved the idea of having an alternative timeline to what happened after the Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>The question we had in mind was <strong>WHAT IF</strong> Japan had the resources to retaliate, what could have happened? What could have happened to the lives of people going about their normal day to day lives. Would it have been the America that we know and love right now for its amazing culture and influence around the world?</p>
<p>We took a step back and started to take a route, where we wanted to focus more on the normal people rather than the Great Soldiers who fought valiantly on the battlefields. How would they go about their lives if a catastrophe of that magnitude hits them? That was the core philosophy that we wanted the game to represent. We want the game to tell you stories about how people regardless of their Gender, Sexuality and Status were affected by this catastrophe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501978927/hoaer1jquusntmfphzbj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Your objective in the game is to pick up passengers from one city and drop them off at another, however the process will not be that simple, as each passenger gives you different classes of rewards. You will have to choose your options wisely based on what you need, because at the end of the day even you are a survivor trying to make it out alive. We have over 200 different passengers, each of them have their own unique backstory, destination and reward they will be giving you. All those things have been carefully handcrafted because we didn't want to break the immersion of the game by showing a reward that is unbelievable from a person with a certain backstory.</p>
<p>During each playthrough of the story mode you will encounter about 100 of the passengers, we wanted to create more since we wanted your story to progress based on how you engage with each passenger. Different events happen in the main story based on the type of survivors you choose to help out. Are you going to be selfish and figure out a way for yourself to survive? or are you going to make sure you help as many people as you can. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>We will also be adding a Sandbox Mode which will allow you to keep helping as many people as you can before you die and be able to compete with your friends in the Online Leaderboards.</p>

<p>The project is made by 3 people, one Programmer, one Artist and one Designer/Artist. All of us with a passion for <strong>Technology, Art and History</strong>. We are using Unity 3D to develop the game. The programmer has worked on many games which have been published on Steam. We use Photoshop and Illustrator to work on the art for the game and have been working on the project full time for the last 4 months. We just need your help to get us through the final phase of development.</p>
<p><strong>We are looking to hire a sound designer and a character artist to help us with the art for the story mode.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe in what we do and truly love it.</strong></p>

<p>This Indiegogo campaign is planned to help us complete the project.

<p><strong>Which platforms will the game be available on?</strong></p>
<p>The game will be playable on PC, Mac and Linux on Steam at launch.</p>
<p><strong>What will be the system requirements for this game?</strong></p>
<p>The game already works on a whole range of mid-high range configurations. Currently i5 CPU, 4 GB Ram and not too old 1GB GPU is the actual minimum for low settings, but this may change at the time of release.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I buy the game after release?</strong></p>
<p>The game can be bought on Steam initially, but after a while we are planning to get the game up and running for the GOG and itch.io Stores as well.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be multiplayer in the game?</strong></p>
<p>When we started work on the project we wanted the game to tell numerous interesting stories than allowing the players to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be combat in the game?</strong></p>
<p>The game is intended to be a very grounded narrative experience, so combat will not be a part of the game.</p>
<p><strong>When will the game be released?</strong></p>
<p>The game will be released in Early 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an Early Access or Open Alpha?</strong></p>
<p>No, we do not intend to launch the game as an Early Access. It will be out worldwide at the same time on Steam.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a Console Version?</strong></p>
<p>Right now we are solely focussing all our efforts on the PC Version of the game. We would definitely love to work on getting the game ported to consoles as well and all you awesome people of the VITA Island, we want to get our game there more than anything :)</p>
<p><strong>Why don't you have any physical rewards for the backers?</strong></p>
<p>We believe developing the game is the most important thing. Since we are a really small team we don't want to spend our time worrying about how to sell you Cups, T shirts and other Swag. We truly believe and love the project, we want to work our tails off to make it as great as it can be.</p>

However cooking is not the only thing you will be doing,  use the items to craft different tools which you can use to scavenge items upon entering each city. Almost every object within the city will be interactive.
When released the game will be launching on PC and Mac on Steam.

We love survival adventure games a lot, so we asked ourselves this pressing question, what would we want to create if we had a chance to do something crazy? The answer was what ended up being The Last Train. As huge World War history nerds we absolutely loved the idea of having an alternative timeline to what happened after the Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The question we had in mind was WHAT IF Japan had the resources to retaliate, what could have happened? What could have happened to the lives of people going about their normal day to day lives. Would it have been the America that we know and love right now for its amazing culture and influence around the world?
We took a step back and started to take a route, where we wanted to focus more on the normal people rather than the Great Soldiers who fought valiantly on the battlefields. How would they go about their lives if a catastrophe of that magnitude hits them? That was the core philosophy that we wanted the game to represent. We want the game to tell you stories about how people regardless of their Gender, Sexuality and Status were affected by this catastrophe.

Your objective in the game is to pick up passengers from one city and drop them off at another, however the process will not be that simple, as each passenger gives you different classes of rewards. You will have to choose your options wisely based on what you need, because at the end of the day even you are a survivor trying to make it out alive. We have over 200 different passengers, each of them have their own unique backstory, destination and reward they will be giving you. All those things have been carefully handcrafted because we didn't want to break the immersion of the game by showing a reward that is unbelievable from a person with a certain backstory.
During each playthrough of the story mode you will encounter about 100 of the passengers, we wanted to create more since we wanted your story to progress based on how you engage with each passenger. Different events happen in the main story based on the type of survivors you choose to help out. Are you going to be selfish and figure out a way for yourself to survive? or are you going to make sure you help as many people as you can. The choice is yours.
We will also be adding a Sandbox Mode which will allow you to keep helping as many people as you can before you die and be able to compete with your friends in the Online Leaderboards.

PC, Mac and Linux versions of the game will be launched initially on Steam. We will later be adding it into the DRM free stores like GOG and itch.io if the funding goals are met.

The game would be first launched in English, French, German, Russian and Chinese. Others will be determined after release.

The project is made by 3 people, one Programmer, one Artist and one Designer/Artist. All of us with a passion for Technology, Art and History. We are using Unity 3D to develop the game. The programmer has worked on many games which have been published on Steam. We use Photoshop and Illustrator to work on the art for the game and have been working on the project full time for the last 4 months. We just need your help to get us through the final phase of development.
We are looking to hire a sound designer and a character artist to help us with the art for the story mode.
We believe in what we do and truly love it.

The game is in the alpha stage of development. There is a lot of work to be done, the development is progressing full steam ahead. We are working on giving the players the possible experience we can. 

This Indiegogo campaign is planned to help us complete the project. We are looking to hire a sound designer and a character artist to help us finish the sound design and the art for the passengers respectively. Apart from that we will be hiring localising services to help us translate the game to multiple languages.

Budget has been broken down keeping the 5000$ budget in mind. We will be updating it as we keep reaching our goals for the project.

Closed Alpha Version September 2017
Closed Beta Version December 2017
Final Release Early 2018

Which platforms will the game be available on?
The game will be playable on PC, Mac and Linux on Steam at launch.
What will be the system requirements for this game?
The game already works on a whole range of mid-high range configurations. Currently i5 CPU, 4 GB Ram and not too old 1GB GPU is the actual minimum for low settings, but this may change at the time of release.
Where can I buy the game after release?
The game can be bought on Steam initially, but after a while we are planning to get the game up and running for the GOG and itch.io Stores as well.
Will there be multiplayer in the game?
When we started work on the project we wanted the game to tell numerous interesting stories than allowing the players to each other.
Will there be combat in the game?
The game is intended to be a very grounded narrative experience, so combat will not be a part of the game.
When will the game be released?
The game will be released in Early 2018.
Will there be an Early Access or Open Alpha?
No, we do not intend to launch the game as an Early Access. It will be out worldwide at the same time on Steam.
Will there be a Console Version?
Right now we are solely focussing all our efforts on the PC Version of the game. We would definitely love to work on getting the game ported to consoles as well and all you awesome people of the VITA Island, we want to get our game there more than anything :)
Why don't you have any physical rewards for the backers?
We believe developing the game is the most important thing. Since we are a really small team we don't want to spend our time worrying about how to sell you Cups, T shirts and other Swag. We truly believe and love the project, we want to work our tails off to make it as great as it can be.


The biggest challenge we are facing right now is because of the size of the team.
We are a small team of 3, but we will give it our all to get the project to the finish line. We are focused on delivering the best possible experience we can to all you lovely people!

If you've come this far down the description we really thank you! You are the best and we love you. Even if you can't help us by backing it we would really appreciate it if you can get the word out to your friends and family. Thanks Again.

</h3>Player 2 will be a bar in Denver, hopefully expanding to many other cities, that has been developed to celebrate nerd culture. We've been avid nerds since early childhood, getting addicted to Donkey Kong Country and endlessly dying in Battletoads. In middle school, we even went so far as to create a pen and paper clone of D&amp;D, without knowing that D&amp;D existed.<p>We don't understand why there are so few bars that cater specifically to nerds. This makes it hard for us to find social settings in which we feel comfortable and engaged. That's where Player 2 comes in. <br/></p>
<p>Here are a few of our main objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a community that celebrates the nerd lifestyle</li>
<li>Offer a large selection of tabletop games to play</li>
<li>Prepare quality food and beverage options for all ages</li>
<li>Provide video-gaming stations</li>
<li>Host tournaments, league games and events</li>
</ul>
<p>For our first location, we feel like that there is no better place to start than downtown Denver. With a growing tech industry, and the fastest growing population of 21-35 year olds in the nation, this will be a great place to make our mark. <br/></p>
<p>With our success we will expand to multiple cities around the US, while also spurring the growth of similar businesses.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>We're asking for $50,000, but every dollar counts. This initial amount gives us the  necessary capital to acquire a small business loan for the rest of the startup costs. We are planning to bear the majority of the financial responsibility ourselves, we just need a bit of a boost to secure that loan.<br/></p>
<p>While our indiegogo funding will be used to acquire the loan, here are few examples of the costs that the money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing and Installing Equipment</li>
<li>Inventory</li>
<li>Renovations</li>
<li>Rent and Down-payment</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Interior Decoration<br/>
</li>
<li>Staffing<br/>
</li>
<li>Build a New Website</li>
</ul>
<p>If we meet or exceed our goal we can go straight to the bank and get started right away. <br/></p>
<ul> </ul>
</div><div> <h3>How Are We Different?</h3>
<p>The concept of Player 2 was developed from the beginning with nerd culture as the focus. We are not aiming to attract the sports viewers or the night clubbers, we are aiming to create a strong community for those interested in tabletop games, video games, anime, science fiction, theoretical physics, computer coding, etc. Too often these interests are banished to internet chat rooms, we aim to be the bar that welcomes it into the light. <br/></p>
<p>What makes us different than a barcade? I'm glad you asked. Barcades are often focused on the nostalgia of arcade gaming. They also lack a strong sense of socialization as most games are single player, and your friends can only hover over your shoulder awkwardly as you play. Player 2 is focused on facilitating socialization through in person multiplayer gaming. This varies from the tabletop experience, to couch co-op/ multiplayer platforming, to squad based competitive matches. We also plan to strengthen the community we build through tournaments, leagues, events, and theme nights for you to get to know all the other members of our local nerd populace.  <br/></p>
<h3>Risk Management<br/>
</h3>
<p>We have already spoken with multiple banks who are excited about the project. After working at length with them, we have found that projected profits are much higher than is standard for the industry thanks to a more diverse revenue stream. This allows us to leverage our money more effectively, as well as to expand more rapidly.<br/></p>
<p>Due to the nature of the industry, there are often unforeseen obstacles with extra costs. To deal with these costs we have a diverse revenue stream and have built a necessary cushion into startup costs. <br/></p>
<h1>

<h3></h3>
<div><h3>Why Flex Funding?</h3></div>We chose flex funding so that no matter what we raise we have something to go to the bank with to leverage a loan. If we don't quite make our $50k goal, we still want to have something to work with rather than be out of luck. We realize this is sometimes associated with scams, but are really just trying to get as much of a leg up as we can.</div><div>

</div></div>","Ever wonder what it'd be like to be 1 inch tall and take on the challenges of the world? See the world differently through much smaller eyes. Confront and eliminate pesky foes throughout your outdoor journey. SlugShot is one adventure you do not want to miss out on. This action packed 2D game includes three different game modes.
★ Adventure (Explore unknown territory while defending yourself)★ Survival (Fight off waves of bugs and try to survive)★ Strawberry Climb (Jump, climb and avoid obstacles)





http://jbern.itch.io/slugshotFunders who contribute $1 or more will receive the full version of the game once it is complete. With your help the final version will be complete within the first two weeks of September. This free demo is just the beginning of SlugShot and we are working on adding A LOT more features and levels to the game. We also love to hear new ideas from you guys and we will do our best to add it to the game.
★ A lot more levels in Adventure and Strawberry Climb mode★ Improve Survival mode, add power ups to the game★ A lot more bugs and bosses added to the game★ Improve all art and add new animations★ Multiplayer mode (co-op and vs)★ New achievement system

Building the remaining features of the game will take time and we will need money to cover our programming costs. We will need to pay licence fees to release it on certain platforms as well as pay for debugging and test tools that will ensure a high build quality to the game. It is important to us that SlugShot is the best that it can be and the people supporting it are most happy with it. Having people contribute towards this game allows us to work on it full time and advertise to tell as many people as possible about it. Every bit helps and we are always listening for new ideas to implement into the game while improving all aspects of it. Become a part of SlugShot today and check out some of our perks you will get.


 We at Divine Gaming plan to constantly keep improving and enhancing the SlugShot gaming experience. Contributing towards this project will give us time to constantly keep adding new awesome updates to the game. With your help SlugShot will be the fun and awesome game we have always dreamt of it being. By becoming a part of SlugShot we can ensure you that we will not stop until this game is finished. Can't contribute? be a part of slug shot by spreading the word around.

 This project has been fun from the start. This has been a great learning experience for us and we are always pursuing to improve our skills and knowledge. We are hoping that our creativity and love for what we do will bring as much joy as it has to us to others. We are a committed team of two and want to bring you the best we have to offer. As a gamer myself, I get all my inspiration from most of the games I played throughout my childhood. Our only obstacle is time. We can only prepare for the future, because the present moment becomes history all too quickly.




Spread the word about this project. Tell your friends, family and anyone you think might be interested. Every little bit of help is greatly appreciated, thanks again for all your support and for taking the time to check out SlugShot.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is Novare Res?</h3>
<p>The Novare Res mission team is comprised of three recent college grads who are passionately in love with Christ and His people in Jamaica.  Matt and Amy Zucco recently celebrated their one year anniversary and will be serving as a mission family with their new son Joseph.  Anna Hogan graduated from Franciscan University in May with a degree in History. Each of us has worked in Montego Bay in the past and are eager to return and begin long-term ministry there.  </p>
<p>The mission of Novare Res (<em>to make a revolution</em>) is to aid in the promotion and strengthening of faith communities in Montego Bay.  Due to the extreme poverty in most areas of Jamaica, many mission organizations will send groups there to help provide better housing, food, or medical care.  This is incredible work, but it sometimes fails to recognize that what these people are most hungry for is love.  The people we work with in Jamaica are constantly telling us how much it means to them that we sit, and talk, and pray, and eat, and just share our lives with them.  Our mission is to restore the church of Jamaica by fiercely loving each person we meet.  </p>
<p>Working in union with the bishop, we hope to accomplish our mission by providing</p>
<ul>
<li>basic physical needs</li>
<li>an evangelical presence</li>
<li>catechesis (as well as the training of catechists)</li>
<li>formation and strenghtening of faith communities</li>
<li>any task the bishop deems as an honest need for his people</li>

<p>As it was with the early Church, this mission can only succeed if we are being <em>sent.  </em>Jamaica is a third-world country and as such cannot fund any missionaries, although there is so much work to be done!  So we need your help to meet our final fundraising goals.  Our expenses are extremely limited and will cover the costs of:</p>

<div>Pour ceux qui ne nous connaîtraient pas, Alt Shift est un studio indépendant de création de jeu vidéo de Montpellier, créé par 5 jeunes joueurs passionnés en mai 2010 (on nous voit dans la vidéo ci-dessus en Français d'ailleurs!). Dans l'équipe, Vincent et Guillaume travaillaient comme ingénieurs chez UbiSoft et nous ont rejoint dès mai 2010, Julien et Fred (=moi), finissons une thèse en IA pour l'un et en social media marketing pour l'autre. François, le dernier larron, est notre premier investisseur et est interne en médecine (il nous soigne lorsque nous nous blessons en travaillant sur Besyde...).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Notre studio mène depuis le 29 février, une campagne de <strong>""crowdfunding"" (don collectif)</strong> pour financer les dernières étapes du développement du jeu Besyde, notre premier jeu massivement multijoueurs géolocalisé. Disponible sur Facebook pour la version web et bientôt sur iTunes pour la version iPhone. Besyde est un jeu « géosocial » cross-plateformes permettant de jouer dans un espace virtuel géolocalisé superposé à la réalité.</div>

<div>Grâce à la plateforme de crowdfunding Indiegogo, Alt Shift compte offrir à ses contributeurs, non seulement les traditionnels ""goodies"" (comme des posters en édition limitée, des polos, de la monnaie du jeu, voir dans la catégorie ""Perk"" ci-dessous), mais aussi un privilège très spécial : l'opportunité de nommer un arbre virtuel situé sur l'un des lieux les plus populaires de la planète, tels que la Tour Eiffel, La Statue de la Liberté, Le Colisée (voir l'exemple ci-dessous), etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Chaque contributeur pourra donc choisir parmi la liste de lieux célèbres encore disponibles. Alors, attention, premiers arrivés, premiers servis ! (La liste est disponible ci-dessous dans le paragraphe ""Elite Besyder"").</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Au total, nous avons besoin de 67000$ (50000€) pour finaliser techniquement Besyde tel que nous l’imaginions (avec de nombreux contenus, des quêtes géolocalisées partout sur la planète, les fonctionnalités sociales et communautaires, une infrastructure serveur solide et testée, etc.) et sortir une version beta ouverte entre mai et juin 2012.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>10000$ (7500€) est notre premier objectif sur Indiegogo pour arriver au lancement d’une version stable sur navigateur dès que possible mais nous espérons que vous nous soutiendrez jusqu’au but final pour que nous puissions développer toutes les fonctionnalités et les contenus intéressants que nous avions prévus pour chaque plateforme (navigateur web, smartphones et tablettes) !</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Les dons possibles vont de 1$ à 500$ (je sais, le site ne propose pas de contribution en euros... snif) mais si la crise vous a vraiment ratissé jusqu’au dernier centime, vous pouvez aussi nous aider en parlant de cette campagne autour de vous !

</div></div>","Alt Shift: Our Story
 
Alternative Shift is an independent video game studio from Montpellier (France) created by 5 young passionate gamers (you can see some of us in the video above ;). 
Vincent and Guillaume used to work as engineers at UbiSoft Montpellier, Julien and Frederic(=me) are currently finishing a PhD in artificial intelligence and social media and our last partner, François, is our first investor and house physician (so we can be healed if we get hurt working on video games ;). 

Born in May 2010, our studio is currently working on Besyde, a location-based MMO game for smartphones, tablets and web browsers. Our idea was to create, from scratch, not only a brand new universe, but also a whole new game experience, worldwide, truly immersive, using new devices such as smartphones and GPS. Here are some details about the Besyde experience:
 
 For the english speaking contributors, you can skip the next paragraph ;)
 
Un petit mot en Français pour nos contributeurs nationaux !
Pour ceux qui ne nous connaîtraient pas, Alt Shift est un studio indépendant de création de jeu vidéo de Montpellier, créé par 5 jeunes joueurs passionnés en mai 2010 (on nous voit dans la vidéo ci-dessus en Français d'ailleurs!). Dans l'équipe, Vincent et Guillaume travaillaient comme ingénieurs chez UbiSoft et nous ont rejoint dès mai 2010, Julien et Fred (=moi), finissons une thèse en IA pour l'un et en social media marketing pour l'autre. François, le dernier larron, est notre premier investisseur et est interne en médecine (il nous soigne lorsque nous nous blessons en travaillant sur Besyde...).
 
Notre studio mène depuis le 29 février, une campagne de ""crowdfunding"" (don collectif) pour financer les dernières étapes du développement du jeu Besyde, notre premier jeu massivement multijoueurs géolocalisé. Disponible sur Facebook pour la version web et bientôt sur iTunes pour la version iPhone. Besyde est un jeu « géosocial » cross-plateformes permettant de jouer dans un espace virtuel géolocalisé superposé à la réalité.
 
Grâce à la plateforme de crowdfunding Indiegogo, Alt Shift compte offrir à ses contributeurs, non seulement les traditionnels ""goodies"" (comme des posters en édition limitée, des polos, de la monnaie du jeu, voir dans la catégorie ""Perk"" ci-dessous), mais aussi un privilège très spécial : l'opportunité de nommer un arbre virtuel situé sur l'un des lieux les plus populaires de la planète, tels que la Tour Eiffel, La Statue de la Liberté, Le Colisée (voir l'exemple ci-dessous), etc.
 
Chaque contributeur pourra donc choisir parmi la liste de lieux célèbres encore disponibles. Alors, attention, premiers arrivés, premiers servis ! (La liste est disponible ci-dessous dans le paragraphe ""Elite Besyder"").
 

Au total, nous avons besoin de 67000$ (50000€) pour finaliser techniquement Besyde tel que nous l’imaginions (avec de nombreux contenus, des quêtes géolocalisées partout sur la planète, les fonctionnalités sociales et communautaires, une infrastructure serveur solide et testée, etc.) et sortir une version beta ouverte entre mai et juin 2012.
 
10000$ (7500€) est notre premier objectif sur Indiegogo pour arriver au lancement d’une version stable sur navigateur dès que possible mais nous espérons que vous nous soutiendrez jusqu’au but final pour que nous puissions développer toutes les fonctionnalités et les contenus intéressants que nous avions prévus pour chaque plateforme (navigateur web, smartphones et tablettes) !
 
Les dons possibles vont de 1$ à 500$ (je sais, le site ne propose pas de contribution en euros... snif) mais si la crise vous a vraiment ratissé jusqu’au dernier centime, vous pouvez aussi nous aider en parlant de cette campagne autour de vous ! Les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivières ! Et pour ceux qui peuvent participer par le don, il suffit de cliquer sur le bouton ""contribute"" en bas de page en choisissant la somme et le cadeau que vous voudriez. Si vous avez besoin de plus d'info sur le principe, n'hésitez pas à me demander directement sur contact@altshift.fr !

 
Cette campagne de crowdfunding nous aidera donc à finaliser notre projet Besyde (développement, design et tests) et devrait nous permettre de lancer une béta ouverte durant le mois de mai 2012. Pour rester informé de nos avancées, vous pouvez vous abonner à notre page facebook.
 


Besyde: Mask of Harmony
 


Besyde is a location-based MMO game which allows players to participate in the defense of Eora, a parallel world in which little cute creatures (the ""anymas"") protect a tree of life regularly attacked by plagues. The goal is simple: help anymas to protect their tree of life and the magical ambers that give it strength against the incessant plagues attacks.




 
How?


 

By rescuing the trapped anymas on the map
By collecting geolocated resources to grow the anymas and the tree of life
And by helping the anymas to protect the tree ambers against the plagues.

  

  

The more ambers you bring to your tree of life, the more it strengthens against its enemies and rewards you with special powers and personal distinctions. Collaborative geo quests will also allow players to play together to release more anymas, find rare items, and ultimately grow their community tree faster than others!
Indeed, at the first login, each player must choose a geolocated tree to defend. Some players will choose to protect a tree of life close to their home; others will choose a tree near their work, or the tree in which their friends are already connected. In the end, everyone contributes, through his/her geotagged actions, to the defense of his/her community.
Besyde will be available for both mobile and non mobile players. Indeed, web players will be able to play on any browsers in the area around the tree of life they have chosen at the beginning, and mobile gamers will be able to play wherever they are on the planet thanks to the GPS on their phone. In fact, the more you will play with your mobile in different places, the more you will find rare items and anymas allowing you to better defend your tree!
A first private beta version had been launched between July and September 2011 among 500 testers and we had a lot of excellent and promising comments and suggestions. Based on these community feedbacks, we developed a whole new version of the game with many new features but we need funds to finish it, test it, and release a new beta version.
 


What We Need & What You Get
 
We need 67000$ to technically finish Besyde as we want it to be (lots of contents, geoquests all around the world, social and community features, a solid and tested server infrastructure, etc) and release the final open beta between May and June 2012.

Our team is composed by a 2D artist, 2 sound designers and 2 game/level designers.  Each one of us has an experience in the video game and entertainment industry..  We worked on projects like the game ""Squids"" or on books like “ l'Epouvantable Noël du vieux monsieur tout de rouge vêtu” .  Our aim is to offer to gamers a new experience of gaming with an original concept and gameplay.</p>

<h2><em>Ecotone, our indie game project</em></h2>

<p>The game’s primary focus is to invite the gamer in a new kind of world, and features a unique, dreamlike and mysterious atmosphere.</p>

Ecotone, our indie game project

Ecotone is a single-player platform game with an evolving gameplay which allows brainwork and/or skill phases.
The game’s primary focus is to invite the gamer in a new kind of world, and features a unique, dreamlike and mysterious atmosphere.
In the weird Ecotone’s world, the gamer embodies a strange little character lacking a real identity. But beware, the character goes through a dangerous environment full of strange creatures and monsters, and some of them may be dangerous. Each level is based on a sentence,   which is the key to solving the riddle.

Here is an idea of some of the things you can expect in Ecotone when it's released
-          A PC and Mac release, assuming the Indiegogo campaign is succesfull.
-          A strange universe and 3 worlds to explore with a lot of enigmas.
-          Our sound designer offers a sound atmosphere and gives a deeper sense of immersion.
-          An unforgettable story: Throughout the entire game, the story will allow the player to further immerse himself and learn more about his character and its story. While the gamer is free to make up his own idea about the world and the end of the game… But this, it’s a secret.

<h3>Hey there, my name is Jude Campbell, and need a leg-up.</h3>
<p>I'm an avid writer, a designer, full-time teenager and a gamer. That's an understatement, I'm a <em><strong>HUGE</strong></em><strong> </strong>gamer. I've been playing for just over 10 years now. Anyway, I'm straying from the point and going into my personal life, and this is NOT what it's about. Well, kinda. Anyway, being the smart cookie I am, I was writing a chapter of a book I've been working on, as well as the occasional Faster Than Light break (an amazing game by the way) when it struck me. What if I can combine the two things that I love. What if, I could do this, entertain and give advice about what to spend their hard-earned money on to the masses along with giving our indie developers exposure, in order that they can keep making the games we very much dear love. This is the product of that thought. Now, I want this to happen, I very dearly do, but I need your help.</p>
<h3>Alright, you've got my attention, so what's gonna be in this mag?</h3>
<p>To put it short, quite a bit. Of course, the focus is reviewing games by indie developers, but we want to get more involved than that. We plan to also include exclusive interviews with the developers and host exclusive competitions. This is nowhere near everything included, but it gives you an idea of the essence of this magazine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So, what do you need?</h3>
<p>Straight off the bat, I'm gonna come clean, we need $750. This is to cover many things, and basically start it up. Get ready for a bullet point list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing costs! Sure, I could print on A4 paper, but we want this to be a real magazine, with that fancy glossy paper and I'll just say it's not the cheapest around.</li>
<li>Paying our writers! I can't write a whole 25 pages on games by myself! I'll be taking some good friends along the Are You Game experience to write for the mag.</li>
<li>Buying the games! This money will go towards buying the games that we review.</li>
<li>Website costs and development! This magazine is planning to release on a hard copy, but we're also going to set-up a digital version. Basically the same thing but for people without the money! (Don't be discouraged and not donate, we're looking to include little bonuses to the people who buy the hard copies.)</li>
<li>To get a better logo! </li>
</ul>
<p>This is nowhere near all of the costly things related to developing a magazine, but just some ideas of what you'll be paying for.</p>
<h3>What's in it for me, then?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! Did you really think you'd help us start this up and you not get anything?! Most definitely not! To your right hand side, there a things named 'perks.' These are little bonuses that we throw in to thankyou for donating to kickstart this project. Remember, the more you donate, the better the bonuses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So uh, what if this gets funded?</h3>
<p>Well, I, myself would be speechless. I would literally have no words to explain how amazing it would be to get this to come true. Oh yeah, except for one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

<br/>I'm proud to announce that a portion of the profit made from the development of Syndemic will be donated to the Canadian Cancer Society! This includes money from this Indiegogo campaign and any future campaigns in 2013.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, this association does not mean that Syndemic has been 'endorsed' by the Canadian Cancer Society, and the science I present in the game does not reflect the actual research that they do.

<div>My goal with Syndemic is to inspire people to dig into real science and learn about the cool processes that occur all around us. Because of the subject matter, I have a unique opportunity to support real disease research. And if I can provide some empowerment and catharsis by letting players destroy diseases with satisfying weapons, then even better! <br/><br/><img alt=""What is Syndemic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img534.imageshack.us/img534/5999/whatissyndemicnew.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Syndemic is a randomly-generated action shooter game that emphasizes upgrades, quick reflexes, and microbial puzzle-solving in a biological setting. <br/><br/>Take control of a unique microbe that can dodge, tumble and weave through bodily tissues and avoid swarms of invasive pathogens. Accumulate a massive arsenal of antibiotic weaponry, upgrade your genome and cell structure, and unleash powerful metabolic abilities. Explore the human body, destroy invading diseases, assist the immune system, and ultimately, discover your origin and the fate of your host. <br/><br/>Are you a biological weapon designed to spread misery?

My aim is to exaggerate the weirdness and coolness (and action) of real microbial ecology, and hopefully inspire players to dig deeper into the actual research that's out there.<br/><br/>My presentation of biology will be less about mechanics and more about the big-picture themes and ideas. I want people to question everything in the game, and I want them to come to their own conclusions about the issues raised. Genetic engineering, herd immunity, antibiotic resistance, and biological altruism are some of the themes I want to explore.<br/><br/>However, in keeping with the spirit of science, the game will include 'Reality Checks' that point out inaccuracies within the game when compared to real-life biology. Some examples include:<br/><br/><em>“Viruses are actually much smaller than bacteria, and can range in size from 1/10 to 1/100 of a bacterium.”</em><br/><br/><em>“Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria specifically.

		Hi, It's Cengiz. I know you have seen me before, at the World Series of Poker! Well, ok, maybe I wasn't the guy with the champion bracelet, but I am the guy who's going to shake up the world of virtual poker. I know you have experienced the same things that I have experienced on all the online poker sites. You get on the site, sit down to play a few rounds, looking for some challenge and what happens? Two seconds into the table, 5 people go all-in just to try to grab chips as fast as possible. I mean - sure - if you had a great hand, maybe it would be worth it, but 5 people at a 9 person table don't have a great hand.So, this gets very boring - because it's just like pulling a lever and playing the slot machines, right? Where is the strategy - where is the competitive element? This is what I miss when I play online. You don't see people doing this in person. So, I said to myself, there must be a way to change this!<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cengiz2.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 10px;""/>
		It turns out - there is! I am excited to announce to you the beginning of an entirely new approach to online poker - Virtual Poker World, Road to Las Vegas. What makes this different is that we get to play for points, earn reputation, play in different cities and face consequences for bad play. A great poker game is possible again! Now, it's time for me to find a way to bring this to you and I need your help. Whether through direct contributions to my campaign or from spreading the word, it takes a passionate community to make a new world of poker exist. I'm here to share my passion for poker with you - please help me to succeed by putting whatever contribution that you are comfortable with whether $10 or $1000 and let's bring virtual poker to a new level across the globe. And don't forget, no matter what you do - spread the news - on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, Youtube and LinkedIn even. Help us to bring you the best online poker game in the world!<br/><br/>

		So what does it take a to launch a successful online poker RPG game - well it's not an impossible amount, but it is a lot.  According to our best estimates, in order to produce a great game, we need to raise approximately $100,000.  This will include software development, artwork/illustrations, marketing, advertising, game design, server hosting and more!  But where did this all begin?<br/><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DungeonPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;""/>
		It began with this realization that playing poker online was just not satisfying. After talking to other poker players, we kept hearing the same thing - so my partner and I sat down and tried to imagine a way to improve this situation. We looked at the games we had most enjoyed playing growing up and what it was about poker that we liked as well. Soon, it became clear - there was a way to connect the two kinds of games that we enjoyed most - Role Playing Games and Poker!<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FameStarGamesLogo.png"" src="""" style=""padding-right: 0px;""/>
		You see, in a Role Playing Game - you fight dragons and loot dungeons and buy equipment and ... wait wait - I'm getting to it - the biggest thing you do in a Role Playing Game - you create a character and you build up that character's reputation. This is very much like poker. And the techniques can be very similar. And so, here we have this great opportunity to play virtually with avatars, travel from tournament to tournament in major poker cities and stop the ""all in"" madness! You must think this is incredible right? I do too! So what can we do to help each other to realize this dream you ask? Let me tell you...

		It begins in Kyrenia - the player is transported to this starting city upon entering the game. From this point, the player begins to develop his or her ""character"" - improving position and reputation through playing the game effectively.<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/MainUIPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-right: 0px;""/>
		As players succeed in overcoming early rounds of play and early tables, the player is advanced to succeeding cities. The next city to come is Athens. The player begins to develop ranking. This continues from city to city across the globe. The player is not forced to start over at the bottom just because of one bad decision.<br/><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CityPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;""/>
		Poor poker play such as going all-in over and over might get you started in Kyrenia, but it will not get you far down the path to Vegas as the weaker players wash out in the first city. This is not all that there is to Virtual Poker World though. As a game built by poker players for poker players, we ask you to directly contribute to our efforts to improve the game for you.<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AchievementsPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-right: 0px;""/>
		Not only can you help us through this crowdfunding campaign, but also through sharing with us your ideas that you want to see us incorporate in the game. Every idea is important, every contribution is important and your voice is critical to us. We are more than ready to create something great that all of us can play.

</ul>
		These are all truly amazing and we are very impressed with the creation that our artists and designers have been able to produce. We are also considering creating special tournaments for our crowdfunding campaign contributors and other special rewards. We may even consider creating a special member's only society to give our earliest supporters first right of refusal and special opportunities in various great poker cities across the world. What could this be worth to you? The sky is the limit! We are very excited to work with you to realize this dream as we have said before.<br/><br/>
		Now to the budget - for us to succeed, we need to put at least over $100 thousand dollars to work.  As you look at all of our missions, game mechanics, multiplayer and multiplatform support, you can imagine how this adds up.  We know we can get there though and provide to you the best possible virtual poker experience in the world!<br/><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/GameMechanicsPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;""/>
		There are steps that we can get to at lower levels though. If our goal is 25 cities at 100K and being able to sponsor winners in tournaments around the world, then getting to $25K gets us fewer cities as you can imagine. We will have to build with what we have until we have what we need to create all of the amazing features. We are a lean team with big dreams but we apply the principles of the Lean Startup to getting there. If you are in America and building games, we are sure you have met others who are doing things this way as well.Before we even begin building toward this large goal though - we have realized that we must raise funds for marketing and developing our audience for this very big effort. We are going to conduct first this Beta Campaign. The Beta Campaign helps us to pull together the critical marketing and advertising dollars that we will require to progress successfully in our Main Campaign. We must reach the 300 million + social and cash poker players in the world if we can expect to be ultimately successful!

		Merhaba, ben Cengiz. Beni daha önce görmüştünüz, Dünya Poker Şampiyonasında! Tamam şampiyonluğu kazanan ben değildim ama bu proje ile poker dünyasını sarsan isim ben olacağım. Özellikle online sosyal poker oyunlarında her oyuncu aynı sorunları yaşıyor. Masaya oturuyorsunuz, biraz poker oynamak istiyorsunuz ama ne oluyor? 5 oyuncu aynı anda “All-in” diyor ve kimsenin elinde doğru düzgün bir kağıt olmuyor. İki As geldiyse neden olmasın tabi ki ama 09 kişilik bir masada 5 kişinin de eli iyi olamaz değil mi?<br/><br/>Dolayısı ile bu çok sıkıcı adeta kol çekip slot oynamaya benziyor di mi? Strateji nerede?  Rekabet nerede? İşte bunları özlüyorum online oynarken. Bunu değiştirmek için bir yol bulmalıyım dedim ve buldum!<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cengiz2.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 10px;""/>
		Size büyük bir heyecan ile online pokere yepyeni bir yaklaşım getiren projemi sunuyorum – Virtual Poker World – Road to Las Vegas. Farklı olan bu sefer puan için oynuyoruz, itibar kazanıyoruz, farklı şehirler dolaşıyoruz ve kötü oynayanlar sonuçlarına katlanıyorlar. Müthiş bir poker oyunu tekrardan mümkün oluyor! Şimdi bu projeyi hayata geçirmek için bir yol bulmalıyım ve yardımınızı ihtiyacım var. Direkt projeye maddi destek vererek ya da bu projeden herkesi haberdar ederek bana yardımcı olabilirsiniz. Bu projeyi hayata geçirebilmek için tutkulu bir topluluk gerekiyor. Bu oyunu yaratmaktaki bu büyük isteğimi sizler ile burada paylaşıyorum. Sizler de 1 usd ve ya 1000 usd destek olursanız sevinirim. Ama unutmayın ne olursa olsun projeyi Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, Youtube ve LinkedIn gibi sosyal ağlarda  herkese duyurmama yardımcı olun.<br/><br/>

		Peki Poker RPG oyunu geliştirmenin maliyeti nedir derseniz imkansız bir rakam değil ancak maliyet yüksek. Hesaplamalarımıza göre gerçekten yüksek kalitede bir oyun yaratılması için 100.000 USD gerekli. Bu bedel yazılım geliştirmenin yanında yüksek kalite tasarım, oyun içindeki bina ve şehir çizimleri, server ve hosting ile beraber başarılı olabilmek için tüm reklam giderlerini içeriyor. Peki hikayemiz nasıl başladı?<br/><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DungeonPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;""/>
		Online sosyal poker oyunlarının yeterli olmadığı fark ettiğimiz ile bu şirketi kurdum. Etrafımızdaki poker oyuncuları ile konuşurken hep aynı sorunları duydum ve biz de bu sorunun çözümü üzerine kafa yordum. Çocukken oynarken en keyif aldığımız oyunları düşündüm ve poker oyununu nasıl olurda bu konsepte uyarlarım dedim.  Aklımda fikir oluşmaya başladı ve iki farklı tarzı birleştirecek bir fikir geliştirdim. RPG Poker! Bilinen en büyük Role Playing oyunlarını hatırlayın, oyuncular dragonlar ile dövüşür tecrübe ve puanlar kazanarak daha güçlü silahlar ve kıyafetler alabilirler. Bunu pokere uyarlamak da çok zor olmadı.<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FameStarGamesLogo.png"" src="""" style=""padding-right: 0px;""/>
		Oluşturduğunuz poker karakteri oyunda başarılar elde ettikçe daha yüksek masalarda oynayabilecek, diğer şehirlere giderek daha büyük turnuvalar katılabilecek daha da güzeli tüm görevleri tamamlarsa sponsorlu oyuncu olacak ve gerçekten Las Vegas’a gidip bir süreliğine poker oyuncusu olma hayalini gerçekleştirebilecek. Bu hedeflere ulaşmak için artık kimse kolay kolay All-in diyemeyecek.

		Kolaylık seviyesi en düşük olan bu şehirde görevler tamamlandıkça oyuncu diğer şehirlere seyahat edebiliyor. Sıradaki şehir Yunanistan, Atina. İlerledikçe zorluk seviyesi artıyor ve önünüzde toplam 25 şehir var ama eğer dikkatli olmazsanız tüm chiplerinin kaybedip başladığınız noktaya kadar geri gelebilirsiniz.<br/><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indiefund.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CityPop.png"" src="""" style=""padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 0px;""/>

		Hi, It's Cengiz. I know you have seen me before, at the World Series of Poker! Well, ok, maybe I wasn't the guy with the champion bracelet, but I am the guy who's going to shake up the world of virtual poker. I know you have experienced the same things that I have experienced on all the online poker sites. You get on the site, sit down to play a few rounds, looking for some challenge and what happens? Two seconds into the table, 5 people go all-in just to try to grab chips as fast as possible. I mean - sure - if you had a great hand, maybe it would be worth it, but 5 people at a 9 person table don't have a great hand.So, this gets very boring - because it's just like pulling a lever and playing the slot machines, right? Where is the strategy - where is the competitive element? This is what I miss when I play online. You don't see people doing this in person. So, I said to myself, there must be a way to change this!
		It turns out - there is! I am excited to announce to you the beginning of an entirely new approach to online poker - Virtual Poker World, Road to Las Vegas. What makes this different is that we get to play for points, earn reputation, play in different cities and face consequences for bad play. A great poker game is possible again! Now, it's time for me to find a way to bring this to you and I need your help. Whether through direct contributions to my campaign or from spreading the word, it takes a passionate community to make a new world of poker exist. I'm here to share my passion for poker with you - please help me to succeed by putting whatever contribution that you are comfortable with whether $10 or $1000 and let's bring virtual poker to a new level across the globe. And don't forget, no matter what you do - spread the news - on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, Youtube and LinkedIn even. Help us to bring you the best online poker game in the world!





		So what does it take a to launch a successful online poker RPG game - well it's not an impossible amount, but it is a lot.  According to our best estimates, in order to produce a great game, we need to raise approximately $100,000.  This will include software development, artwork/illustrations, marketing, advertising, game design, server hosting and more!  But where did this all begin?
		It began with this realization that playing poker online was just not satisfying. After talking to other poker players, we kept hearing the same thing - so my partner and I sat down and tried to imagine a way to improve this situation. We looked at the games we had most enjoyed playing growing up and what it was about poker that we liked as well. Soon, it became clear - there was a way to connect the two kinds of games that we enjoyed most - Role Playing Games and Poker!
		You see, in a Role Playing Game - you fight dragons and loot dungeons and buy equipment and ... wait wait - I'm getting to it - the biggest thing you do in a Role Playing Game - you create a character and you build up that character's reputation. This is very much like poker. And the techniques can be very similar. And so, here we have this great opportunity to play virtually with avatars, travel from tournament to tournament in major poker cities and stop the ""all in"" madness! You must think this is incredible right? I do too! So what can we do to help each other to realize this dream you ask? Let me tell you...
	





		It begins in Kyrenia - the player is transported to this starting city upon entering the game. From this point, the player begins to develop his or her ""character"" - improving position and reputation through playing the game effectively.
		As players succeed in overcoming early rounds of play and early tables, the player is advanced to succeeding cities. The next city to come is Athens. The player begins to develop ranking. This continues from city to city across the globe. The player is not forced to start over at the bottom just because of one bad decision.
		Poor poker play such as going all-in over and over might get you started in Kyrenia, but it will not get you far down the path to Vegas as the weaker players wash out in the first city. This is not all that there is to Virtual Poker World though. As a game built by poker players for poker players, we ask you to directly contribute to our efforts to improve the game for you.
		Not only can you help us through this crowdfunding campaign, but also through sharing with us your ideas that you want to see us incorporate in the game. Every idea is important, every contribution is important and your voice is critical to us. We are more than ready to create something great that all of us can play.
		






		Now that you know a little about me, FameStar Games, our mission and our goal - Virtual Poker World - Road to Las Vegas -, I would like to talk to you more about what we need and what you will get by helping us make this dream real.
		First of all - it takes a lot of dollars to hire all the developers and all of the artists to create a great game. So - as you can imagine we are seeking many thousands of dollars. To make it worthwhile to all of you great players who want to see this amazing experience come to live - we are committed to providing you great rewards:
		
Ante - $10 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 5th city.
Small Blind - $25 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 8th city.
Big Blind - $50 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 9th city.
Poker Life as Art - $75 - Get an incredible custom caricature of yourself just like the one above! Your unique custom caricature is created from your own photograph of course, so it is truly a reflection of you! All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 9th city.
Pot - $100 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 10th city.
Flop - $250 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 12th city.
Turn - $1,000 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 15th city.
River - $2,500 - All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player. You can start the game from 16th city.
Become a Character - $5,000 - We will use YOUR REAL PICTURE and design a character to be used in 1 city.  You will be the in-game character all players will see. All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player.  You can start the game from the 17th city.
Become a Brand - Casino - $10,000 - We will give YOUR NAME to one of our Casinos (in 1 city) in the city layout of the game - for 1 year! Ex. ""John's Poker Room"" LIMITED - 7 BUILDINGS ONLY. All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player.  You can start the game from the 18th city.
Become a Brand - City - $25,000 - We will give YOUR NAME to one of our cities in the virtual world of our game - for 1 year! Ex. ""City of John Carter"" LIMITED - 1 CITY ONLY! All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player.  You can start the game from the 18th city.
World Famous in Poker World - $50,000 - We will design a special episode for you and there will be 3 cities all named after you and all the buildings will also have your name in some way! LIMITED - 1 SPECIAL EPISODE! All contributors will earn a ""Founder"" badge that will never be earned or be able to be bought in-game by any other player.  You can start the game from the 18th city.


Meet the Founders - $8,000 - We will meet you and tell you all about how to design an incredible Poker Game.  We will show you our city - Istanbul for 1 weekend and share with you the experience of living in the cross-roads of civilization as well as giving you the chance to test your skills in an exclusive tournament for you and one other person.  All expenses paid (NOTE: flight not included - you must get here, the rest we will take care of)!

		These are all truly amazing and we are very impressed with the creation that our artists and designers have been able to produce. We are also considering creating special tournaments for our crowdfunding campaign contributors and other special rewards. We may even consider creating a special member's only society to give our earliest supporters first right of refusal and special opportunities in various great poker cities across the world. What could this be worth to you? The sky is the limit! We are very excited to work with you to realize this dream as we have said before.
		Now to the budget - for us to succeed, we need to put at least over $100 thousand dollars to work.  As you look at all of our missions, game mechanics, multiplayer and multiplatform support, you can imagine how this adds up.  We know we can get there though and provide to you the best possible virtual poker experience in the world!
		There are steps that we can get to at lower levels though. If our goal is 25 cities at 100K and being able to sponsor winners in tournaments around the world, then getting to $25K gets us fewer cities as you can imagine. We will have to build with what we have until we have what we need to create all of the amazing features. We are a lean team with big dreams but we apply the principles of the Lean Startup to getting there. If you are in America and building games, we are sure you have met others who are doing things this way as well.Before we even begin building toward this large goal though - we have realized that we must raise funds for marketing and developing our audience for this very big effort. We are going to conduct first this Beta Campaign. The Beta Campaign helps us to pull together the critical marketing and advertising dollars that we will require to progress successfully in our Main Campaign. We must reach the 300 million + social and cash poker players in the world if we can expect to be ultimately successful!
	




		As we said before, in the beginning of our story - we could not do this without you. As Cengiz has said, ""Whether through direct contributions to my campaign or from spreading the word, it takes a passionate community to make a new world of poker exist. I'm here to share my passion for poker with you - please help me to succeed by putting whatever contribution that you are comfortable with whether $1 or $1000 and let's bring virtual poker to a new level across the globe. And don't forget, no matter what you do - spread the news - on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, Youtube and LinkedIn even. Help us to bring you the best online poker game in the world!"" We look forward to seeing you at the poker tables in person!

		Merhaba, ben Cengiz. Beni daha önce görmüştünüz, Dünya Poker Şampiyonasında! Tamam şampiyonluğu kazanan ben değildim ama bu proje ile poker dünyasını sarsan isim ben olacağım. Özellikle online sosyal poker oyunlarında her oyuncu aynı sorunları yaşıyor. Masaya oturuyorsunuz, biraz poker oynamak istiyorsunuz ama ne oluyor? 5 oyuncu aynı anda “All-in” diyor ve kimsenin elinde doğru düzgün bir kağıt olmuyor. İki As geldiyse neden olmasın tabi ki ama 09 kişilik bir masada 5 kişinin de eli iyi olamaz değil mi?Dolayısı ile bu çok sıkıcı adeta kol çekip slot oynamaya benziyor di mi? Strateji nerede?  Rekabet nerede? İşte bunları özlüyorum online oynarken. Bunu değiştirmek için bir yol bulmalıyım dedim ve buldum!
		Size büyük bir heyecan ile online pokere yepyeni bir yaklaşım getiren projemi sunuyorum – Virtual Poker World – Road to Las Vegas. Farklı olan bu sefer puan için oynuyoruz, itibar kazanıyoruz, farklı şehirler dolaşıyoruz ve kötü oynayanlar sonuçlarına katlanıyorlar. Müthiş bir poker oyunu tekrardan mümkün oluyor! Şimdi bu projeyi hayata geçirmek için bir yol bulmalıyım ve yardımınızı ihtiyacım var. Direkt projeye maddi destek vererek ya da bu projeden herkesi haberdar ederek bana yardımcı olabilirsiniz. Bu projeyi hayata geçirebilmek için tutkulu bir topluluk gerekiyor. Bu oyunu yaratmaktaki bu büyük isteğimi sizler ile burada paylaşıyorum. Sizler de 1 usd ve ya 1000 usd destek olursanız sevinirim. Ama unutmayın ne olursa olsun projeyi Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, Youtube ve LinkedIn gibi sosyal ağlarda  herkese duyurmama yardımcı olun.





		Peki Poker RPG oyunu geliştirmenin maliyeti nedir derseniz imkansız bir rakam değil ancak maliyet yüksek. Hesaplamalarımıza göre gerçekten yüksek kalitede bir oyun yaratılması için 100.000 USD gerekli. Bu bedel yazılım geliştirmenin yanında yüksek kalite tasarım, oyun içindeki bina ve şehir çizimleri, server ve hosting ile beraber başarılı olabilmek için tüm reklam giderlerini içeriyor. Peki hikayemiz nasıl başladı?
		Online sosyal poker oyunlarının yeterli olmadığı fark ettiğimiz ile bu şirketi kurdum. Etrafımızdaki poker oyuncuları ile konuşurken hep aynı sorunları duydum ve biz de bu sorunun çözümü üzerine kafa yordum. Çocukken oynarken en keyif aldığımız oyunları düşündüm ve poker oyununu nasıl olurda bu konsepte uyarlarım dedim.  Aklımda fikir oluşmaya başladı ve iki farklı tarzı birleştirecek bir fikir geliştirdim. RPG Poker! Bilinen en büyük Role Playing oyunlarını hatırlayın, oyuncular dragonlar ile dövüşür tecrübe ve puanlar kazanarak daha güçlü silahlar ve kıyafetler alabilirler. Bunu pokere uyarlamak da çok zor olmadı.
		Oluşturduğunuz poker karakteri oyunda başarılar elde ettikçe daha yüksek masalarda oynayabilecek, diğer şehirlere giderek daha büyük turnuvalar katılabilecek daha da güzeli tüm görevleri tamamlarsa sponsorlu oyuncu olacak ve gerçekten Las Vegas’a gidip bir süreliğine poker oyuncusu olma hayalini gerçekleştirebilecek. Bu hedeflere ulaşmak için artık kimse kolay kolay All-in diyemeyecek.
	





		Oyun Kıbrıs – Girne’de başlıyor. Oyuncu oyuna girer girmez bu şehre gönderiliyor. Bu noktadan sonra kazandığı her el, her chip ve tamamladığı görevler sayesinde karakterini geliştirmeye başlıyor.
		Kolaylık seviyesi en düşük olan bu şehirde görevler tamamlandıkça oyuncu diğer şehirlere seyahat edebiliyor. Sıradaki şehir Yunanistan, Atina. İlerledikçe zorluk seviyesi artıyor ve önünüzde toplam 25 şehir var ama eğer dikkatli olmazsanız tüm chiplerinin kaybedip başladığınız noktaya kadar geri gelebilirsiniz.
		Tabi ki bu dünyanın içinde Girne’den Las Vegas’a uzanan bu yolda tüm özellikler bu kadar değil tabi ki. Bu oyun gerçek poker oyuncuları için poker oyuncuları tarafından geliştiriliyor ve bu doğrultuda sizlerin de önerileri bizim için önemli.
		Oyunu geliştirmek için önerilerinizi bekliyoruz çünkü tüm poker oyuncuları için güzel bir proje geliştirmek istiyoruz.
		






		Artık ben ve FameStar Games hakkında biraz bilgi sahibi olduğunuza göre şimdi sıra hedeflerimiz ve sonuçlarda. İhtiyacımız olanlardan ve bize yardım edenlere verilecek ödüllerden bahsetmek istiyorum. Öncelikle bu oyunun sağlıklı yazılması için tutulan programcılar ve tasarımcılar oldukça yüksek bir maliyete sahip. Tahmin edebileceğiniz gibi onbinlerce dolara ihtiyaç duyacağız. Bu oyun projesinin gerçekleşmesi için elinden geleni yapacak sizler için değerli hediyeler hazırlamaya çalıştık.

All miniatures from this range will be casted in high quality resin that will guarantee that every detail will be visible and as precise as original sculpt it would also make the price more affordable than any other form of production. It would be also use to fill my workshop with much needed equipment for sculpting and photographing miniatures as well as to finance future projects.</h3>

<p>Warning:<br/>This product is not a toy. Box may contain small parts. Product is not suitable for children under 14 years</p></div>","Hi !My name is Kamil ""Smok"" Milaniuk and I would like to welcome you to my first Indiegogo pre-sale.
 
I'm an autodidact freelance sculptor and it is my dream to constantly improve my skills and sculpt high quality miniatures that will be suitable for gamers, collectors and hobbyists.
 
Project ""Myconids from Gloom Glade"" is my first attempt in creating a themed miniature range, based on fictional race of humanoid mushrooms called Myconids.  As the sculpting is my full time job this campaign will help me not only to provide necessary equipment and tools for my workshop to further develop my skills but also to sustain myself while developing future themed miniature ranges.
 
 You may ask why this amount of money ? It will help me to provide my miniatures to greater audience. All miniatures from this range will be casted in high quality resin that will guarantee that every detail will be visible and as precise as original sculpt it would also make the price more affordable than any other form of production. It would be also use to fill my workshop with much needed equipment for sculpting and photographing miniatures as well as to finance future projects.
In case You've been wondering what if we don't reach campaign goal. We have chosen flexible founding so that even if the final goal isn't achieved we can still produce and deliver high quality products.
 
>>>   NEWS!!   <<<

We are super excited cause today we got first resin cast of miniatures for our Myconids from Gloom Glade project.First picture is a resin cast of King Mactus and a sprue with mushroom hats that will fit on the model to complete his crown.


Second picture shows Awakened mushrooms in all their glory, so that You can judge the quality of the resin cast for Yourselves

------------------------------
Now time for some explanations concerning perks.First of all there are two types of models in ""Myconids from Gloom Glade"".

 1. Myconids- mushroom herders, sacred guardians. There are 2 different Myconid models:

There is also special model of Myconid King Mactus the Wise who stands as the leader of the myconids, the wisest and oldest of them all. This miniature is limited to 80 numbered copies that will not be available anywhere else. Once their gone their gone forever. 

Miniatures will be casted in high quality resin. Price in the perks includes worldwide shipping. Miniatures will be packed extra carefully and shipped in traceable package.

New perk: Mushroom Familiar set

In the spare time I have decided to sculpt few smaller mushroom familiars. You can see the difference in size on photo.If the goal is reached one set of those familiars would be included as a bonus to all those who ordered ""Court of Gloom Glade"". All who got other perks ( including Mushroom Familiar set) will also receive one random familiar if the campaign reaches its goal.

In a standard game of GriMagia, <b>each player starts with 5 cards in hand</b>.
 <b>All players</b> <b>share the same deck</b> and <b>draw 2 cards each turn</b> (except the 
first turn; draw 1 card). There's a <b>hand limit of 6 cards</b>, so if you 
have more than that at the end of your turn, you discard cards until you

<b>SUMMONING BASICS: </b>You can <b>summon monsters</b> from your
 hand to the field to aid you in battle! <b>Each monster has individual strengths and weaknesses depending on which of the three basic types it is (ATK, DEF, HP)</b>. Attack unarmed opponents 
directly, weaken monsters for capture, or defeat every monster in sight -
 it's up to you!<br/><br/><b>SUMMONING GAUGE:</b> Each GriMeister has a Summoning Gauge of <span><b>8
 hearts</b>, meaning that they may only control a maximum amount of monsters
 that have a printed total of 8 hearts on the field. Exceeding that 
limit will cause <b>Fatigue</b> to the GriMeister, slowly draining away their 
life force.</span><br/><br/><h3></h3>

<b>BATTLE BASICS: </b>In battle, compare the ATK stat of your monster to the 
DEF stat of the opponent's monster;<b> if your monster's ATK is higher than
 the opposing monster's DEF, the attack goes through.</b> The hearts in the upper right corner of each Monster Card represent its HP (1 heart = 1 HP). Each attack does <b>-1 HP</b>
<b>worth of damage</b>, and <b>if a monster takes damage equal to its HP, it's</b> <b>
destroyed</b> and sent to the discard pile.<br/><br/><b>INTERCEPTING: </b>Monsters are able to <b>intercept</b> incoming attacks to take damage instead of the intended target. If the monster that intercepts has higher DEF than the attacking monster's ATK, however, then it won't take any damage.<br/><br/><b>ACTIVE/RESTED POSITIONS: </b>When a monster attacks, 
defends, or intercepts an attack, it gets shifted from <b>Active position</b> 
(face-up, forwards) to <b>Rested position</b> (sideways). Monsters in Rested position are unable to attack/defend/intercept until they're shifted 
back to Active position at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/><b>MOBBING:</b> A monster in Rested position cannot defend, and is thus vulnerable to any attack, regardless of its DEF. Therefore, <b>you can mob a high DEF monster with multiple attacks from different monsters</b>. Because that monster cannot defend itself from all those incoming attacks, it will take damage.<br/><br/><h3></h3>

<b>CAPTURING BASICS: </b>Your role as a GriMeister is to<b> capture your opponents’ monsters</b> with the mystic power of <b>Grimoires</b> - magical books with immense powers of confinement. <b>Each basic Grimoire corresponds to one of the</b> <b>three basic types (ATK, DEF, HP).</b> In order for a Grimoire to be able to capture a monster,<b> its type must match the monster's type</b>, and<b> its MP must be greater than or equal to the remaining HP of the monster</b>.<br/><br/><b>CATCH BLOCKING:</b> If you don't want your opponent to capture your monsters, you can block a capture with a <b>Catch Block</b>! Discard a card from your hand (monster or Grimoire) of the basic type that beats the basic type of Grimoire your opponent played, rock-paper-scissors style. <br/><p></p>

<i>ATK beats HP, HP beats DEF, and DEF beats ATK.</i><br/><br/><b>BLOCK REVERSALS/FINAL BLOCK:</b> If you've performed a Catch Block, your opponent can retaliate with a <b>Block Reversal</b> by discarding a card of the basic type that beats yours to make the capture successful. However, you can respond with a <b>Final Block</b>; again, discard a card of the type that beats your opponent's card type. <b>After a Final Block, no more cards can be discarded to influence the outcome of the capture, and it is deemed unsuccessful.</b><br/><br/><h3></h3>

<b>RELIC BASICS: </b>GriMeisters are able to wield <b>Relics</b>, ancient items that <b>can be used at any time during the game</b>,
 even during an opponent's turn or in response to an action! If utilized
 properly, they can turn the tides of a game in your favor! Use them 
wisely, as there can be <b>only one of each unique Relic in the deck</b>!<br/><br/><b>RESOLUTIONS:</b> If two or more Relics activate in response to one another, the effect of the last Relic that was played resolves first, and so on.

<b>ABILITY MONSTERS:</b> Some monsters have <b>abilities</b> that they can use in order to gain the upper hand over an opponent! <b>Ability Monsters</b> generally have weaker stats than regular monsters, but they make up for it with their useful powers. <b>Different Ability Monsters function in different ways</b>: some monsters' abilities activate on summon, some can be activated on command by shifting the ability monster to Rested position, some activate automatically under certain conditions, and some have effects that last indefinitely.<br/><br/><b>SP MONSTERS:</b>  There exist <b>Special (SP) Monsters</b> with abilities so powerful that they can alter the course of the game, for better or worse. These mystical beings are so rare that<b> there can only be up to 4 SP Monsters in a standard deck</b>, and <b>there can be only one of each unique SP monster in the deck</b>!<br/><br/><b>FUTURE EXPANSIONS:</b> In each expansion, we will be able to add more mechanics to the game to make it even more interesting! All future mechanics will be optional, but will provide new options for players, as we'd like to keep the game fresh and exciting while keeping it as flexible as possible.

<b>The core gameplay is simple enough that it only takes a single game to get the hang of</b>, but at the same time<b> it achieves complexity</b> <b>in that there are many different options for players</b> depending on which cards you decide to play and when, thus leaving a wide range of strategies open. Each cards' effects/abilities have different uses depending on when/how you use them, and each person will use them differently; it's up to you to determine your playstyle!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>You can unite two monsters you control into one stronger monster; the types of monsters you unite will determine which of the monster's stat(s) gets boosted, and by how much.</b> This has strengths and drawbacks; on one hand, the Unioned monster is more powerful and better suited to battle, and it may gain useful abilities. On the other hand, it means you have less monsters on the field, and it's a greater loss if that monster is captured by an opponent.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Since it's not a TCG, <b>the standard mode of GriMagia is</b> <b>played with a shared deck of 100 cards</b> instead of having each player build their own deck (though in non-standard modes, players will be able to build their own unique decks using expansions, if they choose).
<b> Each player draws from the same deck and discards to the same pile. 
</b>This means that anything you can do to your opponent, they can also do 
to you, so watch out!<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>It's versatile and encourages creativity in players.</b> There are <b>multiple ways to play</b> <b>GriMagia</b>; for example, in addition to standard mode, we've created a <b>split deck mode</b> and an <b>RPG mode</b> as well as a <b>deckbuilding mode</b> for more advanced players. Since <b>all of the game's mechanics were designed to be flexible</b>, the creation of new game modes is highly encouraged as well - the only limit is your imagination!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Board/card games with anime themed art like GriMagia's are extremely hard to come by in countries besides Japan</b>, due to the effort required to translate, import, and localize those games, <i>especially</i> when it comes to physical board/card games.<br/>
</li></ul>

<p><b>Since GriMagia was created by a small company, we can't afford to print the game on a mass scale at high quality.</b> And if we don't print GriMagia on a mass scale, we won't be able to get a bulk discount on printing in order to sell the game at a reasonable price. Therefore, we turned to crowdfunding for help, in order to <b>ensure we can produce a high quality product at an affordable price</b>!<br/></p>
<p>Since we're doing a <b>Fixed Funding (all or nothing)</b> campaign, <b>if we don't meet our goal, everyone will be refunded and we won't be able to print the game.</b> That would be a huge shame considering <b>the game's art and gameplay are complete, and it's already been rigorously playtested in several locations</b>, including Anime Expo, card shops in Japan, and multiple colleges. So hopefully, <b>with your support, we can reach our goal!</b></p>
<p><b>If we surpass our goal, the additional funds will go towards future additions to GriMagia</b>, including the creation of expansions, additional promo cards, or even a possible digital version of the game for PC/mobile. These additions will all be displayed in <b>Stretch Goals</b> if our initial $13k goal is reached. <b>The more we raise, the more we'll be able to create!</b></p>

GriMagia (gri-MUH-gi-uh) is a 2-6 player anime-themed card game about fighting and 
capturing monster girls! Take up the role of a GriMeister, specializing 
in summoning and confining monsters with the aid of magical books known 
as Grimoires!
GriMagia, while NOT a TCG, borrows some familiar elements that are found in many TCGs and RPGs, throws in some unique mechanics, and mixes them together in a simple and fun game that anyone can pick up! It's possible to learn the basics in as quick as 10-15 minutes (as proven during our live demos at Anime Expo 2014), and there are many layers of depth and strategy to the game that make it entertaining for experienced players as well!

** Note for International Contributors: If you live outside the US, please add +$10 USD to your contribution in order to cover international shipping costs and ensure you get your perks in good condition. **





In GriMagia, each player assumes the role of a GriMeister, specializing in summoning and confining monsters with the aid of magical books known as Grimoires. Learn how to play by watching the above video or reading the description below!
The objective of GriMagia is to either capture 3 of your opponents' 
monsters OR reduce every opponent's HP to 0 (each player has 5 HP). 
These caps are flexible depending on how long you'd like the game to 
last.
At the start of each game, the 100 card deck is shuffled and players must decide the turn order. In a standard game of GriMagia, each player starts with 5 cards in hand.
 All players share the same deck and draw 2 cards each turn (except the 
first turn; draw 1 card). There's a hand limit of 6 cards, so if you 
have more than that at the end of your turn, you discard cards until you
 have 6 again.

SUMMONING BASICS: You can summon monsters from your
 hand to the field to aid you in battle! Each monster has individual strengths and weaknesses depending on which of the three basic types it is (ATK, DEF, HP). Attack unarmed opponents 
directly, weaken monsters for capture, or defeat every monster in sight -
 it's up to you!SUMMONING GAUGE: Each GriMeister has a Summoning Gauge of 8
 hearts, meaning that they may only control a maximum amount of monsters
 that have a printed total of 8 hearts on the field. Exceeding that 
limit will cause Fatigue to the GriMeister, slowly draining away their 
life force.

BATTLE BASICS: In battle, compare the ATK stat of your monster to the 
DEF stat of the opponent's monster; if your monster's ATK is higher than
 the opposing monster's DEF, the attack goes through. The hearts in the upper right corner of each Monster Card represent its HP (1 heart = 1 HP). Each attack does -1 HP
worth of damage, and if a monster takes damage equal to its HP, it's 
destroyed and sent to the discard pile.INTERCEPTING: Monsters are able to intercept incoming attacks to take damage instead of the intended target. If the monster that intercepts has higher DEF than the attacking monster's ATK, however, then it won't take any damage.ACTIVE/RESTED POSITIONS: When a monster attacks, 
defends, or intercepts an attack, it gets shifted from Active position 
(face-up, forwards) to Rested position (sideways). Monsters in Rested position are unable to attack/defend/intercept until they're shifted 
back to Active position at the start of your next turn.MOBBING: A monster in Rested position cannot defend, and is thus vulnerable to any attack, regardless of its DEF. Therefore, you can mob a high DEF monster with multiple attacks from different monsters. Because that monster cannot defend itself from all those incoming attacks, it will take damage.

CAPTURING BASICS: Your role as a GriMeister is to capture your opponents’ monsters with the mystic power of Grimoires - magical books with immense powers of confinement. Each basic Grimoire corresponds to one of the three basic types (ATK, DEF, HP). In order for a Grimoire to be able to capture a monster, its type must match the monster's type, and its MP must be greater than or equal to the remaining HP of the monster.CATCH BLOCKING: If you don't want your opponent to capture your monsters, you can block a capture with a Catch Block! Discard a card from your hand (monster or Grimoire) of the basic type that beats the basic type of Grimoire your opponent played, rock-paper-scissors style. 

ATK beats HP, HP beats DEF, and DEF beats ATK.BLOCK REVERSALS/FINAL BLOCK: If you've performed a Catch Block, your opponent can retaliate with a Block Reversal by discarding a card of the basic type that beats yours to make the capture successful. However, you can respond with a Final Block; again, discard a card of the type that beats your opponent's card type. After a Final Block, no more cards can be discarded to influence the outcome of the capture, and it is deemed unsuccessful.

RELIC BASICS: GriMeisters are able to wield Relics, ancient items that can be used at any time during the game,
 even during an opponent's turn or in response to an action! If utilized
 properly, they can turn the tides of a game in your favor! Use them 
wisely, as there can be only one of each unique Relic in the deck!RESOLUTIONS: If two or more Relics activate in response to one another, the effect of the last Relic that was played resolves first, and so on. In other words, effects resolve backwards.

ABILITY MONSTERS: Some monsters have abilities that they can use in order to gain the upper hand over an opponent! Ability Monsters generally have weaker stats than regular monsters, but they make up for it with their useful powers. Different Ability Monsters function in different ways: some monsters' abilities activate on summon, some can be activated on command by shifting the ability monster to Rested position, some activate automatically under certain conditions, and some have effects that last indefinitely.SP MONSTERS:  There exist Special (SP) Monsters with abilities so powerful that they can alter the course of the game, for better or worse. These mystical beings are so rare that there can only be up to 4 SP Monsters in a standard deck, and there can be only one of each unique SP monster in the deck!FUTURE EXPANSIONS: In each expansion, we will be able to add more mechanics to the game to make it even more interesting! All future mechanics will be optional, but will provide new options for players, as we'd like to keep the game fresh and exciting while keeping it as flexible as possible. In other words, players will be able to pick-and-choose which mechanics they like best and play with them while not feeling like they're missing out on something.

All of the 100 cards you'll ever need to play a standard game of GriMagia are included in a single box. This includes:
• 40 Monster Cards (4 SP Monsters)


Monsters are powerful creatures that roam the world of GriMagia, but can be tamed or sealed away with the power of magic.


• 40 Grimoires


Grimoires are magical books used by GriMeisters to capture monsters.

• 20 Relics


Relics are mysterious one-of-a-kind items that, when used at the right time, can aid their wielder in combat.



It's NOT a
 
TCG! Instead, GriMagia is packaged like a board game - all you'll ever need to 
play the game is in the box! Our primary focus with GriMagia was to make a fun game with great art, not to make tons of money selling booster packs.

The core gameplay is simple enough that it only takes a single game to get the hang of, but at the same time it achieves complexity in that there are many different options for players depending on which cards you decide to play and when, thus leaving a wide range of strategies open. Each cards' effects/abilities have different uses depending on when/how you use them, and each person will use them differently; it's up to you to determine your playstyle!

You can unite two monsters you control into one stronger monster; the types of monsters you unite will determine which of the monster's stat(s) gets boosted, and by how much. This has strengths and drawbacks; on one hand, the Unioned monster is more powerful and better suited to battle, and it may gain useful abilities. On the other hand, it means you have less monsters on the field, and it's a greater loss if that monster is captured by an opponent.

Since it's not a TCG, the standard mode of GriMagia is played with a shared deck of 100 cards instead of having each player build their own deck (though in non-standard modes, players will be able to build their own unique decks using expansions, if they choose).
 Each player draws from the same deck and discards to the same pile. 
This means that anything you can do to your opponent, they can also do 
to you, so watch out!


It's versatile and encourages creativity in players. There are multiple ways to play GriMagia; for example, in addition to standard mode, we've created a split deck mode and an RPG mode as well as a deckbuilding mode for more advanced players. Since all of the game's mechanics were designed to be flexible, the creation of new game modes is highly encouraged as well - the only limit is your imagination!

Board/card games with anime themed art like GriMagia's are extremely hard to come by in countries besides Japan, due to the effort required to translate, import, and localize those games, especially when it comes to physical board/card games.


  




Since GriMagia was created by a small company, we can't afford to print the game on a mass scale at high quality. And if we don't print GriMagia on a mass scale, we won't be able to get a bulk discount on printing in order to sell the game at a reasonable price. Therefore, we turned to crowdfunding for help, in order to ensure we can produce a high quality product at an affordable price!
Since we're doing a Fixed Funding (all or nothing) campaign, if we don't meet our goal, everyone will be refunded and we won't be able to print the game. That would be a huge shame considering the game's art and gameplay are complete, and it's already been rigorously playtested in several locations, including Anime Expo, card shops in Japan, and multiple colleges. So hopefully, with your support, we can reach our goal!
If we surpass our goal, the additional funds will go towards future additions to GriMagia, including the creation of expansions, additional promo cards, or even a possible digital version of the game for PC/mobile. These additions will all be displayed in Stretch Goals if our initial $13k goal is reached. The more we raise, the more we'll be able to create!

GriMagia T-Shirt

The t-shirt design is as follows and will look approximately as shown below. The shirts will be unisex (your choice of size*) and 100% cotton. They'll be screenprinted, so the design will feel as if it's part of the shirt and won't rub off like an iron-on.

*It's unfortunately more costly to produce larger shirts, so any size above Large will require a small additional fee.
XXS, XS, S, M, L: No extra charge
XL: +$5 USD
2XL: +$8 USD
3XL: +$11 USD
(Funders, either add the fee when contributing to the Lamia Tier ($70) or higher, or if you've already ordered a perk simply make a second contribution under the same name as before and select No Perk.)




GriMagia Mat

These mats will be standard 24x14'' (roughly 60x35 cm) size, the nice kind made of cloth with rubber backing. This makes them ideal for use with any game, not just GriMagia! We're going to allow our funders to vote on which design they like best out of the 5 below.








Uncut Promo SheetAn uncut sheet of the Indiegogo-exclusive promo cards! When we print the cards, they're printed on cardstock before being cut into individual cards. Uncut card sheets are considered collectors' items, and are usually only given out to tournament winners. The fact that this uncut sheet will be of the Indiegogo-exclusive promos only adds to its collector value!

GriMagia: Indiegogo-Exclusive Edition 

Indiegogo-exclusive edition of GriMagia with alternate-colored monsters and alternate flavor text for all the cards!


CUSTOM RARE SPECIES!

Design an alternate color palette for one of the monsters, which will be featured in the Indiegogo-exclusive edition of GriMagia with credit to you as one of the contributors!* (Certain rules/restrictions apply.***)


* Each monster may only have one alternate version. Monsters will be picked on a first come, first served basis.*** Rules:No copyrighted characters or trademarks; no sexually explicit content/excessive gore, or otherwise offensive material. However, palettes inspired by existing characters are fine!
CLARIFICATION: The Rare Species Tier uses previously drawn lineart somewhat as a “base” – the drawing can have expression changes/slight design modifications (such as accessories altered/added or horns changed, etc.) then will be colored again, and the background will be repainted to fit the monster better. So it’s not just ONLY a palette swap, per se, where we would just hue shift the drawing – there’s more freedom to it than that in what can be altered (and thus it is more work on our part).


CUSTOM MONSTER CARD!

Work alongside your artist(s) of choice to have the monster of your choice illustrated into a one-of-a-kind exclusive promo card! (Certain rules/restrictions apply.*)


* Rules: No copyrighted characters or trademarks; no sexually explicit content/excessive gore, or otherwise offensive material.

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcdream.com/images/arkham/12.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our story begins in Arkham, Massachusetts, 1929. Arkham is a town with a long history of paranormal disturbances. It’s also home to Miskatonic University, a storage house for ancient and forbidden objects of power. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcdream.com/images/arkham/12.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With the arrival of the Necronomicon, the greatest spellbook ever created, the fragile fabric of reality was torn and hell was unleashed upon the town. The precious stores of the university were looted, and the Necronomicon, the key to the beyond, was ripped to pieces in the chaos.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arcdream.com/images/arkham/12.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now, in a race against time, three factions fight to reclaim these ancient books and artifacts and control the oncoming tide of madness.</p>

<p><em>Video by Rachel K. Ivey. Video music by Kevin MacLeod.</em></p></div>","Gather your friends in this browser-based, free-to-play MMO and hunt down the unique fragments of the infamous book of deadly magical secrets, the NECRONOMICON!

Each piece of the Necronomicon unleashes amazing powers. It also has a chance to kill the operator, true, but what a small price to pay! Use these powers, if you dare, to turn the tide for your faction. Or struggle to gather enough fragments to perform a ritual to enhance your faction’s abilities. With the right fragments, the Deep Ones could summon mighty Cthulhu himself! Or gather and hide the fragments for later use.

Explore expansive environments. Struggle against dozens of monsters released by the power of the Necronomicon. Perform quests for Lovecraftian characters like Henry Armitage, Herbert West and Brown Jenkin. Explore famous Lovecraft locations such as Miskatonic University. Collect magic items and spells to use against your enemies. Upgrade your character in levels to gain access to new weapons and abilities.

Arkham is awash in secrets. Can you find all of them?

Miskatonic Mayhem!
Man thinks he is the master of his world, but forces exist far beyond his understanding. Those forces constantly threaten to tear through the fragile wall that separates our reality from madness. 

Our story begins in Arkham, Massachusetts, 1929. Arkham is a town with a long history of paranormal disturbances. It’s also home to Miskatonic University, a storage house for ancient and forbidden objects of power. 

With the arrival of the Necronomicon, the greatest spellbook ever created, the fragile fabric of reality was torn and hell was unleashed upon the town. The precious stores of the university were looted, and the Necronomicon, the key to the beyond, was ripped to pieces in the chaos.

Now, in a race against time, three factions fight to reclaim these ancient books and artifacts and control the oncoming tide of madness.


The Human faction is made up of scholars, detectives and thugs, either survivors of the Necronomicon “incident” or simply drawn towards the alluring mystery of the town and then trapped there. The only alternative to working together is to band together with inhuman hordes, so there is a fair amount of tension among the coalition, particularly the gangsters and the investigators. 


The Deep One faction is made largely of survivors from Y’ha-nthlei, the great Deep One city on Devil’s Reef that was recently attacked and destroyed by the U.S. Navy. Some were attracted to Arkham when they heard stories of the resurfacing of their mystical deity Dagon, while others were attracted by the opportunity to gain the Necronomicon’s power. Deep One society consists of two castes: “full-blooded” Deep Ones who can be centuries old and “halflings,” those born with a human parent and slowly transitioning to a full aquatic state.


The Ghouls are flesh-hungry, animalistic creatures with varying control over their primal instincts. They range from mindless, brutal zombies to cunning scientists and magic users who seek to turn their condition to their advantage. The ghouls are divided. Some seek power to reclaim more of their humanity. Others want the power of the Necronomicon to create a larger feast of flesh.

What You Get
Check out VIP Perks for the rewards for supporting H.P. LOVECRAFT’S ARKHAM in this fundraiser: Beta access, in-game credits, premium weapons and more!

And if you’re a longtime friend of Arc Dream Publishing there’s an extra bonus for supporting H.P. LOVECRAFT’S ARKHAM. We have a stake in the game. You get the fun of dynamiting Deep Ones, grenading Ghouls, hamburgerizing Humans and shotgunning shoggoths (um, good luck with that last one), AND the warm, fuzzy glow of knowing that it all supports our roleplaying games and fiction.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We're Lloyd, Jimmy, and Amber. We've been gamers for a long time, and running a store is a goal we share in common. FLGS stands for Friendly Local Game Store. A FLGS is a place for gamers and other geek-friendly people to hang out and play some games. We discovered that the name FLGS is available, and we're naming our store after this common acronym.</p>
</div>
<div>Game stores are great places for kids to hang out, learn developmental skills like resource management and problem-solving (but don't tell them that!) and meet new friends. We're talking about rubbing elbows, laughing with friends, and sharing stories about movies, comics, and The Big Bang Theory. Helping us get open keeps kids from working in meth labs through a false dichotomy!</div>
<p>Sure, FLGS isn't a city necessity like a fire station or a hospital, but it makes people happy.</p>
<h3>Our Business Principle</h3>
<p>Two-thirds of all ex-gamers say they quit because they ""can't find somebody to play with"". We plan to make ""finding somebody to play with"" our r<span dir=""auto"">aison d'être. The game room, the social networking, bulletin boards--the entire business model revolves around people enjoying the company of other people. </span></p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>inventory</strong>! We need current inventory to get people playing games again. Although we could spend $15,000 for this new inventory, we're willing to take it one step at a time. $2,000 will get us the most essential items.</p>
<p>We need to <strong>advertise</strong> to let people know about the stuff we have. We need about $1,900 to do a direct mail to the area around the store. We also plan to get an A-frame sign for the sidewalk so that all that traffic from NAS Jax sees us as they drive by. Those cost about $100.</p>
<p>Merchandise and advertising are our two most critical needs. No part of your contribution will go toward a salary toward the new owners. We believe in this project enough to not take anything out for at least a year. We really want this store to be the best it can be.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, everything we get goes is split between goodies for the shelves and a smaller mailout.</p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>Choose a contribution level. For your donation, you get specific game items or categories, usually at a significant discount. For the largest donations, you get blanket store credit that you can redeem however you want, all at a bonus. If we exceed our goal, we plan to introduce additional benefits for existing contributors.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's no rule that says you and your gaming group can't go in on one of the contributions as a group--as long as one person stands up and makes the contribution, you can split it however you want.</p>
<p><br/>In all cases, international contributors are responsible for shipping costs. Contact us for details.</p>
<p>$10 - Kobold Minion: You get 3 booster packs of Return to Ravnica. That's $2 off retail, it includes shipping.</p>
<p>$30 - Bugbear Brigand: You take home any RPG title worth $35 or less. Pick up the latest release or fill in a hole in your collection. Take a chance on a new game.</p>
<p>$31 - Ogre Champion: This one's similar but for minis. Get any minis blister or box worth $31 or less.</p>
<p>$50 - Hill Giant Chieftain: Settlers of Catan plus the 5-6 player extension. The retail price is $62. You save $12, and domestic shipping is included.</p>
<p>$100 - Fire Giant King: Get any Space Marine army box or corresponding box for another GW army.</p>
<p>$125 - Immortal Titan: A Booster box of Return to Ravnica, shipping included. That's $20 off retail.</p>
<p>$300 - Silver Dragon: You get a $360 gift certificate and credit on a plaque in the store.</p>
<p>$500 - Gold Dragon: You get a $625 gift certificate and everlasting fame identifying you as a Gold Dragon Contributor on our wall.</p>
<p>$1000 - Platinum Dragon: $1300 gift certificate and a plaque dedicated solely to you.</p>
<p><strong>NEW</strong> $2,500 - Publisher Extravaganza: For game manufacturers only. We'll buy $2,000 worth of your products through distribution and restock them for at least a year before we even check sales records.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Manufacturer Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>Choose one of the gift certificate rewards and a contribution level. You'll get a chance after the campaign to work out the details. We'll buy your products through distribution if available or directly if not.</p>
<p>The larger the contribution, the more effort we'll put into sales. For $100, we'll put it on the shelf and mention its arrival through our normal communication. At the $500 level, we'll run demo games and report sales levels to you afterward.</p>
<p><br/>Why support us? Two main reasons. One is that we can't keep track of everybody out there, and this gives you an automatic ""in"". More importantly, of course, is the potential for downstream sales, and it's why we love inventory. We'll restock anything that sells (okay, IF it sells within the first year. We have to be reasonable), and we'll keep restocking it. Your $50 donation could mean $500 in sales--and more as your SKU list grows.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>FLGS will be picking up the legacy of War Dogs Game Center, the last full-service game store in Jacksonville with all the main product lines and a game room. It brought the magic of games to millions of kids in Jacksonville. Okay, maybe not millions, but certainly thousands. </li>
<li>We'll be moving into Sun Coast Comics' old space. While some people are expected to become customers of the new online venture the current owners are starting, we'll be glad to take care of the customers who choose to stay.</li>
<li>Starting next year, we'll participate in Free RPG Day, offering a chance to get free games. It's a good opportunity to bring a friend in and get him hooked. </li>
<li>Since 2004, Lloyd has been writing business plans for other would-be store owners. He literally wrote the book on how to start and run a retail game store. You can be confident that this isn't a fly-by-night effort. No wasted contributions here!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, you can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share us on Facebook or Twitter or however you socialize with your friends.</li>
<li>You can use the Indiegogo share tools below to make it easier to tell people.</li>
<li>If you've already donated, pester your friends into contributing so that you can increase the value of your perk through our bonus perks.</li>
<li>If you want to get a tattoo of a QR code linking to this campaign, we'll provide your inker with the graphic. Go for it!</li>
</ul>

</h3><p></p><b>Who is behind Game Related?<br/><br/></b>
<p>Behind Game Related are Ebi Enisuoh and Brent Hutzal, Ebi is
the founder and takes care of the day to day operations of Game Related and
Brent is the CFO that takes care of Game Related`s financials. <br/></p><p></p><p>Ebi Enisuoh: Video games are my passion and always will be,
I have been working on Game Related for the past 5 years to solve a lot of the problems that gamers have and
find unfair with the way games are being sold and traded, I have a strong sales
background that has taught me to put customers over profit, innovation and
relationship building . I’m a family man who’s married to an awesome woman and
the most supportive wife ever, and a new dad to an unbelievably awesome little
boy who is now a year and 3 months. </p><p>Brent Hutzal: I provide professional and business services for small businesses in southwestern Ontario and the GTA, including Business Strategy, Consulting, Project Management, Bookkeeping, Remote Controller, and Remote CFO services. I love spending time with my wife and 4-year old daughter.</p><br/><p></p><b>Why is Game Related better than just trading my game in at my
local Game Stop, etc?</b><br/><p></p>
<p>We’re way better than ""<b>Big Box Stores</b>"" or any other video game
retailer because our goal is to get games to you at the lowest price possible. Our trading system is better because it’s built to put gamers first, with our
trade in system, you will never trade in more than 3 games to get the game you
want, so we give you more value for your used games, Our trade in system also gets you up to 3 games by trading in only 1 of your games. Your trade in
also benefits other gamers as well, giving them the opportunity to trade for the
games you traded in or buy them for $5 to $30, saving gamers more money than any
other retailer. </p>
<p><b>How are trades assessed? How does the star rating system
work?</b></p>
<p>All games in our data base are given a star rating of 1 to 3,
these star ratings are determined based on the age of the game, what gamers
thing about the game and how they feel about it, we then take that
information and give the game a rating of 1, 2 or 3 stars, 1 being games that
gamers have little to no interested in, to 3 being games that gamers are very
excited about and can’t wait to be released, <b>If extra copies of a game remains in our trade inventory for one month from it's release date, it will then be put on sale and discounted by 60% off it's retail price.</b> If a user wants a game, all they
have to do is offer enough games to equal the star rating of the game they want,
if a user offers a game that is above the star rating of the game they want,
they can select more games they want to equal the star rating of the game they
are offering. A game will keep it’s star rating for up to 4 months then
decrease by one star every 4 months and remain at one star until it is no
longer accepted by Game Related. </p>
<p><b>Why was Game Related started?</b></p>
<p>Game Related started as an alternative to corporate video
game retailers, we wanted to create something that put gamers first and was always looking for ways to save gamers money. We know a lot of gamers aren't
happy with the value they get for their used games and new games aren’t getting
any cheaper, so we set out to change that, by offering more value on used games
and in return selling those used games at very low prices. We then thought to
ourselves, ""How can we lower the cost of new games?"" We decided to sell all our new games at wholesale price and create a loyalty program that can be
used to discount new games even further. We want to get gamers to play and
discover more games for less money.</p>
<p><b>How can I browse available games?</b></p>
<p>You can always browse available games by checking our trade
or sell page, also on the trade and sell tabs on our home page, we don’t upload
games if we do not have them in our inventory.</p><p><b>What is the origin of the name?</b></p>
<p>When we came up with the idea, we wanted a platform where
gamers can buy, sell and trade anything related to video games, so we then
decided to call the site Game Related, as time went on we thought to ourselves
that there are too broad a range of video game related products so we
simplified the concept of the site for now.</p>
<p><b>Isn’t it expensive to mail my games?</b></p>
<p>Shipping is the one thing that we are constantly trying to
reduce; if you have a trusted network of people on Game Related you trade with,
you can ship without tracking for about $2.20 through Canada Post. If you are trading with Game
Related, we take care of the shipping cost. We introduced a lot of our
discounts to offset shipping as well so we can continue to have lower prices then any other retailers. </p>
<p><b>I’m not a heavy gamer, is this service for me?</b></p>
<p>Most definitely! By not being a heavy gamer meaning you don’t
want to spend a lot of money on the games that you do play, with Game Related
you save a lot of money by trading in the games that you no longer play to get
the new games you want for no more than $30. If you are not the type to buy
games when they are first released, then get a pre-owned copy with Game Related
from $5 to $30 and earn your $15 credit every time you spend $60 on pre-owned games that can be used to help you save more on new
games that you may want in the future.<span>  </span></p><b>Can you give me a real example of a trade?<br/><br/></b>
<p>A user recently traded their copy of Thief [PS3] (a 3
star game), for a new copy of Assassins Creed IV: Black
Flag [PS4] (a 2 star game) <i>and</i> a new copy of The Last
of Us [PS3] (a 1 star game).</p><p>Both of these games are
currently still over $60 each at retail, at the time of this writing.</p><p></p><p>In October 2013, a user traded in Asura's Wrath, Twisted Metal (PS3) and Street Fighter X Tekken ( all 1 star games) for Batman: Arkham Origins

Anarchy Reigns, and Crysis 3 ( all 1 star games) for Battlefield 4
for PS4 (a 3 star game at the time).<br/></p><p><b>Are there any restrictions? </b><br/></p><p>Currently no, but with our new updates there will be only one restriction, to add as much value to Game Related and offer those who buy pre-owned games from us the lowest prices possible, we will only accept trade in's going back as far as 2 years from the games release date. The reason being is because games that are really old are already sold at very low prices at retailers due to the lack of demand, even if we where to sell these games as low as possible, we would still have the additional cost of shipping, which would bring the cost of the game to the same price you would pay in store or slightly higher, and we are all about offering the lowest prices. Plus it gives our users the chance to trade those games with each other for way less then they would spend in store!  </p><p></p><b>How is shipping covered to Game Related?

<p>We believe strongly in our community and that's why we believe in crowd-funding. If you also believe in this project as much as we do, we urge you to help us. Crowd-funding gives us the ability to be personally connected to our community right from the beginning of development. You are the producers of our game.</p>

<p>We understand that this game is a huge undertaking. That's why we've spent the last half year working hard on developing a playable demo and alpha. And we have it.

<p><i>GMod Tower</i> was ambitious in itself and it's been available to the public for 5 years and from that you get an idea of how we handle ourselves.

We’re confident in what we’re doing and we can complete this project.</p>
<p>We estimate that this project will take us around 8 months to get feature complete - and once it’s ready we will launch an Early Access on Steam. It'll also help us get the feedback we need from the community as well as generate more interest and revenue to keep us going as a company.</p>
<p>Another risk that we take very seriously -- the Game Worlds.

Full list of funding milestones can be found near the bottom of the campaign.

Tower Unite is a community-based virtual world party game with online games, entertainment, and activities. Powered by Unreal Engine 4.Every aspect of Tower Unite allows for online multiplayer interaction. It's a living and evolving online game world, driven by the community. Play games online with your friends, or make new friends from around the world.Tower Unite isn't just a single game. It's a union of games, united by the community. It's all about having fun with friends!


Tower Unite will be available on PC, Mac, and Linux - distributed via Steam.




Play multiplayer games of various genres online with friends.
Customize yourself with clothing and accessories.
Use lots of different movement items such as jetpacks, wings, and rollerblades.

Furnish and design the layout of your personal space (the Condo) with furniture and interactive toys.


Invite other players over to your Condo for parties and mini-games.
Watch synchronized YouTube™ videos in a virtual theater or your Condo.
Hang out at a nightclub and listen to music synchronized with the environment and every other player!
Join official servers or host your own server.
Hang out with your friends or find new friends!

Remember when games had a single price for all the content? We do. Which is why Tower Unite has ABSOLUTELY...



Pay once and never again! Enjoy all that Tower Unite has to offer for just $15.




Steam Workshop support so players can add their own custom items to the game.

Receive free DLC for life and developer support.

Interact in new ways with gamepad support, and additional peripheral support in future updates.


We also plan to use every Steam feature available to us including: Steam Cloud, Inventory, Friends, VOIP, Achievements, Trading Cards, and Steam Workshop.
We'll be working towards proper VR intregration, starting with Oculus Rift and Vive!


Tower Unite isn’t just a walking around simulator. You can run, jump, crouch, use jetpacks, get drunk, dance, sit, stand, throw-up, lounge in pool tubes, give high fives, and much much more. You can of course also: voice chat, text chat, group up with friends, and party with your friends! The possibilities are endless!



Tower Unite comes equipped with a powerful multimedia system. Watch synchronized YouTube™ videos or listen to music from Soundcloud. We’ll be constantly adding support for more media services for you and your friends to share and enjoy from within the game.




Unlike other virtual world games, Tower Unite is hosted, managed, and powered by the players.
We will be hosting official servers, and you'll be able to host Tower Unite servers yourself!
There are two types of servers:

Ranked: Saves progress across all ranked servers and distributes Units (our in-game currency).
Free: Saves progress on its own server, doesn't distribute Units, but allows for complete customization of the gameplay.
You’ll also have a slew of moderation tools built in to handle players to enforce your own rules. With your own servers you can even create your own items and accessories, ranked or not!






Tower is made of up three main core sections of gameplay:

The Condo - your virtual home.
The Plaza - the gathering point that everything connects to.

The Game Worlds - games which let you earn units, to buy items with.





In Tower Unite everyone has their own personal space, which we call a Condo. This space is fully customizable, bottom to top. From the floor plan and the furnishings to the landscaping of the garden, you can tweak it however you like. It's a space that defines you, and acts as the gathering point for you and your friends.
Watch YouTube™ videos, listen to music on Soundcloud, or just chat with your friends.





From the Condo you can exit through your front door into a bigger online experience called the Plaza. The Plaza connects players from around the globe using an intuitive matchmaking system. If there is no Plaza to connect to - then you will automatically create one.
The Plaza acts as a gathering point, like a shopping mall. The Plaza has a casino, an arcade, theaters, stores, attractions, and Game World ports. You connect and meet new players at the Plaza.


Shops are available to further customize your look, condo, and more. You will be able to unlock clothing, furniture, toys, pets, and more.




 On top of that you'll be able to customize your avatar in various ways, such as:

Changing clothing
Altering height, weight, and definition
Adjusting facial features, including eye color
Altering hair color and style
Adjusting skin tone
Wearing tons of different accessories like hats, glasses, earrings, necklaces, wrist bands, watches, rings, backpacks, belt items, and particles.








The Arcade features interactive 2D games and numerous indoor activities such as bowling, and skee ball.








The Boardwalk is a relaxing oceanfront with constantly expanding outside activities like a ferris wheel, boardwalk games, pool, and water slides.




The Casino lets you gamble virtual chips with your friends. It has Blackjack, Slots, Roulette, Poker (Texas Hold 'Em, 5 Card Draw), and video machines.





The Theater and Nightclub are places where everyone can share and discover new videos and media with their friends.





The Plaza is an infinitely expanding location- based on community feedback, we plan to constantly provide additions and new activities to this area.
And here’s the cool part: once you’ve gotten a group of people together in the Plaza you can then go to a Game World.



Game Worlds are large multiplayer games that you can enjoy with 6-18 players, depending on the world’s rules.
Each Game World has its own gameplay mechanics and genre. We have 10 Game Worlds planned - and the more funding we get, the more Game Worlds we can deliver for the initial launch.


















As you play games in Tower Unite you collect points called Units. Units can be used to unlock furniture items, toys, clothing, and other neat in-game items. You can also gamble Units at the Casino, duel players for Units, and trade Units with other players.
Oh, and you have to earn Units. There will never be a way to purchase Units. Unlike most virtual world games, this isn't a pay-to-win game.
There will also be tons of achievements, in-game trophies, badges, and item-awards (milestones) to achieve. Tower Unite is very achievement heavy, allowing for strong replayability.


We want players to feel like they all have an equal chance at getting the items in the game. We care about our community and we strongly believe in the idea that a game should only incur a one-time cost (the purchase price) and that all of its content should be available at no extra charge.

Tower Unite is a spiritual successor of one of the most popular gamemodes on Garry’s Mod, GMod Tower. GMod Tower, which runs on the Source Engine, is where we invented the core ideas and concepts for Tower Unite. GMod Tower has been available for free to the public for over five years and has constantly evolved.
One of our strongest influence is our community. We have listened, discussed with, and implemented ideas that our players came up with. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for our community’s undying support for us. We’re proud to have 30 thousand active users on GMod Tower!
We’re keeping that same attitude for Tower Unite. That’s why everything that we implement will be made for the community or requested by the community. Just like we did with GMod Tower, we aim to have constant free feature updates for Tower Unite.



PixelTail Games is a small independent group of 9 talented people from all over the globe. Back in 2009, we bonded together over collective passion for GMod Tower, the very project that inspired Tower Unite. And just like that we realized quickly that we loved creating games and that we wanted to expand our efforts beyond the confines of a Source modification.
Over the years, we've passionately worked on free modifications for the Source engine. Specializing in online multiplayer games, such as GMod Tower, we enable players from around the world to connect with friends and have fun.
Projects such as:


GMTower, the massively multiplayer experience and Tower Unite’s predecessor.

Elevator: Source; a one of a kind coop elevator simulator.

Cinema, an online theater experience that allows you to watch movies and videos with your friends.

You can read more about us on our press site: http://www.pixeltailgames.com/press/

For over five years, we've been providing content to our community for free.
We love what we do, especially seeing the incredible amount of feedback from the community. Tower Unite is a large project that requires a decent budget to pull off. Without your help, it will never be possible for us to make this game.
For over a year, we have been iterating on concepts for Tower Unite as a standalone game and we are finally ready to make it happen. We shipped our last mod for the Garry’s Mod platform, GMod Tower: Lobby 2 and now we’re ready to make our own standalone title.
Tower Unite is more than a game-- it’s a social network. Meeting new people across the globe is a phenomenon that we love to contribute to. We believe that a standalone product which cultivates this is definitely worth making.
We believe strongly in our community and that's why we believe in crowd-funding. If you also believe in this project as much as we do, we urge you to help us. Crowd-funding gives us the ability to be personally connected to our community right from the beginning of development. You are the producers of our game.










This is a flex funding campaign, meaning every bit of the proceeds will go towards development of this game. Because Game Worlds are large projects in and of themselves, we have specific funding milestones (detailed in the funding rewards below) that will allow us to add more Game Worlds by early access release.
After the campaign is over, we will open voting on which Game Worlds should be developed first. We will always keep our backers and community up to date on all our plans going forward.


Our timeline for our project may change should we go over funding, as we will use the extra money to develop more Game Worlds.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can raise enough funds to get Clinton to the World Championships and Commonwealth Championships, this will be a <b>dream come true</b> for Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton's story is a great example that <b>NO OBSTACLE IS EVER TOO BIG</b>. He is an inspiration to me and I hope he will be an inspiration to you too.</p>

</ul>
<p>and was a finalist for Coach of the Year at the Waitakere Sports Awards, 2013.</p>
<p>My achievements are nothing compared to Clinton's but this is my second attempt to raise money for a fantastic cause (I completed the Oxfam 100km Trailwalk in 2007 where my teams and I raised $21,000 for Oxfam). My personal best for the marathon is 3:06:00 and I recently completed a 55km training run in 5:00:00.</p>

Clinton has to raise NZ$6000 to cover the cost of his travel and accomodation to the World Championships and Commonwealth Championships in Budapest in September 2013. He has already raised NZ$3000 himself and, together with your help, we would like to help him raise the rest.

All monies raised will go to Clinton Davies to cover his travel and accomodation costs

Donate $10 and you'll get a teaspoon of good karma coming your way

Donate $20 and you'll get a tablespoon of good karma coming your way
Donate $30 and you'll get a cup of good karma coming your way
Donate $40 and you'll get a bucket of good karma coming your way
Donate $50 and you'll get a shedload of good karma coming your way


The Impact
If we can raise enough funds to get Clinton to the World Championships and Commonwealth Championships, this will be a dream come true for Clinton.
Clinton's story is a great example that NO OBSTACLE IS EVER TOO BIG. He is an inspiration to me and I hope he will be an inspiration to you too.
Clinton has won numerous awards for his wrestling

Commonwealth Champs - Bronze medal - Greco Roman Men’s
74kg, 2009 and 2011
Oceania Champs - Gold medal - Greco Roman Men’s

New Zealand Champs - Gold Medal

– Freestyle Men’s 74kg, 2012
Blind Sportsman of the year 2008

and was a finalist for Coach of the Year at the Waitakere Sports Awards, 2013.
My achievements are nothing compared to Clinton's but this is my second attempt to raise money for a fantastic cause (I completed the Oxfam 100km Trailwalk in 2007 where my teams and I raised $21,000 for Oxfam). My personal best for the marathon is 3:06:00 and I recently completed a 55km training run in 5:00:00.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>RedCubed is a Minecraft server with a focus on Youtubers making good content. With our combined audience we decided it was time to bring YOU, the fans, into the game; but we need your help! Starting and hosting a server is expensive, and we want to do our best to give everyone the best minecraft server experience! This gives YOU a chance to be part of the RedCubed community! All the members of RedCubed will be making series on the server which will include you guys! Keep an eye on everyones channel they will be making videos promoting the campaign! And who knows maybe some of the fans like you who make videos on the server might get noticed and become a Cuber!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>Minecraft Server Startup</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If you remember we have had public servers in the past but they have been plagued with problems due to us having a lack of funding to properly rent a server. Doing this indiegogo ensures we have the proper funds to get this thing going off with a bang. To help convince you guys to donate we have added prizes! We will get the funds from IGG on the 15th of September and we are going to go for a smooth launch of the server on the first of October or a bit before then for all the people who donated for early access!</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h1 dir=""ltr""><span>What the funds are for</span></h1>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This time we are going to start the server right. In the past we rented cheap servers from sketchy websites. This time around we are looking at either buying a physical server if demand is super high or renting a verry nice one. If we buy a server our startup costs will be around eight hundred dollars with lesser monthly costs. Otherwise we will rent a server and that will cost around $180 a month and if this campaign is successful will run the server until the end of the year in which case we will reevaluate how much traffic the server is getting.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>

RedCubed is a Minecraft server with a focus on Youtubers making good content. With our combined audience we decided it was time to bring YOU, the fans, into the game; but we need your help! Starting and hosting a server is expensive, and we want to do our best to give everyone the best minecraft server experience! This gives YOU a chance to be part of the RedCubed community! All the members of RedCubed will be making series on the server which will include you guys! Keep an eye on everyones channel they will be making videos promoting the campaign! And who knows maybe some of the fans like you who make videos on the server might get noticed and become a Cuber!
 
Minecraft Server Startup
If you remember we have had public servers in the past but they have been plagued with problems due to us having a lack of funding to properly rent a server. Doing this indiegogo ensures we have the proper funds to get this thing going off with a bang. To help convince you guys to donate we have added prizes! We will get the funds from IGG on the 15th of September and we are going to go for a smooth launch of the server on the first of October or a bit before then for all the people who donated for early access!
 
What the funds are for
This time we are going to start the server right. In the past we rented cheap servers from sketchy websites. This time around we are looking at either buying a physical server if demand is super high or renting a verry nice one. If we buy a server our startup costs will be around eight hundred dollars with lesser monthly costs. Otherwise we will rent a server and that will cost around $180 a month and if this campaign is successful will run the server until the end of the year in which case we will reevaluate how much traffic the server is getting.
 
Stretch Goals
Depending on how awsome you guys are here are a couple more things that will happen if we get the funding!







500
The public server launches!


1000

Dedicated RedCubed Website!
Will feature fan videos screenshots and forums!



2500
Closed Public FTB Server!


5000
Public FTB server!


7500
The Minecraft Chronicles Season 4 Begins!


10000
?!?!


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help us. Get the word out and make some noise about the campaign. It was you guys the fans that built RedCubed up as an excellent community and private server and all the cubers believe that you will come through again so you can join us!
 
What you can expect from this campaign as it goes on
As the month goes on we will post teaser screenshots to this page. Also keep an eye on the cubers channels as they will be making videos to promote this campaign!

<h2>/// Shplem Jam Update ///</h2>
<h3>We had our own game jam at the end of April. We managed to get the whole team in one place for three days.</h3>
<h3>And this is the fruits of our labour:</h3>
<p>- designed some new exciting game mechanics,</p>
<p>- programmed an editor for building levels,</p>
<p>- started work on integrating OpenFeint,</p>
<p>- made 5 new character designs and some new animations,</p>
<p>- created lots of mood boards for different game worlds,</p>
<p>- planned and made icons for achievements and challenges .</p>

<h2><span>What is Shplem?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Shplem</strong> is a new game born from a simultaneous labour of a few students and freelancers at the <a href=""http://globalgamejam.org/2012/shplem"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Game Jam""><strong>2012 Scottish Game Jam</strong></a>.

<p>We were even more pleased when we won the <strong>Best Artwork award</strong> and were nominated in the <strong>Best Tech Award</strong>.</p>
<p>So we thought: “We did a lot in just two days. Maybe we should continue this project?”</p>
<p><img alt=""Shplem Awards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7-m3kcWumrM/T3xYQzw778I/AAAAAAAAACA/XqHSvTrURg8/s960/SHPLEM_indieGoGo%2520%25280-01-07-06%2529.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Shplem Awards""/></p>
<p>Couple of days later we won<strong> IGDA Scotland’s Top 4 Play Party Games</strong> (as voted by play party attendees).</p>
<p><strong>So then we thought: “People seem to really like it. We should develop this further... right?”</strong></p>
<p>Recently we were nominated for the <strong>Scottish BAFTA New Talent Award!</strong> We didn't win the prize but it sure was a fun night out in Glasgow!</p>
<p><img alt=""BAFTA"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dzAO1ltCxss/T3xaHn1IwMI/AAAAAAAAACM/CZ98hOG3t-o/s912/bafta.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""BAFTA""/></p>
<h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>And so now we are thinking: “Yeah! Let’s do this!”</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h2><span>Do what?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Release a full game</strong> with a minimum of 3 worlds - each with a minimum of 12 levels of increasing difficulty and challenges. We will have a challenge system so you can try out different gameplay styles.</p>
<p><strong>Make it cross-platform</strong>. We will start with a Windows 7 Mobile version. Possibly venture into a port for PC. Than invade iPhone and iPad. Then take over the rest of the known mobile world. Basically we want Shplem to be available for any Smartphone that you might be using.</p>
<p>In time we will update the game with <strong>new worlds, skins and features</strong> available for download.</p>
<p>Due to the way you control Shplem we think this would be an ideal game for any touch screen device.<strong> It’s just simple and addictive fun!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><span>How about the gameplay?</span></h2>
<p>Basically you project Shplem using a spring like mechanism. The goal is to gather small Shplems and avoid hostile obstacles. If you gather enough of your small friends you give birth to a new character that spawns in mirror like world.</p>
<p>Well... that is what we have after 2 days of development. But we want so much more.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>These are the features we are currently working on:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sequential collectables - a slightly puzzle element, where you will need to collect small Shplems in the right order.</li>
<li>Exploding collectables - excitable little Shplems that don’t like groups and have to be handled with extra care.</li>
<li>Moving Terrain - to make the world less static.</li>
<li>Moving enemies – to make the world even less static.</li>
<li>Portals – change the way you explore the worlds by introducing teleportation.</li>
<li>Multi-Shplem – control more than one Shplem at once.</li>
<li>Lightouts - the only source of light is the Shplem and environmental elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we will be able to do much more than this. <strong>Drop us a message if you have any suggestions!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Level Example"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SW9V2CojKZE/T3xWLnfCEQI/AAAAAAAAAB0/gAnDIuh8deM/s640/level.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Level Example""/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><span>If I help what happens with the funding?</span></h2>
<p>The most important thing for us is to get our <strong>team working together</strong>. We are talking about 7 people from different parts of UK . Lot of the work will be done remotely. Although that becomes troublesome and we need to organise regular meetings.</p>
<p>This is why we need to rent studio space, consider transport and communication costs. Every 2 week we will be organising 2-3 days of development under the same roof. We are used to this method of working due to our Game Jam experiences. This way we can synchronise our work and assure quality control over a complicated both technically and artistically project. Most of us have been together for 18 months doing game jams so we aren't new to each other and our strengths and weaknesses as a team.</p>
<p><strong>Actually, we already organised our first meeting!</strong> We will be working in Edinburgh on 27-29 April and hopefully expand Shplem world with new levels and features!</p>
<p>Another barrier for us is the lack of equipment. We need to get a Macbook for our programmers. This would greatly improve our development process and make those guys life much more easier. After pushing the game to Windows 7 Phone we will need to equip ourselves with an iPhone and iPad for testing the port to iOS. Our art team needs two Photoshop and one After Effects licenses. They are crazy talented people but need professional software to fully use their potential and meet tight time limitations of a development process. Our sound designer sure could use some basic reference speakers.</p>
<strong>We are UK based so we humbly ask for $8000 which is roughly equal £5000.</strong>
<p>First of all we will focus on organising development meetings. Secondly, we will focus on the most essential equipment. If we raise anything above our goal we will invest this money in promotion to ensure we get some decent publicity.</p>
<p>We are not paying ourselves for this. <strong>We just need a start-up fund so we can make Shplem a professionally developed, healthy looking blob.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What’s in it for me?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Every person which contributes any amount of money is entitled to the game after its release!</strong> It basically works like a pre-order. You can also get access to all game versions and<strong> all future DLC for just $5.</strong></p>
<p>Of course with higher contributions come<strong> extra prizes</strong> and possibilities to influence the game development from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Don't worry we will make sure that you are well informed and truly take part in creating something awesome, with weekly updates.</p>

What is Shplem?
Shplem is a new game born from a simultaneous labour of a few students and freelancers at the 2012 Scottish Game Jam. In just 48h we managed to develop a 3 level working demo.

Release a full game with a minimum of 3 worlds - each with a minimum of 12 levels of increasing difficulty and challenges. We will have a challenge system so you can try out different gameplay styles.

Lightouts - the only source of light is the Shplem and environmental elements.

Hopefully we will be able to do much more than this. Drop us a message if you have any suggestions!



If I help what happens with the funding?
The most important thing for us is to get our team working together. We are talking about 7 people from different parts of UK . Lot of the work will be done remotely. Although that becomes troublesome and we need to organise regular meetings.

What’s in it for me?
Every person which contributes any amount of money is entitled to the game after its release! It basically works like a pre-order. You can also get access to all game versions and all future DLC for just $5.
Of course with higher contributions come extra prizes and possibilities to influence the game development from the very beginning.
Don't worry we will make sure that you are well informed and truly take part in creating something awesome, with weekly updates.

<h3><strong>SPRINGRINS... WHAT?</strong></h3>
<p>Fast-paced action? Check. Galactic explosions? You bet. Rupture of the time and space continuum? Got it. <em>Mind-blowing special effects</em>? OF COURSE. This is a list of some, but certainly not all, of the things that you are not going to find in Springrins - and yet you will be enthralled and, without a doubt, you will fall in love with the adorable blue springrin in his vertical ascension trough the universe.</p>
<p>Join the most brave hero of Scotland, SpringrinBluck (Or just Bluck), in his not-so-epic adventure. He just wants to return to Earth, like every other springrin on the universe, in time for spring. However, space is full of dangers like black holes, wormholes, supernovas and asteroids!</p>
<h3><strong>HERE! HAVE SOME SCREENSHOTS!</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Bluck and the Supernovas!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://springrins.com/media/screen05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://springrins.com/media/screen04.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://springrins.com/media/screen03.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://springrins.com/media/screen02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM?</strong></h3>
<p>Well, the game is simple: Bluck must always go up. To achieve this, you can paint lines on which he can bounce and keep going up. The more you do, the better your score. Moreover, that is just the main game mode! Springrins counts with three very different gameplay modes (You still have to go up and make points and all that...)</p>
<h3><strong>YOU MAY OR MAY NOT, BUT MOST PROBABLY MAY NEED A PHONE TO PLAY THIS.</strong></h3>
<p>We intend to release Springrins for the iPhone App store, and eventually Android. Even more eventually, we may release it on the web. The game is already complete, it is functional and it is fun; we just need the final push to release it. Your final push.</p>
<h3><strong>HERE, HAVE A WALLPAPER!</strong></h3>

<p>We are very aware that the concept is most probably not revolutionary or innovative. But then again, our whole team consists of only two; the game developers of a micro-company yet-to-exist. Since time immemorial, we always dreamt of making videogames. We love them, they sometimes love us; it is the circle of life.  To make this game we had to learn the basics of game making, programming and even graphic design; and we are still learning, always and daily, to make better games.</p>
<p>We have many ideas (Some of them <em>are </em>revolutionary and/or innovative, mind you) but we choose to start with the most simple of them all: Springrins. Surprisingly enough, it quickly grew into its own franchise, and we are already making Springrins: Atmosphere Entry and Springrins: Maze.</p>
<p>And while it may be a game of simple design, it’s incredibly fun, lovable, difficult and rewarding.</p>
<h3><strong>NO. WE WILL NOT USE THE MONEY TO BUY SNACKS AND DVDS.</strong></h3>
<p>We would not be pledging money if we still had any. We didn’t wanted to come here and ask right away for your kindness, so we used most of our savings during the three-month developing time. However, once the game was finished we still needed to pay for the license of the graphic motor we used, Unity, which cost around 3,000 dollars. The remaining 2,000 dollars are to pay the Apple Developer License, for the music, some of the freelancers we hired from time to time and other minor things that we need to address.</p>

SPRINGRINS... WHAT?
Fast-paced action? Check. Galactic explosions? You bet. Rupture of the time and space continuum? Got it. Mind-blowing special effects? OF COURSE. This is a list of some, but certainly not all, of the things that you are not going to find in Springrins - and yet you will be enthralled and, without a doubt, you will fall in love with the adorable blue springrin in his vertical ascension trough the universe.
Join the most brave hero of Scotland, SpringrinBluck (Or just Bluck), in his not-so-epic adventure. He just wants to return to Earth, like every other springrin on the universe, in time for spring. However, space is full of dangers like black holes, wormholes, supernovas and asteroids!
HERE! HAVE SOME SCREENSHOTS!

HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM?
Well, the game is simple: Bluck must always go up. To achieve this, you can paint lines on which he can bounce and keep going up. The more you do, the better your score. Moreover, that is just the main game mode! Springrins counts with three very different gameplay modes (You still have to go up and make points and all that...)
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT, BUT MOST PROBABLY MAY NEED A PHONE TO PLAY THIS.
We intend to release Springrins for the iPhone App store, and eventually Android. Even more eventually, we may release it on the web. The game is already complete, it is functional and it is fun; we just need the final push to release it. Your final push.
HERE, HAVE A WALLPAPER!

<h3>              Engineerius - the quiz board game about important stuff</h3>
<p>Have you ever experienced playing a quiz board game where all the questions <em>you</em> know are missing? There are several types of these quiz board games available for the curious and inquiring minds. These games have several different categories and editions, specializing within eras, areas of interest, different age groups and other differentiating factors. Even though these board games have various categories that appeal to a specific area of interest and knowledge, there is a lack of educational and entertaining quiz board games specifically specializing within the areas of engineering, science and technology.</p>
<p>It's not rocket science. Or is it?</p>
<p>This is where we come in. Engineerius is a quiz board game developed by engineers for engineers, scientists and techies, originated from Norway. Engineerius offers you, as a scientist, engineer and techie, to show off your knowledge and skills. The board game offers high quality and challenging questions and answers within categories such as:</p>

<p>After selling out most of our board games in Norway, we want to offer others the same joy of winning. Not for knowing random information, but knowing important and interesting information. So we are launching the first English edition of Engineerius and we are very excited to have you join us! Do you have an above average interest in science, engineering and technology? Then this is the game for you!</p>

<h3>                               Why Enginerius? Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>All of our crowd sourced questions are translated into English and just waiting to challenge the young and healthy minds of United States. The is one thing though. We need some help to get started with production of the first English edition. This is where you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the pledged funds wil be used to cover production and shipping costs related to releasing the first English edition. We are so excited!</li>
<li>There is already great interest from stores, especially in the Boston and California area, that wants to sell this unique game. It will also be available for purchase online, which means you will be able to challenge others (and hopefully win) if we make the pledge. No pressure.                               </li>
<li>We will still try to complete production, even if the pledge goal is not reached. It will only take some more time.</li>
<li>In order to show our appreciation through the magic of internet, we have gathered a bunch of perks for those of you who decide to pledge.</li>
<li>Even if you don't pledge, we are very grateful that you kept on reading for this long. So thank you! You are still awesome!

<p>We take lots of pride in being able to offer you this unique and one of a kind board game and we believe that Norwegians shouldn't be the ones having all the fun.

Have you ever experienced playing a quiz board game where all the questions you know are missing? There are several types of these quiz board games available for the curious and inquiring minds. These games have several different categories and editions, specializing within eras, areas of interest, different age groups and other differentiating factors. Even though these board games have various categories that appeal to a specific area of interest and knowledge, there is a lack of educational and entertaining quiz board games specifically specializing within the areas of engineering, science and technology.
It's not rocket science. Or is it?
This is where we come in. Engineerius is a quiz board game developed by engineers for engineers, scientists and techies, originated from Norway. Engineerius offers you, as a scientist, engineer and techie, to show off your knowledge and skills. The board game offers high quality and challenging questions and answers within categories such as:
     
After selling out most of our board games in Norway, we want to offer others the same joy of winning. Not for knowing random information, but knowing important and interesting information. So we are launching the first English edition of Engineerius and we are very excited to have you join us! Do you have an above average interest in science, engineering and technology? Then this is the game for you!
 
“A very cool concept and the product look amazing. I will definitely buy a copy of this game.” - Christopher Mirabile, Launchpad Venture Group
 


                               Why Enginerius? Why Indiegogo?
All of our crowd sourced questions are translated into English and just waiting to challenge the young and healthy minds of United States. The is one thing though. We need some help to get started with production of the first English edition. This is where you come in:

All of the pledged funds wil be used to cover production and shipping costs related to releasing the first English edition. We are so excited!
There is already great interest from stores, especially in the Boston and California area, that wants to sell this unique game. It will also be available for purchase online, which means you will be able to challenge others (and hopefully win) if we make the pledge. No pressure.                               
We will still try to complete production, even if the pledge goal is not reached. It will only take some more time.
In order to show our appreciation through the magic of internet, we have gathered a bunch of perks for those of you who decide to pledge.
Even if you don't pledge, we are very grateful that you kept on reading for this long. So thank you! You are still awesome! You can also like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter. It's free and it keeps you updated on what's going on. Know a geek? Of course you do! Help us by using the Indiegogo share tools and tell them about us.

 
“This game is exactly what we could use here in our shop. People would eat this stuff up! We want to buy it when it is ready for the US market” - Claudia Majetich, Store Manager MIT Museum


                          
                         Challenge by educating and entertaining
We take lots of pride in being able to offer you this unique and one of a kind board game and we believe that Norwegians shouldn't be the ones having all the fun. By giving us your pledge, you will not only help us release the first English edition of our game, but you will have an impact on the intellectual future of your fellow countrymen. Help us brighten people's minds and make science fun. For more information, please visit our website www.engineeri.us or shoot us an email.

<div><br/></div>
<div>Hello!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is Erick Harding and I created a card game called Legacy!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was tired of games being over simplified and not very creative. i mean simple is good, however my mind craves something where i have to really think and explore possibilities  to come up with new and interesting things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i really like to make people think differently.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The game itself was converted from a Role playing game i made when i was younger, and converted it over the years to a card game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I am raising money to fund a Prototype of my card game at <a href=""http://www.legacytcg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.legacytcg.com</a>.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i am hoping to create a new type of card game , adventurous and creative, i want this card game to FEEL like a role playing game.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If my goal is not met my card game may never see the light of day, as have no real job, i have a sleeping disorder which prevents me from working a normal job, so i have to work from home. this work is unsteady at best, so i have to pretty much sell everything i own in order to pay for a programmer.</div>

Hello!

My name is Erick Harding and I created a card game called Legacy!

i was tired of games being over simplified and not very creative. i mean simple is good, however my mind craves something where i have to really think and explore possibilities  to come up with new and interesting things.

i really like to make people think differently.

The game itself was converted from a Role playing game i made when i was younger, and converted it over the years to a card game.


The Impact
I am raising money to fund a Prototype of my card game at www.legacytcg.com.

i am hoping to create a new type of card game , adventurous and creative, i want this card game to FEEL like a role playing game.

If my goal is not met my card game may never see the light of day, as have no real job, i have a sleeping disorder which prevents me from working a normal job, so i have to work from home. this work is unsteady at best, so i have to pretty much sell everything i own in order to pay for a programmer.

this prototype will help me in ways you cannot imagine.
 


What We Need & What You Get

What we need is 2200 dollars for a Working prototype and a playable game. 

once this prototype is created we can begin Alpha and Beta testing. 

once this prototype is complete we can  raise more money with this prototype and hire artists and graphics gurus to come in and make the game and website look much better.

i intend to release this game on the Iphone/ipad and other devices as well as on PC and mac.

Should my goal not be reached the money will still go to the programmer to get as far as we can and i will scrape and sell what i can to try and meet the rest of the money.

well now for the fun part. the Perks!

The initial introductory set of this game has around 300 cards.  around 160 cards are going to be released upon Launch of the website.

several of those cards are completely unattainable by anyone other than investors.

i have set aside some Swag for people who are kind enough to donate for this cause.


1 - 1 dollar donation and above gets you a Unique card available to no one else but investors.

5 -  5 dollar donation or higher gets you into the beta as well as a unique card.
 
10 - 10 dollar donation gets you into alpha and beta, and unique card.

25 - 25 dollars or higher gets you into the pre-alpha and beta and 2 unique investor cards.

50 - 50 dollars or higher grants you access to pre-alpha and beta and 2 unique investor cards and all of the concept art not seen by anyone else as well as a Poster of your favorite card signed by the artist.

100 - a donation of 100 dollars or more gets you access to pre-alpha and beta, 2 unique investor cards all the concept art and a poster of your favorite card signed by the artist as well as a Hat and t-shirt sporting the Legacy logo.

500 - an amazing 500 dollar donation gets you into the pre-alpha and beta, 2 unique investor cards, all concept art available, a poster of your favorite card, a jacket, hat, poster,t shirt and a unique prize, a Custom card of a character made by you, with the way you want him to look and pose. within the game balance rules of course.
