<h3>Our Story</h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
 Kronberg Ensemble is a full-time, professional string chamber ensemble,
 consisting of a core group of 6 to 18 players, dedicated to the 
performance of classical music and education for all ages. The group’s 
primary purpose will be to perform a wide range of string chamber music 
repertoire from Baroque to Modern for audiences initially in the Midwest
 region of the United States, where it is bas<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ed.
 Additionally, the group serves as an educational entity through 
performances, workshops, private coaching, and masterclasses.</span>
</h3>
<p>The Kronberg Ensemble is just starting out and trying to attain our 
non-profit status.  Our fundraising goal may be less exciting than others, but our mission promises to make this journey an exciting one.  We want to make classical music accessible and 
enjoyable for EVERYONE, not just those with lots of money.  We hope that
 free concerts will attract new listeners of our generation (the 20 and 
30-something crowd).</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Because the Kronberg Ensemble is in its infancy, our activities are being paid for, out of pocket, by our founder.  A $20 fee here and there for state filing or opening a bank account with the local credit union was manageable, but it is going to take a lot of effort (and a lot of packets of ramen instead of real food) for our founder to pay the $850 I.R.S. filing fee on her own.   <br/><br/>Filing with the I.R.S. for non-profit 501(c)(3) status will allow us to apply for grants to bring classical music to people around the country who would not have a chance to experience it otherwise. Grants also help to pay our performers who have chosen to be a part of something larger than themselves.  Because this is a professional group, our musicians will never be forced to go without pay for playing.<br/><br/>It isn't the end of the world if we don't make our entire goal, but every dollar (or ten) donated gets us that much closer to providing chamber music and education for EVERYONE, not just those who have disposable income.  <br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $850 to pay the filing fee for non-profit status with the I.R.S.  The remaining portion of the $1,200 goal will go towards helping us purchase QuickBooks software to do our own accounting (and save money on hiring a bookkeeper).  Right now the I.R.S. fee, followed by QuickBooks are our priority, but any additional funding we receive will go towards paying the musicians of the Kronberg to play future concerts. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>What you get:  <br/>See the contribution perks!  They're pretty sweet.<br/><p><br/></p>

<p><strong>About the Festival of Lights</strong></p>
<p>Production group Taos Tandoori brings together internationally acclaimed ensembles Music Meets Bells, from Kolkata, India, and Sangeet Millennium, from Austin, Texas, who team up for the first time ever to present the Festival of Lights in the Land of Enchantment, a four-day “journey of the senses,” Oct. 24-27. You will experience world-class concerts, Indian dance and Indian and Indo-jazz music workshops, Tandoori cuisine, yoga sessions with live music, and more … all in the visually stunning, artistically inspiring setting of Taos, New Mexico.</p>
<p>The showpiece concert of Indian classical music, Odissi dance, and Indo-jazz fusion music will take place Saturday, Oct. 27, 7:30 p.m., at the iconic Old Martina’s Hall, a historic 230-year-old adobe venue much-beloved in Taos. Friday, Oct. 26, an inaugural night Tandoori dinner with the artists will be served at the historic La Posada de Taos Bed &amp; Breakfast, just two blocks from the Taos Plaza, followed by an impromptu Indian music performance. </p>
<p>Workshops and yoga sessions with live music will take place Oct. 24, 25, and 26. Times and locations TBA. Check <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/taostandoori"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/taostandoori</a> and here for updates. </p>
<p>If you cannot travel to the Festival Lights, we will bring it to YOU by providing a live event CD and DVD to contributors of $40 or more.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Like the mix of spices for which it named,<strong> Taos Tandoori</strong> brings the sights, sounds and tastes of India to Taos. Producer Ana Chávez is a native New Mexican and resident of Taos for 24 years.</p>
<p><strong>Sangeet Millennium, one of the leading world music ensembles in central Texas,</strong> presents traditional and new music and dance of the Indian subcontinent through collaborative and interactive performance, workshops, classes, festivals, and films. Founder and Director <strong>Amie Maciszewski</strong> is a sitarist, music educator, ethnomusicologist, and native of New Mexico. Saxophone player/composer <strong>Paul Klemperer </strong>is a regular collaborator<strong>. </strong>Both are based in Austin, TX.</p>
<p><strong>Music Meets Bells</strong> is a unique experimental duet between the sensuous temple dance form Odissi and the 100-stringed Indian hammered dulcimer santoor. It is a musical conversation on stage—jamming together! Music Director <strong>Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya</strong> isa maestro of the santoor and an internationally acclaimed performer and composer, named as Rotary International’s Global Ambassador for Peace and Goodwill. His wife and professional partner, <strong>Guru Sanchita Bhattacharya,</strong> acclaimed by the Edmonton (Canada) Journal as the “ambassador of Odissi dance around the world,” is also recipient of the Shree Kshetra Mahari (revered temple dancer) award from the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Orissa, India, among numerous awards.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We need your contributions to cover the costs to produce this event, including production costs, and artists’ travel costs and fees. The amount raised from tickets sales along is not sufficient to cover these costs.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Each of our nine levels of giving offers a unique package of benefits that you can customize, regardless of whether you plan to attend the Festival or would like to “listen in” through live recordings and support the artists’ efforts in other ways. Benefits include discounts at La Posada Bed and Breakfast, the chance to help light the lamp at the opening night dinner, free admission to the workshops, VIP seating at the concerts, public acknowledgement, signed live event CD and DVD recordings with your name in the support credits, and more.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> <strong>WHAT WE NEED:</strong></p>
<p>Our Indiegogo fundraising <strong>GOAL</strong>: <strong>$4500</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need this to cover artists' travel expenses and fees, as well  videography and photography of the event. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em>If we don’t reach our entire goal</em>, we will still use whatever funds we raise to pay the artists’ travel expenses and fees but will seek in-kind contributions for ground transportation and lodging. Since the video and photo shoot is an essential part of the project, we may have to set up a barter arrangement with the videographer/photographer.</p>

<h3>Time to make a record...</h3>
<p>This project has been a long time coming. I've always loved playing music, recording, writing songs, and leading worship. After much thought, prayer and many great conversations with many great friends, I've decided it's time to record an EP of original music - songs written specifically for the church. I've had all kinds of experiences shape me and inspire me - leading worship in Southern Ontario in my teens, touring with a worship team from Heritage Bible College, my time at Briercrest writing, recording and leading worship with Elevate, and my last 4 years working in Lethbridge at the E-Free Church.</p>
<p>There's a TON of 'worship' music out there these days, but I think there is still a need for great songs that can be sung by the church - songs with simple melodies and rhythms, truth packed lyrics which inspire and challenge, and music/arrangemets that are compelling when played by a single person or a worship team of 15. I've talked to many of my friends who work and lead worship in other Canadian and American churches, and they agree.</p>
<p>In Feburary of this year, I made my first trip down to Nasvhille to start things off with Ben Reynolds (a Canadian friend and writer, producer, artist extrordinare - <a href=""http://www.benreynoldsmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.benreynoldsmusic.com</a>) and Jason Germain (one of the frontmen in Downhere, and also a fellow Canadian!) who are producing this project for me. I've got a second trip planned for early August to finish up all of the recording, and then a brief trip sometime in October (with any luck) to sign off on all of the mixes and final stuff.</p>
<p>I'm really excited about this project - I'm not looking to quit my day job or become famous, but to help lead people deeper in their discipleship with Christ through great music that we sing together. Recorded music is the way in which our culture speaks best these days, so I'm jumping in. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading this so far, and I'd love it if you'd consider partnering with me by pre-ordering the album or some other cool perks. Every dollar helps, and this project is going ahead regardless of how much I raise - I'd just love to be able to keep paying my mortgage and feeding my family this fall. I think there's something really significant about a project like this and it being comissioned by the community of people around me - I feel honoured and inspired to ask you to help.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>(okay, no one's asked any of these yet, but I'm figuring you would at some point...)</p>
<p><strong>Where's the money going?</strong> - Recording music well costs money. Thankfully, it's WAY cheaper than it used to be! I've already completed the first trip of three down to Nashville and started the recording process. Much of the money is going to the people who help to make this happen - paying for production time, studio time, mixing time, mastering time, and musican time. Some of the budget is for travel, and some is for the costs of producing the physical copy of the CD. There are lots of things I'm NOT budgeting for and am trying to do myself or foregoing - graphic design, marketing, and the first part of the project which I payed for out of pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you going to Nashville? Aren't there studios here, isn't there one at your church?</strong> - Yes, we actually do have a really great setup at the church where I work, but it's a great setup for good demo stuff. The reason I'm going down to Nasvhille is mostly to get the expertise and experience of Ben and Jason, as well as the other friends we'll bring in for this. The gear and know-how down in Nasvhille is also well beyond what I've got access to at our little setup, and to go up to Calgary or somewhere else and rent the same gear would actually cost just as much (including travel expenses). I'm enjoying the opportunity to get away and hope to be bringing lots of things back with me to do recordings here at home in the future.</p>
<p><strong>I want something that's not on your list of perks, can I get it?</strong> - Send me a message and I'm sure we can work something out. You can't have my wonderful family, but I'm sure we could have you over for dinner or something.</p>
<p><strong>I'd like to help with support, but I don't really want the perk/I don't want the whole perk</strong> - Thanks for your generosity! That's easy to do - just click 'contribute now' and there's an option for just a contribution with no perk. If you'd like to give MORE than the perk amount but a smaller perk, select this option and just put what you want in the comment section.</p>
<p><strong>I can't give you any money, can I still be involved?</strong> - Of course you can! I always appreciate your encouragement and prayers throughout this whole thing. You can also give me a hand by spreading the word about this project - throw it on your facebook, email it to your friends, tweet it to your neighbours, anything helps! Indegogo has some really easy 'share' tools which will link right in to whatever social media is your thing, so check it out.</p>
</div></div>","Time to make a record...
This project has been a long time coming. I've always loved playing music, recording, writing songs, and leading worship. After much thought, prayer and many great conversations with many great friends, I've decided it's time to record an EP of original music - songs written specifically for the church. I've had all kinds of experiences shape me and inspire me - leading worship in Southern Ontario in my teens, touring with a worship team from Heritage Bible College, my time at Briercrest writing, recording and leading worship with Elevate, and my last 4 years working in Lethbridge at the E-Free Church.
There's a TON of 'worship' music out there these days, but I think there is still a need for great songs that can be sung by the church - songs with simple melodies and rhythms, truth packed lyrics which inspire and challenge, and music/arrangemets that are compelling when played by a single person or a worship team of 15. I've talked to many of my friends who work and lead worship in other Canadian and American churches, and they agree.
In Feburary of this year, I made my first trip down to Nasvhille to start things off with Ben Reynolds (a Canadian friend and writer, producer, artist extrordinare - www.benreynoldsmusic.com) and Jason Germain (one of the frontmen in Downhere, and also a fellow Canadian!) who are producing this project for me. I've got a second trip planned for early August to finish up all of the recording, and then a brief trip sometime in October (with any luck) to sign off on all of the mixes and final stuff.
I'm really excited about this project - I'm not looking to quit my day job or become famous, but to help lead people deeper in their discipleship with Christ through great music that we sing together. Recorded music is the way in which our culture speaks best these days, so I'm jumping in. 
Thanks for reading this so far, and I'd love it if you'd consider partnering with me by pre-ordering the album or some other cool perks. Every dollar helps, and this project is going ahead regardless of how much I raise - I'd just love to be able to keep paying my mortgage and feeding my family this fall. I think there's something really significant about a project like this and it being comissioned by the community of people around me - I feel honoured and inspired to ask you to help. Great art speaks to people in ways in which simple words cannot and I'm excited to give back my mere gifts and skills in a way which I hope will serve and inspire the community.
Stay tuned throughout this campaign for videos of me doing simple acoustic videos of a few of the songs that'll be on the disc! And feel free to check out my blog at www.davesiverns.com or follow me on twitter.

<h2>PROJECT<strong> OPENED TO ALL FACTIONS IN RELICS.</strong>
</h2>
<p>Originally this project was meant to be a pre-order system for the Nuem new faction that allowed people to pre-order a Nuem starter and get some extras if enough people ordered.</p>
<p>Then we were asked to open it to the other factions, and as we like to listen to what you say and try and meet your requests, we did just that!</p>
<p>You can find the original project pitch down below the ----- if you are interested in taking a look, but all you need to read now is what is above that line!</p>
<h3><strong>Current Stretch Targets</strong></h3>
<p><strong>If the project hits</strong><strong> $13,000</strong> we will have the postcard artwork for the Britanan, Orcnar and Vaettir done and add them to the pile!</p>
<h3><strong>Already achieved Stretch Targets</strong></h3>
<p>Every backer who backs the project with a TARGET BUSTER Perk will receive the Perk they chose plus the following</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Relics rules in PDF format</em></li>
<li><em>A single choice<strong> for each starter set</strong> you have in your Perks from a SpecialisPueri,  Britanan Company Sergeant Major, Orcnar Niwian or Vaettir Evocatour<strong>.</strong></em></li>
<li><em>A single choice <strong>for each starter set</strong> you have in your Perks from a pack of Auxilium Concursus, Britanan Marksmen, Orcnar Grymann or Vaettir Elvspon</em></li>
<li>
<em><em>A single choice <strong>for each starter set</strong> you have in your Perks from a</em> pack of Britanan Highlanders, a</em><em> pack of Orcnar Angilde, a</em><em> pack of Vaettir Cwalu, a</em><em> Pack of Nuem Auxilium Sagittarius</em>
</li>
<li><em>A single choice for each starter set you have in your perks from a pack of Nuem Tormenta (Will need concepting!), Britanan Company Colour Party, Orcnar Spatga (Will need concepting!), Vaettir Cylod (Will need concepting)</em></li>
<li><em><span><em>A single choice<strong> for each starter set</strong> you have in your Perks of </em>10 x custom d6 dice with the faction logo of your choice on the 6 plus a drawstring dice bag with the faction logo screen printed on.</span></em></li>
<li><em><span><em>Pack of four full colour Nuem art postcards (Check out the Gallery tab for a preview of the first two cards!)</em></span></em></li>
</ul><p>NOTE: Your choices above DO NOT have to be the same faction as your starter set/s.</p>
<p><strong>How does this project work?</strong></p>
<p>When you contribute to this project and choose a perk with Target Buster in it’s text, you will get the perk you chose plus all stretch targets we set.</p>
<p>However, it is slightly more expansive as that because depending on which perk you choose will determine how much from each stretch goal you get:</p>
<p>If you choose a perk called: Get a Different Starter, Nuem Starter Set or Nuem Starter plus Rulebook you will receive the choice of one option form each stretch target!!</p>
<p>If you choose the perks that give you two starters (or contribute twice and choose the options above twice) you will get two choices from each stretch target!!</p>
<p>Basically, the number of starter sets you are getting denotes the number of choices you get from EACH stretch target!!</p>
<p>So, contribute enough time and choose the ‘Get a different starter’ three times and you will get three choices from each stretch goal!</p>
<p>In addition, ALL Target Busting Perks will also receive a <strong>FREE copy of the Relics PDF rules</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>When do I get my stuff???</strong></p>
<p>Once the project is complete, we will email everyone to find out what their choices are for each target we exceeded. We will include the Relics full rules pdf in this email for you.</p>
<p>The goods will hopefully be sent out within 6 weeks of the project end - But that really depends on how we do. If we hit the targets for more sculpts, we need to get them sculpted and cast first so obviously this takes time. But we hope it won't be longer then 6 weeks after the project ends.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading Your Perk - Just 'cause you want too!</strong></p>
<p>If you've already selected a Perk but want to upgrade a more expensive non-limited perk, all you need to do is contribute the difference between the two perks, then email us with the details and we will adjust your perk in our records.</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade to a limited perk please email us first.</p>
<h3><em>How Much is Shipping Going To Set Me Back?</em></h3>
<p>Nothing, zero, nil, zilch, nowt, nada. Yep, Nothing. No matter where your models are going, you will pay nothing for basic land based shipping.</p>
<p>If you wish for your pile of swag to be sent with tracking, you will need to add $10 if outside the UK to your pledge.</p>

The journey had been treacherous thus far and their numbers had been thinned along the way but as Thantos walked out into the clearing and the blinding light of the sun beamed down upon his pale sunken face he felt a strange twinge of a feeling that he had almost forgotten, hope.</em></p>
<p><em>He stood and enjoyed its warmth for a moment but as he looked down into the valley something startled him and he suddenly ducked behind the nearest boulder.

<p><em>“Why have you stopped Thantos? It’s not safe here!”</em></p>
<p><em>The young Dolor ranted his words and sprayed Thantos with an unhealthy dose of spittle.</em></p>
<p><em>“Shhhh!”</em></p>
<p><em>Thantos stared him dead in the eye and lifted his left drill arm to his lips like one might do with a finger when hushing an unruly child.</em></p>
<p><em>“Keep low Cerctes and tell me I am not imagining things, take a glance out over that clearing there.”</em></p>
<p><em>Cerctes faintly nodded and gingerly moved to look out where Thantos had directed him. As he looked out into the valley he saw them, Orcnar, hundreds of them in all shapes and sizes. He slumped back down out of sight and grinned at Thantos.</em></p>
<p><em>“What did you see Cerctes?”</em></p>
<p><em>Cerctes paused for a moment and then smirked.</em></p>
<p><em>“Fresh meat for us to butcher my dear Thantos!”</em></p>

<p>Tor Gaming is a Tabletop Wargames producer based in the UK. We are best known for the Stitchpunk wargame Relics. Not surprising really as it’s our only game at the moment! Relics is a unit skirmish game in the 28mm scale. You can check out the <a href=""https://www.box.com/shared/static/044624f3497cdc0d33f1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Relics Free Rules"">light version of the rules here</a> with some of the most original concepts around!</p>
<p>We’re using this project is a sort of ‘Pre-order Plus’ system. Back the project (effectively Pre-order the Nuem listed on the reward you choose) and you are guaranteed to get the reward you have chosen, no matter if we meet our target or not. And not only the Nuem, we have included some rewards for the other factions to help you get into the game!</p>
<p>But, it doesn’t end there! The more people that back the project the more we can give away to everyone claiming specific rewards!! As we hit targets that we define as the project grows, we will add more to your rewards for no extra cost. </p>
<h3><em><strong>What Do They Look Like?</strong></em></h3>
<p>The Nuem are sadomasochistic Dwarfs. Oh, and they tend to wear clock work suits of armour and wield chains and drills and stuff as weapons.</p>
<p>The Dedicatus pack comes with one of two sculpts, one standing and one running. Both sculpts come with arm options to build either the Metus or the Dolor. If you chose the Reward of a Dedicatus Model, we will send you the sculpt you prefer.</p>
<p>Both sculpts also come with face plates to make their suits enclosed.</p>

<h3><em><strong>So, How Is It Going To Work?</strong></em></h3>
<p>Pure and simple, you pledge for the reward you want and you will get it guaranteed. It doesn’t matter how much we raise, you will get what you asked for at the very least.</p>
<p>If the reward you selected has the text ‘TARGET BUSTER’ in it, the more that is pledged to the project, the more YOU will get! Let’s take a look at an example (the following is just an example...The actual targets and rewards may be differ):</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>You pledge for the NUEM STARTER SET – That is yours, guaranteed. It will be sent out to you once we have them produced. The project has an initial target of $XXX. If we do not hit this target, no worries – you will still get your Nuem Starter Set. However, if we do hit the target then in addition to your NUEM STARTER SET, you will also receive a copy of the SPECIALIS PUERI sculpt for FREE!.</em></p>
<p>At this point, we will set a new target and a new reward:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>So, we have hit the first target! Great!! Now is time for a new target. Let’s say we set a new target of $YYY with a bonus of a unit of AUXILIUM CONCURSUS. </em></p>
<p>This continues until the project ends or we just run out of what we can give you!!</p>
<h3><em><strong>So, What Are The Funds Being Spent On?</strong></em></h3>
<p>As I say, this is like a ‘Pre-Order Plus’ system, so we already have the moulds made for the <strong>Dedicatus </strong>and <strong>Paenitentiam </strong>units, so that is sorted. The money that is raised here will be used to sculpt and cast more Nuem units!!! And that is where the Target Busting rewards kick in and you get more stuff!!!</p>
<h3><em><strong>How Much Is Shipping Going To Set Me Back?</strong></em></h3>
<p>Nothing, zero, nil, zilch, nowt, nada. Yep, Nothing. No matter where your models are going, you will pay nothing in shipping.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Help Us Spread The Word!</strong></em></h3>
<p>You can help us to spread the word about the Nuems arrival on Relicia.</p>
<p>If you have a facebook and/or twitter account, post links to this project on them. Make sure everyone knows about it! Start threads on wargames forums you visit and point people here!</p>
<p>Remember, the more people that support the project, the more miniatures you could end up with!</p>

The money that is raised here will be used to sculpt and cast more Nuem units!!! And that is where the Target Busting rewards kick in and you get more stuff!!!
How Much Is Shipping Going To Set Me Back?
Nothing, zero, nil, zilch, nowt, nada. Yep, Nothing. No matter where your models are going, you will pay nothing in shipping.
Help Us Spread The Word!
You can help us to spread the word about the Nuems arrival on Relicia.
If you have a facebook and/or twitter account, post links to this project on them. Make sure everyone knows about it! Start threads on wargames forums you visit and point people here!
Remember, the more people that support the project, the more miniatures you could end up with!
Use the share buttons on this page to spread the word and lets make the Nuems entrance into Relicia something to remember!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Jess Gulbranson.  You may know me musically <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/djfalsifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">DJFalsifier</a>, or one half of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Coeur+Machant"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Coeur Machant</a>.  I've been working in electronic music for a couple of years now, and I'm starting to get into scoring and composition.  Since I'm not actually trained in those areas, I'm hoping that a stout supply of audacity and morbidity will carry me through.  When I'm not planning on hitting everyday objects with a hammer and calling it music, I am a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/BOOT-STOMPING-HUMAN-FACE-GOTO/dp/0980593840"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">novelist</a>, <a href=""http://http://crappyindiemusic.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">music critic, and interviewer</a>.  By day I work for a natural foods company and am a husband and father.  My daughter Amelia is 3, and has already helped me with several experimental compositions, but she is slightly afraid of ghosts and we'll see how much she wants to do on this project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When was the last time music moved you?  It probably happens all the time.  But when was the last time music scared the hell out of you and made you afraid to go to the bathroom at night?  IN YOUR OWN HOUSE?  I would like to spread fear and confusion to a jaded populace, and give them something to play at their Halloween parties that isn't ""Monster Mash"" or ""Ghoul, You'll Be A Woman Soon"".  Instead, we'll have songs about and manifesting the spirit of some of the creepiest locations in the world... <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Aokigahara</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat_(city)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Pripyat</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_LaLaurie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">The Lalaurie House</a>, and more...</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To be perfectly honest, my recording facilities suck.  I prefer to run lean, like a thief in the night, but that won't be enough for this project.  I mean, I could just sneak into an abandoned warehouse with a length of rebar and a dictaphone- actually, that sounds like a really good idea.  Maybe I'll do that.  BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR MY GRAND VISION!!!  To really evoke the dark presence of haunted locations, I'm going to be getting some electronic percussion (to use as a midi controller to ""play"" my locations), some better microphones and audio equipment to do field recording, and whatever is left will be used to buy random crap that I will hit with a hammer. Come to think of it, I may need to buy a coupla hammers as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, I really want to do something unique and original.  So, apart from cool, normal stuff like downloads, physical copies, thank-you notes, etc., I have put in the very top support bracket a slightly weird opportunity- I come to your house, set up my stuff, and record the ambient life (or unlife) of your living space.  I will then take what I find and plug it into reverbs and sampling and PLAY YOUR HOUSE on a song.  Okay- and if that wasn't creepy enough, I will then either haunt your house or unhaunt it using a special ritual.  How's that for supporting the arts!?!?!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Now, I'd love it if you could help financially, but if you can't, I'd appreciate you getting the word out there.  Indiegogo has some great sharing options, please avail yourself of them. And of course, if you happen to live somewhere haunted and want to send me creepy audio clips, I will most certainly not turn them down.  If I use your audio you will of course receive credit and I will probably give you a download.  Because I am super nice.</p>

</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Canticle of the Black Madonna</strong> </i>is a new opera premiering in Portland, Oregon on September 5, 2014. Created by Ethan Gans-Morse and librettist Tiziana DellaRovere, it is the culmination of four years of hard work in bringing together veterans, military families, nationally-renowned artistic talent, and key supporters needed to produce a ground-breaking, professional performance.</p>
<p>Set in coastal Louisiana, <i>The Canticle of the Black Madonna</i> tells the story of a soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returning from Afghanistan to his wife during the devastating 2010 Gulf Oil Spill. Together, they face many of the challenges that our nation’s military families encounter in their daily lives. Through stirring music, sets, costumes, and drama, <i>The Canticle  of the Black Madonna</i> ultimately reveals the healing power of divine love, represented by the Black Madonna, which transforms them both forever and touches all who witness it.</p>

“You honor me, and my brothers and sisters in arms, with this opera. Please know that as a combat veteran I am truly and deeply touched that you have undertaken such an elusive and misunderstood issue as combat-related PTSD in America today.

An Opera and Service Project that Changes Lives

The Canticle of the Black Madonna is a new opera premiering in Portland, Oregon on September 5, 2014. Created by Ethan Gans-Morse and librettist Tiziana DellaRovere, it is the culmination of four years of hard work in bringing together veterans, military families, nationally-renowned artistic talent, and key supporters needed to produce a ground-breaking, professional performance.
Set in coastal Louisiana, The Canticle of the Black Madonna tells the story of a soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) returning from Afghanistan to his wife during the devastating 2010 Gulf Oil Spill. Together, they face many of the challenges that our nation’s military families encounter in their daily lives. Through stirring music, sets, costumes, and drama, The Canticle  of the Black Madonna ultimately reveals the healing power of divine love, represented by the Black Madonna, which transforms them both forever and touches all who witness it.

More than an Opera

The Canticle of the Black Madonna project goes beyond the opera performance to encompass the following free services for veterans and their families:





A facilitated workshop before and after the opera


An exclusive performance of the opera 

Three weekly art therapy sessions 

A guest lecture event featuring experts on combat-related PTSD


The project also provides the following:


Casting veterans to appear onstage during the opera


Hiring veterans to work on the design of the opera

Marketing and sales opportunities for veteran-owned businesses


“The Canticle of the Black Madonna opened my heart and brought new healing to me, 44 years after I returned from Vietnam. This is a gift that should be shared with the world.”
Bill Ritch, Combat veteran, Silver Star recipient, Former West Point instructor

Who We Are
Anima Mundi Productions is a 501(c)(3) non-profit arts initiative dedicated to creating and producing  projects that harness the power of art to stir the soul, foster community, and address urgent social problems.
Art is much more than entertainment. It reconnects us with ourselves, restores our wounded self-image, and reaffirms our passion and our sense of belonging. The arts are the ideal vehicle for social change and the healing of the wounds of the world because they speak directly to the human unconscious through symbolism, ritual, and shared communal experience.

His works have been performed by numerous ensembles in the United States, Mexico, and Italy, including the Portland Vocal Consort (winner of the 2010 Composer Competition), Chorus Austin, the American Creators Ensemble, the Quartetto Indaco, the Fireworks Ensemble, and the Eugene Contemporary Chamber Ensemble.
Writer/Librettist Tiziana DellaRovere was trained at the University of Milan, Italy, the California College of Arts and Crafts, and San Francisco State University. She is a published author, mystical artist, and professional counselor with over three decades of experience healing a wide range of psychological conditions.

</p><p><b>OUR STORY<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We met while attending the
American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in Manhattan. Attending the same
school allowed us to experience each other’s work ethic, personal strengths,
and performing ability. Upon graduating we each prepared ourselves to audition
for casting directors, talent agencies, regional, and local theatre houses. We
quickly discovered the reality of being on-again, off-again, working actors.
The expense burden of living in this glorious city combined with the need to
stay invested in our craft led us to create the New York Nightingales. We
decided to determine our own success, and the New York Nightingales are taking
flight.</span></p>
<p>It is the Nightingale mission
to serve our community by teaming with fellow artists and nonprofit
organizations to promote creative independence and awareness.  Performing
is a passion for many that often goes unrewarded or unsupported.  By
combining efforts with other artists, musicians, performers, and non-profit
organizations, we hope to increase opportunities and raise awareness about
performing arts-related issues. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The New York Nightingales will
establish ourselves as a self-sustaining business that will support us doing
what we love—performing.  As a business, we will track income and

performers and recent graduates, the Nightingales do not have the funds
necessary to get our business off the ground.  Therefore, we are asking

Mark is an Apple Certified Associate in iWorks Suite.  Mark has extensive knowledge in assistive technology that includes adapting and creating curriculum that is effectively harnesseed to iPad/iPod Touch applications to create a seamless learning experience. </p>
<p>In addition, Mark speaks professionally for organizations, school districts and companies on using technology with individuals with autism.  He has presented for Autism Speaks, Autism NJ, Caldwell College, Hofstra University, Camden Community College, Aruba Autism Foundation, Apple Retail, Apple Education K-12 (Reaching All Learners), and Macworld/iWorld 2013.</p>

<p>Brian McGlade started his career as a software developer during his studies at Cornell University, where he graduated with a BS in Computer Science. He has been a developer for the mobile team of S&amp;P Capital IQ for the past one and a half years, working on both their iPad and smartphone financial apps. He is primarily responsible for the front-end development of the iPad app, specifically creating custom UI controls. He also works on bringing new data sets to the app, both on the front and back ends.

<p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p>We are raising funds for the development of an integrated universal interface suite for the Apple iPad that is simple for a parent, teacher, or individual with autism to learn. Over the past couples years, apps have been introduced to parents and teachers that are designed to educate individuals using specific tools. I own over 2300 apps and have had the opportunity to apply them in the capacity in which it was designed. Although some are helpful, most aren't easy to learn, share a similar interface, poorly designed and are very costly. But one important aspect I found across most apps is the limitation of independent usability for an individual with autism spectrum disorder. As we strive for an individual with autism spectrum disorder to become independent we must also provide them with the tools to do so.</p>
<p>The Spectrum Tool Suite has been carefully designed for a parents, teachers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder to learn, implore, and meet educational needs. The Spectrum Tool Suite will have 5 fully customizable tools that are needed to educate an individual with autism that share a common interface.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div class=""modal_body"" id=""page_object_bio_modal_content"">
<div style=""width: 480px;"">
<p>I am a solo Canadian folk and indie artist from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>After moving from Toronto to Niagara in 1991, I began an immense passion for creating an unique and dynamic sound in the Niagara community. Since 2011, I have been an activist for mental health awareness as I have been coming to grips with my own bouts of depression and anxiety that I have been battling for years, and on my worst days, leaving me helpless on the floor, unable to move. Music is what has always grounded me, along with the sense of community that music brings with it.</p>
<p>My solo efforts have earned me a reputation in Niagara as a noble and sincere artist. I also have a deep passion for my community. Every year I am contantly looking to make charitable contributions in any community I am part of, meanwhile yearning to add a different perspective of the folk and indie genre to the music scene.</p>
<p>My early success as a solo artist are due in large part to my passion for writing creative and fulfilling lyrics, which I like to  describe as observations of life.</p>
<p>I want to write songs that can reach through the speakers and grab a person and let them know we are there with them. Music can have such an emotional and spiritual aura about it that in order to be considered successful, you must tap into that aura because you will never know who is listening to your words.</p>
<p>This campaign is about encouraging and supporting the creative minds of not only for my own endeavours but also for the youth of the Niagara Region. Half of all the donations will be going to the youth group at the Niagara Regional Native Centre. The purpose of the funds will be to purchase art supplies for their program.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important because not only will it assist me in acheiving one of my life long goals, it is also going to support the youth and their creative minds while they reclaim their culture in ways that they may never have been able to before.. With each donation of $100 or more, you will receive a free digital copy of the album I will be creating as well as a piece of artwork created by one of the youth!</p>
<p>The way the money will be broken down per group is:</p>
<p>JAY SHAWANA</p>
<p>- Pre- and Post-Preduction</p>
<p>- Studio Time</p>
<p>- Sound Engineering and Mixing</p>
<p>- Mastering of songs</p>
<p>- CD manufacturing</p>
<p>- Packaging</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>- Marketing</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary


I am a solo Canadian folk and indie artist from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
After moving from Toronto to Niagara in 1991, I began an immense passion for creating an unique and dynamic sound in the Niagara community. Since 2011, I have been an activist for mental health awareness as I have been coming to grips with my own bouts of depression and anxiety that I have been battling for years, and on my worst days, leaving me helpless on the floor, unable to move. Music is what has always grounded me, along with the sense of community that music brings with it.
My solo efforts have earned me a reputation in Niagara as a noble and sincere artist. I also have a deep passion for my community. Every year I am contantly looking to make charitable contributions in any community I am part of, meanwhile yearning to add a different perspective of the folk and indie genre to the music scene.
My early success as a solo artist are due in large part to my passion for writing creative and fulfilling lyrics, which I like to  describe as observations of life.
I want to write songs that can reach through the speakers and grab a person and let them know we are there with them. Music can have such an emotional and spiritual aura about it that in order to be considered successful, you must tap into that aura because you will never know who is listening to your words.
This campaign is about encouraging and supporting the creative minds of not only for my own endeavours but also for the youth of the Niagara Region. Half of all the donations will be going to the youth group at the Niagara Regional Native Centre. The purpose of the funds will be to purchase art supplies for their program.
This campaign is very important because not only will it assist me in acheiving one of my life long goals, it is also going to support the youth and their creative minds while they reclaim their culture in ways that they may never have been able to before.. With each donation of $100 or more, you will receive a free digital copy of the album I will be creating as well as a piece of artwork created by one of the youth!
The way the money will be broken down per group is:
JAY SHAWANA
- Pre- and Post-Preduction
- Studio Time
- Sound Engineering and Mixing
- Mastering of songs
- CD manufacturing
- Packaging
and
- Marketing
 
YOUTH GROUP
- Purchase of Art Supplies
- Funds for Art related field trips
- Administration and Operating costs of youth group
 
With your help, not only will I be able to fulfill my dream, but you will also be helping these youth by giving them not only the freedom of expression, you may also be giving them a way of communicating things they may not be able to say through other forms of communication.
If you would like to help in other ways, you may do so by making donations of art supplies or musical instruments for the Niagara Regional Native Centre Youth Group by contacting Jay Shawana - jasonshawana81@gmail.com or the Youth Group Leader, Seth Hill at bhill_ccay@hotmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Funding Needs</h2>
<p>Minimally, we need the funds to purchase 1000 fully decked out Windsingers (with LED lights) that we can give away (to you!) so we can create a number of ""Windphonys"" throughout the Bay Area, at Burning Man and ultimately around the world!

<p>We want to create an effective video and social media campaign that will light the fuse on the Windsinger Re*evolution!

<h3>Venues</h3>
<p>We plan to do a number of performances throughout the Bay Area and a premier Windphony with 888 players at Burning man 2013. And we want YOU to be a part of it!

<h3>Is this the real life? Is this Just Fantasy?</h3>
<p>Being able to record our First Album is simply put an honor. Few people get to experience such an overwhelming amount of joy that we feel every time we get to share the stage with our talented friends and colleagues. As a band we pour our hearts out on stage at every show and we want to be able to share that energy to a wider audience. An album to us isn't just about the music but it's a representation of who we are, where we've been, the struggles and the triumphs we all face. We have never been a sideline band and try to include our fans and supporters in everything we do and this campaign is one of the biggest extensions of that. This campaign isn't just about raising funds. To us it's about sharing the uncommon experience of building something bigger than ourselves with people we've come to love and those we haven't had the pleasure to meet...yet. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Become a Supporter</h3>
<p>Unfortunately putting together an album, merch, artwork, and recording isn't cheap. After hundreds of emails and countless hours of research we've set our goal to $3,000- which we think with your help and support is more than achievable! These funds will ensure we can record, mix, master and deliver merch that is professional and doesn't hinder our creative abilities. We found an amazing Designer <a href=""https://astephens.design/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrew Stephens</a> that greatly reduced his fees to help us make this happen. We are working with him on creating a unique album design and with his vision a cohesive line of brand new stunning + high quality merch. We've included perks that we think our friends and supporters are going to love. One of our favorites is actually including select perk contributors on the album as back-up vocalists! If we do not reach our goal we may have to sacrifice some recording options, however, all perks will be fulfilled regardless of the amount of money we raise.  Any excess funds raised will go to produce a professional music video for one of our songs from the Album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We know you have options</h3>
<p>There's a lot of amazing bands across the country that deserve your support. We do not take your contribution or attention lightly. We will be posting at a minimum weekly updates to our indiegogo campaign as well as to our Facebook Page!</p>

<h3>SING music video </h3>
<p>Sing is a project written with the intent of giving hope to people going through hard times. Adding a visual element to a song increases it's ability to impact the listeners and helps to tell the story. Click on link below to listen to the song.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Any resources donated to this project will go toward the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childrens Choir </li>
<li>2 days of filming</li>
<li>Video arrangment and editing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am hoping to create a music video that encourages people who are battling heartbreak and depression, especially around the holiday season. Music is amazing in it's ability to lift our spirits and help us deal with difficult circumstances. I have felt more and more recently, the necessity to write music with a positive message with the idea of spreading hope and giving people motivation to continue to try even when they feel like giving up. </p>

<h3>How you can Help</h3>
<p>Any donation, small or large, will be greatly appreciated. A project of this magnitude would generally require somewhere between $1000 and $1500 to see to completion. Rashad believes in the project and has committed to help regardless of compensation, but I have set a goal of $650 to help with some of the costs of making this video, as well as providing some compensation for Rashad's time and generousity.</p>

<p><strong>A Rannygazoo album at last?!</strong></p>
<p>Hello, Our Public. We, as you’ve doubtless surmised, are Rannygazoo, America’s Favorite Ukulele Duo*. For, oh, a dozen years now, we’ve been bringing our own special brand of joy** to audiences as far-flung as Brooklyn, Connecticut, &amp; Humboldt County – but mostly Louisville, Kentucky, our home sweet home. We sing songs left behind by time’s brutal onward slog, primarily songs about alcohol of illegal provenance and women of questionable reputation. We sing them in harmony against a spectacular backdrop of ukulele and with occasional interjections of other noises we hesitate to name, lest they lose their powers.</p>
<p>We are also married. To each other, yes.</p>
<p>We feel it is our duty to bring a proper recording of some of these (sometimes justly) forgotten lyrics and melodies into the world, because many people have requested just such a thing of us, and who are we to reject their pleas, particularly when said pleas are accompanied by the offer of an honest buck?</p>
<p>Your contribution(s) will make this dream a reality, but not nearly so harsh a reality as, if adulthood has taught us anything, the usual sort of reality tends to be. We seek only to spread joy and maybe a bit of remembrance, flask-bound and sprinkled over the graves of songs long-neglected yet promising to tell us something about where we are and where we’ve been. Like that time we tried to make booze illegal and accidentally turned the entire population into criminals.</p>
<p>*some precincts have not yet reported</p>
<p>**and a little pain, without which joy is meaningless; patent pending</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So here’s what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve gotta record those songs;</li>
<li>We’ve gotta have those recordings mixed and mastered;</li>
<li>We’ve gotta get a pretty cover made;</li>
<li>We’ve gotta put them on physical and digital media platforms;</li>
<li>We’ve gotta get them into people’s hands;</li>
<li>We’ve also gotta pay for the very perquisites we offer below;</li>
<li>And if we don't reach our entire goal, we’ll do as much of the above as we can – by hook or crook, there will be an album; that’s an inevitability. You can’t get out of it <i>that</i> easily.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Perquisites </strong></p>
<p>You’re not just throwing piles of spondulix* our way; heavens, no. Depending on your contribution, you get...stuff! Though not really merch - there are plenty of t-shirts &amp; bits of plastic cluttering your home &amp; the world. No, GOOD stuff like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the album in whatever form best suits you, CDr digital (vinyl, shellac, &amp;/or cylinders aren’t currently a part of the plan, unless this thing takes off more than we expect);</li>
<li>Oodles of our personal thanks, expressed verbally in written form, on nice paper with a fountain pen;</li>
<li>A credit in the album liner notes</li>
<li>A custom ringtone of that…that weird muted trumpet sound Greg makes…you know the sound…once you’ve…it just…*shudders*…anyway. Ringtone;</li>
<li>An evening out with the Maupins at a local watering hole we frequent frequently;</li>
<li>A song, in our inimitable style, written and dedicated personally to you! (we’ll ask whether you prefer “charmingly witty” or “just filthy”);</li>
<li>An acoustic house concert (provided your house is within a reasonable distance from ours or one of the places we visit regularly);</li>
<li>Some combination of the above!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a long-time Teramaze fan or recently converted one, Dean, Andrew, Nick and Chris thank you for your support, whether it be buying our albums, streaming our music and of course the die-hard fans that attend our live shows.</p>
<p>Teramaze have had a long recording career starting in 1995 with the debut album ‘Doxology’ all the way up to our sixth album ‘Are We Soldiers’ released in 2018. One of the most amazing things about this band’s survival and ability to make records is that we have always had financial backing from record labels.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we were released from our record label we were presented with two options.</p>
<p>1. Shop around our next album’s and see which labels were interested and would fund it… and ultimately have to do things on label’s terms.</p>
<p>2. Go independent. Release music when we want, as fast as we want and be able create our music on our own terms.</p>
<p>When you look at the two options, it’s pretty obvious which one we as a band wanted to go with. The problem with going independent is that it puts a massive, up front financial strain on the band, to not only cover the costs of the album, but also its promotion, film clips, designing costs… the list goes on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set our end goal to $20,000 - $40,000. Where does that money go? It’s only fair you as the fans and backers of this project should know!</p>
<p>ALBUM BUDGET</p>
<p>Studio Time (tracking, mixing mastering)                             $15,000 </p>
<p>Artwork                                                                                              $2,000</p>
<p>2 Film Clips + Visualizer/Lyric Video                                        $4,000</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Whether you’re a long-time Teramaze fan or recently converted one, Dean, Andrew, Nick and Chris thank you for your support, whether it be buying our albums, streaming our music and of course the die-hard fans that attend our live shows.
Teramaze have had a long recording career starting in 1995 with the debut album ‘Doxology’ all the way up to our sixth album ‘Are We Soldiers’ released in 2018. One of the most amazing things about this band’s survival and ability to make records is that we have always had financial backing from record labels.
Earlier this year we were released from our record label we were presented with two options.
1. Shop around our next album’s and see which labels were interested and would fund it… and ultimately have to do things on label’s terms.
2. Go independent. Release music when we want, as fast as we want and be able create our music on our own terms.
When you look at the two options, it’s pretty obvious which one we as a band wanted to go with. The problem with going independent is that it puts a massive, up front financial strain on the band, to not only cover the costs of the album, but also its promotion, film clips, designing costs… the list goes on.

What We Need & What You Get
We have set our end goal to $20,000 - $40,000. Where does that money go? It’s only fair you as the fans and backers of this project should know!
ALBUM BUDGET
Studio Time (tracking, mixing mastering)                             $15,000 
Artwork                                                                                              $2,000
2 Film Clips + Visualizer/Lyric Video                                        $4,000
Photography for promo                                                                 $2,000
Choir hire                                                                                            $1,000
CD & booklet design & printing                                                  $2,000

We can comfortably say this album is the most honest, heart-felt, intricate and well-orchestrated piece of music that Teramaze have done to date.

</div>
<div>
<p>Fenrismaw unleashed its self-titled demo in 2010, which recieved substantial acclaim. It was heralded as ""dynamic... crushingly heavy, highly melodic"" (<a href=""http://forgedwny.tumblr.com/post/42845243727/fenrismaw-self-titled-ep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forged WNY</a>) and ""full of potential"" (<a href=""http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=18049"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Metal Observer</a>).</p>
<p>We went on to play countless shows alongside local and national acts alike and established ourselves as one of the region's driving forces.</p>
<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBqgiXIZMYE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this full-set video</a> from our show with Marduk, Inquisition, and Moonspell.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>HELCULT</strong></h2>
<p>After 4 years of crushing devastation in the name of Heathen Gods, Fenrismaw has reached the end of its road. Our vocalist is going to Iceland for at least 2 years, and the band is going on indefinite hiatus. But before that happens, we are set to release our full-length album: ""Helcult.""</p>
<p><img alt=""Helcult"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i888.photobucket.com/albums/ac81/Nekoroth/hlclt3.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>The ""Helcross"" symbolizes the Heathen Black Trinity: the fury of the Fenris Wolf, the unrelenting carnage of Jormungandr, and the cunning venom of Death. Our music embodies the primal wrath of the old, the forgotten powers, to whom the album pays homage.</p>
<p>The album is a testament to the dedication of both ourselves and our fans. Recorded and ready for release, it picks up where our demo left off and burrows straight into the underworld. It is exactly how we, as a band, envisioned our music.</p>
<p>""Helcult"" includes a rerecording of three of the four songs from our demo, four all-new originals, and a bonus cover of Grave's ""Extremely Rotten Flesh.""</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i888.photobucket.com/albums/ac81/Nekoroth/Songlist.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>But we need your help!</strong></h2>
<p>Helcult is recorded, mixed, and mastered--it just needs to be printed. With the help of our friends and fans, we need to raise $2000.  </p>
<p>This money will go towards the hefty cost of printing 6-panel digipaks and creating a host of new merch items, including T-shirts, posters, and limited edition Helcross pendants.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How we'll use the money</h2>
<p>Of the $2000 we hope to raise, roughly $1500 will go towards production of the CDs, another $400 (at least) will go towards T-shirts, and the rest will go towards the formidable cost of production and shipping/transportation of the perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Make ""Helcult"" a reality</h2>
<p>Like many bands, Fenrismaw has had its ups and downs over the last 4 years, but ""Helcult"" is by far the greatest thing we have accomplished. With your help, we can turn our hard work into something permanent and leave off on a positive, triumphant note.</p>

I am using this page to exchange a new record that I am recording for financial support for this trip. The new record will have four songs and will be recorded using some fairly nice equipment that my university is graciously letting me use for free. Hopefully, it will include guest artists (i.e. my friends) to thicken up the sound.

<p>We began our collaboration in early Fall 2017 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst exploring works by composers ranging from the 19th century to today. We want to share our perspectives on Beethoven and Brahms by performing their works and by having an open educating our audiences about them. In addition, we would like to use part of the campaig funds to commission a new work by a Chicago composer to expand the violin/piano duo repertoire.  </p>
<p>Having an open conversation about classical music in a concert setting is one of many ways to get new people interested in this genre. With your help, you can send us to Chicago to perform, and be a part of a project that will allow us to bring music education in a series of community outreach events in local schools and libraries.</p>

<h3>THE BARRETT ANDERSON BAND'S 3rd Album</h3>
<p>Get ready for <i>Hypno-Boogie Live</i>!</p>
<p>The Barrett Anderson Band will be recording a brand new, live double album at the beginning of 2020, and you can help make it happen. Be a part of the team with interactive perks and, through your support and funding, help create The Barrett Anderson Band's best album yet.</p>
<p>Barrett, <strong>winner of a 2013 Boston Music Award - Blues Artist of the Year</strong>, and his rock-solid band's live shows are truly special events.  Drawing from a blues background but not limited by the form, The Barrett Anderson Band plays by feel, <strong>improvising and pushing the songs</strong> forward with every performance; creating original music that connects with the audience and makes them move and groove, <strong>filled with the spirit and sou</strong>l rolling off the stage.</p>
<p>On February 1, the proverbial tape will be rolling, forever capturing the performance as Barrett Anderson's third album. Your support is needed to ""do this right.""  <strong>Join the action</strong>, take advantage of great perks, and get ready, because The Barrett Anderson Band is going to get groovy in 2020.  Here comes <i>Hypno-Boogie</i>!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Making an album is not cheap; making a double album even more-so.  The music on this recording is unique, original, important music.  Capturing it in a way that stands the test of time - all the post-production needed to ensure it sounds as good as it can - takes time, effort, and money.</p>
<p>We have constructed a bare-bones budget; one that allows us to do everything we need to make this music sound great, and that budget comes to $6,000.  This includes recording, editing, mixing, mastering, licensing, and duplication, with a tiny amount of funding set aside for art and promotion.  The more we raise, the more we can do.</p>
<p>If our funding exceeds $6,000 we will be able to increase the promotional campaign, helping to introduce the album to a larger audience.  If our funding exceeds $10,000 we will be able to enlist the aid of a fantastic line artist to make the album look as good as it can.  If our funding exceeds $11,500 we will be able to press this album on vinyl.</p>
<p>We have a solid plan and budget in place to maximize the effectiveness of your investment in this project.  The team is in place, we simply need the funding to do this right. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The Barrett Anderson Band is incredibly grateful for how supportive and dedicated the fans and friends of the band are, and we've put our heads together to create highly interactive, individualized perks across the full range of price options.  We offer some traditional perks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sticker and an online thank you video from Barrett and the band for $5</li>
<li>A signed copy of the brand new, live double album to you ""hot off the presses"" for $30</li>
<li>Want the entire collection?  Get all 3 albums by Barrett for $60</li>
<li>For the biggest fan/true collector (or maybe someone who wants to have some blackmail leverage on Barrett and Jamie), you can get the ""ultimate collection,"" all 3 of Barrett's commercially available albums signed, plus a special copy of <i>The 708 Club</i>, an album made by 16 year-old Barrett in 1999, featuring a young Jamie ""Black Cat Bone"" Hatch on the guitar!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most exciting perks offer direct interaction with the band, and we are really thrilled to do this with you!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Barrett Anderson Band will learn a song of your choice and post it online with a special shout out to you for $100</li>
<li>An hour-long lesson with the band member of your choice is $150.  Want to learn your favorite Barrett Anderson Band song?  Get in on Doug's drum secrets?  Do you want to learn about how Barrett approaches soloing?  Want to talk gear?  Let's do it.  The lessons are via Skype, although could be in person by special arrangement</li>
<li>Have a strong vision for the sound of The Barrett Anderson Band?  Want to be involved with the whole process and thanked on every album Barrett releases from this point forward?  Then look into being an Executive Producer for $2,000</li>
</ul>
<p>By contributing to this project on any level, you're helping to make important music by independent musicians on their own terms.  </p>
<p>We chose ""Flex Funding"" for this project, which means that we will receive the donated funds whether or not the project goal is met.  Our project goal does represent the most bare bones way we can make this album without having to make some sacrifices, however, if the project goal is not met, we will be able to compromise some of the production decisions without forsaking the integrity and intent of the project.  We are prepared to make this album one way or another and can guarantee a return for your investment and enthusiasm in this project, whether or not the fundraising goal is hit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is one of the great joys in life - a language we're all hardwired to understand and react to...  A language that speaks to us deeply, bridging the conflicts that divide us.  Music matters.  Good music matters.  The Barrett Anderson Band's music matters.</p>
<p>Barrett was 16 when he joined <i>Ronnie Earl &amp; The Broadcasters</i>.  Ronnie took young Barrett under his wing and his very first advice was ""Make sure you play music because it's what you have to do.  Find something else if you're in it to get famous, to get rich, or even to get girls.  Be a musician because you have no other choice.""</p>
<p>Twenty years later, Barrett is still at it, making music because it is in him and it has to get out.  The music industry truly is the ""hardest way to make an easy living.""  With your help and support The Barrett Anderson Band will be able to make and market their third album on their terms.  The band has never been better.  The music has never been more vital.  The time is now and we need you on our team.  Every donation helps, we can use all the support we receive, and we are truly grateful for the community that allows us to make this wonderful music.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<h3>Help the Buffalo Chamber Players get a harpsichord!</h3>
<p>After years of borrowing or renting harpsichords for our performances, we have the opportunity to finally have our own harpsichord! The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra has given us a Richard Taylor double manual harpsichord that has been in storage at Kleinhans Music Hall for over 20 years and is in need of a major restoration. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511212353/h4r00m5xdotqylvjyf1y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Though the harpsichord was given to us free of charge, we need $4800 to cover the restoration of the instrument. The work will be performed by our wonderful piano and harpsichord technician Robert Sowyrda. Mr. Sowyrda has many years of experience working on keyboard instruments throughout Western New York, including the tuning and maintenance of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's pianos. </p>
<p>While the cost of this extensive restoration is not insignificant, it is a fraction of the cost of a new or newly restored harpsichord of this quality. This is a world class instrument that deserves to be restored and played again. And play it we will!</p>
<p>The harpsichord will be featured on many of our concerts at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and beyond. In 2018, we plan to launch a new concert series in various venues throughout the community featuring works of the Baroque era. Most of this music features the harpsichord and would be cost prohibitive to do without our own instrument.</p>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511228735/wxtt0wgmptyaflfe4jqd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All donations are appreciated! You are welcome to donate any amount via the ""BACK IT"" button above or take advantage of the various donation rewards we have created. Any funds raised in excess of our campaign goal will be used for maintenance of the instrument and future concerts throughout the community featuring our harpsichord.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Please help us get the word out about our quest for a harpsichord! Use the buttons above to share our campaign on social media and send friends our way. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<hr noshade="""" size=""10""/>
<h3>F.A.Q:</h3>
<p><strong>What is the goal of this campaign?</strong><br/>We are raising money to cover the cost of the restoration of a harpsichord for the Buffalo Chamber Players.</p>
<p><strong>How much money is needed?</strong><br/>The repairs and restoration of the instrument will cost $4800. Any money raised beyond that will be applied towards future maintenance of the instrument and performances.</p>
<p><b>Are donations to the campaing tax deductible?</b><br/>The Buffalo Chamber Players is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization and your donation is tax deductible. Please consult your accountant.</p>
<p><strong>How will you use the harpsichord?</strong><br/>Over the years, our programming of works with harpsichord has been limited by the availability of an instrument to rent or borrow. Having our own instrument gives us greater flexibility to explore and program more repertoire with harpsichord. The instrument will be heard on our concerts at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and other venues throughout the community.</p>
<p><strong>What is the campaign timeline?</strong><br/>The funding campaign will run through December 31 and we hope to have the instrument playing in January.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to choose a reward? Any other options?</strong><br/>You may donate any amount without claiming a reward or feel free to contact us with your sponsorship ideas!</p>
<p><strong>I can't donate but want to help. Any other ways to help?</strong><br/>Certainly! You are the best ambassadors to our campaign, so please help us spread the word among your friends and family. You can use the social media links above, email, or word of mouth. The more people we reach, the more succesffull our campaign will be.</p>

In 2018, we plan to launch a new concert series in various venues throughout the community featuring works of the Baroque era. Most of this music features the harpsichord and would be cost prohibitive to do without our own instrument.


All donations are appreciated! You are welcome to donate any amount via the ""BACK IT"" button above or take advantage of the various donation rewards we have created. Any funds raised in excess of our campaign goal will be used for maintenance of the instrument and future concerts throughout the community featuring our harpsichord.

Please help us get the word out about our quest for a harpsichord! Use the buttons above to share our campaign on social media and send friends our way. 
Thank you!

F.A.Q:
What is the goal of this campaign?We are raising money to cover the cost of the restoration of a harpsichord for the Buffalo Chamber Players.
How much money is needed?The repairs and restoration of the instrument will cost $4800. Any money raised beyond that will be applied towards future maintenance of the instrument and performances.
Are donations to the campaing tax deductible?The Buffalo Chamber Players is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization and your donation is tax deductible. Please consult your accountant.
How will you use the harpsichord?Over the years, our programming of works with harpsichord has been limited by the availability of an instrument to rent or borrow. Having our own instrument gives us greater flexibility to explore and program more repertoire with harpsichord. The instrument will be heard on our concerts at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and other venues throughout the community.
What is the campaign timeline?The funding campaign will run through December 31 and we hope to have the instrument playing in January.
Do I need to choose a reward? Any other options?You may donate any amount without claiming a reward or feel free to contact us with your sponsorship ideas!
I can't donate but want to help. Any other ways to help?Certainly! You are the best ambassadors to our campaign, so please help us spread the word among your friends and family. You can use the social media links above, email, or word of mouth. The more people we reach, the more succesffull our campaign will be.
Where can I reach you with other questions?Please visit our website, www.buffalochamberplayers.org.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We're thrilled that our latest album, <strong><i>Almost Paradigm</i></strong> -- 14 tracks, 72 minutes, our first collection of all-new all-original material in eight years! -- is finished. Right now it's only available as a download at our <a href=""https://sonsofnothingband.bandcamp.com/album/almost-paradigm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Bandcamp</strong> </a>site, but we've heard from quite a few listeners who would prefer to purchase a CD copy. <br/><br/>Well, we're down for that. As fans and as artists, we've always loved physical media.

<p>Alabaster is a jam band at our roots. We flaunt a style that is very passionate and energetic. Our emotions are poured into every lick and riff they play. Alabaster is not bound by genre but draws influence by Rock, Blues, Psychedelic, Reggae, to name a few, with a more old school take, similar to Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin. We consistently challenge ourselves to push our creativity and musicianship to a new level through improvisation and exploring our music and to make sure the crowd really gets down. </p>
<p>Alabaster has had a lot of success in the midwest but now it's time to push it forward--with this trip down to Austin, TX, we're breaking into a new market and starting to spread Alabaster's name into new national markets.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a FLASH FUNDRAISER to help us through the next two weeks as we tour down to SXSW.</p>
<p>We want to raise $1000. This money will help us book hotels in the colder states (we plan on camping but sometimes that just won't be realistic in midwestern March!), gas, food, and provide us a level of security if something goes wrong with our van on the road (ask us about the time we toured out to Colorado and our van broke down). This money will also help us use our time as best as possible while we're traveling to Austin as it will allow us to check out more places and meet more people.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is flexible--if we don't meet our total, every dollar donated toward it will still help us make our SXSW dreams a reality.</p>
<p>Our perks will provide you with all sorts of intimate behind the scenes moments from the band--starting from the first level where you'll get a personal thank you, to the last where we will play you a private show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Alabaster believes in the power of music--to build community, to create joy, and to heal minds and bodies. We draw inspiration from the stone alabaster after which we are named as well; alabaster the stone has healing properties that aid forgiveness, ease anxiety, clear the mind, and spark creativity. When we are together onstage and playing, our riffs and improvisations have similar qualities, allowing the audience a moment to get in the groove and experience the ways in which our spontaneous creativity and jams can get you out of your head and into the present moment.</p>
<p>Supporting a band like ours is an opportunity to spread these positive vibes and support independent artists as we pursue our dreams.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Going on tour is a risky thing. Unreliable venues, problems with transportation, security for our equipment--there's a lot of different factors at play when you travel for a show. Since we've gone on the road out west before, we have some experience now that we think will help prevent any unforeseen circumstance totally derailing the tour. But this is also why we're fundraising: with additional funds, we will be more equipped for success.</p>

<h3>Ghana Recording Studio Project</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528600202/zon68wmynq0idxny6zzt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Ghana is a deeply musical place with diverse traditional and popular music. Since 2000, I have developed personal and professional ties in Ghana that have shaped my outlook as a musician, scholar, and teacher. I began conceptualizing the Ghana Recording Studio Project during a two-year (2013-2015) visiting scholar position in the University of Ghana’s Music Department. I was inspired by the students’ level of engagement and dedication though I found that the University facilities required a great deal of improvisation due to the limited resources. At one point, I taught an eight-student studio production class in my office with one computer, a borrowed projector and keyboard, and two microphones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530926612/uurtz6wittwdbt2yblsi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Ghana Studio Project</strong></p>
<p>I will be working under a Fulbright Fellowship to install a music production studio and develop a program of study within the University of Ghana's Department of Music. This studio will serve to teach music production, promote student activities, connect visiting scholars and artists to the University of Ghana's music department, and provide a place for generating creative output. As the studio develops, I hope that it will become a focal point of musical activity in Accra for both local and visiting musicians, producers, and artists.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530926507/pequ3hgg31vkznjxsbns.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Music Production and Education in Ghana</strong></p>
<p>This project is important because music is one of the most visible and lasting cultural exports of West Africa and embodies an ongoing process of national formation and participation in global economies. Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkruma, believed that local music traditions were more than entertainment or static culture and that they should play an important part in shaping a Pan-African political and social consciousness that would carry African nations forward in the postcolonial era. I follow Nkruma’s lead in looking to these traditions as archives of knowledge and ways of understanding the world as well as valuable resources for the development of cultural products. </p>
<p>As Ghana continues to develop leadership opportunities in West Africa, music should provide a vibrant part of positive change in the region. Musicians, producers, promoters, educators, and venue owners are facing the difficult challenges of negotiating a music industry defined by streaming services and unrestrained piracy. However, great potential exists in establishing West African cities as new centers of music production that do not rely solely on European and U.S. distribution and promotion companies.</p>
<p>This project would directly benefit the University of Ghana, local scholars and teachers, and the student body by providing a sustainable recording studio for:</p>
<p>●      Teaching Graduate and Undergraduate courses</p>
<p>●      Music production</p>
<p>●      Hosting resident artists</p>
<p>●      Networking with local artists, promoters, educators, and producers</p>
<p>●      Generating income for the department</p>
<p>I expect this project to have a lasting impact as it will provide a foundation for students who wish to pursue further studies or work in music production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>I aim to raise $10,000 which will cover costs for equipment that will be donated to the Music Department, shipping costs to Ghana, labor for building and installing sound treatment, and fees for visiting artists who can interact with students as they work through music production projects. </p>

<p>With the Ghana Studio Project, we will continue to develop music collaborations that explore new directions in Ghanaian music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline and Goals</h3>
<p>Through the fall months of 2018, we will be working on the studio install and also developing projects that bridge music production, composition, theory, analysis, and musicology. The Spring of 2019 will be dedicated to hands-on work with students in the production space seeing their projects through completion.</p>
<p>As this is an ongoing project, the first stage of funding will go largely to equipment and install with the remaining 20% being used for studio assistants and guest artists. </p>
<p>In the first year we aim to produce a CD of recordings by student artists as well as keep an online website dedicated to showcasing the work being done in the Studio.  </p>
<p>Having worked extensively in Ghana as a musician, teacher, and producer, I see the main restraints on this project being time. With your donations, we can work efficiently to build the studio so that students can begin to benefit from its facilities!</p>

Ghana is a deeply musical place with diverse traditional and popular music. Since 2000, I have developed personal and professional ties in Ghana that have shaped my outlook as a musician, scholar, and teacher. I began conceptualizing the Ghana Recording Studio Project during a two-year (2013-2015) visiting scholar position in the University of Ghana’s Music Department. I was inspired by the students’ level of engagement and dedication though I found that the University facilities required a great deal of improvisation due to the limited resources. At one point, I taught an eight-student studio production class in my office with one computer, a borrowed projector and keyboard, and two microphones.

The Ghana Studio Project
I will be working under a Fulbright Fellowship to install a music production studio and develop a program of study within the University of Ghana's Department of Music. This studio will serve to teach music production, promote student activities, connect visiting scholars and artists to the University of Ghana's music department, and provide a place for generating creative output. As the studio develops, I hope that it will become a focal point of musical activity in Accra for both local and visiting musicians, producers, and artists.

The Importance of Music Production and Education in Ghana
This project is important because music is one of the most visible and lasting cultural exports of West Africa and embodies an ongoing process of national formation and participation in global economies. Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkruma, believed that local music traditions were more than entertainment or static culture and that they should play an important part in shaping a Pan-African political and social consciousness that would carry African nations forward in the postcolonial era. I follow Nkruma’s lead in looking to these traditions as archives of knowledge and ways of understanding the world as well as valuable resources for the development of cultural products. 
As Ghana continues to develop leadership opportunities in West Africa, music should provide a vibrant part of positive change in the region. Musicians, producers, promoters, educators, and venue owners are facing the difficult challenges of negotiating a music industry defined by streaming services and unrestrained piracy. However, great potential exists in establishing West African cities as new centers of music production that do not rely solely on European and U.S. distribution and promotion companies.
This project would directly benefit the University of Ghana, local scholars and teachers, and the student body by providing a sustainable recording studio for:
●      Teaching Graduate and Undergraduate courses
●      Music production
●      Hosting resident artists
●      Networking with local artists, promoters, educators, and producers
●      Generating income for the department
I expect this project to have a lasting impact as it will provide a foundation for students who wish to pursue further studies or work in music production.

Our Goals
I aim to raise $10,000 which will cover costs for equipment that will be donated to the Music Department, shipping costs to Ghana, labor for building and installing sound treatment, and fees for visiting artists who can interact with students as they work through music production projects. 



Impact
Your contributions will help build a place for the students to creatively engage with West Africa's vibrant music scene.
My previous experiences designing and working as a producer in Accra led to many incredible collaborations with...

With the Ghana Studio Project, we will continue to develop music collaborations that explore new directions in Ghanaian music.

Timeline and Goals
Through the fall months of 2018, we will be working on the studio install and also developing projects that bridge music production, composition, theory, analysis, and musicology. The Spring of 2019 will be dedicated to hands-on work with students in the production space seeing their projects through completion.
As this is an ongoing project, the first stage of funding will go largely to equipment and install with the remaining 20% being used for studio assistants and guest artists. 
In the first year we aim to produce a CD of recordings by student artists as well as keep an online website dedicated to showcasing the work being done in the Studio.  
Having worked extensively in Ghana as a musician, teacher, and producer, I see the main restraints on this project being time. With your donations, we can work efficiently to build the studio so that students can begin to benefit from its facilities!

Other Ways to Help!
We are taking recording equipment donations too! We need computers, microphones, and audio interfaces. Any audio cables, audio controller, instrument, or other auxiliary item donations are also welcome!

<div>Ray Wild is an explosive combo of shredding guitar, groovy basslines, and sexy vocals that is here to bring back that funky rock and roll. Inspired by the rock gods of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers- our music will get you on your feet and banging your head. And we want to spread those funky rock and roll vibes across America.<br/>
</div>
<div>One of our goals as a band is to tour the country, and this is just the beginning. From our own fundraising efforts like the Ray Wild Car Wash and with your help, we can go from Columbia, Missouri all the way to Los Angeles and back and gain invaluable experience along the way. This tour will provide us with more exposure, opportunities for radio play, networking with other locals, and new songwriting material to make our tunes and live show even more exciting.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Basically, we need to get from Lawrence -&gt; Boulder -&gt; Salt Lake City -&gt; Santa Rosa -&gt; Oakland -&gt; Los Angeles -&gt; Las Vegas -&gt; Albuquerque -&gt; Oklahoma City -&gt; Columbia and that's where you guys come in.  All of your contributions would go towards getting us and our gear from place to place, which is easily the most important part of this whole tour.</div>
<div>Gas for 2 cars at 20mpg (4344 miles @ $2.50/gal) = $1,090 .00</div>
<div>Lodging for 4 nights (the rest of the two weeks we are couch surfing) = $533.40</div>

<div>Check out our sweet perks and just know that your help will not go unnoticed - we greatly appreciate all of the good vibes!</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This tour is honestly just the beginning for us. With the exposure and experience we would gain on this tour, we can really take off. We want our music to reach as many people as possible and for people to really feel connected to our music. We've got that covered in Columbia but we want it to reach everyone. Touring out west is the jumpstart we need. We will gain so much more experience on the road, learn how to communicate and reach fans in other markets, gain loads of new songwriting material, and meet people that can help us achieve our ultimate goal.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>With touring comes great challenges. We could make it all the way to California and only play for 10 people, but we're prepared for that challenge and many more. We're already working on marketing plans to combat the challenge of getting people to the show.

<li>My name is Janine Willard, and I run The Choral Agency. It started a few years ago, as an attempt to seek out work for singers, and arrange recitals and concerts for them across the country.  </li> <li>In the past few years, children have been systematically failed by the powers that be, with respect to the Arts. Working with children is something I am passionate about, and 90% of my work involves children, teaching them privately, and within choirs. So we want to bring them top quality music, introducing them to something new, and giving them the chance to perform in beautiful settings. </li>
<li>Our first event is planned for May 2015 - children will take part in rehearsals with some of our professional singers, on the final Saturdays in January - April, and then come together at Arundel Cathedral, to perform Vivaldi's Gloria with supporting professionals, and a string orchestra, as well as some more recently written pieces. They will take away a CD and a professional photograph of the event. </li> <li>With some funding, we can advertise fully and comprehensively to the whole of Sussex and Surrey, to try and get the event more widely known about. It would also mean that we could offer free places to those children who might not be able to afford the cost (albeit as small as we could make it). If we get enough, we might be able to do it for the children completely free! What is absolutely certain, is that we will be able to arrange more of these events within the next two years, offering these events to children right the way across the UK.</li> </ul>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul>
<li>The more we are able to raise, the more children we'll be able to reach.

</div></div>","Short Summary  
My name is Janine Willard, and I run The Choral Agency. It started a few years ago, as an attempt to seek out work for singers, and arrange recitals and concerts for them across the country.   In the past few years, children have been systematically failed by the powers that be, with respect to the Arts. Working with children is something I am passionate about, and 90% of my work involves children, teaching them privately, and within choirs. So we want to bring them top quality music, introducing them to something new, and giving them the chance to perform in beautiful settings. 
Our first event is planned for May 2015 - children will take part in rehearsals with some of our professional singers, on the final Saturdays in January - April, and then come together at Arundel Cathedral, to perform Vivaldi's Gloria with supporting professionals, and a string orchestra, as well as some more recently written pieces. They will take away a CD and a professional photograph of the event.  With some funding, we can advertise fully and comprehensively to the whole of Sussex and Surrey, to try and get the event more widely known about. It would also mean that we could offer free places to those children who might not be able to afford the cost (albeit as small as we could make it). If we get enough, we might be able to do it for the children completely free! What is absolutely certain, is that we will be able to arrange more of these events within the next two years, offering these events to children right the way across the UK. 
   What We Need & What You Get  
The more we are able to raise, the more children we'll be able to reach. It's not just about singing the music, but the children will be asked to engage with it, to listen in their own time, and be given ideas on how to express what they feel the music is trying to say. The majority of the money will go on hiring buildings, such as other cathedrals, and later on, concert halls. With enough funding, we could also let the children take DVDs instead of CDs. We have Choral Agency mugs, t-shirts, and hoodies available for funding, as well as CDs of all our events for 5 years, or for large donations, naming one of our financial awards after you! Because our amount is so flexible, any amount we raise can go towards our Youth Projects, but if we should fall short of arranging more than one other, we would arrange an event at Durham Cathedral, and the money could go towards the hire, which would most likely mean free participation for the children.  
  The Impact  
Nobody ever got to the end of their lives and said ""I wish I'd performed less music!"". Music has a positive impact on physical and emotional health. It contributes to language skills, it can engage children in history and mathematics, as well as having the obvious and frequently proven benefits to organisational skills, discipline,  We already have some children signed up, and we are doing a lot of work to spread the word about our project, and the building hires aside, the majority of our funding will go to marketing and to offering free places for some, or if we get enough, even all! 
  Risks & Challenges  
Implementing this on a country wide basis will be a huge challenge, which is why, at least to start with, we will spend a minimum of £1000 on promoting our events, doing talks in schools, making promotional videos based on our first event in Arundel.

DreamCatchers is a vision of Ariel Clinical Services that started in 2012 with the mission to provide vocational training for adults with intellectual disabilities and at risk youth in our Blank Canvas Cafe & Gallery, The Alibi Room (gallery & venue), and The Studio (handcrafted goods).
Our participants receive job training in customer service, salesmanship, craftsmanship, culinary skills, facilities and maintenance that extend to the operation of the our cafe, galleries and community contracts.






We believe that every individual has a right to a meaningful life and an opportunity to contribute to their community despite any intellectual/developmental disability. We also believe in empowering and strengthening the at risk youth in our community to facilitate their success. 


The Studio
The DreamCatchers Studio mission is to supply our adult artisans with the workspace, tools, recycled materials and craftsmanship training they require to create quality handmade goods for sale. Upon completion, artists price and present their work to be curated into the store. If accepted, the artwork is available for sale in our Etsy store, Blank Canvas Cafe and The Alibi Room Gallery and Venue.

<p>My name is Ivy Ross Ricci.  I am a teacher and a musician based in Port Angeles, Washington and Portland, Oregon.  I have spent the better part of the last 20 years working on behalf of the freedom and creative expression of girls' and women's voices nationwide.</p>
<p>My most recent album, 'It's Hard to Know' features a song that exposes the essence of the many double standards that girls and women experience in the classroom, in the workplace, and in our society in general.  It is called ""Girls Sit Screaming"".</p>
<p>Renowned Portland director, Alicia J Rose and I are partnering to make a video that will allow the song to reach a wider audience. Known for her subversive pop portraiture and ability to tap into cultural zeitgeist, Alicia has created inventive music videos for well-known national artists like First Aid Kit, Cake, EMA and Bob Mould as well as playing a key role in branding NW bands like The Decemberists.</p>
<p>Join us in spreading the message of Girls Sit Screaming, an anthem for the cultural shift we are experiencing in which women's voices are beginning to be heard, believed, and valued,</p>
<p>By donating and sharing word of this song and this campaign with your friends, you will be helping the movement towards  a safer world for girls and women, a world in which there is equal pay for equal work, a world in which no girl feels afraid to take up space, a world in which women inhabit at least half of leadership roles in every field.</p>

<p>We need to raise $5500 to create and promote the video. These funds will cover pre-production fees (producer/director), day rates for crew &amp; featured cast (talent, director, producer, camera crew, lighting crew, hair/makeup etc), all equipment rentals, insurance, location fees, art/props/costume budget, hard drives, and Post Production.</p>
<p>The PERKS that you will receive by being a part of the team that makes this video happen include: the song itself; my latest album ""It's Hard to Know""; a blockprint of the album cover on Ricci Handmade Paper; a hardcopy of my very first solo album; and House concert Anywhere in the world!!</p>
<p>I have already invested many years and many dollars in making this work, and I am so grateful that with your help Alicia and I can take it to the next level and have an impact on more lives by encouraging creative critical thinking about the cultural expectations for girls and women in mainstream culture.</p>

The music artists who are being featured on this single are Elyse Aeryn, Sam Jefferson, Maddisun, Slick Division, Jenny Deacon, ELA, Michael Parma and James Millier. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606069579/aroy3wgo2scbtinndji7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Why playing a key role towards this Christmas charity single will help musicians.</h3><p>Due to the effects of Covid-19 it's more now than ever that musicians are having a tough time making money however it's not just about the money for the musicians it's harder to showcase their identity as a music artist.

<h3>Workshop Descriptions</h3>
<p><strong>Take Charge of Your Vocal Health &amp; Technique</strong></p>
<p>How can you take the helm of your vocal health and technique as a choral singer or vocal educator? In this interactive workshop, Dr. Lisa Neher will share practices for developing and maintaining lifelong vocal ease, flexibility, stamina, beauty, and health. You will learn a framework for building or revamping your own singing practice, plus tools for returning to singing after illness and maintaining vocal efficiency through the aging process. </p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement, Affirmation and Action: Cultivating an Inclusive Choral Community</strong></p>
<p>Unpacking the bias in our curriculum and in ourselves is a difficult process but necessary journey in creating and fostering an inclusive choral community. In this presentation, Dr. Derrick Fox will present concepts that help you ACKNOWLEDGE your biases (personal, curricular and organizational ) with the hopes that you will identify blind spots that may minoritize and marginalize singers in your ensembles or classrooms, outline methods that support the AFFIRMATION of varied lived experiences represented in your ensembles and offer ACTION steps that break the cycle of oppression and support diversity equity, inclusion, access and belonging. Our journeys are unique and this presentation is intended to be a starting place and not a final chapter for your work towards creating an inclusive choral community.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Breaths/Deep Spirit: A Healthy Spirituality for Performers</strong></p>
<p>Our lives are made up of many elements: family, work, home, relationships, religion, education, identity, and more.  We will begin with the idea that spirituality is not a separate category alongside these others, but a quality found in all aspects of our existence and experience.  We will explore this quality of depth and meaning through practices of rest, gratitude, self-awareness, and integrity.  The goal is to help each person gain a better self-understanding and bring more of their whole selves to their performance.  Our work together will not presume a religious identity and is accessible to people of any faith or no faith.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Why Peace and Healing?</h3>
<p>The last year and a half has been an incredibly challenging one for us all, as we’ve lived through a historic pandemic and come to understand even more deeply some of our society’s biggest social justice challenges. As we look forward to returning to in-person living and singing, it’s time to give our hearts and our voices love and to lift those voices in song to make it clear how urgent these social justice issues are. That’s why this music addresses violence in schools, the climate crisis and its impacts on our oceans. But while these are difficult topics, we believe there is enormous hope and possibility for change, thanks to the work being done in our communities. That’s why we will also sing about the power of singing itself, and the power we each have to make a difference. </p>
<p>You’ll have support with PDF scores of the music, rehearsal tracks, and guidance from the faculty on how to record your vocal parts at home. </p>
<p>After the festival, my team will edit together everyone’s recordings and we will have a reunion on <strong>Wednesday September 22 at 8 pm Eastern</strong> to have a watch party as the recordings are released in a virtual concert for all of your family and friends across the world to enjoy. In this way, our combined voices from across the world, lifted in song, raising awareness and building urgency on some of the most important issues of our time, will create ripples that will expand across the globe. </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What Others Have To Say</span></h3>
<p><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Michael is an excellent musician with a clear, engaging musical voice. She has the ability to work quickly and flexibly with collaborating musicians and composes music that is both topical and accessible, while never vapid. Being a conductor herself she understands the learning process, the abilities of singers, and the need to write music that fits the voice. I highly recommend collaborating with this excellent musician and person. </i></p>

Deep Breaths/Deep Spirit: a Healthy Spirituality for Performers  with Rev. Dr. Philip Hobson

 
Workshop Descriptions
Take Charge of Your Vocal Health & Technique
How can you take the helm of your vocal health and technique as a choral singer or vocal educator? In this interactive workshop, Dr. Lisa Neher will share practices for developing and maintaining lifelong vocal ease, flexibility, stamina, beauty, and health. You will learn a framework for building or revamping your own singing practice, plus tools for returning to singing after illness and maintaining vocal efficiency through the aging process. 
Acknowledgement, Affirmation and Action: Cultivating an Inclusive Choral Community
Unpacking the bias in our curriculum and in ourselves is a difficult process but necessary journey in creating and fostering an inclusive choral community. In this presentation, Dr. Derrick Fox will present concepts that help you ACKNOWLEDGE your biases (personal, curricular and organizational ) with the hopes that you will identify blind spots that may minoritize and marginalize singers in your ensembles or classrooms, outline methods that support the AFFIRMATION of varied lived experiences represented in your ensembles and offer ACTION steps that break the cycle of oppression and support diversity equity, inclusion, access and belonging. Our journeys are unique and this presentation is intended to be a starting place and not a final chapter for your work towards creating an inclusive choral community.
Deep Breaths/Deep Spirit: A Healthy Spirituality for Performers
Our lives are made up of many elements: family, work, home, relationships, religion, education, identity, and more.  We will begin with the idea that spirituality is not a separate category alongside these others, but a quality found in all aspects of our existence and experience.  We will explore this quality of depth and meaning through practices of rest, gratitude, self-awareness, and integrity.  The goal is to help each person gain a better self-understanding and bring more of their whole selves to their performance.  Our work together will not presume a religious identity and is accessible to people of any faith or no faith.
 
Technical Requirements

High speed internet
Laptop or tablet to join the daily sessions, 2nd device (such as smartphone) to use when making recordings of yourself (see below)
Headphones
Quiet space with a clean backdrop to use when you record yourself
Optional: ethernet connection to use during daily sessions for fastest internet, tripod for when you record yourself

When you record your parts for the choral pieces, you will need 2 devices:

Device 1 (computer, laptop, etc): to play the guide audio track through headphones
Device 2 (smartphone): to video record yourself singing your part. You may want a tripod to hold the device while you record.
New to recording yourself? Don’t worry! We will have time to show you exactly how to do this.


 
Why Peace and Healing?
The last year and a half has been an incredibly challenging one for us all, as we’ve lived through a historic pandemic and come to understand even more deeply some of our society’s biggest social justice challenges. As we look forward to returning to in-person living and singing, it’s time to give our hearts and our voices love and to lift those voices in song to make it clear how urgent these social justice issues are. That’s why this music addresses violence in schools, the climate crisis and its impacts on our oceans. But while these are difficult topics, we believe there is enormous hope and possibility for change, thanks to the work being done in our communities. That’s why we will also sing about the power of singing itself, and the power we each have to make a difference. 
You’ll have support with PDF scores of the music, rehearsal tracks, and guidance from the faculty on how to record your vocal parts at home. 
After the festival, my team will edit together everyone’s recordings and we will have a reunion on Wednesday September 22 at 8 pm Eastern to have a watch party as the recordings are released in a virtual concert for all of your family and friends across the world to enjoy. In this way, our combined voices from across the world, lifted in song, raising awareness and building urgency on some of the most important issues of our time, will create ripples that will expand across the globe. 
 
What Others Have To Say
Michael is an excellent musician with a clear, engaging musical voice. She has the ability to work quickly and flexibly with collaborating musicians and composes music that is both topical and accessible, while never vapid. Being a conductor herself she understands the learning process, the abilities of singers, and the need to write music that fits the voice. I highly recommend collaborating with this excellent musician and person. 
--Dr. Allan Friedman, Director, Women’s Voices Chorus of Chapel Hill
 
Rarely have we sung a piece where the poetry and music truly combine to create something approaching divine. 
--Shelley Hedtke, Soprano with Women’s Voices Chorus of Chapel Hill, about Michael's work Only Time To Love

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Plain and simple—we want to make an amazing music video. We'll be traveling to a remote location to spend the day capturing all sorts of great things. The video will feature all seven band members, a cast of six professional dancers, and original choreography, all to be directed and shot by cinematic experts.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO</h2>
<h3>The Band:</h3>
<p>If you don't already know us, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fellowfellowmusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fellow Fellow</a> is a Los Angeles based circus-pop band.  After making music for a few years, we've developed our own truly unique sound.</p>
<p>""With guitars, a tuba, and blaring trumpets, the band gives you a big circus of sound while Cooper Wolken’s vocals carry you through like an 18th century American frontiersmen.."" —The New LoFi</p>
<p>"" . . . a woozy, wonky joyride."" —Buzz Bands LA</p>
<p>Fellow Fellow is: Steven Kai van Betten, Marcus Buser, Nick Hon, Stefan Kac, Louis Lopez, Andrew Rowan, and Cooper Wolken. We released our debut CD <i><a href=""https://fellowfellow.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Traveler</a></i> in July, 2016.</p>
<h3>The Filmmakers:​</h3>
<p>After our CD release show at Bootleg Theater in July, we were approached by filmmakers Sarah Prinz and Daniel J. Rosenberg (collectively <a href=""http://www.flexsusstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flexsus Studios</a>) about collaborating. Having seen the quality of film they make, we were flattered that they were inspired by our music. How could we say no?</p>
<h3>The Choreographer:</h3>
<p>Unbeknown to Sarah and Daniel, Fellow Fellow has a history of visual collaboration with accomplished choreographer and dancer <a href=""http://www.jordansaenz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Saenz</a>, with whom we co-created an immersive and interactive cabaret-style dance-theater production that premiered at ArtShareLA in April 2015.</p>
<p>Thus our team was born: Fellow Fellow'd make the music, Jordan would choreograph the movement, and the masterminds at Flexsus Studios would direct and capture it all.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal, as always, is to create something special, something beautiful, something sublime, something impactful—and that's exactly what we aim to do with this video. We also want to share our music with as many people as possible, and in 2016 there's no better way to share music than through the art of the music video. Something about moving images just captures more attention and encourages more people to press ""play."" And understandably so—we love a good music video. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We need <i>at least</i> $1,100 to make this video happen to its fullest potential.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of costs for the 12-hour film shoot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dancers: $600 (minimum, $100 per dancer)</li>
<li>Crew: $250</li>
<li>Wardrobe: $100</li>
<li>Camera package: $50</li>
<li>Food: $60 (for +/- 15 people, for a 12-hour shoot.)</li>
<li>Props: $20</li>
<li>Gas: $20 (several vehicles needed for 7 musicians, 6 dancers, plus film crew and equipment.) </li>
</ul>
<h3>What you get:<i> PERKS!</i>

<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll use whatever is raised to make the best music video we can with a more limited budget. </p>

<h3>We Need Help!</h3>
<p>Odd Box has been releasing the best noisy (and not so noisy) indiepop and diy punk for nearly 9 years now. Over the years we have built up some debt and we have slowly been paying this off - we need to raise some money to finally clear the debt and allow Odd Box to continue. Without this funding our next 3 or 4 releases will be our last.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Crowdfunding?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise £5000 to pay off all current Odd Box debts and allow us to fund 1 of the the currently planned releases.</li>
<li>We are offering unique T-shirts, tote bags, a mug, stickers, badges as well as an exclusive story of Odd Box fanzine: <i>All Killer, No Filler</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have always been reluctant to crowd fund to help run the label but I see no alternative to help the label survive. I did think about doing a big sale to bring in the funds but I felt the flexibility of running a campaign and offering nice exclusives was the way to go on this occasion.<br/><br/>I know many are uncomfortable with crowd funding as a model and I totally understand that and if this is a funding method you don't agree with it or it doesn't sit easy with you please don't fund us this way. Over 9 years the label has paid it's own way for over 120 releases we're just finding the current conditions very tough and without clearing our debt Odd Box will not be able to continue doing what we have been doing - finding exciting new bands and giving them a helping hand.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time.</p>

<p>With this set of songs, I'm aiming to do two things, to challenge and to please. </p>
<p>First, is to challenge common political beliefs by reflecting on the current political situation and showing the ugliness of the war and how capitalism needs it to survive. Also to show my view on individualism and its destructive role for the society as a whole. ""Brutal Machine"" and ""Ideology"".</p>
<p>Second, is to please the listener and to pay tribute to the style of the Big Band writing represented by such arrangers as Sammy Nestico and performers as Frank Sinatra or Nancy Wilson which I adore. ""Rainbow"" and ""The Sea"".</p>
<p>The main part of the project is funded by the Art and Humanities Council of Montgomery County MD and my own funds. But I will need additional funding to cover the mixing and mastering, plus to pay to the performers of two songs ""Brutal Machine"" and ""Ideology"", vocal tracks for which have not been recorded yet.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, whatever I would get will go towards mixing and mastering as it is essential for the record to be finished.</p>
<p>The impact that I'm trying to make is best described by Bertolt Brecht:</p>
<p>“The worst illiterate is the political illiterate, he doesn’t hear, doesn’t speak, nor participates in the political events. He doesn’t know the cost of life, the price of the bean, of the fish, of the flour, of the rent, of the shoes and of the medicine, all depends on political decisions. The political illiterate is so stupid that he is proud and swells his chest saying that he hates politics. The imbecile doesn’t know that, from his political ignorance is born the prostitute, the abandoned child, and the worst thieves of all, the bad politician, corrupted and flunky of the national and multinational companies.”</p>
<p>With this record, I'm also calling my fellow musicians to use their art to stand up against the war and inequality and be on the worker's side in the political ideology.</p>
<p>For this campaign, I decided to don't make any CDs as I see them as not very useful.</p>

Below are all the lyrics, written by Douglas Kearney.
 
""Brutal Machine""
The War Machine grinds bodies into money.
Money feeds the capital’s ravenous hunger.
The hunger for power and the tool to inflict it.
The tool is the bloody War Machine. War is
A market where lives are bartered
Blood pours from wealthy wallets
But they call it dollars
The same way they call murdering
poor people “honor.” Who owns the boats, the jets, the bombs and guns?
Who sells death to collect the funds?
[THE RULING CLASS!!!]  
declares wars and sends the people to fight it,
with the weapons that our labor and taxes provided.
Perpetual war
There’s a way we can to stop it,  
Refuse to kill, to kill or die for profit.
Die for profit, die for profit, die for profit, die for profit, die for profit.
Repeat
We can stop the machine’s brutal grinding.
We can starve the state’s endless greed.
We can cut the power from their pockets.
We can choose for whom we’ll bleed.
 
""Ideology""
Chained
to
Our desire for wealth
To make
us higher, we
chant to ourselves,
Inequality’s fate.
“One
crawls
through the mud so that
“one
Rides
on the horse.”
We let the lie live,
Hoping we’ll hold the reins.
Those
Who
Want
To trample you claim
That
We're
just animals
wallowing in our animal lust.
They
want
Our Humanity
sold for Selfish
comfort That's Nothing
but a handful of dust.
 
No more lies and we
change our lives, cause the
future has come., the future is here.
When we choose to fight all our greed
and our selfish pieties,
humanity’s won.
 
Speak the truth
And we wake our minds
‘cause the truth
belongs to us all.
When we fight
For the common good
Selfishness fails
Humanity’s won!
 
""Rainbow""
 
Multicolored ribbon bending in the air.
Lookie-loos are smitten like it’s something rare.
I ignore that scene, I know what “wonder” means.
Wonder is that I have you.
 
Optical illusion, it’s not magical.
Just a trick of fluid and refraction’s all.
But your touch I feel, I know my love is real—
It's like magic that came true
 
When a rainstorm comes and turns the day to night,
You’re the ray of sun that makes the gray go bright.
And what once was glum now fills me with delight.
every color of delight!
When the white-hot sun beats down with vicious heat
And the sidewalk feels like fire on my feet
You’re the nice, soft rain that makes the air so sweet.
Beautiful and oh so sweet.
 
When they seek, they hope for gold and leprechauns,
That’s antique, the chase just leads them on and on.
But I’ve found my treasure cause it's meant to be.
Rainbow just for you and me.
 
""The Sea""
I know a way
that takes me
out of this room
and makes me
feel as vast as the sea beyond the sand.
Sun on my skin, wind blows in,
my windows and blinds swung open,
as seagulls circle like a ceiling fan.
 
The whispering waves
start roaring,
till under the door,
they pour in,
to wash the floor away from where I stand.
Holding my breath, I dive in.
Deeper and yet I’m flying
Free from being stranded back on land.
 
You might think this is a dream—it’s better.
Plant my feet firm on the ground? No, never!
You can’t stop a spirit wild as a tempest
I’ll be sailing in the bluest distance.
 
It’s farther than you’d
imagine.
More wondrous than you
could fathom.
Its strength could wear a mountain to a stone.
Bright as a jewel It shimmers,
Peaceful and cool,It glimmers.
And when I swim inside I’m finally home!
 
You might think this is a dream—it’s better.
Plant my feet firm on the ground? No, never!
You can’t stop a spirit wild as a tempest
I’ll be sailing in the bluest distance.
 
Don’t you tell me it’s a dream—it’s better.
Keep my feet firm on the ground? I’ll never!
You can’t dam a spirit wild as a tempest,
I’ll be sailing in the blue—
I’d sail into the blue—
I want to sail the bluest distance.

<p>Robin Cisek is a singer/ songwriter who creates melodic and moody, alternative pop with introspective and vulnerable lyrics. Robin Cisek emerged into her music career after years of struggles with health problems. These experiences have further fueled her growth as a songwriter and encouraged her to write about experiences that are highly relatable but not often talked about. Robin uses her soulful and highly stylized vocals to create mysterious and dramatic narratives that are captivating and powerful. Throughout her music, Robin Cisek wears her heart on her sleeve and openly invites audiences to join her in a surreal world.</p>
<p>Robin’s inspiration comes from her own experiences and her Indigenous heritage. Robin’s heritage takes form in music through her alternative beats and lyrics that challenge the status quo. Robin has been a professional musician for a short time and released her first commercial song at the end of 2017 and then another in 2018. Previous to this, she was awarded many high adjudications for her vocals. Robin Cisek’s first releases were developed with the guidance of Grammy-award-winning producers in NYC and LA. These singles received many praises in addition to being played on radio in Canada and internationally. Robin’s single, “Waiting on You” claimed the #1 spot on an Indigenous International Radio chart and remained on the countdown for 24 weeks.</p>
<p><strong><u>Robin is working towards creating brand new music</u></strong> that she hopes to release as her first album by the summer of 2021. As you may know, creating art can be very expensive. This campaign was created to help fundraise to ensure that <strong><u>Robin's first full-length</u></strong> album can find success and come into the world without a hitch! </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The goal of fundraising is to collect money for marketing and promotion for my new album and to recoup the money used to record my music. The creation of this album was entirely funded by me from my previous musical successes and gigs. I am now, reaching out to you, for funding for promotion and marketing! I have many tiers of donation, some have merch, some are services like performing cover songs and some are just donations ranging from very low increments to something on the larger side. I appreciate every donation and action to support my music, big or small!</p>
<p><strong>Why Donate?</strong></p>
<p>By donating, you are ensuring the success of my new album. I have worked extremely hard on writing these songs and making sure that they are the best thing I've created to this day. I have complete faith in what I have created and I know you will love my new music! Previously, my song hit #1 on the Indigenous music countdown. This was accomplished with no public funding and a lot of hard work! If I was able to procure a bit of a marketing budget, I can only imagine what we can accomplish for my new music! Any support or donation you can offer me is so greatly appreciated!</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I have always had to work extremely hard to make sure my music is successful and I will continue to do so! My music is my passion and I want to share it with the world. With that being said, I want to work for your support and give you something back for your donations. This is why many of my donation tiers offer a service, item or some form of thank you! I have created personalized perks at a range of prices from $4 all the way to $500 so you can be a part of my project and find a perk that fits your budget and interests you the most!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>

<strong>ABOUT :</strong>  </h2><p>Hi.  I'm a singer-songwriter originally from a small town in Maryland, currently residing in Nashville, TN.  I come from a musical family and grew up playing concert piano and violin, rooted in Bach, Tchaikovsky, Brahms and Beethoven.  I didn't grow up listening to staple, epic songwriters like most of my friends and I don't have an ongoing list of artists and bands who have inspired me from a young age.  I have composers and sonatas and symphonic works.  And I think that's what makes my music and approach to songwriting different than others.</p><p>I didn't start songwriting until college, but found that I could weave in musical ideas I was learning about in school to form a three-and-a-half minute pop song.  I tried to mimic the thick string textures from Brahms, the simple, beautiful melodic lines from Mozart, minimalism from Philip Glass and emotional pull of Tchaikovsky.  I wrote my first song (that I felt proud of), ""The Seams"" and released it on YouTube and then on Facebook.  I was terrified and I felt vulnerable, but friends and family began to react in such a way that I thought, <i>""Wow.  Maybe I really can do this.""  </i>And more importantly, <i>""...maybe I should.""</i></p><p>I wrote song after song after song, and finally took the plunge to record my first full-length album, ""Taller Than Trees"" which released in 2014.  It had radio airplay on Baltimore's 98 Rock and I had a successful release show at the 8x10 with a line out the door in support.  Soon after, I hopped in my car and relocated to Nashville.<br/><br/><strong>N A S H V I L L E</strong></p><p>Life has its ups and downs.  Nashville started as a two-year chapter of downs.  But, what I've learned is that beautiful things can be unearthed from the darkest of moments and you can grow, exponentially, when you have no other place to go than straight up.  Nashville symbolizes so much for me: heartache and disappointment paired with extreme growth and acceptance.  A beautiful contrast and balance.  Feelings I can barely begin to describe in words. </p><p>I've spent the last year writing songs from the deepest parts of my being, digging deeper to find the things I'm too scared to say out loud and the things I'm too proud to admit.  And now, with your help, I'm ready to scream those things from the rooftop and share them with the world.</p><h2>W H A T   C O M E S   N E X T ?</h2><p>The hustle.  I have my songs, but now comes the execution and the part where you can help me do this.  As much as I wish it were as easy as hitting the ""record"" button, the process is much more complex and demanding of time, creative energy and money.  If you're not familiar with the process of recording and releasing music, here's a quick snapshot:</p><ul>

<p>Jeremy Vancaulart is a self-taught, independent musician. He’s been creating music since he was young, listening to bands such as Nine Inch Nails, The Crystal Method, The Prodigy, and Massive Attack. Jeremy’s passion led him through high school – he played in various rock, and industrial, bands as a singer, but always knew in the back of his mind that he had yet to find a genre that really tapped into his talent.</p>
<p>In his late teens, Jeremy discovered electronic music. He started producing his own music, realizing that he had a knack for evoking incredible emotion with a computer. As the genre gained momentum in the mainstream world, Jeremy continued producing and gaining confidence making electronic music. The response he received from friends and fans was increasingly positive – Jeremy found his calling.</p>
<p>His friend was tragically murdered on October 18 2004. This drove Jeremy to produce his first independent CD. Even though the CD was amateur he realized the true power and impact of music. Producing music became a therapeutic process for him as well as his listeners. His alternative industrial act was featured in the local news, received radio play in Japan, and was sold locally.  The following singles Jeremy produced were sold digitally around the globe.</p>
<p>Although Jeremy had achieved small success in the local music industry, it was still not enough to keep him financially stable. He attended Sheridan College for media, film, and television. He graduated with honours majoring in post-production sound editing and mixing. Jeremy tried to pursue a career working on feature films and television shows, all the while knowing it was not where is heart was.</p>
<p>Jeremy has done all he can do to continue making music while paying the bills – he was paid to drive a truck picking up donations for the Canadian Diabetes Association, and got a part-time job working as an AV technician in Toronto. Still, this was not enough.</p>
<p>With an entrepreneurial spirit, Jeremy has chosen a new path. He has created a digital independent record label, Black Sunset Music, and needs financial support through the startup phase. His undeniable love and passion for developing musicians coupled with his essential need to produce his own music led him to Black Sunset Music. </p>
<h2>
<strong>What Is Black Sunset Music?</strong>           </h2>
<p>Black Sunset Music is an independent, digital record label that aims to promote and release quality electronic dance music (EDM). With a focus on trance, progressive, and chill music, Black Sunset Music will help give musicians, like Jeremy, the support and resources needed to break into the electronic music industry. Black Sunset Music is located in Toronto, Canada and work mainly with Canadian musicians.</p>
<h2><strong>The Goal</strong></h2>
<p>Black Sunset Music will bring you music that makes you really ‘feel’. There is a misconception in some people’s minds: over-production means less emotive music. Black Sunset Music will help prove that this is not the case.</p>
<p>Breaking out of the mainstream mold is difficult, and Black Sunset Music aims to show the world true electronic talent by producing exceptional EDM. Black Sunset Music will help promote truly talented artists that deserve to be recognized and will help share the love and beauty of electronic dance music.</p>

<p>l suppose that's not entirely true: but recording and mixing music that doesn't make people's ears bleed is the real trick.</p>
<p>We're up to our eyeballs in pre-production demo recordings that we're really, really excited about. The key factor here is we want to release our music and we want to do it RIGHT. We're getting the experts involved.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.sansarcade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> to check some of them out, they're <strong>REALLY</strong> good!</p>
<h3>So what's the goal?</h3>
<p>We want to get a shortlist of 6 songs professionally recorded, mixed, mastered and playlisted on local rock radio stations. We're not talking a quick ""slap it together after work, before putting the kids to bed"" effort in a semi-professional studio: this is the real McCoy, the full monty.</p>
<p>We've worked hard at developing fantastic connections with New Zealand's top recording engineers and music industry leaders to figure out how to make our money work as hard as it can. We want the best value possible with the best people available without compromising on a single iota of quality to get a result we can get behind and be really proud of.</p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>We've set up a pre-ordering system on the right hand side of this page, everything from $1 digital downloads, to limited edition CDs. </p>
<p>If you aren't able to place an order or donate financially, we completely understand - there are other way you can support the SansArcade phenomenon:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOST IMPORTANTLY help us spread the word. Use the indie-gogo 'share' tools above for your facebook and twitter. We need help getting the word out and it'll be much easier with your help!</li>
<li>Follow us on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SansArcade"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> and/or <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SansArcadeNZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>
</li>
<li>Show a friend our <a href=""http://www.sansarcade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>;</li>
<li>Play a friend some of our <a href=""http://www.sansarcade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Helping us spread the word on Facebook, Twitter and by telling your friends about us helps more than you could imagine. Please share the link and get the word out!</p>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>We're seeking support with covering the costs of the recording, mixing &amp; mastering of the EP to get our music out to new people. The basic costs are outlined below and we're seeking $5000 through crowdfunding, this won't cover everything but will at least cover the majority of the recording costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary recording in one of NZs most famous high quality studios is going to cost around <strong>$2500</strong> at a conservative estimate.</li>
<li>Secondary recording, editing and mixing will run us <strong>$4000</strong>
</li>
<li>Mastering for 6 songs has been quoted at around <strong>$1000</strong>
</li>
</ul><p>As you can see already, the project will be just short of 8K and we are already doing everything we can to self-fund the rest.</p>
<h3>So who are we?</h3>

l suppose that's not entirely true: but recording and mixing music that doesn't make people's ears bleed is the real trick.
We're up to our eyeballs in pre-production demo recordings that we're really, really excited about. The key factor here is we want to release our music and we want to do it RIGHT. We're getting the experts involved.
Click here to check some of them out, they're REALLY good!
So what's the goal?
We want to get a shortlist of 6 songs professionally recorded, mixed, mastered and playlisted on local rock radio stations. We're not talking a quick ""slap it together after work, before putting the kids to bed"" effort in a semi-professional studio: this is the real McCoy, the full monty.
We've worked hard at developing fantastic connections with New Zealand's top recording engineers and music industry leaders to figure out how to make our money work as hard as it can. We want the best value possible with the best people available without compromising on a single iota of quality to get a result we can get behind and be really proud of.
How can you help?
We've set up a pre-ordering system on the right hand side of this page, everything from $1 digital downloads, to limited edition CDs. 
If you aren't able to place an order or donate financially, we completely understand - there are other way you can support the SansArcade phenomenon:

MOST IMPORTANTLY help us spread the word. Use the indie-gogo 'share' tools above for your facebook and twitter. We need help getting the word out and it'll be much easier with your help!
Follow us on Twitter and/or Facebook

Show a friend our website;
Play a friend some of our music.
Helping us spread the word on Facebook, Twitter and by telling your friends about us helps more than you could imagine. Please share the link and get the word out!
Where does the money go?
We're seeking support with covering the costs of the recording, mixing & mastering of the EP to get our music out to new people. The basic costs are outlined below and we're seeking $5000 through crowdfunding, this won't cover everything but will at least cover the majority of the recording costs.

Primary recording in one of NZs most famous high quality studios is going to cost around $2500 at a conservative estimate.
Secondary recording, editing and mixing will run us $4000

Mastering for 6 songs has been quoted at around $1000

As you can see already, the project will be just short of 8K and we are already doing everything we can to self-fund the rest.
So who are we?

We're an Auckland band who's new on the scene but between the four of us we've been touring and playing shows all over New Zealand for over a decade, including some of the country's largest festivals - some of us have even made it across the Tasman to book and play shows up and down the east coast of Australia.

<h3><strong><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">Personal Journey</span></strong></h3>
<span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">My name is Rose Bilal.  In addition to being a jazz singer, I'm a visual artist, a writer, motivational speaker, and actor.  I love being able to do all of those things!     The talents I've been given has brought so much happiness to my life, and to the lives of the many people I've have the privilege of entertaining.  </span> <span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">This campaign is important to me because it gives me a tool that provides me with a bigger voice to spread the healing sounds of music to a wider listening audience, and to help keep alive the music that has played a major role in the creation of our culture.   </span> 
<h3><strong><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">My Story</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">In the 1960’s when I was singing with my Rhythm &amp; Blues group I thought, “it can’t possibly get any better than this”.  Here I am, traveling the globe with a dynamite singing group, making a ton of money, and hanging out with the stars!  For me, that was equivalent to having died and gone to heaven.  Especially since before that time, my life was a long way from being anything special.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">As I explain in my book, “Don't Blame the Road”, a memoir I've written about my life, “It was almost as if overnight I'd gone from being incarcerated, to being friends with people who were on television, in the news, and had millions of people rushing out to buy their records.  I was constantly pinching myself as I marveled at how things had turned around in my life.    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">As I look back I can't help but marvel at how the simplest things can end up making the biggest difference.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">It wasn't until the 90’s when the wonderful, intricate, sounds of jazz music found its way into my ears.   I knew I was hearing something unique, and that it would somehow have a profound effect on my life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">For me it was hearing a voice on the radio, coming out of a woman I thought must've been an angel.   World renowned jazz vocalist, Sarah Vaughan made so many unbelievable twists, turns, highs, and lows in all the songs I'd heard her sing that it instantly changed my taste in music.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">Being a singer, I thought I knew about singing, and music.  That is, until I heard jazz music.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">I had no idea there was such a huge difference in the rhythm and timing of jazz music, versus Rhythm &amp; Blues.  Having been a rhythm &amp; blues singer since early childhood, and not having any formal training, made my transition to jazz music a very trying, but extremely rewarding experience.   I had an<em> unprecedented</em> drive to learn this new music.  I worked day &amp; night listening to all the female jazz singers whose records or CD’s I could find.  Singers like, Sarah, Ella, Carmen McRae, Nancy Wilson, etc.  I would go to all the night clubs where jazz was being played and listen to the singers, and when my nerves allowed, I’d get up and sing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">Early on I was introduced to some world class musicians who recognized in me something I'd been too insecure to admit; I had talent.  These guys were more than willing to take me under their wings, and unselfishly give me their time, guidance, and expert musical advice - which I've used like a Bible - that has helped me tremendously in my growth as a jazz vocalist.  I believe it was during this time my dream of writing and producing my own cabaret show was born.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">The Rewards</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">As time passes, I'm honored, and humbled, to hear, and see the efforts of all my hard work paying off with the applause, and words of encouragement from all the many fans and supporters who has followed my career over the years</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">It is for them and the love I have for what I do that propels me forward, and compels me to want to continue spreading the healing sounds of music throughout the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">There are no words for me to describe the complete ""joy"" I feel inside whenever I witness Senior Citizens who stand up from their wheel chairs, and dance to the <em>old school</em> jazz music they immediately recognize, but can no longer hear played on the radio.  Or, when I see young people, and teenagers running up to me after my performance, to tell me in their “I can't believe it” voice, how much they loved hearing the songs I'd sung.</span></p>

In the 1960’s when I was singing with my Rhythm & Blues group I thought, “it can’t possibly get any better than this”.  Here I am, traveling the globe with a dynamite singing group, making a ton of money, and hanging out with the stars!  For me, that was equivalent to having died and gone to heaven.  Especially since before that time, my life was a long way from being anything special.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Seventh Circle is technically a solo project by Adam Pederson.  Other members who will be featured on this album are Kevin Wiler (guitars) and Pete Allan (drums).  I will also be hiring a bass player as well as additional vocalists for a choir and misc vocals throughout the album.  The first Seventh Circle album (THE STRUGGLE) was released in 2008 and was co-produced with Eric Clayton of the band Saviour Machine.  This time around, I won't be so lucky to have him work on it so I will need an engineer and producer for certain aspects of recording, mainly vocals and drums.  Human, Part One is the first part of a two part concept album which explores the many things happening in our world today. It's mainly about what the digital age has done to our society and where it's all going from here.  Part One deals with the many struggles and turmoils we are facing today where Part Two will delve deeper into what may become of us in the near future.  The music tells just as much of a story as the lyrics will, using many organic and electronic elements side by side to symbolize the fusion of Technology and Human interaction.  I spent 28 months writing this album and I believe it deserves to be done right, utilizing the best possible resources I can and working with some of the best musicians I know.  This album is extremely important to me and I can't imagine releasing it any other way.  Your help to bring this vision to light will be greatly appreciated and I promise to deliver the best album I possible can.  Thank you for taking the time to visit this page and remember, every little bit helps... there is no donation to big or too small.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without sounding too pretentious... I am a HUGE music lover and I believe that a great record can truly change someones life... many have changed mine... it is my sincere hope that my music can reach people and inspire them to create and to do amazing things... A ""Pay it Forward"" concept if you will.  I'm not saying my music will change the world, please understand that... I just want it to open peoples eyes and bring joy and inspiration to those who hear it.  At the very least... I want it to be heard by those who can enjoy it for what it is... my heart and my soul.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Seventh Circle is technically a solo project by Adam Pederson.  Other members who will be featured on this album are Kevin Wiler (guitars) and Pete Allan (drums).  I will also be hiring a bass player as well as additional vocalists for a choir and misc vocals throughout the album.  The first Seventh Circle album (THE STRUGGLE) was released in 2008 and was co-produced with Eric Clayton of the band Saviour Machine.  This time around, I won't be so lucky to have him work on it so I will need an engineer and producer for certain aspects of recording, mainly vocals and drums.  Human, Part One is the first part of a two part concept album which explores the many things happening in our world today. It's mainly about what the digital age has done to our society and where it's all going from here.  Part One deals with the many struggles and turmoils we are facing today where Part Two will delve deeper into what may become of us in the near future.  The music tells just as much of a story as the lyrics will, using many organic and electronic elements side by side to symbolize the fusion of Technology and Human interaction.  I spent 28 months writing this album and I believe it deserves to be done right, utilizing the best possible resources I can and working with some of the best musicians I know.  This album is extremely important to me and I can't imagine releasing it any other way.  Your help to bring this vision to light will be greatly appreciated and I promise to deliver the best album I possible can.  Thank you for taking the time to visit this page and remember, every little bit helps... there is no donation to big or too small.  

Feel free to check out our previous releases here:  http://seventhcircle.bandcamp.com

Thank you!

The Impact
Without sounding too pretentious... I am a HUGE music lover and I believe that a great record can truly change someones life... many have changed mine... it is my sincere hope that my music can reach people and inspire them to create and to do amazing things... A ""Pay it Forward"" concept if you will.  I'm not saying my music will change the world, please understand that... I just want it to open peoples eyes and bring joy and inspiration to those who hear it.  At the very least... I want it to be heard by those who can enjoy it for what it is... my heart and my soul.

            On the heels of our Sudden Death Records deal came Steve Kravac. Steve has produced and engineered bands such as Blink 182, Bad Religion, MXPX and many, many more. He is also a RIAA gold-certified producer, and a damn fine fellow. Steve has given us the amazing opportunity to come to his brand new studio on the outskirts of LA (Hell's Half Acre) and have him record, produce and mix our new album.    Steve has also put us in front of Michael Hateley who is an award-winning audio mastering engineer. Past and present clients of Michael’s include artists such as Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eric Clapton, The Flaming Lips, Green Day, and many more. His work as a Mastering Engineer has sold over 50 million records worldwide.            I know what you’re thinking, ""why don’t you just ask the label to pay for your recording?"" Well the simple answer is that a label is like a bank. Do you love your bank? Do you love paying massive amounts of interest on student loans or mortgages over an unknown number of years!? Well neither do we. We can’t make it on our own and we feel that $5000 is not an unreasonable amount of money to ask for if it can give us a real shot at making it to the main stage of North American music. We love and appreciate anything you can donate.            Check out a few reasons why we think we deserve this money.
First, we have amazing songs. We’re not here to reissue the flavor of the week, we’re writing timeless punk, folk and rock songs that have something to say across the entire spectrum of Love & Politics. Our lyrics do not preach but are a reflection of the society around us and our own experiences of life. We believe in asking questions about society, relationships and one’s place in the world. However, all this is delivered to the tune of fearless sing-along anthems. Our content aims towards those who live and die by the pen, the pint, and the curious mind, but there is a place in all hearts for this band.
Second, we live to entertain. Armed with guitars, sticks and amps, we cover nothing up and let our three part harmonies ring like victory bells. No costumes, no gimmicks, nothing to distract from the fact that we play amazing songs with all our hearts and give you all the energy that music, friendship and living has given us.
There are no words to describe our gratitude. We love and appreciate anything and everything you can donate. If we could repay you with the world we would, but alas we are but one of the flock. We have nothing to offer you but our pure love of life, distilled down into music. You are the grease by which our wheels keep us moving and our dreams keep coming true. Thank you from our heart of hearts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Martha Cargo, and I am a freelance flutist in New York City. I had a zany idea about a year ago to commission 8 young composers (my ""crazy eights,"" referencing a favorite childhood card game), and to not only perform 8 works in one performance in New York but to also bring half the program as a preview to my hometown of Columbia, Maryland.</p>
<p>Drake Ralph Andersen, my good friend and electronics wizard, will be flying in to run sound for the performance (Sunday, August 26th, 2012, at The Other Barn in the Village of Oakland Mills), which will feature premieres of solo flute works by Anne Goldberg, Mike Perdue, Jonah Rosenberg, and Drake himself: Drake is designing a unique responsive audio environment We are renting 6 speakers to fill the cavernous Other Barn space, and we will be getting a high-quality audio recording of the performance. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need:<strong>$500</strong> to cover Drake's travel expenses, as well as the rental of the audio equipment for the electronics.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$10 donation</span>, you will receive an <em>mp3 download of a premiere of your choice</em> from the performance;</li>
<li>For a $<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">50 donation</span>, you will receive a <em>signed CD of the complete performance</em> (composers and soloist!)</li>
<li>For a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$100 donation</span>, you will receive an <em>insider's guide to a performer's life</em> from Martha herself - exclusive access to a videoblog that chronicles her misfit adventures in the Big Apple!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The funds raised</strong> will go, <strong>50-50</strong>, to renting the electronics and paying for Drake's travel. This show will happen<strong> </strong>with your support. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not many professional musicians emerge victorious from our community. It feels right to bring my work home after a decade. This performance is part of my ongoing mission to promote and encourage new repertoire. As John Cage wisely wrote, ""Contemporary music is not the music of the future nor the music of the past but simply music present with us: this moment, now, this now moment.""</p>
<p>I have successfully raised funds with choreographer/composer Anne Goldberg towards our tuition as Emerging Artists in Residence at the Field; last fall, the group now known as Ensemble Sans Maître successfully funded our performance of Boulez's inimitable chamber work <em>Le marteau sans maître. </em>I am eternally grateful for the continued support of my family, friends, colleagues, and mentors in this ever-evolving hustle of a career that I have carved out for myself.  </p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Rhythmo stands for Reaching &amp; Helping Youth Through our Heritage in Music Organization. Rhythmo is dedicated to the preservation of Mariachi music as a folkloric art form.  Since its inception in 1996, Rhythmo has provided affordable music education to hundreds of children.  It is the longest running mariachi program for children of its kind in Orange County and has been featured in numerous articles and news stories in the OC Register, The Los Angeles Times, as well as ABC, NBC, Univision, and Telemundo.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE FOUNDER</strong></p>
<p>Maestro Gabriel Zavala founded Rhythmo Mariachi Academy.  He is one of Orange County’s most celebrated veterans of Mariachi music.  The man is a walking encyclopedia of Mexican-American history.  Zavala is originally from Guanajuato Mexico.  He began his mariachi career with his 7 brothers as “Los Hermanos Zavala” in the early 1960’s. Together they blazed trails for generations to come in ever-conservative Orange County. Twenty years later “Los Hermanos Zavala” disbanded but their passion and legacy lives on through Maestro Zavala’s Rhythmo Mariachi Academy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>Since 1996, Rhythmo Mariachi Academy has been taking students to the Tucson International Mariachi Conference.  The TIMC is a weeklong music workshop taught by the worlds premiere Mariachi groups.  Children from all over the country gather to learn from the most relevant mariachi musicians in the world.  For those not familiar with this genre, imagine being able to learn guitar and singing techniques from John Lennon, Paul Mc Cartney, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regretably, Rhythmo Mariachi Academy was not able to attend the conference last year.  The economic crisis has been especially hard on non-profit organizations such as Rhythmo Inc.  We are simply not able to afford the $10k needed to transport, house, feed, register up to 60 students. The mariachi kids are looking to YOU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE WILL DO</strong></p>
<p>The money raised through Indie Go Go will go directly to pay for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1               charter a bus from Anaheim, Ca. to Tucson Arizona (roundtrip)</p>
<p>2               pay for housing for up to 60 students (hotels)</p>
<p>3               pay the registration fees of $100 for each student.</p>
<p>4               Feed up to 60 students for 5 days.</p>
<p>5               Van rental once in Tucson for transportation from hotel to Conference every day.</p>
<p>In the event that we do not meet our goal, we will keep the money in a fund for next year or for one of Rhythmo’s many projects such a trip to San Diego, Catalina Island Etc.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Year after year we hear the same story.  Kids come to our program a little shy. -Unsure about the funny suit -Unsure about the music. Unsure about themselves.!  They learn the songs. They learn the instrument.  But its not until they make the “pilgrimage” to Tucson that they feel they are a part of something much bigger than their neighborhood.  Their entire demeanor changes and they come home eager to break out their violin, trumpet or guitar and start practicing so they can one day be as good as the master mariachi musicians they have admired and now personally know.  It strengthens their resolve to be somebody and feel good about themselves directly affecting the environment around them.  Many of our students have gone on to be professional musicians. At least two have gone on to be High School band directors.</p>
<p><strong>THE PITCH</strong></p>
<p>We have seen the far reach that Indie Go Go has in funding multi-million dollar projects.  Rhythmo only needs 10, 000 people to donate one dollar each to get these very deserving and talented kids of Rhythmo Mariachi Academy to Tucson.</p>

<p>Rhythmo gave me my first initial experience with music.  Not only was it the first place where I was able to learn and play the violin, but it also gave me my first ensemble experience where I learned at an early age, the importance of  listening, playing, and singing together in a group.  As an active performer today, I am especially grateful for the performance experience that I received from Rhythmo Mariachi Academy, which showed me the importance of having great energy and stage presence in every concert i give.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The one quote that still sticks to me today is from Tio Gaby, (Maestro Zavala).  I was just getting started and could barely  hold the violin, but the principal direction that Tio Gaby gave me was, “Listen and watch.”  Thats all it really took, yet I am still learning that today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think that programs like Rhytmo are very important because it makes music accessible to all.  It encourages the youth as well as adults to appreciate and value culture, art and music. It gives anyone  the experience of creating something beautiful and  rich, while sharing it with the a wide range of audiences.</p>

<p>I first heard of RHYTHMO through my mom in May of 2003.  She read an article about the program in the OC Register and asked if I wanted to join and play violin in RHYTHMO as well as being part of my middle school orchestra.  I gladly accepted not knowing I was going to stick with mariachi music for the rest of my life.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>With the RHYTHMO Mariachi Academy, I now view mariachi music in a different mindset.  Mariachi music used to be just music my parents listened to from time to time.  Now it is practically the only music I play when I’m in my car.  Today, I expanded that passion into not only exploring more into the mariachi genre, but I am studying more about music of other cultures with my Ethnomusicology classes at UCLA.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>I think the best experience I’ve ever had in the time I was with RHYTHMO was when I went to the Tucson International Mariachi Conference for the first time.  It opened my eyes to believing that there are youth out there in the United States that do exactly what I do.  Coming from a predominately Asian and White community, I was never exposed to sharing a common culture with anyone.  When I was at this conference I felt so connected with everyone there and loved that first networking experience and meeting new people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important for programs like RHYTHMO to exist for the purpose of passing traditions on to younger generations.  It is also important because society needs to be informed that the United States is a melting pot and people come from all different backgrounds.  This is the reason why mariachi ensembles do not just exist in Mexico, they exist all over the world (even Japan!).</p>

With the RHYTHMO Mariachi Academy, I now view mariachi music in a different mindset.  Mariachi music used to be just music my parents listened to from time to time.  Now it is practically the only music I play when I’m in my car.  Today, I expanded that passion into not only exploring more into the mariachi genre, but I am studying more about music of other cultures with my Ethnomusicology classes at UCLA.
 
I think the best experience I’ve ever had in the time I was with RHYTHMO was when I went to the Tucson International Mariachi Conference for the first time.  It opened my eyes to believing that there are youth out there in the United States that do exactly what I do.  Coming from a predominately Asian and White community, I was never exposed to sharing a common culture with anyone.  When I was at this conference I felt so connected with everyone there and loved that first networking experience and meeting new people.
 
It is important for programs like RHYTHMO to exist for the purpose of passing traditions on to younger generations.  It is also important because society needs to be informed that the United States is a melting pot and people come from all different backgrounds.  This is the reason why mariachi ensembles do not just exist in Mexico, they exist all over the world (even Japan!).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are Sophistafunk, an analog-soul trio from Syracuse, NY.  Adam plays the keyboards and sings; Emanuel plays the drums, sampler, and sings backup; and Jack is the MC, bringing inspirational and positive lyrics to the deep pocket grooves produced live on stage.  We represent Syracuse, NY and all young hard-working musicians.  Each year we perform more than 200 shows all over the US, and we will continue to do so with your help!</p>
<p>This campaign is crucial to our success because of several factors.  First off, we hope that the release of our new EP will engage our current fans with fresh music, as well as attract new listeners to our style of funk music.  Next, we found that in 2011 ALONE we spent upwards of $18,000 on fuel!  That's a ton of money going to the oil companies rather than our own livelihood.  Lastly, we want to take Sophistafunk to the next level by becoming an INTERNATIONALLY touring band.  This is a huge step for us, and we are confident that the people of the United Kingdom will appreciate what we have to offer.</p>
<p>You as contributors will help us achieve the unimaginable.  Most bands request $20k for a new van ALONE, but with this money we will pay for the recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, CD manufacturing, AND vinyl manufacturing of our new EP, ""Freedom Is"".  The funding will also afford us the diesel conversion van AND the installation of a kit to allow it to run on vegetable oil, saving us at least $15,000 per year in fuel costs!  We will also be able to pay for the 5'x8' trailer which will making touring safer and more comfortable.  And just to top it off, this $20k will even pay for round trip flights for the three of us to go to the UK and spread our music WORLDWIDE!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>- <strong>New EP</strong> - $7,000</p>
<p><em>Once again we are working with our brother Jocko at MoreSound Studios in Syracuse, NY.  Jocko has been amazing to work with.  Effecient, creative, crazy-fun, and also an auxilliary percussion player on our albums!  Your contribution will pay for the recording, mixing, and mastering of our new EP titled ""Freedom Is"".</em></p>
<p><em>We will print 1,000 4-panel digipacks (CDs) of this new EP, as well as 500 180-gram 12"" vinyl records.  Both with full-color artwork by our friend Jon Daly, who has also done the artwork for our debut EP, and our full-length ""Twentyeleven"".</em></p>
<p>-----&gt;  Perks include digital copies of the album, CDs, vinyl records, combo-packages</p>
<p>-----&gt;  LIMITED Perks include SIGNED copies of the CDs and vinyl!</p>
<p>- <strong>Diesel Tour Van</strong> - $3,800</p>
<p><em>The money we raise will pay for the purchase of Pat Sajak, our 1995 GMC Duravan 2500 DIESEL.  This van is amazing, sturdy, without rust, clean, and affordable.  Since it is diesel, it is the perfect candidate for the veggie-oil conversion, we'll get more into that in a second.</em></p>
<p>-----&gt;  LIMITED Perks include a once-in-a-lifetime tour with us in the fabulous Pat Sajak on any one of our 5-10 day tours in 2013/14.</p>
<p>- <strong>Vegetable Oil Conversion</strong> - $5,000</p>
<p><em>You may not know this, but ALL deisel engines are capable of running on vegetable oil!  Sam over at Full Circle Fuels is going to customize Pat Sajak (our van) to run on USED fryer oil. That's right! We can literally tour the United States in a van that runs on the same thing you deep fry your chicken in. To make it even more incredible, Adam (keyboards) owns Funk 'n Waffles, which is a waffle restaurant featured on Diner's Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network. Funk 'n Waffles can provide enough ""grease"" for us to run our van for plenty of miles, let alone all the other restaurants and venues we play that can provide us with their waste-oil as well! </em></p>
<p><em>Sam will install two additional fuel tanks for us to full with used vegetable oil.  Each tank will be filtered, and one will be brought to temp before the filtered oil goes into the engine compartment. We will get the same milage as regular diesel, and we will save at least $15,000 in fuel costs every year!!!</em></p>
<p>-----&gt;  LIMITED Perks include 10-50 orders of Chicken &amp; Waffles @ Funk 'n Waffles.  Help us get the ""grease"" we need by buying multi-packs of that delicious meal you can't get anywhere else!</p>
<p>- <strong>5'x8' Enclosed Trailer</strong> - $1,200</p>
<p><em>Our 5'x8' enclosed trailer is a crucial element in our touring rig.  First off, its about safety, and by keeping all our equipment in a trailer rather than in the van itself, the trailer ensures that if we ever get in a crash, we won't be injured by our own equipment!  Next, the trailer saves the van from unnecessary hauling of our gear on the shocks, struts, and chassy.  With the trailer, we also have enough room to grow as a band, allowing us space to put a full lighting rig and a larger PA if necessary.</em></p>
<p>-----&gt;  LIMITED Perks include a complimentary large furniture or similar moving job utilizing the spacious 5'x8' trailer you helped us purchase. We will travel up to 250 miles to move a piano, couch, anything you need that'll fit inside this beautiful trailer.</p>
<p>- <strong>UK Tour</strong> - $3,000</p>
<p><em>Our good friend Joe Driscoll has been living out in the UK for several years, bringing the hot and heavy Syracuse funk to the ears of the United Kingdom for some time. In August of this summer we plan to take our new EP WORLDWIDE by joining Joe &amp; Sekou as they tour the UK on the way to Shambala Festival.  We will be performing with them the whole way and at the festival itself. This last $3k will go to the three round-trip flights from JFK to Heathrow airport in London.</em></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use the majority of the funds to pay for the production of the CD and Vinyl as well as the studio time.  If there's enough to cover the expense of purchasing the van and trailer we will apply it there.  We hope to cover everything, which is why we are being very thrifty with this $20,000.  You can look around and see that many bands spend $20k on one album alone, or one van alone.  But our fundraiser will cover a van, trailer, conversion to vegetable oil, studio time, CDs, vinyl, and a trip to the UK.  You will not find this value in any other BAND-oriented fundraiser!</p>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Music has always been important to each one of us. Through it we've been changed for the better. Music has given us safety, hope, and inspiration, and recently we've been handed a beautiful chance to extend that safety, hope, and inspiration to others through our own music. We're asking for your help in putting out an album that is shaping up to be the product of all of our struggles, abilities, and love.</p>
<p>Why are we asking for your help? Simply put, recording is expensive. Printing merch is expensive. Gas is expensive. We need a boost to overcome some of the production costs involved in making a full length record from start to finish.</p>
<p>Disguise the Silence has had a great year so far, and it has all been thanks to the love and support of our local music scene. We aim to do justice to the love you've shown.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We're shooting for a goal of 2,000 dollars.</p>
<p>This should help us cover the costs of printing and distributing CDs and merch related to the CD release, and perhaps some travel and production expenses for the CD release show(s). We're taking on the costs of recording ourselves, as we know that sometimes asking a little is still asking a lot, and we want to make our goal so that we can honor those that donate with a successful release. </p>
<p>We also want to give as much back to you as you've given us.</p>
<p>This means we'll be placing heavy emphasis on getting you involved with the process of making the album, whether that be by simply giving those that can't contribute much an early digital release all the way through bringing you into the studio with us or playing a private show for you. We'll also be printing CDs, exclusive t-shirts, and making all sorts of other goodies available to you (free tickets, demos, and so much more). </p>
<p>If we find ourselves falling short of our goal, indiegogo's flexfunding will allow us to keep what we raise, which we will still put towards the album and release party. We will do our absolute best to make sure every contributor receives the perks that fall into their bracket of contribution.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The beauty of the independent music scene is that its growing! We as a band don't have to wait around for our one in a million shot at a major record deal. Still the only way bands become successful independently is through community effort. </p>
<p>By contributing to the creation of this record, it is effectively yours. The music is yours, the message is yours, the love that we wrap it in is yours. Disguise the Silence has never shied away from an opportunity to be outspoken about our passions, our struggles, and most importantly about building each other up through love and encouragement. We will do our best to continue down this path, and we'd be honored to have you as a part of it! </p>
<p>We will continue to play benefit shows. We want you at them. We will continue to write music challenging the structure of our society in hopes of making it better. Your thoughts are valuable to us. Let's make something beautiful together.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>While we have a lot of experience recording collectively as a young band, we've never attempted an endeavor this big before.</p>
<p>As it currently stands we're shooting to release a full-length record of about twelve songs, collectively broken up into four sections that are each themed differently. We're not set on making a concept album, as over the process of writing and deciding what ideas to keep as a band, we'd like to stay open to the opportunity to change things for the better. That said our writing is shaping itself thematically as of now and we're eager to try and take the risk of making a cohesive album that functions as a singular dialogue rather than just a collection of random songs. </p>
<p>This album is going to take a couple months minimum to make, which will most certainly be emotionally and financially stressful, but the four of us feel ready and couldn't be more excited to try.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Money is hard. We understand that completely, which is why we'd still love to have you involved if you can't spare any cash. </p>
<p>Please share our campaign, our music, our videos, and our show dates on all of your social networks. Word of mouth is extremely important in helping a band get on its feet without the use of the manipulative and finely tuned marketing machines like those available to major record labels. </p>
<p>Please consider talking to your friends about pitching together to help as well! If two friends can donate $5 each, it would still mean the world to us, and we'd have no issues with sending you a digital copy of the album when its finished so you can burn it for each-other. </p>

Please consider talking to your friends about pitching together to help as well! If two friends can donate $5 each, it would still mean the world to us, and we'd have no issues with sending you a digital copy of the album when its finished so you can burn it for each-other. 
If you've read this far, thank you so much for your time and we look forward to working with you! 
Love, 
Zach, Michael, Jake, and Dan",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""It all started when I stumbled into a Jazz club in Paris where Pascal was scratchin' on his guitar. It was love at first sight, followed by a complicated and challenging ""French Romantic Comedy"" scenario.  Our duo was created from a desire to play in my home town on family visits. January 2014, Craig Tuthill &amp; Deborah Rogers from the Columbus Blues Alliance wandered by Java Central, heard us playing and encouraged us to compete in the Columbus Blues Challenge on Sept. 28th. Our challenge began before the challenge. We were already booked to play the Volcanic Blues Festival in the center of France Sept. 25th &amp; 26th, but we decided to go for it! After our gig Friday night we drove 6 hours back home to change our luggage just in time to catch the Saturday morning train to Paris, then boarded the plane to the USA. We arrived in Columbus at 10pm, performed in the Challenge on Sunday at 1:30pm, and won! Whoosh. Breath. Ok ... now Memphis! Go!"" ~Lil' Red<br/></p>

<h3><em>Ars Futura</em></h3>
<p>IS a new music group comprised of mixed wind, string, and keyboard instruments. Our goal is to provide the opportunity for collaboration between composers and <em><strong>Ars Futura</strong></em> performers. We hope to redefine the concert experience of new music to the public, dissolving the boundaries between the performers and audience members. The main goal of <em><strong>Ars Futura </strong></em>is to perform and commission new music. In order for our art form to continue evolving, we believe that we must advocate the invention and performance of new compositions.</p>

</div></div>","Ars Futura
IS a new music group comprised of mixed wind, string, and keyboard instruments. Our goal is to provide the opportunity for collaboration between composers and Ars Futura performers. We hope to redefine the concert experience of new music to the public, dissolving the boundaries between the performers and audience members. The main goal of Ars Futura is to perform and commission new music. In order for our art form to continue evolving, we believe that we must advocate the invention and performance of new compositions.
Ars Futura is founded and directed by pianist Shuai Wang, who received her doctoral degree from the Cleveland Institute of Music (Piano, CIM).

singer and guitarist for the rock band, Question of Honour.   I've been a
musician for over three decades.  Creating
music has been something that I've done for most of my life.   It's hard work, fun and challenging.  It's my
passion and I'm fairly certain that I'll be doing it right to the end.  :)  <br/><br/>I'm finishing up work on my first full length album as
Huetensil.  I'm extremely excited for people to hear it, but I need your
help.   In order to ensure that as many people as possible get to hear
my new songs, I want to  promote them to internet and terrestrial
radio.   I've had some success with this in the past.  For me to be effective though, I need some tools that will help
me keep track of who's playing my songs.<br/><br/>That's where you come in.   With the help of your contributions, I'll
be able to pay for those tools and they will help make me more
effective.  Ultimately, this means more people will hear my songs. 
Please take a few minutes and contribute whatever you can afford to
help meet my goal.  I've included a few incentives for you, so
check them out and thank you very much.<br/><br/><b>  <br/></b><h3>The Tracking Tools</h3>
<p>The money that you contribute will allow me to subscribe to CMJ:  New Music Report, Radio Wave Monitor and/or other similar services.  I still haven't decided which one I'm going to use.  I may get to use a combination, depending on how far beyond the goal we get.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>CMJ publishes a weekly magazine that lists the charts for each of the radio stations that report to it along with contact information for those stations.  They cover mostly terrestrial college radio stations in the U.S.<br/></p>
<p>Radio Wave works a little differently.  They have a system which tracks each play of an individual song on each station that they monitor.  Their focus is primarily on internet stations but because many terrestrial commercial stations stream on-line their stats are added to the mix.  They monitor well over 1,800 stations.  They also provide contact information for the stations that they monitor and an avenue for distributing music to those stations.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p>There are no guarantees that, with these tools, I'll be able to get even
 one radio station to air my songs.  However, I've done this several 
times before and I have never failed to get at least a few.  In fact, 
every major release that I've been involved with has charted for at 
least a week on several stations.  I want these tools because stations 
will often air songs and not tell the artist!</p>
<p>  <br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways That You Can Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone will be able to help financially, but that doesn't mean that you can't help me reach my goal.  You can still help by getting the word out and making some noise about my campaign and my new album:</p>

WHO?
Hi Crowdfunders, what's up?
We are Kezia, an Italian band which is trying to raise some
funds to print and promote our  first
album, “The Dirty Affair”.   We like to define our genre ""prop-metal"", 'cause we like to merge the classical progressive sonorities with the freshness and lighthearted
flavour of pop-rock music.
The themes we deal with inside our songs are often ironic,
desecrating and even embarrassing, but mainly we try to paint metaphors of
life.WHY INDIEGOGO?We decided to ask you an aid 'cause we believe it's important to have some feedback about our art and, above all, we're very proud of the idea to directly involve our potential fans into the promotion of our first record. This campaign will also allow us to spread our music out of national borders and to meet a lot of brand new friends.        The funds we'll try to raise will be used for the following outgoings:                          ABOUT THE ALBUM...Here’s the album’s track list with a short theme’s description:
1) 
Before I Leave: due to the global economic crisis a sad cat
comes to a tragic decision...
2)  Ebola: a hungry man and his turtle...
3)  The Dirty Affair (Between Pelican and Bear): it’s not
just another silly love song, it's an ode to a different type of beauty.
4)  Sneakers: the real story of Roy Sullivan, the Ranger with the gift of
immortality.
5)  Barabba Son’s Song: Everyone remembers Jesus but nobody talks 'bout Barabba.
6)  Quendo: ...and what if a pub in a small town was a gateway to hell?
7) 
Preludio: Just a moment of peace.
8)  Treesome: The recurring nightmare of a young teenager. Just a botany issue?Up ahead you'll find a youtube link where you could listen a short preview of each song.     This gonna be the album's cover:
PERKS?YES THANKSIf you join our family we'll give in exchange some cool exclusive gadgets...You can even join us for a cozy dinner, obviously cooked by us (don't be scared and trust us, we're italian).

<h2>O HAI</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm George Ryan Perez, singer/songwriter for the Gainesville, FL indie-punk band Murphee K, and I am happy to announce that I'm releasing not just one but 2 music CDs!</p>
<h2>Niiiiiice!  Could you plz tell me about the 1st CD you're releasing?</h2>
<p>The first CD I am releasing is the one I made with Craig, Peter, and Matt, and it's called <strong><em>The Missing</em></strong>.  It has 7 songs and it was recorded in 2004 (then mixed in Aug 2005) from Goldentone Studios.  If you like catchy punk tunes that make you want to dance and hug your friends, then this CD is for you!  And OK there may be some parts in there that could induce crying spells, so anyway FAIR WARNING.<br/><br/>[I want to take a second here to address Craig, Peter, and Matt.  Guys if you are reading this, thank you.  I wanted to dedicate this to you all because of the work you've put into this, and I wanted to finally give it a proper release.]</p>
<h2>Cool story, bro, but what about the 2nd CD?</h2>
<p>The second CD I am releasing is the one I made with Chris and Shuhei this summer 2012, and it's called <strong><em>EndGame</em></strong>.  This CD contains 3 songs, each of which tries to improve upon every song from <em>The Missing</em> on every aspect imaginable.  (The key word here is ""try"".)  A couple of songs are also garnished with samples from video game music, which -- as some of you know -- I am quite fanatic about.<br/><br/>[Chris and Shuhei -- thank you for investing your time and effort into this, you both are top notch.]</p>
<h2>Like, whoa, I'd like to be a part of this.  How can I help?</h2>
<p>So, ho-kay, let's talk about you.  You, dear reader, could be part of my journey of releasing both CDs simply by contributing to this fundraiser.  (Check out the perks on the side to see what cool things you'd get as a contributer.)  In return, I will judiciously use the funds to do five things:<br/><br/><strong>1) Pay the costs of the cover art designs</strong><br/><br/><strong>2) Order a press run of both CDs</strong><br/><br/><strong>3) Sell the CDs to awesome people like you directly (via the band website) or indirectly through iTunes or other online services</strong><br/><br/><strong>4) Use whatever is left to make T-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise</strong><br/><br/><strong>5) [BONUS] Donate 100% of the proceeds made from the first CD's first press run to a local Gainesville, FL organization</strong></p>
<h2>Oooh, what's this donation thingy you're doing?</h2>
<p>I just told you!  OK, OK, one more time:  <strong>all the proceeds from <em>The Missing</em>'s first pressing will be donated to one local Gainesville, FL organization</strong>.  This means that once I start selling <em>The Missing</em> (the first CD), 100% of the proceeds that I make from its sales during the first run will go to charity.<br/><br/>As of this writing, I am still working on which organization that is, and I'm leaning towards either the <a href=""http://www.civicmediacenter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Civic Media Center</a> or the <a href=""http://www.homevan.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">H.O.M.E.

My dream started at a very young age when I was constantly in the hospital battling kidney failure. My mom likes to say that she was the start of my career since she is the one that supplied all the musical toys for me, and I guess I just got hooked from there. Anyways, I want to make this short and simple. I released my first EP in January of 2013 and it since hit the charts at #4.

<li><p><b>Studio Time/Recording</b> - Recording is the first step (and one of the most important steps) in completing this EP.  I mean, without recordings of the songs, this project can’t actually exist.  I will be recording at Studio 2100 in Springfield, MO.  Studio 2100 is an extremely high quality, professional recording studio that produces outstanding music.  These funds will be used to record, mix, and master the songs.  I have recorded there once before, and I am so excited to go back! :)  (28% of budget)</p></li>
<li>
<b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Post Production</b><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> - Post production is definitely the most expensive part of this whole project.  But, an EP or album just isn’t the same without it.  Post production includes everything from creating the album cover to distributing the music on iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, etc.  I will be working with Disc Makers on all the post production, and I am super excited to work with them.  They can pretty much do anything when it comes to post production, so there are endless possibilities!  (61% of budget)</span><br/>
</li>
<li><font color=""#6a6a6a""><b>Fees </b>- A small percentage of the costs comes from certain fees that we have to pay.  These fees include Indiegogo project fees (so we can keep using their amazing services), Pay Pal fees for when we collect the contributions, and copyright fees.  (7% of budget)</font></li>
<li><font color=""#6a6a6a""><b>Extra/Emergency Funds </b>- It's always super important to have an emergency fund just in case unplanned events take place.  This will account for any unexpected costs that may arise.  This part of our budget is kind of like insurance, being that it will insure that we have enough funding to complete our project.  (4% of budget)</font></li>

<ul> </ul>
<div>Where your money is going:</div>
<div>Our establishment and entity. We are a team of strong-willed individuals who have a strong and dynamic vision and we need your help in order to start our amazing journey.</div>
<div>In order for us to launch our first ""Ultimate FAN-Raising Experience Sweepstakes"", we need funding  that will be used to rent a quality camera, lights, sound, insurance, and the private studio where you will have your chance at meeting one of our celebrity guest. This Sweepstakes will launch as soon as we reach our projected. We've even teamed up with some celebrities that you might recognize from Disney Channels ""Wizards of Waverely Place"", and another from MTV's ""Faking It."" <br/>
</div>
<div>Our first annual, ""Project; No Solider Left Behind,"" where we will be flying a select few active-duty service men and woman home for the holidays to be able to celebrate with their families and loved ones who otherwise can't afford to. If time permits, we would like to transport active duty soldiers who are stuck on base this Thanksgiving and host a warm, hearty, catered Thanksgiving meal in Los Angeles, CA. Having friends personally who are active duty Marines and learning of the thousands of soldiers who simply can't afford to go home for the holidays is something we'd like to change. </div>
<div>In return for your donation, we are offering incentives for you to join us for our Celebrity Launch Party in Hollywood, CA. Tickets will be sold at a higher rate early next year BUT you can earn PRIORITY ACCESS NOW!!! This means you get in before the general a public at a discounted rate! </div>
<div>You can even win a date with Christoper Van Etten, Kennedy Grace, or Luke Valen as they celebrate with us at our Celebrity Launch Party! They'll treat you to dinner before you WALK THEM DOWN THE RED CARPET and join them backstage as their special guest of the night. That's right, backstage access and walk the red carpet where you could be rubbing elbows with our musical and celebrity guest. We are reaching out to Emblem3, Hunter Parrish, and even Nick Jonas and will announce as we get confirmations. So follow us on Twitter @FANdationLA as well as Instagram @FANdationLA to be the first to know who's involved. *All donations are lawfully meant as donations and will not be returned to the general public for any reason. By the laws and regulations of the State of California, all donations shall remain donations and cannot be refunded. If FANdation is terminated or of dissolution, and assests are lawfully obligated to be distrubted to one (1) or more qulifying organizations.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With your donations, we are launching:</p>
<p>""Project: Protect Our Schools"" is our biggest passion as we readily prepare schools for possible gunman attacks by running mock school shooting drills, donate metal detectors to schools in need, and creating safety regulations that will help protect our schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>""Project: No Solider Left Behind"" we will host an annual ""TROOP-N-TURKEY TIME."" Every Thursday, November 27, we will transport and host a few of our uniformed men and woman and provide them with a warm, catered, Thanksgiving meal in Los Angeles. We know of the thousands of active duty soldiers who are stuck on base and cannot be with their families for the holidays, and we want to help change that​. Available at our host location, we will provide Skype/FaceTime booths where they will be able to contact their loved ones. If we raise enough funds, we are hoping to be able to fly a select few home for a surprise visit with their families.</p>
<p>""Project: Art is Alive"" Where we will donate new pianos, instruments, and even cameras and boom mics to help develop a morning news crew team for less fortunate schools. We will also donate the funds to put up full-scaled productions as well as offer directing and coaching to put on performances for their community and raise money for their own art programs.</p>
<p>In Spring of 2015- we are planning ""FANdations Ultimate Glee-off"". Part of our ""Project: Art is Alive,"" In Hollywood, CA, we will host 5 schools who will compete against one another for the Gold Glee Cup. More details to come soon!</p>
<p>Not to mention, year round ""Ultimate FAN-Raising Experiences with some of your favorite celebrities.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>FAN-dation will survive because we plan to use more community outreach than anything. We want to get people actively involved instead of just giving money. This is why we like the idea of providing fans with once-in-a-lifetime chances to meet their biggest idols. It's a win-win situation for everybody! We team up with big celebrity names to bring you awesome experiences, you donate for an amazing cause and win these awesome prizes, and in return, Americas schools, communities and service men and woman, will replenish from it. </p>
<p>Launching a non-profit organization requires, oddly enough- money. We are filing with the IRS to obtain a 501(c)(3) and with our production skills as well as all our marketing skills we will be able to sustain the necessary marketing tools in order to keep afloat. Government funding and grants are not a critical component for our survival and we will be applying as a ""small non-profit"" at least for the first three years making it easier for us to obtain the 501(c)(3), according to our organization adviser. </p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute even just a $1 bill, hey, we understand. We know what it's like to be broke college/high school students as well, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<p>Help spread the word! A simple tweet or insta post will help us out tremendously! Tell your friends about us and follow us.</p>

Available at our host location, we will provide Skype/FaceTime booths where they will be able to contact their loved ones. If we raise enough funds, we are hoping to be able to fly a select few home for a surprise visit with their families.
""Project: Art is Alive"" Where we will donate new pianos, instruments, and even cameras and boom mics to help develop a morning news crew team for less fortunate schools. We will also donate the funds to put up full-scaled productions as well as offer directing and coaching to put on performances for their community and raise money for their own art programs.
In Spring of 2015- we are planning ""FANdations Ultimate Glee-off"". Part of our ""Project: Art is Alive,"" In Hollywood, CA, we will host 5 schools who will compete against one another for the Gold Glee Cup. More details to come soon!
Not to mention, year round ""Ultimate FAN-Raising Experiences with some of your favorite celebrities.   Risks & Challenges
 

FAN-dation will survive because we plan to use more community outreach than anything. We want to get people actively involved instead of just giving money. This is why we like the idea of providing fans with once-in-a-lifetime chances to meet their biggest idols. It's a win-win situation for everybody! We team up with big celebrity names to bring you awesome experiences, you donate for an amazing cause and win these awesome prizes, and in return, Americas schools, communities and service men and woman, will replenish from it. 
Launching a non-profit organization requires, oddly enough- money. We are filing with the IRS to obtain a 501(c)(3) and with our production skills as well as all our marketing skills we will be able to sustain the necessary marketing tools in order to keep afloat. Government funding and grants are not a critical component for our survival and we will be applying as a ""small non-profit"" at least for the first three years making it easier for us to obtain the 501(c)(3), according to our organization adviser. 
   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute even just a $1 bill, hey, we understand. We know what it's like to be broke college/high school students as well, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi! I and my band, Dawn Drake &amp; ZapOte have been invited to play at the Iowa Women's Music Festival, which features women who write and perform all kinds of original music. It is held in Iowa City every year. The festival impacts about 1500 people in Iowa City and it is a grassroots festival run by dedicated women. The festival is paying us a fee to come play, and the fee paid meets about half of our expenses towards traveling to Iowa, eating, sleeping and paying these wonderful female musicians a small fee for their time and talents. We are starting this campaign to raise money to help make this trip possible. We have 5 shows: Baltimore, MD; Cleveland, OH; Bloomington, IN; Iowa City, IO, and Youngstown OH. Most of the venues are small and are offering us a small fee. But we are 5 females, so we need some extra help meeting our needs for our trip, which will be fro Sept 7 to Sept 13, 2011.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The impact will be that we girls in the band will be able to rent a van, eat 3 meals a day and sleep in a safe place on the nights that are not covered by the venues that we play.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1600 to make this tour happen. $500 for a mini-van rental, $400 for gas(for 2000 miles of travel), $300 for food for 5 musicians for 5 days, and $450 for hotel rooms(2 rooms for 3 nights for the venues that do not provide this).  We are offering several campaign options.  Check them out!!<br/></p>
