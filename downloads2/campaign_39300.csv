This year i'll be sharing donations between two good causes:<br/><br/>Firstly, donations will go to Itapoa Reserve, a rainforest project in Ecuador. Every now and then you meet someone in life whose dedication and devotion in the face of adversity humbles you. Raul and his project does just that. $16,800 has already been raised to purchase 50 hectares of rainforest and save it from the logging companies. We need to push this to around $22,000 to get the legal work done to turn it into a national reserve. If I could raise just $500 that would really help the final push. Spread the word and we could do much better. <br/><br/>I would be here all night if I tried to write why this is such a good cause so if you would like to know more here are some links for you:</p><p> <a href=""http://www.itapoareserve.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.itapoareserve.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.itapoareserve.com</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.itapoareserve.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Itapoa-Tropical-Rainforest-Reserve/161706220523717?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Itapoa-Tropical-Rainforest-Reserve/161706220523717?fref=ts</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.itapoareserve.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBNrQJpmtZU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBNrQJpmtZU</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Royal National Lifeboat Institution</h2><p><br/>If saving the rainforest isn't your thing, maybe the RNLI is.

<p><strong>Hallo wir sind Claire &amp; Margit</strong>,<br/>wir leben in Südtirol und hier befindet sich In der Stadt Brixen, wie durch <strong>ein Wunder, ein letztes Stück Auwald</strong> - und zwar mitten in der Industriezone.</p>
<p>Der Wald ist mit seiner lebendigen Kronenstruktur, seiner Pflanzenvielfalt und seinem reichen Boden voller Pilze, ein <strong>dringend schützenswerter Lebensraum</strong> unzähliger, zum Teil gefährdeter Arten. <strong>Wir lieben diesen Auwald</strong> &amp; möchten gemeinsam mit dir alles tun, um ihn davor zu bewahren abgesägt und durch ein Industriegebäude ersetzt zu werden.</p>
<p>Der Brixner Gemeindeausschuss hat das geplante Gebäude der Firma ‘Progress’, dem der Auwald weichen soll, zwar schon genehmigt, aber <strong>noch ist es nicht zu spät!</strong></p>
<p>Es stehen noch weitere Entscheidungen aus und gemeinsam mit dem <a href=""http://artenschutzzentrum.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen</a> ist nun alles vorbereitet, <strong>um Rekurs einzuleiten.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Was wir jetzt brauchen</h3>
<p>...deine Hilfe, die Gerichtskosten zu decken. Mit deiner Spende <strong>kannst du direkt mitwirken, dieses wertvolle Lebewesen Wald vor der Abholzung bewahren</strong> und aktiv für deine Werte und für’s Leben einstehen.<br/><br/><strong>Gib was du kannst und weit mehr, als du eigentlich geben würdest und noch mehr</strong> <strong>und spüre, wie deine Großzügigkeit in den Wald, in die Erde und in die zukünftigen Generationen fließt.</strong> Danke dir, für deinen Beitrag und dein Mitgestalten unserer aller Zukunft.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>→ + ca. 4.400 EURO</p>
<p>Indiegogo Plattformgebühr</p>
<p>→ + ca. 500 EURO</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wohin geht das Geld der Crowdfunding Kampagne? </strong><br/>Direkt auf’s Onlus-Spendenkonto vom ‘Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen’ von da aus wird ein Teil der Summe dem Anwalt zur Einleitung vom Rekurs am regionalen Verwaltungsgericht in Bozen überwiesen. Das Sicherheitspolster bleibt vorerst auf dem Konto des Onlus Vereins und wird für Eventualitäten verwendet, bis der Prozess abgeschlossen ist. Wenn der Wald sicher ist, und noch etwas übrig ist, kann das Geld gemäß der Satzung des Artenschutzzentrums für den Erhalt der Biodiversität eingesetzt werden. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ciao, siamo Claire &amp; Margit</strong>,<br/>viviamo in Alto Adige e qui nella città di Bressanone c’è rimasto, come <strong>per miracolo, un ultimo pezzo di bosco ripariale</strong> - proprio nel mezzo della zona industriale.</p>
<p>Con la sua struttura, la varietà di piante e il suo terreno ricco di funghi, il bosco è <strong>un habitat che ha urgentemente bisogno della nostra protezione</strong>. È la casa di innumerevoli specie, alcune delle quali sono in pericolo di estinzione. Noi<strong> amiamo questo bosco</strong> e insieme a te vogliamo fare tutto il possibile per evitare che venga abbattuto e sostituito da un edificio industriale.</p>
<p>La giunta comunale di Bressanone ha già approvato il progetto di costruzione dell a ditta ""Progress"", a cui il bosco deve cedere il passo, ma <strong>non è troppo tardi!</strong></p>
<p>Altre decisioni devono ancora essere prese e, insieme all '<a href=""http://artenschutzzentrum.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen/centro di protezione delle specie</a>', abbiamo preparato tutto <strong>per avviare un ricorso! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cosa ci serve</h3>
<p>...abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per coprire le spese legali. Con tua donazione <strong>contribuisci direttamente a salvare questo prezioso bosco </strong>e di mostrare attivamente i tuoi valori, difendendo la vita. </p>
<p><strong>Dai quello che puoi, e se riesci molto più di quanto daresti di solito e ancora di più e poi fermati a sentire come la tua generosità fluisce nella foresta, nella terra e nelle generazioni future.</strong> Grazie, per il tuo contributo e per creare il nostro futuro.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Il piano</h3>
<p>In particolare, abbiamo bisogno di sostegno per finanziare</p>
<p>Studio del caso, avvio del processo, comprese le trattative iniziali</p>
<p>→ 5.690 EURO</p>
<p>Cuscino di sicurezza per le eventualità e per ulteriori trattative </p>
<p>→ + ca. 4.400 EURO</p>
<p>Tassa per la piattaforma Indiegogo</p>
<p>→ + ca. 500 EURO<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Dove vanno a finire i soldi del crowdfunding? </strong><br/>Direttamente sul conto della Onlus dell'Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen, da lì una parte del denaro sarà trasferita all'avvocato per avviare il ricorso presso il tribunale amministrativo regionale di Bolzano. Per il momento il cuscino di sicurezza rimane sul conto dell'Associazione Onlus e sarà utilizzato per gli imprevisti fino al completamento del processo. Se la foresta è sicura, e c'è ancora qualcosa da fare, il denaro può essere utilizzato per la conservazione della biodiversità secondo gli statuti del Centro di protezione delle specie. <br/> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANTE SE HAI BISOGNO DI UNA RICEVUTA DI DONAZIONE</strong><br/>dal Centro Conservazione delle Specie? In questo caso il denaro deve essere trasferito direttamente sul conto - non su indiegogo. Si prega di contattare Claire (claire.idansun@gmail.com) per la ricevuta della donazione e di trasferire la donazione:</p>

<p><strong>Hi, we are Claire &amp; Margit, </strong><br/>we live in South Tyrol and here, in the city of Bressanone there is, <strong>by miracle, a last piece of flood plain forest</strong> - in the middle of the industrial zone.</p>
<p>With its vibrant crown structure, its plant diversity and its rich soil full of mushrooms, the forest is<strong> a habitat urgently needing our protection</strong>. It's the home of countless species, some of which are endangered. <strong>We love this flood plain forest</strong> &amp; together with you we want to do everything we can to prevent it from being logged and replaced by an industrial building.</p>
<p>The municipal committee of Brixen has already approved the planned building of the company 'Progress', which the flood plain forest is to give way to, but <strong>it is not too late!</strong></p>
<p>Further decisions have yet to be made and, together with the '<a href=""http://artenschutzzentrum.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artenschutzzentrum/Species Protection Center St. Georgen</a>', we've got everything  ready now <strong>to lodge an appeal against approvals!</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>... your help to cover the legal fees. With your donation <strong>you can directly contribute to saving this precious living forest </strong>from deforestation and actively stand up for your values and for life. Thank you for being here! </p>
<p><strong>Give what you can, with your possibilities give far more than you would usually give and even more and then stop to feel how your generosity flows into the forest, into Earth and into future generations.</strong> Thank you, for your contribution and for helping to shape our future.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Specifically, we need support to finance the following:</p>
<p>Study of the case, initiation of the process including the initial negotiation</p>
<p>→ 5.690 EURO</p>
<p>Safety cushion for eventualities and further negotiations </p>
<p>→ + approx. 4.400 EURO</p>
<p>Indiegogo platform fee</p>
<p>→ + approx. 500 EURO</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where does your crowdfunding money go? </strong><br/>Directly to the onlus-donation account of the Species Protection Centre (Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen), from where a part of the money is transferred to the lawyer to initiate an appeal at the regional administrative court in Bozen. For the time being, the safety cushion remains on the Onlus-Association’s account and will be used for any eventualities until the process is completed. When the forest is safe, and there is still something left, the money can be used for the conservation of biodiversity according to the statutes of the Species Protection Centre. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: IF YOU NEED A DONATION RECEIPT from the Species Protection Centre</strong><br/>In this case the money has to be transferred directly to the account - not through Indiegogo. Please contact Claire (claire@claireidansun.com) for your donation receipt and transfer your donation to:</p>

Hallo wir sind Claire & Margit,wir leben in Südtirol und hier befindet sich In der Stadt Brixen, wie durch ein Wunder, ein letztes Stück Auwald - und zwar mitten in der Industriezone.
Der Wald ist mit seiner lebendigen Kronenstruktur, seiner Pflanzenvielfalt und seinem reichen Boden voller Pilze, ein dringend schützenswerter Lebensraum unzähliger, zum Teil gefährdeter Arten. Wir lieben diesen Auwald & möchten gemeinsam mit dir alles tun, um ihn davor zu bewahren abgesägt und durch ein Industriegebäude ersetzt zu werden.
Der Brixner Gemeindeausschuss hat das geplante Gebäude der Firma ‘Progress’, dem der Auwald weichen soll, zwar schon genehmigt, aber noch ist es nicht zu spät!
Es stehen noch weitere Entscheidungen aus und gemeinsam mit dem Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen ist nun alles vorbereitet, um Rekurs einzuleiten.

Was wir jetzt brauchen
...deine Hilfe, die Gerichtskosten zu decken. Mit deiner Spende kannst du direkt mitwirken, dieses wertvolle Lebewesen Wald vor der Abholzung bewahren und aktiv für deine Werte und für’s Leben einstehen.Gib was du kannst und weit mehr, als du eigentlich geben würdest und noch mehr und spüre, wie deine Großzügigkeit in den Wald, in die Erde und in die zukünftigen Generationen fließt. Danke dir, für deinen Beitrag und dein Mitgestalten unserer aller Zukunft.
 

Der Plan
Konkret benötigen wir Unterstützung, um folgende Dinge zu finanzieren:
Studium der Causa, Einleitung des Prozesses inclusive Erstverhandlung
→  5.690 EURO
Sicherheitspolster für Eventualitäten und weitere Verhandlungen 
→ + ca. 4.400 EURO
Indiegogo Plattformgebühr
→ + ca. 500 EURO
 
Wohin geht das Geld der Crowdfunding Kampagne? Direkt auf’s Onlus-Spendenkonto vom ‘Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen’ von da aus wird ein Teil der Summe dem Anwalt zur Einleitung vom Rekurs am regionalen Verwaltungsgericht in Bozen überwiesen. Das Sicherheitspolster bleibt vorerst auf dem Konto des Onlus Vereins und wird für Eventualitäten verwendet, bis der Prozess abgeschlossen ist. Wenn der Wald sicher ist, und noch etwas übrig ist, kann das Geld gemäß der Satzung des Artenschutzzentrums für den Erhalt der Biodiversität eingesetzt werden. 
 
WICHTIG: Brauchst du einen Spendenbeleg vom Artenschutzzentrum?In dem Fall muss das Geld direkt auf’s Konto überwiesen werden. Bitte kontaktiere Claire (claire@claireidansun.com) für deinen Spendenbeleg & überweise deine Spende an:

Ciao, siamo Claire & Margit,viviamo in Alto Adige e qui nella città di Bressanone c’è rimasto, come per miracolo, un ultimo pezzo di bosco ripariale - proprio nel mezzo della zona industriale.
Con la sua struttura, la varietà di piante e il suo terreno ricco di funghi, il bosco è un habitat che ha urgentemente bisogno della nostra protezione. È la casa di innumerevoli specie, alcune delle quali sono in pericolo di estinzione. Noi amiamo questo bosco e insieme a te vogliamo fare tutto il possibile per evitare che venga abbattuto e sostituito da un edificio industriale.
La giunta comunale di Bressanone ha già approvato il progetto di costruzione dell a ditta ""Progress"", a cui il bosco deve cedere il passo, ma non è troppo tardi!
Altre decisioni devono ancora essere prese e, insieme all 'Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen/centro di protezione delle specie', abbiamo preparato tutto per avviare un ricorso! 
 

Cosa ci serve
...abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per coprire le spese legali. Con tua donazione contribuisci direttamente a salvare questo prezioso bosco e di mostrare attivamente i tuoi valori, difendendo la vita. 
Dai quello che puoi, e se riesci molto più di quanto daresti di solito e ancora di più e poi fermati a sentire come la tua generosità fluisce nella foresta, nella terra e nelle generazioni future. Grazie, per il tuo contributo e per creare il nostro futuro. 

Il piano
In particolare, abbiamo bisogno di sostegno per finanziare
Studio del caso, avvio del processo, comprese le trattative iniziali
→ 5.690 EURO
Cuscino di sicurezza per le eventualità e per ulteriori trattative 
→ + ca. 4.400 EURO
Tassa per la piattaforma Indiegogo
→ + ca. 500 EURO 
Dove vanno a finire i soldi del crowdfunding? Direttamente sul conto della Onlus dell'Artenschutzzentrum St. Georgen, da lì una parte del denaro sarà trasferita all'avvocato per avviare il ricorso presso il tribunale amministrativo regionale di Bolzano. Per il momento il cuscino di sicurezza rimane sul conto dell'Associazione Onlus e sarà utilizzato per gli imprevisti fino al completamento del processo. Se la foresta è sicura, e c'è ancora qualcosa da fare, il denaro può essere utilizzato per la conservazione della biodiversità secondo gli statuti del Centro di protezione delle specie.  
IMPORTANTE SE HAI BISOGNO DI UNA RICEVUTA DI DONAZIONEdal Centro Conservazione delle Specie? In questo caso il denaro deve essere trasferito direttamente sul conto - non su indiegogo. Si prega di contattare Claire (claire.idansun@gmail.com) per la ricevuta della donazione e di trasferire la donazione:

<p>I am a computer systems engineer,
and one day while driving in my car listening to KPFK in LA, I heard
talk about a movie showing the plight of the world’s oceans, and
plastics in the Pacific Garbage Patch.  I thought to myself, what is
so hard about cleaning them up?</p>
<p>As it turns out the plastics in our
oceans can be very small and hard to collect, and even when you do
collect them what are you to do with them? </p>
<p>Most of the ideas I
have read about, people just want to collect the waste, and transport it
back to land where it can be processed.  I thought what if you
processed them right where you collected them?</p>
<p>My idea is to recycle an oil
platform that is no longer being used by the oil industry, combine
that with a machine purchased from <a href=""http://www.agilyx.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Agilyx</a>, and start producing
synthetic crude oil from the plastics just floating in the ocean. </p>
<p> Oil platforms are decommissioned and then destroyed because they have
to be reused or re-purposed.  The derricks are capable of
withstanding major storms and other related issues while floating in
the gyres.</p>
<p>Oil recovery from plastics is
already a proven technology that thanks to Agilyx, plastics that
traditionally are not recyclable; even those that are mixed or
contaminated can now have a profi­table recovery option.  Here
are three ways Agilyx accomplishes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Energy returned on energy
	invested – recovers fi­ve times more energy than is consumed
	by the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial value – produces
	synthetic crude oil a high value energy commodity, far out-pacing
	the BTU-equivalent price as electricity and leaves it in a
	convenient storable medium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
	– the crude oil produced has lower carbon intensity than
	traditional sources.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The first thing I need to do is get
the money to incorporate and start doing feasibility studies on this
venture, I will be developing contacts with others that will help
facilitate this project, and I am hoping to be at the first stages of
actually putting this project in the ocean in 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>I am thinking that what I need is 3
to 5 million dollars to really get things moving, but seeing as this
is unproven and caries risk of failure I am asking for just 1 million
to get the ball rolling.</p>

<div>If I am unable to reach the goal then I will use what I do have to fund the research on this project, I really believe the answer to the problem is to process the plastics into something that is worth more than the plastic itself, so that it makes sense to ship that new product back to land.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By being able to collect and transform the plastics into a commodity, it is more likely to succeed.  The plastics are going to be with us for years to come why not turn them into a resource rather than just letting them destroy our oceans and ecosystem.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>At this point I see two risks:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is it really feasible to put an oil platform in the middle of the ocean to collect this plastic, and convert it to oil.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Once it is converted it is going to have to be stored in some way until a ship can come to pick it up.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<div>In a pic I posted Challenge 2 may not be a challenge, it seems that some of the deep water derricks have storage already built in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The real challenge is how to actually collect the plastic without killing sea life in the process.  There is a guy on Indiegogo that is trying to come up with an idea for that, I plan on working with him if I can on this project , because I believe he has half of the answer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I will be setting up an email address for this project and once I do I will post it for everyone to see if you can't contribute, but want to help, you may email me and let me know what you might be able to do.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Mainly please help to get the word out to as many people as you can.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my idea, and look forward to getting started on this project.</p>
<p></p>

  The Impact By being able to collect and transform the plastics into a commodity, it is more likely to succeed.  The plastics are going to be with us for years to come why not turn them into a resource rather than just letting them destroy our oceans and ecosystem.


  Risks & Challenges At this point I see two risks:



Is it really feasible to put an oil platform in the middle of the ocean to collect this plastic, and convert it to oil.  


Once it is converted it is going to have to be stored in some way until a ship can come to pick it up.


In a pic I posted Challenge 2 may not be a challenge, it seems that some of the deep water derricks have storage already built in.

The real challenge is how to actually collect the plastic without killing sea life in the process.  There is a guy on Indiegogo that is trying to come up with an idea for that, I plan on working with him if I can on this project , because I believe he has half of the answer.


  Other Ways You Can Help I will be setting up an email address for this project and once I do I will post it for everyone to see if you can't contribute, but want to help, you may email me and let me know what you might be able to do.

Mainly please help to get the word out to as many people as you can.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my idea, and look forward to getting started on this project.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>The Reason</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">While many people

<p>But, perhaps something
more relevant to your everyday life will impart the importance of oceanographic
research to you as an individual?  The 2014 <b>polar vortex</b> <b>began
and ended over an ocean</b>.  Starting in the North Western Pacific, this
incredibly destructive system brought on weather the likes of which had not been
seen by North America and the UK in centuries (<a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/11/1276269/-Ocean-Heat-Driven-Stratospheric-Squeeze-of-Polar-Vortex-Led-to-Extreme-Winter-from-U-S-to-U-K"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learn more here</a>).  It brought the conversation <a href=""http://protectourwinters.org/climate-snow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">about
disappearing winters and snow</a> to the forefront of the news this winter and spring not
just because of the massive economic losses sustained over multiple industries,
but because this could mean the end of cold weather for many places whose

<p>The North Pacific has
one of the most powerful currents in the world, the Kuroshio Current that connects to the California Current, but little is known about the surface

In April of 2015, I am going to attempt to be the first woman to row the 6,000 nautical miles (or
roughly 180 day) crossing of the North Pacific Ocean from Japan to San
Francisco.  In partnership with ABC News, my team and I will get the
opportunity to create a larger conversation about ocean awareness on an
international platform. We
will be creating an open source website with real time data uploading and
conducting in-school programs to educate on how oceans drive our every day
lives.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, This is Bob from Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy.  Escarpment Biosphere Conservancy (EBC) is a charity founded in 1997 to create nature reserves and provide opportunities for the public to learn from untouched nature. Over the last 15 years, we have created 120 reserves, protecting 9,000 acres along Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment, the Lake Huron shoreline and on the world’s largest fresh-water island, Manitoulin. We have created 11 hiking trails, 7 official Niagara Escarpment parks and provided hiking on seven properties for other organizations.</p>
<p>Today, we are here to ask for your help to protect this piece of gorgeous land, located right beside the famous Misery Bay Provincial Park and another EBC reserve, and which is now at risk of being logged or turned into a hunt camp.  We have raised two-third of the funds and are only short $5000.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Located adjacent to Ontario’s Misery Bay Provincial Park, the 25-acre property we are trying to save contains a creek and rock outcrop, as well as untouched mature moss-covered cedar trees.  (See map in the gallery to get a picture of how it fits together)</p>
<p>Based on our observations from land in similar parts of Manitoulin Island, this property, now for sale, is in danger of being turned into a hunt camp and the old cedar is a valuable target for logging companies.</p>
<p>Our goal is to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>EBC has an accepted conditional offer to purchase this land and prevent the habitat within the land from being destroyed.</p>
<p>We have secured a grant from a friendly foundation for $10,000 of the $15,000 total cost.  All we need is the remaining $5,000 to pay the remainder of the purchase cost ($4,000) and the legal fees.</p>
<p>The property has not been touched for years with its mature moss-covered cedar trees; <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the only access is along a trail about a mile from the nearest drivable road. We can build a three kilometre (2 mile) long through this property and an adjacent EBC reserve to link up trails already established at Misery Bay which are used to visit the shoreline and globally-rare alvars (limestone pavement with rare plants). Our adjacent reserve (with our other three nearby reserves) will further protect the habitat and biodiversity of this special place.</span></p>
<p>We would appreciate it if you can donate a few dollars to help us protect this land for future generations to enjoy.  </p>
<p>Because we are a registered charity, we are able to issue an Income Tax Receipt upon request if you donate $10 or more (for Canadian donors only).  So every $10 you donate, you get approximately $5 back (how great is that?)!</p>
<p>*note: American Donors: Please contact us for more information regarding Income Tax Receipt. </p>
<p>*note 2: If you wish to claim any of the perks, you cannot donate anonymously!  We must be able to have your info to send you the perks!  Alternatively, if you really wish to stay anonymous and want to claim a perk, please email me your details and we will sort it out (email underneath).   </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate your support even if you can't donate!</p>
<p>We are a charity and rely heavily on volunteers.  If you are passionate about conserving nature and wish to give some time to this beautiful cause, please email me (Bob), at <a href=""mailto:rbarnett@escarpment.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rbarnett@escarpment.ca</a> </p>

Based on our observations from land in similar parts of Manitoulin Island, this property, now for sale, is in danger of being turned into a hunt camp and the old cedar is a valuable target for logging companies.
Our goal is to prevent that from happening.
EBC has an accepted conditional offer to purchase this land and prevent the habitat within the land from being destroyed.
We have secured a grant from a friendly foundation for $10,000 of the $15,000 total cost.  All we need is the remaining $5,000 to pay the remainder of the purchase cost ($4,000) and the legal fees.
The property has not been touched for years with its mature moss-covered cedar trees; the only access is along a trail about a mile from the nearest drivable road. We can build a three kilometre (2 mile) long through this property and an adjacent EBC reserve to link up trails already established at Misery Bay which are used to visit the shoreline and globally-rare alvars (limestone pavement with rare plants). Our adjacent reserve (with our other three nearby reserves) will further protect the habitat and biodiversity of this special place.
We would appreciate it if you can donate a few dollars to help us protect this land for future generations to enjoy.  
Because we are a registered charity, we are able to issue an Income Tax Receipt upon request if you donate $10 or more (for Canadian donors only).  So every $10 you donate, you get approximately $5 back (how great is that?)!
*note: American Donors: Please contact us for more information regarding Income Tax Receipt. 
*note 2: If you wish to claim any of the perks, you cannot donate anonymously!  We must be able to have your info to send you the perks!  Alternatively, if you really wish to stay anonymous and want to claim a perk, please email me your details and we will sort it out (email underneath).   



Other Ways You Can Help
We appreciate your support even if you can't donate!
We are a charity and rely heavily on volunteers.  If you are passionate about conserving nature and wish to give some time to this beautiful cause, please email me (Bob), at rbarnett@escarpment.ca",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name's Mathuri (don't bother on the pronunciation!). I'm a 15 year old girl from England. I've just signed up for an expedition to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands!</p>
<p>This is honestly a once in a lifetime opportunity as I'll be living with an Amazonian tribe, for approximately a week, and working with them to help with the development of their community.

<p><em>Localize This!</em> started 5 years ago when a community mobilized to stop a transnational corporation from trashing one of the gems of the Northwest. After a 10-year long legal and regulatory struggle, the traditional channels of public redress proved to be wholly innadequate. The community turned to Backbone Campaign for support and launched a action camp as a part of their campaign to defend their island and the Puget Sound. Today, what would have been turned into a gravel mine is now a public park containing an important estuary, home to salmon, orca whales, and more - now preserved for generations to come. Since then Localize This has become a tradition, nurturing effective organizing strategies and creative tactics.</p>
<p>Last year <em>Localize This!</em> designed many of the trainings and actions around supporting and strengthening a brand new volunteer-led eviction and foreclosure defense community organization.

<p>We, Koko, Kevin and Agus, are three people wanting to share our passion for nature. We hope to develop a five-acre dry land on a karst hill in to an eco-lodge where nature lovers can have fun and share knowledge. This site is located in Gunung Kidul District of Special Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. </p>
<p>Koko studied biology at Northern Arizona University (BS - 1994) and animal sciences at Colorado University (MS - 1999). He grew up in a small farm in Blora, a small town in Central Java province, and started hiking the mountains the island of Java in high school. Living in northern Arizona and Colorado, his love for nature only increased. Besides hiking and taking nature photography, he has come to love rock climbing and sailing.</p>
<p>Kevin is from Philadelphia. After spending years studying engineering, he decided that permaculture was his calling. He has been studying this discipline for the last two years in the New Mexico desert and western Oregon lush forests. Now he wants to apply this knowledge to start the practice of permaculture in this new place.</p>
<p>Agus is native to the area. He has a degree in accounting. However he is very passionate about nature and education. His family is well known in the area for promoting conservation. He has done some years of teaching in grade schools after graduating from college. His father, Mr. Sudarli, won the highest award for conservation from the Indonesian government in 2011 for his work in the forestation of the hills.</p>
<p>This eco-lodge is close to  beaches and sea cliffs, and surrounded by countless beautiful limestone hills where many farmers subsist. This facility will rely on what we grow in the farm using permaculture method. Being farm boys and nature lovers, we intend to use this facility to share knowledge about environmentally responsible practices not only to the surrounding people, but also to university students.</p>
<p>Yogyakarta is the largest college town in the country. There are countless universities in the area. The students of these colleges see the need to learn English to help their career in this globalized economy. We hope to use the facility to have camps (weekend or extended) to teach English to these students with the emphasis of nature education. Your contributions will provide an environmental education facility. Such a place is becoming more and more necessary, especially in Indonesia where industry and commerce are growing too fast and environmental concerns are often ignored.</p>
<p>Besides the garden and teaching the environment, we also hope to provide the visitors with other activities. This area is endowed with many natural wonders in the forms of a beautiful coastal line that contains secluded beaches and towering sea cliffs. These beaches have coral reefs and tide pools that people can explore during low tide. Some of the sea cliffs have been developed into climbing destinations, but there are more walls to be explored. The Indian ocean offers limitless potential for sailing and windsurfing.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We will need $10,000 to start with. We need the money to build the commons, three cabins, water tanks, two composting toilets, two shower facilities, trails, solar power system and promotional materials. The following figures are approximate expenditures for the items mainly because of the fluctuating currency exchange rate.</p>
<p>The first thing to be built is the water tank. This is a karst area, which means that rain water usually disappears almost immediately into subterranean rivers. The people in this area have adopted the skill to tap the rain water by using large brick-and-plaster water tanks (5000 liters). This structure will cost $1000. The commons which will serve as a dining hall and multipurpose building is in the size of 8x4 m2. It will require approximately $2000 to build. The cabins are in the size of 3x3 m2, and each will cost approximately $1000. We will employ composting toilets and regular shower facilities. These structures will cost $1000. The location of this on a hillside and away from the main road (<a href=""http://www.panoramio.com/photo/91194986"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.panoramio.com/photo/91194986</a>). We will need to build a hiking trail to the site. This trail will be no wider than 1 m. Lots of care has to be done so that the trail does not expose the hill to more erosion. We plan to manage the drainage with vegetations. This trail will cost us $1000. Since this site is out of the electricity grid, we want to install solar panels. We can use $1500 to set up the system. A $500 fund will be set aside to promote the business. We will start promoting the business as soon we start erecting the buildings.</p>
<p>We accept any amount of donations, but for $50 dollars, we will name a fruit tree after you. We plan to plant fruit (mango, guava, sawo, sirsak etc) and food (jackfruit, breadfruit, sukun etc) trees. There are already hardy trees like teak, mahogany, ironwood etc in the farm but we plan to add more. With a $100 donation, we will name one of these trees after you. Besides the plants, we have structures to be named as well and $500 will get you to name a hut or any other structure of your choice, except for the commons. We will surround the structures with gardens, and these gardens’s names are available for $500 as well.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will use the fund that we recieve to build the trail and water tank, because they are essential infra structures to the facility. The other buildings can be added slowly while we work on the land and do further fundraising.</p>
<p><strong>Our Goals</strong></p>
<p>The conventional agriculture can be highly destructive, especially for a fragile environment like this area. An alternative method in land stewardship is permaculture. This practice ensures the sustainability of an agricultural operation because the extensive use of perennial plants allows a significant reduction of erosion. As mentioned earlier, the area consists of karst hills. Besides continuing the work that has been done by Mr. Sudarli in reforesting those hills, we also hope to build on it, not only to maintain the already established system of tree-planting, but also to further improve the lives of the subistent farmers by attracting eco-tourists.</p>
<p>Our final number of cabins is five. The cabins can hold up to four people. We hope to have no more than 30 people (guests and personnel) at an extended period of time (over three days) so as to not put too much pressure on the system. If this system succeeds, we plan to share this small scale operation with others.</p>

We, Koko, Kevin and Agus, are three people wanting to share our passion for nature. We hope to develop a five-acre dry land on a karst hill in to an eco-lodge where nature lovers can have fun and share knowledge. This site is located in Gunung Kidul District of Special Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. 
Koko studied biology at Northern Arizona University (BS - 1994) and animal sciences at Colorado University (MS - 1999). He grew up in a small farm in Blora, a small town in Central Java province, and started hiking the mountains the island of Java in high school. Living in northern Arizona and Colorado, his love for nature only increased. Besides hiking and taking nature photography, he has come to love rock climbing and sailing.
Kevin is from Philadelphia. After spending years studying engineering, he decided that permaculture was his calling. He has been studying this discipline for the last two years in the New Mexico desert and western Oregon lush forests. Now he wants to apply this knowledge to start the practice of permaculture in this new place.
Agus is native to the area. He has a degree in accounting. However he is very passionate about nature and education. His family is well known in the area for promoting conservation. He has done some years of teaching in grade schools after graduating from college. His father, Mr. Sudarli, won the highest award for conservation from the Indonesian government in 2011 for his work in the forestation of the hills.
This eco-lodge is close to  beaches and sea cliffs, and surrounded by countless beautiful limestone hills where many farmers subsist. This facility will rely on what we grow in the farm using permaculture method. Being farm boys and nature lovers, we intend to use this facility to share knowledge about environmentally responsible practices not only to the surrounding people, but also to university students.
Yogyakarta is the largest college town in the country. There are countless universities in the area. The students of these colleges see the need to learn English to help their career in this globalized economy. We hope to use the facility to have camps (weekend or extended) to teach English to these students with the emphasis of nature education. Your contributions will provide an environmental education facility. Such a place is becoming more and more necessary, especially in Indonesia where industry and commerce are growing too fast and environmental concerns are often ignored.
Besides the garden and teaching the environment, we also hope to provide the visitors with other activities. This area is endowed with many natural wonders in the forms of a beautiful coastal line that contains secluded beaches and towering sea cliffs. These beaches have coral reefs and tide pools that people can explore during low tide. Some of the sea cliffs have been developed into climbing destinations, but there are more walls to be explored. The Indian ocean offers limitless potential for sailing and windsurfing.
What We Need & What You Get
We will need $10,000 to start with. We need the money to build the commons, three cabins, water tanks, two composting toilets, two shower facilities, trails, solar power system and promotional materials. The following figures are approximate expenditures for the items mainly because of the fluctuating currency exchange rate.
The first thing to be built is the water tank. This is a karst area, which means that rain water usually disappears almost immediately into subterranean rivers. The people in this area have adopted the skill to tap the rain water by using large brick-and-plaster water tanks (5000 liters). This structure will cost $1000. The commons which will serve as a dining hall and multipurpose building is in the size of 8x4 m2. It will require approximately $2000 to build. The cabins are in the size of 3x3 m2, and each will cost approximately $1000. We will employ composting toilets and regular shower facilities. These structures will cost $1000. The location of this on a hillside and away from the main road (http://www.panoramio.com/photo/91194986). We will need to build a hiking trail to the site. This trail will be no wider than 1 m. Lots of care has to be done so that the trail does not expose the hill to more erosion. We plan to manage the drainage with vegetations. This trail will cost us $1000. Since this site is out of the electricity grid, we want to install solar panels. We can use $1500 to set up the system. A $500 fund will be set aside to promote the business. We will start promoting the business as soon we start erecting the buildings.
We accept any amount of donations, but for $50 dollars, we will name a fruit tree after you. We plan to plant fruit (mango, guava, sawo, sirsak etc) and food (jackfruit, breadfruit, sukun etc) trees. There are already hardy trees like teak, mahogany, ironwood etc in the farm but we plan to add more. With a $100 donation, we will name one of these trees after you. Besides the plants, we have structures to be named as well and $500 will get you to name a hut or any other structure of your choice, except for the commons. We will surround the structures with gardens, and these gardens’s names are available for $500 as well.
If we do not reach our goal, we will use the fund that we recieve to build the trail and water tank, because they are essential infra structures to the facility. The other buildings can be added slowly while we work on the land and do further fundraising.
Our Goals
The conventional agriculture can be highly destructive, especially for a fragile environment like this area. An alternative method in land stewardship is permaculture. This practice ensures the sustainability of an agricultural operation because the extensive use of perennial plants allows a significant reduction of erosion. As mentioned earlier, the area consists of karst hills. Besides continuing the work that has been done by Mr. Sudarli in reforesting those hills, we also hope to build on it, not only to maintain the already established system of tree-planting, but also to further improve the lives of the subistent farmers by attracting eco-tourists.
Our final number of cabins is five. The cabins can hold up to four people. We hope to have no more than 30 people (guests and personnel) at an extended period of time (over three days) so as to not put too much pressure on the system. If this system succeeds, we plan to share this small scale operation with others.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to help us financially, we hope that you will help us by spreading the word about our endeavor.
Koko has some experience teaching climbing and English, Kevin is the land steward, and Agus is the bean counter. But neither of us has any experience in combining those skills. We are open to advice and suggestions on how to pursue this dream.

<h3>Why do garden classes matter?</h3>
<p>I'm a mom of six. My kids grew up on our small farm and played outdoors all year. Being in the garden was a natural. We like to see kids playing outside.  We also realize so many kids aren't able to get outdoors to dig or plant in a yard or garden. With online classes people can learn how to start a garden and grow something...even if it's a tiny potted garden on the windowsill!</p>
<p>With our new kid's class in the works, adults can learn basic garden skills along with their kids and will learn how to start an herb garden of their very own.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Will you help us keep going?</h3>
<p>Even if you can't make a donation just helping to get the word out would be beyond terrific!</p>
<p>We have some fun perks and give aways for donors like watercolor notecards,</p>
<p>bookmarks and even handmade miniature fairy garden sets!</p>

Werbung mal anders
Aussage: Wir produzieren keinen Müll.

 
Der umweltfreundliche recyclebare/kompostierbare Werbeträger mit der
Botschaft: ""Wir denken an die Umwelt"".
Der Stift hebt sich aus der Masse der Werbestifte als Besonderheit durch Aussage, Gestaltung und Funktion hervor.
Dadurch hat er eine längere Verweildauer beim Kunden und wird öfter als andere Stifte ""herumgezeigt"".

</div></div>","This Campaign's Story    
Hello!
My name is Robert Pohl and I am the Executive Director of CleanEnergy4All. 
Clean Energy4All is a non-profit organization that provides solar systems for charities who help at risk individuals to succeed. These systems help cut energy costs for the charities in a major way. 
This campaign is to install a solar system for East End Community Services (EECS), a foundation that has the potential to ""break"" the pattern of poverty for children in East Dayton, Ohio. It oversees an early childhood program in inner city schools, putting these students well above average reading levels for their age, and providing them with skills to help them excel later in life. In addition, it constructs energy efficient homes for families in need. 

Being a resident of Dayton, Ohio myself and having worked in education for years, this project is particularly important to me. 
If this project is funded, it is estimated to create savings in utility costs of over $225,000 for EECS in the next 20 years. And you can help! 
   What We Need & Where It Will Go We need $20,000 to complete the funding process for this project (a $100,000 venture in total), and this is where it will lead:  CE4A, in concert with Chapel Electric, will oversee the installation of a world class solar system at an EECS building in East Dayton.

A renowned public relations firm will conduct a publicity campaign that will enable EECS to significantly market this cutting edge solar system. This will in turn enhance EECS's national and local reputation. 

The solar system will reduce East End’s carbon footprint
A family in need will receive an energy efficient home complete with a full solar system. 


The Impact


In the past, CleanEnergy4All has helped multiple organizations, such as Teen Challenge and an inner city Boys and Girls Club, to reach similar fundraising goals. These organizations have benefitted greatly long-term in two ways:
1) By saving a significant amount of money on power
2) By promoting their charitable reputations through environmental protection
If charities around the nation and eventually the globe can start adopting this trend, carbon emissions will be significantly reduced. And the foundations will save a significant amount of money that can be used toward helping those in need. 

A look into the C4A's mission, and a succesful past project (the installation of solar panels on a parking structure for Teen Challenge in California):

While I'm doing my best to save the money on my own for this, most of my waking hours are spent working on a startup that makes no money. It's on average $2/per mile to hike the trail plus all the gear I need to buy for it.  Expenses on the trail include things such as: food, supplies, room/board (to have a place to shower and rest), and so forth.  In addition, I'll need things like a backpack, a tent, sleeping bag, shoes, etc. 



I need your support.

A rough breakdown of the costs looks like:


Food, supplies, places to stay: ~$4400 

Hiking Gear: ~$1500

Without any outside help, this dream will remain exactly that.  No donation is too small.



Thank you for your time and support.  I very much look forward to taking you on this journey along with me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A hub for reuse and reimagination requires a place to sit and imagine, a place to buy, and a place to make.  To bring these elements together we will lease a 300+sqm space close to Geelong, with easy road and public transport access.  At the entrance to the space will sit an ethical cafe, serving simple, quality, sustainable food and drink, where you can sit, dream, and collaborate on incredible reuse projects.  The next section of the space will be filled with the best reclaimed and reimagined goods around, ready to take home and enjoy.  Towards the back there will be a simple workshop where repair cafes can operate, and individual makers can offer their services in repair or reimagination.</p>

We can stop this
Help us to raise enough money to protect 10 villages in South-West Bangladesh from arsenic-contaminated water.
Our campaign goal is £55,000. But whatever we raise, we will be able to protect people in direct, practical ways from arsenic contamination.
TAKE PART IN OUR CAMPAIGN and participate in a small but achievable step to deal with a vast and deadly problem.

Why is this happening?

The tube-wells were constructed in the 1970s and 80s by aid agencies who were acting to eliminate the many diseases, such as cholera, typhoid, and TB, which were spread by the use of untreated surface water. In this, they were largely successful.



What was not understood at the time was the risk of groundwater contamination by arsenic, which occurs naturally within the earth in high levels throughout the Ganges Delta.
About 1 in 5 of the tube-wells constructed have been found to be contaminated by arsenic. In the early 1990s, the first signs of arsenic poisoning appeared among people using the tube-wells.

The SONO Arsenic Filter
There is currently no complete or long-term solution to the problem - but there are effective solutions which can be implemented at a local level. 

The SONO Arsenic Filter is being used by thousands of families and communities in Bangladesh, and has been proven to eliminate arsenic contamination and to provide safe drinking and cooking water. 
The Filter - which consists of two buckets containing porous iron, charcoal, sand and bits of brick - filters nearly all of the arsenic from well water.
The SONO Arsenic Filter was invented in 2006 by Abul Hussam, a Bangladeshi who is chemistry professor at George Mason University (GMU) in Fairfax, Virginia. Hussam developed his filter after years of testing hundreds of prototypes. The Filter was awarded the prestigious Grainger Challenge Prize for Sustainability by the US National Academy of Engineering. 



What's the point of this crowdfunding campaign?
The scale of the problem of arsenic contamination is vast. It is also a problem which is largely ignored. And while it is ignored, huge numbers of people are suffering slow, painful and unnecessary deaths - deaths which relatively simple, low-cost interventions could prevent.

</div></div>","Kill the Cup is a startup nonprofit that encourages people to bring a reusable cup when they get coffee. Did you know that 100 BILLION disposable cups are sent to U.S. landfills each year?Most coffee cups are coated with plastic and can't be recycled. Plastic creates toxic pollution at every stage of its existence: manufacture, use, and disposal.But what incentives are in place to encourage change? Ten cent discounts are insufficient, and most people grow tired of direct environmental messaging.At Kill the Cup, we make it FUN for people to bring reusable cups. When it comes to environmental behavior change, research shows that consumers are most likely to respond to social norms messaging.After buying their morning coffee, we encourage people to upload photos with their reusable cups. Each photo serves as entry into weekly and grand prize raffles! These photos help establish the social norms that prove so effective.Successful pilot programs on college campuses have generated a 25% increase in the rate at which people bring reusable cups when they buy coffee -- in just 4 weeks! And get this: the coffee shops were more profitable. So what's next?Kill the Cup is raising funds to support a multi-university ""$10,000 Reusable Cup Challenge"" that will allow university student organizations to compete with one another to create the most environmental impact on campus. 
Think of it as March Madness -- but for student associations that are competing to have the greatest environmental impact. We have already receive interest from universities in Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and San Diego.







We need your help to make it happen! Kill the Cup has partnered with a number of forward-thinking companies to offer exciting perks in exchange for your contributions.






The reusable mugs and eco-friendly t-shirts will be ordered at the end of the Indiegogo campaign, so it may take until August to receive your perks. We hope you don't mind!

Thanks to our friends at Causora, we are able to offer One-for-One rewards. You can receive Thank You Credits that are redeemable at a growing number of socially conscious merchants, including TOMS, Lyft, and Zipcar.

$10,000 will be used towards prize money for the Reusable Cup Challenge! These funds will be redistributed to student organizations to help them further environmental initiatives at their own campus.
We'll also invest $7,500 in a technology platform that will streamline many of the manual processes that make our campaigns ""go."" And the remaining funds will be used to co-brand all of the perks for the Indiegogo campaign.







Drew Beal and Mike Taylor, Kill the Cup's co-founders, met in 2011 when they started grad school at UC San Diego's Rady School of Management. They launched Kill the Cup as their MBA capstone project in April 2013.
Testimonial
""This phenomenal team developed their first social venture project, Kill the Cup, in my class at the Rady School of Management. They were exceptional students - among the hardest working and most focused in the class. They learned, listened, persevered and made a real impact at UCSD in reducing the use of paper coffee cups and generating excitement around sustainability and corporate social responsibility.""



Georgetown (Fall 2013)

Last Fall, we teamed up with The Students of Georgetown, Inc. to run a Kill the Cup campaign at the D.C.-based university. They ran the program for four weeks, and replicated the success of our pilot campaign.


Testimonial
“We’re really
hoping that members of the Georgetown community will become aware of how
wasteful coffee cups are. We’re hoping to run it every year
and to get people excited about it and thinking
about sustainability.”

We will be armed with the knowledge and skills to fight against fossil fuel and towards a clean, just world. Power Shift 2013 will be the conference that defines and inspires a new generation of activists. <b>We are united, we defend the future, we believe everyone is entitled to a clean and just society!</b></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are striving to bring at least 100 students from NYC passionate about our cause to Power Shift, so they can come back empowered, inspired, and ready to take on today's biggest issues. We know many students want to come, but face great financial constraint.

<p>Over the past 30 years, SIBAT has grown to address another needs, such as the power and water rehabilitation in Typhoon Haiyan affected areas.</p>
<p>SIBAT has been to at least 500 Filipino communities, and held more than 700 sustainable agriculture trainings for more than 20000 farmers (including women and indigenous people). These trainings are mostly held in the farming communities, with a subset taking place at our 1.3 hectare organic farm and training center in Capas, Tarlac. </p>

Our farmer training facility is no longer sufficient to meet our growing needs, and we need funding to make it bigger, sturdier and more efficient.

<p>Based on our previous building experience, we estimate that $5,000 (P225,000) will be needed for repairing the native roofing and adding an additional layer of steel sheeting that will make the roof more reliably leak-proof. The native thatched roofing allows for ventilation, so by keeping it in place we will still enjoy its benefits during the hot summer.</p>

</div></div>","Who is SIBAT? Starting out as a farmer’s advocacy coalition in 1984 that promoted appropriate technology (AT), SIBAT has a long history of  empowering rural communities by using sound science to achieve community goals.  Its AT niches are the following:

  Sustainable agriculture
  Renewable energy
  Water resources development
  Community adaptation to climate change in agriculture
  Training of farmers, women and other rural sectors



Over the past 30 years, SIBAT has grown to address another needs, such as the power and water rehabilitation in Typhoon Haiyan affected areas.
SIBAT has been to at least 500 Filipino communities, and held more than 700 sustainable agriculture trainings for more than 20000 farmers (including women and indigenous people). These trainings are mostly held in the farming communities, with a subset taking place at our 1.3 hectare organic farm and training center in Capas, Tarlac. 
Today, we need your help to further our mission of reaching as many people and communities as possible. Our farmer training facility is no longer sufficient to meet our growing needs, and we need funding to make it bigger, sturdier and more efficient. Sustainable agriculture techniques will be spread to an even larger number of Filipino farmers through regularly held seminars and outreach activities in this Sustainable Agriculture Training Center (SATC).    What We Need & What You Get All of the money you donate will be used directly for the refurbishment of the Sustainable Agriculture Training Center. Currently, the training house roof is made of native materials (bamboo), and is badly in need of repair and improvement.  This is our number one priority. 
Based on our previous building experience, we estimate that $5,000 (P225,000) will be needed for repairing the native roofing and adding an additional layer of steel sheeting that will make the roof more reliably leak-proof. The native thatched roofing allows for ventilation, so by keeping it in place we will still enjoy its benefits during the hot summer.
In the Philippines, labor and materials are relatively inexpensive, so your money can go a lot further toward making a significant impact! Here are some examples of what you can buy with just $5:


Lunch for 5 people
A 25 kg sac of cement
A 3'x6' sheet of steel roofing
2 peices of coco lumber (2"" x 3"" x 12"")
28 concrete hollow blocks, size 4

If we are unable to reach our target goal of $5,000, your donation will still be put toward the eventual improvement of this training center. We will ensure that this project reaches completion by continuing to apply for grants and other funding opportunities. If we exceed our funding expectations, all additional funds will be used toward our next construction goal, cottages on the farm for farmers and guests to use during multi-day trainings and expansion of the size of the training center.

The Impact
Once the training center is running all year-round, we will be able to reach more farmers. This will benefit:


The environment. Every farmer that switches to organic methods reduces the number of toxic pesticides being introduced into the soil and water of the Philippines.
The economy. Farmers can sell organic produce for a higher profit, especially with all the money they save when they stop buying imported pesticides and seeds. 
THE FARMERS! Our main goal at SIBAT is to empower farmers.   Through sustainable agriculture, they can play a vital role in protecting their health, their families, the environment and their land.

Ele sunt considerate mai puțin durabile și de multe ori lumea le asociază cu condiții de viață modeste.

Sunt născut în Polonia, însă de doi ani m-am stabilit în România, unde, împreună cu soția mea și cu prietenii noștri entuziaști, promovez arhitectura ecologică și construcțiile din baloți de paie.https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.591909657494960.1073741833.363250173694244&type=1&l=ece9934fa4[EN] Over the past three years, I attended workshops, construction fairs and straw bale builders’ gatherings. _______________________________[FR] Au cours des trois dernières années, j’ai participé à des ateliers, des foires de construction et des réunions des constructeurs en ballots de paille._______________________________[DE] In den letzten drei Jahren nahm ich an Workshops, Baumessen und Treffen der Strohballenbauer teil. _______________________________[RO] În ultimii trei ani am participat la workshopuri, târguri de construcții ecologice și conferințe ale constructorilor de case din baloți de paie.https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.579866948699231.1073741830.363250173694244&type=3[EN] I have also collected and read a lot of books about natural building and I worked as a site manager for one of the first straw bale houses in Romania._______________________________[FR] J’ai aussi rassemblé et lu un grand nombre de livres sur la construction naturelle et j’ai travaillé comme superviseur de chantier pour une des premières maisons en paille réalisées en Roumanie._______________________________[DE] Ich habe auch viele Bücher über Naturbau gelesen und ich war Baustellenleiter für eines der ersten Strohballenhäuser in Rumänien._______________________________[RO] În același timp, am adunat și am citit multe cărți despre construcțiile din materiale naturale și am lucrat ca șef de șantier la una dintre primele case din baloți de paie din România.

[EN] Romania has a long history of building with straw and earth. _______________________________[FR] La Roumanie a une longue histoire de construction en paille et en terre._______________________________[DE]  Rumänien hat eine lange Geschichte des Strohballen- und Lehmbaus. _______________________________[RO] În România, paiele și pământul sunt un material de construcție tradițional, cu o istorie lungă. 





[EN] Unfortunately, over the past two decades, the traditional techniques and materials have been gradually abandoned in favour of concrete blocks insulated with polystyrene and finished with cement plasters and toxic paints, resulting in arguably aesthetic houses._______________________________[FR] Malheureusement, pendant les deux dernières décennies, les techniques et matériaux traditionnels ont graduellement été abandonnés pour le béton isolé avec polystyrène et finalisé avec du cément et des peintures toxiques, avec des résultats peu esthétiques._______________________________[DE] Leider hat man in den  letzten zwei Jahrzehnten allmählich auf die traditionellen Methoden und Baustoffe verzichtet, zugunsten der mit Polystyren isolierten und mit Zementputz und gifthaltigen Anstrichstoff ausgebauten Betonblöcke. Unästhetische Häuser sind das Ergebnis dieser Entwicklung. _______________________________[RO] Din păcate, în ultimii douăzeci de ani, materialele și tehnicile tradiționale au fost abandonate în favoarea blocurilor din BCA, izolate cu polistiren și finisate cu vopsele toxice, totul rezultând în case cu o estetică discutabilă. 






[EN] There are many negative stereotypes attached to earth and straw houses. People tend to see natural buildings as not very durable and they link them to poor living conditions. With our campaign, we are trying to show that straw and earth can be used in different ways, building solid houses with many unexpected advantages.Last year we have managed to set up a stall at a small construction fair in Bucharest. This involved making and printing leaflets, banners and building a straw bale panel on site. _______________________________[FR] Beaucoup de stéréotypes négatifs sont associés aux maisons en paille et en terre. Les gens pensent que les bâtiments naturels ne sont pas très durables et les associent au fait de vivre dans des conditions pauvres. Notre campagne essaie de montrer que la paille et la terre peuvent être utilisées des différentes manières pour construire des maisons solides avec beaucoup d’avantages inattendus.L’année dernière nous avons eu l’opportunité de monter un stand dans une foire de construction à Bucarest. Nous avons réalisé et imprimé des flyers, des affiches et avons construit un panel en paille sur place, ce qui nous a également donné l’occasion de vérifier combiens de ballots de paille rentrent dans nos petites voitures. _______________________________[DE] Es gibt viele negative Stereotpye über Lehm- und Strohballenhäuser. Naturbauten gelten häufig als nicht dauerhaft und werden mit schlechten Wohnverhältnissen assoziiert. Mit unserer Kampagne versuchen wir zu zeigen, dass Strohballen und Lehm in verschiedenen Weisen benutzt werden können, um feste Häuser mit vielen überraschenden Vorteilen aufzubauen.Voriges Jahr ist es uns gelungen, einen Ausstellungstand bei einer kleinen Buchmesse in Bukarest einzurichten. In diesem Zusammenhang, haben wir Broschüren und Werbebanner erstellt und gedruckt und eine Strohballenwand vor Ort aufgebaut. _______________________________[RO] Există multe stereotipuri negative în legătură cu casele din pământ și paie. Ele sunt considerate mai puțin durabile și de multe ori lumea le asociază cu condiții de viață modeste. Campania noastră încearcă să demonstreze că paiele și pământul pot fi folosite în modrui diferite, construind case solide, cu avantaje surprinzătoare.Anul trecut, am reușit să organizăm un stand la târgul Expo Casa Mea din București, unde am construit un modul de perete din baloți de paie și am împărțit materiale informative. 






https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.59190...[EN] It also gave us the chance to check how many straw bales we can fit in our small cars._______________________________[DE] Das hat uns auch die Gelegenheit gegeben zu erfahren, wieviele Strohballen in unsere kleinen Autos passen. _______________________________[RO] Cu ocazia asta, am putut testa și câți baloți de paie pot intra în mașinile noastre. 






[EN] Our demonstration generated a lot of interest and a few journals even wrote about our project: http://www.earthsafedesign.com/publicatii/ Next, we took our straw bales and our wall to a lively art and culture street festival in the heart of Bucharest. It was great to see so much interest and so many people excited to discover straw bale building._______________________________[FR] Notre démonstration a généré beaucoup d’internet et plusieurs journaux ont écrit sur notre projet: http://www.earthsafedesign.com/publicatii/Ensuite, nous avons pris nos ballots de paille et notre mur à un festival culturel d’art de rue au cœur de Bucarest. C’était génial de voir autant d’intérêt et autant de gens enthousiasmés à la découverte de la construction en ballots de paille. _______________________________[DE] Unsere Vorführung hat viel Interesse erweckt und einige Zeitungen und Zeitschriften haben über unser Projekt berichtet: http://www.earthsafedesign.com/publicatiiDanach haben wir unsere Strohballen und unsere Strohballenwand im Rahmen eines lebendigen Kunst- und Kulturfestivals im Zentrum von Bukarest ausgestellt. Es war toll, so viel Interesse zu erleben und so viele Leute zu treffen, die begeistert waren, den Strohballenbau zu entdecken._______________________________[RO] Demonstrația noastră a stârnit mult interes și câteva publicații chiar au scris despre noi: http://www.earthsafedesign.com/publicatii/Apoi, ne-am dus baloții de paie și peretele în centrul Bucureștiului, la Street Delivery. A fost grozav să vedem atâția oameni interesați și entuziasmați să descopere construcțiile din baloți de paie.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3xgTuiL0oA[EN] Finally, just before the cold season started, we travelled all the way to Cluj, where we made another presentation at Transylvania Fair._______________________________[FR]  Enfin, juste avant la saison froide, nous avons voyagé à Cluj, où nous avons fait une autre présentation à la Foire de Transylvanie._______________________________[DE] Schließlich sind wir zum Herbstende nach Cluj/Kolozsvár/Klausenburg gefahren, wo wir eine andere Vorführung im Rahmen der “Transylvania Fair” gemacht haben._______________________________[RO] În sfârșit, înainte de începerea sezonului rece, am dat o fugă până la Cluj, unde am făcut o nouă prezentare pentru Transylvania Fest.[EN] Following these actions, there were a few other articles in the press about straw bale building and our website saw an increase in popularity.Encouraged by the success of our campaign so far, we have set ourselves a new goal. This time, we would not be able to do it on our own, so we are asking for your support. In April 2014 we want to attend Construct Expo, the largest construction fair in Bucharest. This event gathers 17000 visitors over a period of three days and gets coverage all over the mass media. _______________________________[FR] Suite à ces actions, la construction en ballots de paille a été couverte dans plusieurs articles de presse et notre site a augmenté en popularité, avec une moyenne de 30 visiteurs uniques dans la journée.Encouragés par le succès de notre campagne jusqu’ici, nous nous sommes fixé un nouvel objectif.

Cet évènement rassemble 17000 visiteurs sur une période de 3 jours et reçoit une large couverture médiatique. _______________________________[DE] In Anlehnung an diesen Aktionen gab es viele Presseartikel über den Strohballenbau. Zudem erlebe unsere Webseite einen nicht gekannten Ansturm mit durschnittlich 30 verschiedenen Besuchern pro Tag.Vom Erfolg unserer Kampagne bis hierher ermutigt, haben wir uns ein neues Ziel gesetzt. Diesmal sind wir aber auf Ihre Unterstützung angewiesen: Wir wollen an Expo Construct teilnehmen, der größten Baumesse in Bukarest, die im April 2014 stattfinden wird.17 000 Besucher sind für gewöhnlich bei dieser Veranstaltung zugegen, die drei Tage dauert. Es wird in allen Massenmedien darüber berichtet. _______________________________[RO] În urma acestor acțiuni de promovare au apărut mai multe articole în presă despre casele din baloți de paie iar numărul de vizitatori de pe site-ul nostru a crescut. Încurajați de succesul de până acum al campaniei, ne-am fixat un nou obiectiv. De data aceasta, nu ne putem descurca pe cont propriu, de aceea vă cerem ajutorul. În aprilie 2014 vrem să participăm la Construct Expo, cel mai mare târg de tehnologii și materiale pentru construcții din București. Evenimentul se bucură de multă atenție în mass media și va găzdui 17000 de vizitatori, într-o perioadă de 3 zile.

Here are some things to do in this section:  Introduce yourself and your background. Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Ich möchte gerne Seegras aus der Ostsee als Dämmmaterial wieder bekannt machen und vertreiben.

<p><strong>Was bekommst Du</strong></p>
<p>Perks haben wir in drei Kategorien eingeteilt, Ihr könnt uns schon mit wenig Geld unterstützen (ab 10 Euro), dann werden wir Euch persönlich über die weitere Entwicklung des Seegrasprojektes informieren und Euch eine Probe per Post zukommen lassen.

<p><strong>Warum ist Seegras extrem ökologisch?</strong></p>
<p>Der heutige Markt an ökologischen Produkten ist schon sehr toll, Hanf, Flachs und dergleichen sind sehr gute Produkte. Aber an Ökologie ist Seegras kaum zu toppen, da es nicht extra angebaut (keine Ackerflächen) und behandelt werden muss, im Gegenteil, es werden viel Kosten und Mühe aufgebracht, um es zu entfernen, weil es die Touristen an den Stränden stört. Auch muss es nicht weiter aufbereitet werden, es muss nur trocknen und kann dann direkt in Hohlräume eingebracht werden.</p>

The next challenge has been compressed air containment, and we have located a manufacturer who can build the high pressure tanks that we need, and do it quickly enough to keep up with assembly schedules. 
Our engineering efforts are now concentrating on electro-mechanical control systems. Turning 5,000 psi into torque and horsepower that matches the application, provides sufficient operational time between charges, etc. is a matter of testing and fine tuning, both on the bench and on the track.

The Impact

<b>Summary </b> </h3><p>     In September 2014 a group of students, teachers and parents at Northcoast Preparatory and Performing Arts Academy, in Arcata, California, launched the school’s Climate Change Project. We are a student-led group but we have had much help from our wonderfully committed adult supervisors, Keta Paulson Palmer, Larry Soll and Greg King. While the NPA Climate Change Project is principally committed to working locally, in Humboldt County, to address the global threat of climate change, our greatest funding need is our planned journey to Paris this year for the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference. At least ten NPA students and three adult chaperones will attend the conference from Nov. 30 – Dec. 11. There we will collaborate with youth from throughout the world to make our voices heard in favor of sensible, rapid action to forestall the looming catastrophe of climate change. In Paris we will collaborate with Concordia, a French non-profit organization that will host youth groups from 30 countries to attend events and share performances during the Climate Conference. The Concordia collaboration will allow our efforts to extend further than just our own community, and at the same time we will learn from other organizations what we can do to further create change. But we need your help to do it! </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>     The bulk, though not all the funding raised in this campaign will pay for travel costs associated with the UN Climate Conference. Some funds will also go to future events and generally contribute to our mission of working locally to educate residents, and ouselves, about climate change and what we can do about it. Attending the conference is just another part of our mission. If you choose to contribute you will be given a perk! See below for the perks associated with contribution levels.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>     The NPA Climate Change Project has already had an impact locally. In February 2015 the Eureka Times-Standard ran a front-page story on our art installation and performance event during Arts Arcata. That story is here: <a href=""http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20150215/students-raising-climate-consciousness-funds-for-paris-trip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.times-standard.com/general-news/20150215/students-raising-climate-consciousness-funds-for-paris-trip</a>. By continuing to work locally for a global cause we are able to engage and inform local residents and, we hope, garner even greater community input to meet the challenges of Climate Change. Our journey to Paris will inevitably put us in contact with groups and individuals from around the world who are making similar efforts. Together we can shape climate policies locally, nationally and globally. The time is now. There is momentum on a world scale. We, the people, can and must develop and demand quick and effective action to forestall climate change.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>     One of the challenges that has been pointed out to us is that by flying to Paris we will be contributing to carbon emissions. We recognize this, and understand the argument. But what better cause to fly for? Would it be better for us to sit at home, or to go out into the world and create change? Nevertheless, we don't want to completely disregard this concern so we will purchase carbon credits from the City of Arcata. These carbon credits will support the city’s efforts to protect the Arcata Community Forest, and to purchase more forestland in the future. It is an excellent means for us to balance some of the carbon we are putting into the air. While this doesn't completely solve the problem, it helps. </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>      We understand that some people cannot contribute at this time, and that’s okay! Tell your friends about our campaign, use the Indiegogo share tools to help us get our campaign out there. Thank you for your support! And thank you also for becoming educated on the issues our world is facing related to climate change and its effects.<br/></div>","Summary       In September 2014 a group of students, teachers and parents at Northcoast Preparatory and Performing Arts Academy, in Arcata, California, launched the school’s Climate Change Project.

</div> </div> <div> <h3> What is the problem about?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Rural communities in the Gambia are grabbling with low agricultural productivity, compounded by limited off – farm economic opportunities.

<p>Loam's mission is to seed joy, hope, and action in our community through creative and collaborative storytelling. <i><strong>Reawakening Resilience</strong></i>  embodies our belief that the capacity to bounce back from adversity is interwoven into our DNA. As the climate crisis escalates each day, tapping into our inner stores of resilience will help us not only survive but also to thrive during these unprecedented times. </p>
<p>As the Founder and Creative Director of Loam, I've spent the last two years collaborating with and learning from trailblazing environmental educators, artists, and activists who are working to inspire ecological regeneration and social resilience. My experiences have shown me that storytelling—through the art we make, the meals we cook, the words we write, and the collaborations we create—is  a truly vital and valuable tool for transforming our communities and nourishing narratives of regeneration. </p>
<p>When you support <strong><i>Reawakening Resilience</i>, </strong> you support artists, activists, and educators who are working to heal our world. You'll help our community publish a carbon neutral print publication that shares tangible strategies for cultivating ecological and social resilience with our 22,000 readers as well as nourish Loam's capacity to support artists and activists working at the intersections of social justice and earth care. </p>
</div><div>
<p>To bring <i><strong>Reawakening Resilience</strong></i> into being costs $10,000. This helps us to fund printing costs, compensate our contributors, support our gifted graphic designer <a href=""http://www.giorgiasage.com/loam-magazine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Giorgia Sage</a>, and ensure that a percentage of profits from every issue of <i><strong>Reawakening Resilience </strong></i>sold helps to nurture reforestation projects. We are proud to print with Hemlock Printers, the most sustainable printer in North America, as well as to mail our magazines in biodegradable mailers with compostable tape. Although ensuring the ecological integrity of our production and distribution process isn’t cheap,  it's a non-negotiable. </p>
<p>Our choice to print this publication is rooted in our deep belief that our world needs more opportunities to touch, to engage, and to hold. During an era when so many of us are losing hours each day to screen time, our hope is for <strong><i>Reawakening Resilience</i></strong> to be a tangible antidote to disconnection and isolation. We want to provide our readers with a vibrant print publication that you can thumb through again and again to find resources for resilience, luminous art, and inspiring stories to turn to as you navigate a climate changed world. And we want to offer a series of in-person workshops throughout the fall of 2018 that will work in conversation with this publication to connect our readers to the vibrant Loam community. This workshop series will be an opportunity for our readers to explore strategies for ecological, social, and spiritual resilience. </p>

<p>Green
Shorts is an International Film Festival showcasing independent films that
promote environmental awareness. The festival's origins are rooted in Santa
Barbara, CA and have been an important part of the Earth Day celebration since
2008.</p><p>
</p><p>The
6<sup>th</sup> annual Green Shorts Film Festival will be held in Santa Barbara,
CA at the historic Arlington Theater. The event will take place on April 24<sup>th</sup>
2014 in conjunction with Earth Day.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

The Green Shorts Film Festival is a Film
Positive production. Film Positive is an organization that brings awareness to
environmental and social issues though the medium of film. One hundred percent
of the money raised will go toward festival cost and filmmaker prizes and comes
entirely from sponsors and donors. 
We have some awesome perks including; event tickets, VIP seating, tickets to the after party and reusable goodie bags filled with all kinds of cool environmentally friendly items. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>The idea for Earth Day came from founder Gaylord Nelson, a
U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive
oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Inspired by the student anti-war
movement, he realized that if he could infuse that energy with an emerging

Americans took to the streets, parks, and auditoriums to demonstrate for a

Green
Shorts is an International Film Festival showcasing independent films that
promote environmental awareness. The festival's origins are rooted in Santa
Barbara, CA and have been an important part of the Earth Day celebration since
2008.
The
6th annual Green Shorts Film Festival will be held in Santa Barbara,
CA at the historic Arlington Theater. The event will take place on April 24th
2014 in conjunction with Earth Day.

What We Need & What You Get

The Green Shorts Film Festival is a Film
Positive production. Film Positive is an organization that brings awareness to
environmental and social issues though the medium of film. One hundred percent
of the money raised will go toward festival cost and filmmaker prizes and comes
entirely from sponsors and donors. 
We have some awesome perks including; event tickets, VIP seating, tickets to the after party and reusable goodie bags filled with all kinds of cool environmentally friendly items. The Impact
The idea for Earth Day came from founder Gaylord Nelson, a
U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive
oil spill in Santa Barbara, California. Inspired by the student anti-war
movement, he realized that if he could infuse that energy with an emerging
public consciousness about air and water pollution, it would force
environmental protection onto the national political agenda. Senator Nelson
announced the idea for a “national teach-in on the environment” to the media; persuaded Pete McCloskey, a conservation-minded Republican Congressman,
to serve as his co-chair; and recruited Denis Hayes as national coordinator.
Hayes built a staff of 85 to promote events across the land. As a result, on the 22nd of April, 20 million
Americans took to the streets, parks, and auditoriums to demonstrate for a
healthy, sustainable environment in massive coast-to-coast rallies. Thousands
of colleges and universities organized protests against the deterioration of
the environment. Groups that had been fighting against oil spills, polluting
factories and power plants, raw sewage, toxic dumps, pesticides, freeways, the
loss of wilderness, and the extinction of wildlife suddenly realized they
shared common values.

After spending the past two years working on lowering the carbon footprint at our school, we have realized we need to do more if we are going to have a sustainable and livable future.Our mission now is to take action to mitigate climate change not only at our school and in our community, but at a national level.Our story is already gaining local acclaim, and has been covered by the Port Townsend Leader and the Peninsula Daily NewsWe have been meeting with state and national legislators in our area, and now we are taking our message across the nation.Why Urgent Action on Climate Change is So ImportantThe facts are sobering:- the 10 hottest recorded years in history have been within the past 16- we have reached a level of 400 parts per million of CO2 in our atmosphere, a level which has not been seen in 800,000 years. We know that more CO2 means a warmer planet and a warmer planet means an increase in severe weather- 2013 set a new global record for billion-dollar weather disasters with 41 disasters like Hurricane Sandy, which caused $68,000,000,000 in damageAs the generation that will inherit this crisis, we can’t wait any longer for politicians to argue the facts.  As President Obama said in his State of the Union Address this year, “the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact.” We need solutions NOW!Therefore, as passionate and dedicated citizens of planet Earth, we will travel by public transportation from our small town in western Washington to the ‘other’ Washington to bring our message of hope and plea for action to our leaders.We Will Create a Wave of Student Voices Across Our Nation!To provide a voice for our fellow concerned students, we will be contacting schools along the train route from Seattle to D.C. (55 stops through 12 states!) and picking up petitions from students as we go (see Updates to download) or sign our national online petition.  Around the clock, we will meet energized young adults across America and bring their concerns with us as we generate a wave of hope for our leaders to do the right thing - for us and for generations to come!We Need Help to Fund Our Travel Costs - we leave on March 27th!To keep a low carbon footprint, public transportation will be taken all the way there and back, including 7 days on the train round-trip!  We are staying at the youth hostel to support more 'green', sustainable and affordable accommodations. For each student (there are 15 students on this life-changing journey!)$ 1,500 = total cost of trip including travel, lodging, and meals  $ 503 = one coach train ticket; round trip; 7 days on the train!  $ 172 = lodging/breakfast at the hostel for 4 days  $ 43 = lodging/breakfast at the hostel for 1 day  $ 25 = one dinner on the trainYour financial support is critical, but we also need your moral and social support. Please share this with your friends and spread the word. The more people that support us, the closer we get to our goal. If you want to stay informed about what we’re doing, you can like our page on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, or follow our blog.
We are trying our best to make a difference.Accomplishments:• we are a student run organization which has taken innovative steps to reduce the carbon footprint at our school by:  - restructuring and restarting the 'broken' recycling program  - conducting an energy and waste audit to reduce the amount of garbage at the school  - creating a business plan to show the cafeteria that they can    save about $10,000 per year if they switch to reusable dishes and trays instead of disposable ones  - switching to paperless bulletins, homework and assignments saving 30-100 reams of paper each year  - recruited another 25 students making us the largest club on campus!Awards:1) The Students for Sustainability have just received a prestigious honor for our groundbreaking work in our community.  The Environmental Protection Agency has awarded certificates of recognition to each of us for our work on sustainability issues, both at our high school and in the work we are doing with the Northwest Watershed Institute and the Jefferson Land Trust.  The citation reads: The United States Environmental Protection Agency, through the President's Environmental Youth Awards Program, congratulates the students involved in the 'Students for Sustainability' project.The United States Environmental Protection Agency is pleased to present this Presidential recognition to the Students for Sustainability and those who supported and assisted in the project.  You have all made an important contribution to the environmental resources of Washington.Congratulations to you all.Each certificate is signed by President Obama and carries the presidential seal along with a student's name. This certification allows us to compete with students from Washington, Alaska, Idaho and Oregon, for the award winner to represent the EPA's Region 10.  If we win this award, we will move on to a national competition.2) The president of Students for Sustainability, Ewan Shortess, was selected as a 2013 K-12 Student Environmental Leader at the annual E3 Washington Green Apple Awards on June 27, 2013.  He was recognized for his leadership as president of the Students For Sustainability at the high school, as well as his role as a member of the city and county Climate Action Committee.What you will receiveWe need over $25,000 for our dedicated group to travel the 3,000 miles to D.C. and stay at the hostel.  We will be deeply appreciative of any support you can provide.

<p>Pasadena
Audubon Society and the Arroyo Seco Foundation are working together
to protect and restore the stream habitat and wildlife along the
Arroyo Seco River. We filed a lawsuit to stop the LA County Flood
Control District's $100 million Big Dig program to truck sediment
from Hahamongna Watershed Park in Pasadena to landfills 25 miles
away.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1082008/files/20141208173203-1444491_ae8e2c6d.jpg?1418088723"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>
The
Big Dig program will have horrendous impacts on habitat and wildlife
in Hahamongna and on the neighboring communities. The District
is pushing ahead with it's program, claiming that their Big Dig is
the only way to protect downstream communities from flood threats. In
their push, they have ignored clear alternate proposals from our
organizations, community members, and the City of Pasadena. The alternate proposals lay
out methods to achieve needed flood protection without such significant
impacts. The Flood Control District claims these alternatives would not provide
protection but have given no indication of how much more protection
their destructive project will provide. They are simultaneously
moving forward with similar programs at other large dams in LA
County – which will add up to an enormous amount of money, air
pollution, and waste.</p>

Hahamongna
is a precious environmental treasure in the Arroyo Seco, a branch of
the Los Angeles River and a rare alluvial canyon that links the San
Gabriel Mountains to downtown Los Angeles.

Pasadena
Audubon Society and the Arroyo Seco Foundation are working together
to protect and restore the stream habitat and wildlife along the
Arroyo Seco River. We filed a lawsuit to stop the LA County Flood
Control District's $100 million Big Dig program to truck sediment
from Hahamongna Watershed Park in Pasadena to landfills 25 miles
away.

The
Big Dig program will have horrendous impacts on habitat and wildlife
in Hahamongna and on the neighboring communities. The District
is pushing ahead with it's program, claiming that their Big Dig is
the only way to protect downstream communities from flood threats. In
their push, they have ignored clear alternate proposals from our
organizations, community members, and the City of Pasadena. The alternate proposals lay
out methods to achieve needed flood protection without such significant
impacts. The Flood Control District claims these alternatives would not provide
protection but have given no indication of how much more protection
their destructive project will provide. They are simultaneously
moving forward with similar programs at other large dams in LA
County – which will add up to an enormous amount of money, air
pollution, and waste.



Image courtesy of Dorothy WongWe
filed this lawsuit to force the agency to manage the Devil's Gate Dam reservoir in
a way that not only preserves flood protections provided by the dam
and its reservoir, but also considers traffic, air quality, natural
communities, and water resources to create an integrated and
sustainable approach that will benefit all residents of Los Angeles
County. Now we need funds to successfully press this lawsuit, to prove that the agency cannot simply proceed while
ignoring the needs of the community.
Their
Big Dig:



$100
million for a quick fix, temporary solution


425 trucks a day adding to traffic, noise, and air pollution


150,000
trucks for this reservoir alone – an unknown number for all their
reservoirs


No
clear goal for reservoir capacity – but a minimum of 2.4 million
cubic yards of soil and vegetation removed from Hahamongna in under 5
years


Destroy
71 acres of established stream side habitat, a state wide resource,
and riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub – a rare habitat nearly
extirpated in Los Angeles County








The Pasadena Alternative:



120 trucks a day, maximum


Require trucks to meet at least 2010 EPA emissions standards, reducing NOx emissions


Set a clear goal of reservoir capacity, work slowly to get there over 10 years


MAINTAIN that level of capacity every year to avoid a future 'crisis'


Limit the project to a 40 acre footprint


Preserve key areas, including stream-side habitat and riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub


Maintain a pool of water near the dam to increase water conservation and provide habitat for birds, fish, frogs and more

</div></div>","Short Summary City Park For Everyone Coalition is the alliance of New Orleanians working together to halt the development of the new golf course while preserving the park's continued open access of green spaces and the abundance of wildlife by providing sustainable, non privatized, alternative revenue methods and gaining greater transparency and accountability from City Park Leadership.
Our campaign is build to bring awareness to the destruction of the wild space that is currently happening, and to help fund the injunction we have filed to stop the work. City Park Board has not been transparent about this process, and have not taken public consideration of the use of land. 
It was a golf course, pre Katrina, but afterward it had been allowed to grow back into a natural state and be repopulated by many species of bids and plants.
With your contribution we will be able to pay our legal fees associated with the federal injunction we have filed.   What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise $20000 for legal fees, and other costs that may come up for events that we have building awareness of the park, 
Our perks are all built around New Orleans culture, photos and postacrds, different items of art that are centric to the beauty of City Park. 
Even if we don't reach our entire goal, all the funds will be going to our legal team. Any extra funds that may come will go to a local charity.   The Impact If we are successful the wild space in City Park will stay wild, which leaves a space for thousands of people to come and relieve stress of their daily lives. It gives room for people to exprience nature that they can't find within the city limits of New Orleans.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a couple that wants to do something about the climate crisis. We believe that many small actions can achieve as much (or even more) than one big action. So, we want to start small by planting trees. Planting a tree has a lot of benefits for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>We talked to a reforestation company and they gave us about 60.000 trees to plant, and we found 3 places in Colombia to do it.</p>
<p>Now we need your help to plant them! We want to dedicate ourselves to being really good at this simple yet complex task.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to cover the expenses of the workers that will do the planting, create a good camping facility to them, with food and a place to rest.</p>
<p>Yes, we could do this with volunteers, but we think this is an opportunity to also create work for people in these rural areas. This way we make an even bigger impact.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, we will plant as many trees as we can with the collected money, but we want to keep doing this on the long term, so after the campaign is over we will open our web site for everyone who wants to keep donating.

<p>Planting trees has a huge impact in the environment.

<h3>2020 Plans</h3>
<p>We're kicking off our annual fundraiser with this campaign. We still have our survey going in Cambodia's <a href=""https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/cambodia-virachey-national-park-in-danger"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virachey National Park</a>, and we are seeking to start another in the region, the details of which we cannot make public at the moment (but which can be shared via email: greg.mccann1@gmail.com ). For those who haven't seen our work before, allow us to summarize what we do:</p>
<ul>
<li>We work in currently neglected/underpriotized protected areas in Southeast Asia that the bigger conservation NGOs, for whatever reason, don't want to touch.</li>
<li>We conduct camera-trap surveys to uncover globally important wildlife populations and use that data to encourage larger NGOs and the government to invest in long-term conservation programs. We have already achieved success in this regard in our project in Sumatra's <a href=""https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/ecotourism-sumatra-rainforest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hadabuan Hills</a>, bringing in the esteemed <a href=""https://prcfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PRCF</a>, and also in Cambodia's Virachey NP, where negotiations are currently underway for NGOs to make an entry, and where our work resulted in the <a href=""https://prcfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rediscovery of a breeding population of Asian elephants</a>. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are shooting for $6,000 to pay for camera traps, protective metal casings, lithium batteries, SD cards, food and provisions, and daily supply allowances for local staff on expeditions and camera checks. </li>
<li>Everyone who donates will get exclusive digital copies of camera trap images, and those who donate $250 or more will recieve actual prints in the mail. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our fundraising goal, the projects still go on, and whatever we bring in goes straight to the field.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We work in places that other conservation NGOs largely consider to be too risky or too difficult. We see these factors as opportunities to explore. Here is what we bring to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indisputable photographic evidence that globally important species persist in currently neglected refugia and which need urgent conservation investment. Species we've found so far include: tigers, Malayan tapirs, Asian elephants, clouded leopards, dholes, pangolins, helmeted hornbills, and many others species. </li>
<li>We're basically 2/2 with our projects so far, with the missions accomplished of bringing in larger, better-monied organizations who have the funding to carry out long-term management strategies.</li>
<li>We are not a cut-and-run team and we are commited to the locations and local people where we work for the long haul. This is evidenced by our multi-year engagements in Cambodia and Indonesia. </li>

We think it just makes sense to develop cleaner, more sustainable energy infrastructure at Nowhere (and indeed the world). This year for the inaugural Here&amp;Now Camp at the Nowhere festival in Monegros, Spain, we want to build a sustainable fuel cell system that is SILENT, CHEAP TO RUN, CLEAN and most importantly - FREAKIN’ COOL.

<br/><br/>We’ve already been allocated a 400€ Innovation Grant from the Nowhere Board, and the camp has been actively fundraising with events in Barcelona. But we’re going to need at least 1600€ more to build the fuel cell itself and get the other components we need to create a complete energy system. And if we meet this goal ahead of time, we have a stretch goal of 500€ more - to provide Nowhere with its very first Oxygen Bar!

<br/><br/>Andrea will give a workshop on the project at this year’s Nowhere and will provide detailed open source schematics of the fuel cell system for anyone interested in building their own. It’s not just a better battery - it’s a positive step forward for the whole community.

After Nowhere the plan is to use the fuel cell to help power ConnectHORT, a community garden project in Barcelona.<br/><br/><h3>THE FUEL CELL</h3>
The main component of the system will by an HHO fuel cell, designed by Andrea Gini (a longtime Burner and ex-Navy engineer). Using solar panels to provide energy to the fuel cell, it will initiate an electrolysis reaction of the water inside, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases. <br/><p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431518917/uwu7tja26dkyvehv1ubu.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 490.993px; height: 401px;""/></p><br/>Using special laser-cut membranes, we will separate these gases and store the hydrogen in a tank during the day to provide fuel for a  fuel cell stack during the night, which will power the camp’s electricity needs.

<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431518962/uyxb37wxuoln0tgnyixy.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 595.686px; height: 294px;""/></p>This system could be developed further to provide an effective energy alternative for other barrios in future, and help us collectively transition to more sustainable energy generation at the festival.

<br/><br/><h3>THE OXYGEN BAR</h3>
If we can, we want to go further than just building the fuel cell. Because the electrolysis process produces oxygen as well as hydrogen, if we can raise enough for the extra pump and filters we would need to supply it, we’ll be able to make Nowhere’s very first Oxygen Bar! Oxygenating the human system can have a range of benefits, from increased energy levels to increased concentration. Help us reach our stretch goal of 2100€ so we can bring a healthy and fun pick-me-up to the dusty chaos of Nowhere!

<br/><br/><h3>BUDGET</h3>
To build the system we will need:
<br/>- Solar panels: 700€
<br/>- HHO Fuel cell (materials + fabrication): 400€
<br/>- Hydrogen tank: 100€
<br/>- Connectors (gas + electricity): 100€
<br/>- Fuel cell stack: 400€
<br/>- Campaign perks: 300€

<br/><br/><h3>HERE &amp; NOW CAMP 2015<br/>
</h3>
This will be the inaugural year for the Here &amp; Now Camp at Nowhere. Inspired by our experiences with yoga, meditation, merrymaking, and other transformational practices, as well as camps such as Sacred Spaces at Burning Man and retreat centres around the world, we wanted to create a space that would facilitate these sorts of experiences for the inhabitants of Nowhere.

<br/><br/>Through exploration of the body, emotions, mind, and spirit we will seek to inquire into the deeper questions of our existence, as living beings, as human beings, as a community and as part of the evolution of all the cosmos. 
Our focus will be on providing a forum for educational sessions by and for everyone. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge of the Nowhere community we will offer a wide range of effective personal practices known to facilitate transformation in every aspect of our lives. 

<br/><br/>Yoga will be expressed not only as a physical practice suitable for a bendy few, but an integrated discipline accessible to all in daily classes and workshops, supporting more vibrant health, greater physical capability, clarity of mind, and increased interpersonal awareness. Meditation will be practiced in many forms, personal and guided, still and dynamic, silent and sounded. Artistic expression in all its forms will be celebrated, and we will offer daily talks on health, lifestyle design, diet, philosophy, spiritual practice, and how we can clarify the concept of ""sustainability"" in many aspects of our life. 

<br/><br/>Through these many different aspects we want to ask the question of ourselves and the festival as a whole: how can we meet our own needs, and once we have, how can we really be of service to each other, and the world at large? We welcome transformative workshops, yoga, meditation, panel discussions, ceremonies, seminars, dance, live art creation, music and any other experiences that will inspire our Nowhere community. If you would like to collaborate with content, please sign up here: <a href=""https://goo.gl/VxsXic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/VxsXic</a>
<br/><br/>This clean energy project is another facet of the camp’s vision for creating a space that inspires and empowers us to evolve, both personally and collectively!

<br/><br/><h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
We need the help of the Nowhere, and the wider Burn community, to make this happen and to do it right. We think this could be an important step forward to creating a more sustainable energy environment at Nowhere and help the Nowhere/Burn community as a whole develop better tools for generating and storing electricity for camps. We will be offering guided tours and workshops on the fuel cell technology for anyone interested!

<br/><br/>Check out the perks in the right sidebar - we are offering detailed schematics and mentorship to build your own fuel cell, limited edition Here&amp;Now schwag and private therapies with some of our members! But most of all, the satisfaction of knowing you are part of a team working to make our environment cleaner!<br/><br/>If you support the project, please let others who may be interested in it know about it too, and if you have any questions or feedback please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at hereandnowcamp(at)gmail.com or our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hereandnowcommunity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here&amp;Now FB community page</a>.

Did you know that the typical American family generates 4,320 pieces of trash annually during lunchtime? We are ECOlunchboxes, a small business specializing in
waste-free lunchware. 
Our dream is to teach children about lunch waste in a fun
way and empower them to green their lunchtime habits. How do we want to do
this? By developing a smart phone game.
Imagine lunch trash flying in air. The
object is to quickly swipe trash into one of 3 cans: recycling, compost &
trash. If the trash goes into the correct bin, the bin lights up and blinks. If
the trash misses the bin or goes into the wrong bin, it explodes and splats in
a pile on the lunchroom floor. Each round has a timer and point threshold to
beat. 
Correctly sorted trash wins! 



The Impact
Our landfills and oceans are filling up with trash. Lunchtime provides an opportunity for children to take change into their own hands and green their habits. A study completed by ECOlunchboxes has shown that the typical American family generates 4,320 pieces of trash just during lunchtime! (Study results here http://www.ecolunchboxes.com/learn_study.html)
By recycling and adopting sustainable habits at lunchtime, families can dramatically reduce their environmental footprint.

<p>I'm Tim Moore.  I
have a BS in Biology from VA Tech and my Masters from UNC's Kenan-Flagler
Business School.  </p><p>From the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office on Oyster Restoration:</p><p>""Although the native oyster is an extremely resilient species, able to tolerate wide variations in salinity and temperature, it has not been immune to the pressures of disease, overharvesting, and pollution. As a result, native oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay are at less than 1% of historic levels. This tremendous decline in the oyster population has dramatically changed the ecology of the Bay as well as the oyster fishery and the cultural tradition of watermen who harvest seafood from the Bay for a living. One of the responses to this decline has been attempts to restore oyster populations.""</p><p>For the last three years I have been growing oysters on
the Chesapeake Bay as a hobby.  I
recently obtained a bottom lease from the State of Virginia and am in the
process of creating an artificial oyster reef on it.  Creating an artificial oyster reef will do
three major steps towards restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay:  filter water, provide habitat for juvenile
fish, and reduce pressure on native - wild oysters.</p>
<p>Oysters have an
amazing ability to filter water.  An
adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day.  They remove algal blooms and sediment from
the water column enhancing water clarity. 
This allows light to penetrate to a greater distance and allows sea
grasses to grow on the bottom.  These sea
grasses provide habitat for juvenile fish, molting crabs, and mollusks. Oysters
also remove both carbon and nitrogen from the water with their shells acting as
a carbon sink to reduce the harmful effects of CO2 emissions on global warming.</p>
<p>Oyster reefs themselves
provide shelter for juvenile fish and bottom structure to attract fish
populations.  Fish of all sizes congregate
around bottom structure – with smaller fish looking for protection and larger
fish looking for shade and smaller fish. 
Historically natural oyster reefs in the Chesapeake Bay provided this
benefit but mechanical dredging over the past century has dramatically reduced
the number of these reefs.  </p>
<p>Creating an artificial
reef to grow oysters for market reduces the pressure on naturally occurring wild
oysters.  This allows these wild oysters
to reproduce and repopulate an area that had been depleted through years of
over harvesting.  Planting and raising oysters
through aquaculture also provides a consistent product for market and allows
the traditional waterman a method of earning a living through a sustainable,

<p>This contribution will

three feet square and have feet that hold them four inches off of the bottom

I'm Tim Moore.  I
have a BS in Biology from VA Tech and my Masters from UNC's Kenan-Flagler
Business School.  From the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office on Oyster Restoration:""Although the native oyster is an extremely resilient species, able to tolerate wide variations in salinity and temperature, it has not been immune to the pressures of disease, overharvesting, and pollution. As a result, native oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay are at less than 1% of historic levels. This tremendous decline in the oyster population has dramatically changed the ecology of the Bay as well as the oyster fishery and the cultural tradition of watermen who harvest seafood from the Bay for a living. One of the responses to this decline has been attempts to restore oyster populations.""For the last three years I have been growing oysters on
the Chesapeake Bay as a hobby.  I
recently obtained a bottom lease from the State of Virginia and am in the
process of creating an artificial oyster reef on it.  Creating an artificial oyster reef will do
three major steps towards restoring the health of the Chesapeake Bay:  filter water, provide habitat for juvenile
fish, and reduce pressure on native - wild oysters.
Oysters have an
amazing ability to filter water.  An
adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day.  They remove algal blooms and sediment from
the water column enhancing water clarity. 
This allows light to penetrate to a greater distance and allows sea
grasses to grow on the bottom.  These sea
grasses provide habitat for juvenile fish, molting crabs, and mollusks. Oysters
also remove both carbon and nitrogen from the water with their shells acting as
a carbon sink to reduce the harmful effects of CO2 emissions on global warming.
Oyster reefs themselves
provide shelter for juvenile fish and bottom structure to attract fish
populations.  Fish of all sizes congregate
around bottom structure – with smaller fish looking for protection and larger
fish looking for shade and smaller fish. 
Historically natural oyster reefs in the Chesapeake Bay provided this
benefit but mechanical dredging over the past century has dramatically reduced
the number of these reefs.  
Creating an artificial
reef to grow oysters for market reduces the pressure on naturally occurring wild
oysters.  This allows these wild oysters
to reproduce and repopulate an area that had been depleted through years of
over harvesting.  Planting and raising oysters
through aquaculture also provides a consistent product for market and allows
the traditional waterman a method of earning a living through a sustainable,
environmentally responsible process.
Reef Creation
This contribution will
be used to purchase polypropylene trays that will be used to construct an
artificial oyster reef.  These trays are
three feet square and have feet that hold them four inches off of the bottom
allowing good water flow to the oysters inside. 
Each stack of trays will hold between 500 to 1000 oysters depending on
oyster size and will protect them from predators.  The cost of a stack of trays is $70, however
if I buy in bulk the price drops to $50 each. 
$20,000 works out to 400 stacks and will hold 200,000 adult oysters. The

Every $10 contribution

<p>Green By Force Communications (""GBFC"") has developed a proprietary marketing tool -- the <a href=""http://greenbyforce.com/?page_id=538"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Service Announcement (""GSA"")</a>.  For purposes of clarification - the GSA is something brand new and doesn't exist as yet. The simplest explanation is that it's a hybrid between a PSA (public service announcement) and a commercial. Therefore the GSA will both educate like a PSA AND sell a product that is certifiably green (not BP masquerading as a green company). We could, for example, create a GSA spot in which a household energy conservation product is used to highlight the deleterious effects of human waste/consumption.  Or climate change.  The GSA would be eligible for discounts on media buys on a scalable basis according to the ratio of public educating re environment/product selling. </p>
<p>So the hard part is explaining this new tool to our first round investors. We need to raise funds to produce a high quality video that would show what's different about a GSA, how it would work, what an actual GSA would look like and how/why it would be eligible for scalable discounts.</p>
<p><strong>Green By Force Communications is Five People on a Mission… </strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to save the planet (yes, really!), and we need your help to get started. We have an idea: the GSA. Call it a “Green Service Announcement.” The GSA is a marketing tool that will revolutionize the green economy by leveling the playing field for green product and service companies. CERTIFIABLE companies. Greenwashers need not apply!</p>
<p>Once in place, the GSA will reduce the cost of the media buy, typically the largest portion of an integrated marketing campaign. This will allow our partner companies to get the word out a little louder, reduce their prices, or invest more into R&amp;D.  All the better for you and me as consumers. The GSA simplifies decision making by giving you the assurance that these companies are truly beneficial, and knowing that your money is spent in the smartest way possible.</p>
<p><strong>Our Company</strong></p>
<p>Green By Force Communications (GBFC) is not a traditional company. Founded in 2011, we are a member-managed cooperative. This means that there is no hierarchy. Each member has an equal vote and an equal share in the company. <strong>We don’t have titles, only members. </strong>Meet us on our website: <a href=""http://greenbyforce.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://greenbyforce.com/</a></p>
<p>So that’s the first thing. Behind our environmental vision, we are on a mission to <strong>increase</strong> <strong>economic equality.</strong> Did you know that the average CEO makes 380 times more than the average employee! (<a href=""http://neweconomicsinstitute.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://neweconomicsinstitute.org/</a>). This is socially unsustainable, and our cooperative model works to combat that. The GSA also works to promote economic equality by allowing the socially beneficial companies to better compete with the rest.</p>
<p>Green By Force is the only integrated marketing and communications company devoted exclusively to the certifiable, green economic market sector. We operate on two main principles.</p>
<p>1)     <em>Link social benefit to the product</em>. The essential pieces of the GSA are to <strong>educate and promote</strong>. The buyer has to know not only what the product does for them, but how it helps serve society or the environment better than a competing product.</p>
<p>2)     <em>Completely sustainable campaigns</em>. It’s not just the product that has to be beneficial. We will conduct campaigns that are <strong>green end-to-end</strong>, from the wages of the crew to the type of straws used to stir coffee on the set. </p>
<p><strong>What we’ve done so far…</strong></p>
<p>The early months were spent a little like the first few billion years of the universe—clouds of matter swirling and forming into something recognizable.  We were gathering the right members and brainstorming to eventually come up with the GSA. With our core concept in place, we developed a business plan and a strategic plan for growth of the cooperative. We also started on the pitch to obtain angel funding. The business plan is complete (although, like the universe, expanding and evolving) and this indiegogo campaign is the final piece of the VC pitch.</p>
<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>So like we said, this indiegogo campaign is the last part of Phase One. With the indiegogo funds, we will create a high-quality video presentation to court bigger investors. With the proper backing, we will be able to concentrate full time on making the GSA an officially recognized program (working with industry, NGO partners like the NRDC, and local and federal government).</p>
<p>We need $20,000 to cover the costs of creating a presentation about our GSA. We have the know-how to create a really sweet presentation, ""Grow Your Green,"" but in order to complete a truly professional project, we need your help to:</p>
<ul>

<h3><strong>It's hard to talk about the climate crisis. </strong></h3>
<p>Listen, we've all experienced what works when it comes to viral campaigns we've felt compelled to share, or the cultural leaders we call heroes.  There's something magical about striking the right balance -- throwing down meaningful, relevant content but still being, ya know, fun.  Connecting with people.  Bringing the love.<strong> </strong> When it comes to the climate crisis it's a hard balance to strike -- 'cuz man is it huge and man is it bad. </p>
<h3>But I want to capture the magic. </h3>
<p>As a speech coach, host, and content creator with a background in academia... my dream is to live at the intersection of pop culture &amp; social change.  Inspire my generation to do what must be done, before it's too late, and have fun in the process. If you can, please help the dream become reality.  You'll own a piece of this training and I hope you'll feel like you're doing something tangible in support of a climate solution.  You absolutely are.</p>

Which is amazing, except that I'm a bit of a poor creative type.  If you've got a little to give, please help fund my trip to become a climate leader, alongside the former VP and all the fresh-faced global shapers of tomorrow.  Your donation will pay off!

""Hi Samara,
Congratulations! On behalf of The Climate Reality Project, I am thrilled to inform you that your application to the Climate Reality Leadership Corps has been accepted. We look forward to welcoming you to our three-day training with our Chairman, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, on July 30-August 1 in Chicago, IL.
As a member of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps global network, you will join a select group of diverse, passionate, and talented volunteers from around the world. During the training you will learn about the latest science of climate change, best practices in public speaking and connecting with your audience, communication strategies, social media, leadership skills and community outreach and organizing.""
It's hard to talk about the climate crisis. 
Listen, we've all experienced what works when it comes to viral campaigns we've felt compelled to share, or the cultural leaders we call heroes.  There's something magical about striking the right balance -- throwing down meaningful, relevant content but still being, ya know, fun.  Connecting with people.  Bringing the love.  When it comes to the climate crisis it's a hard balance to strike -- 'cuz man is it huge and man is it bad. 
But I want to capture the magic. 
As a speech coach, host, and content creator with a background in academia... my dream is to live at the intersection of pop culture & social change.  Inspire my generation to do what must be done, before it's too late, and have fun in the process. If you can, please help the dream become reality.  You'll own a piece of this training and I hope you'll feel like you're doing something tangible in support of a climate solution.  You absolutely are.
Thank you so much for your donation!!
$1800 covers airfare from LAX, a hotel for four nights near the training center in the South Loop area of Chicago, other transport and meals not covered by the conference, and Indiegogo fees.
And if you're not in a position to give, I totally get it!  Maybe you'll forward this link on to friends or family who care about climate defense. 
Social networking to save the world, y'all!  Thank you so much!

<p>My name is Lis Addison. I've been a
musician, dancer, environmentalist and supporter of women's wisdom my entire
life and in recent years have blended these passions into a practice called
KiVo®, which is short for Kinetic Voice. KiVo is a fun and powerful art form
that combines vocals, dance and rhythm and builds community. </p>
<p>While developing KiVo, I researched
the song/dance tradition worldwide. My research took me to Kenya and Tanzania
where I enjoyed KiVo like celebrations with many communities during my
tree-planting service work there. Now I'm happy to be returning to plant trees
in the Mulingana Primary School Yard in Kenya, share and learn more songs and
dances and contribute to the livelihood of women, by opening a KiVo Sewing and
Design Center in Arusha, Tanzania, which will manufacture schoolchildren's uniforms.
I will also record music and video while I'm there to incorporate into the KiVo
practice.</p>
<p>This Project is important to me
because I believe that singing and dancing together is our birthright. It
creates joy, cultural exchange and harmony between people, nature and spirit. I
believe trees are beautiful old beings and as the lungs of the earth help to
reverse the effects of global warming. I also believe that the sisters of the world
must support one another and bring their voices of wisdom forward to benefit
their families and the coming generations.</p>
<p>When I went to Mulingana Primary
School in Kangundo, a county outside of Nairobi, I saw dozens of schoolchildren
playing soccer with a ball they'd made out of old t-shirts. They were playing
in the dusty dirt and blazing sun because there were no trees to shade them or
reduce soil erosion. I made a decision right then to support The Kamba women's
project which, in association with the Green Belt Movement will plant 1,000
trees in the schoolyard. We planted 3 that day. Only 9,997 more to go!</p>
<p>After Kenya, I went to Tanzania
where I worked with teachers and students affiliated with Roots &amp; Shoots. I
taught school and the students performed my music and choreography for me, which
they'd learned before I arrived! I also learned traditional Morogoro
song/dances and got to plant a tree on Mt. Kilimanjaro. I have been
communicating with my friends in Arusha via Facebook. They are school teachers
and we have decided to open the KiVo Sewing and Design Center to support women
who need jobs and children who need uniforms (all the students in E. Africa
wear them-public and private). </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Your
 support will provide money to
buy trees, water and a caretaker who will drive a water truck for 2 
years to
Mulingana Primary since there are no hoses at the school in Kangundo. It
 will pay rent, fabric, thread and scissors for the Sewing Center in 
Arusha, Tanzania for one year. It will pay for the extra baggage charge 
for the 2  sewing machines I am taking. We already have 4 at the site. 
Your support will pay for my transportation to
Nairobi and Kangundo with GBM to plant the trees and record the
songs and dances of the Kamba community and it will pay for my 
transportation to Arusha to establish the KiVo Sewing and Design Center 
and continue recording songs and
dances.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you cannot contribute, please

TO CONSERVE THE MANGALOMA NATURE RESERVE!</b><br/></p>
<p>The Mangaloma Nature Reserve has an extension of 200
hectares (500 acres). It is located at the western foothills of the Andean
Mountain Range, in the province of Pichincha, Ecuador. Its altitude levels
range from 700 to 900 m.a.s.l.</p>
<p>This protected area is part of the Chocó Region, which
extends from Colombia to northwest Ecuador. It is well known for its high
biodiversity and for the important number of endemic species. Being at
immediate threat, this region is considered as a “hot spot”. </p>
<p>The Mangaloma Reserve stands out for its
avifauna diversity. More than 290 species have been identified. Amongst them, the
most prominent are the Banded Ground Cuckoo (<i>Neomorphus radiolosus</i>), the
Umbrellabird (<i>Cephalopterus penduliger</i>) and the Ornate Hawk Eagle
(Spizeatus ornatus), species that are almost extinct in the Chocó Region. Our
web page includes a complete inventory of birds.</p>
<p>There are also 121 species of fine
tropical trees, many of them near to extinction in cause of the progressive
deforestation and monoculture in the region. The most important are the Tangare
(Carapa megistocarpa) and Phitelephos aequatorialis.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are a great variety of
animals that find refuge in the Reserve like the wild boar (Pecari tajacu), the
ant eater bear (Tamandua Mexicana), rodents (Dasyprocta punctyata, Cuniculus
paca), otter (Lutra longicaudis), armadillo, and even the puma (Puma concolor).</p>
<p>The concept of the
Mangaloma Nature Reserve is to provide a self sustaining option to live in harmony
with nature. That is why our basic resources come from the same reserve: solar
electricity, potable water from the internal springs, organic vegetables and
fruits, among others.</p>
<p>We work also in
close contact to the surrounding communities which live in humble and marginalized
conditions. So we are carrying a capacitation program to teach, through
workshops, about subjects like health, organic agriculture, strengthening the
communal organization, social security and the importance of living in balance
with the environment. Thanks to these efforts, we have taken important steps to
stop the destruction of nature in the area, contributed to well-being of the
surrounding habitants and drastically reduced the hunting of wild animals.</p>
<p>We, María and
Reinhard have maintained the reserve for about 15 years allocating our own
economic resources on it. </p>
<p>Now we are retired
and our resources are exhausted. We consider the conservation of nature is not
a business. The incomes obtained from visitors are undermost and there are no
governmental programs to support the reserve. So we need your help. The reserve
still needs care and the community needs to improve its living conditions and
welfare and also its environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Help us to keep the
Mangaloma reserve and make a donation to support its maintenance until we find
a long term and sustainable financing.</p>
<p>The demanded amount
of 65.000 USD will permit us to maintain the reserve at least for 2 years, the
space of time necessary to procure sustainable resources for the conserved
area.</p>
<p>Your donations will
be strictly used for maintenance and proper management of the reserve,
especially for the ranger salary and wages for other farm workers needed occasionally,
the maintenance of the infrastructure (the ranger’s house, the capacitation
center used for workshops, the water supply system, solar electricity, paths
trough the forest and signage), administration and public relations.</p>
<p>Our rewards for the

Billions of gallons of fuel are wasted each year due to our driving habits... but what can you do about it, really? The problem is that we are unconscious about the fuel we use.  If only there was a way for you to become aware... My app, GreenRider, will change the way you interact with your car as well as with others by sharing, comparing, and “gamifying” your car fuel data as you drive. Competing against your friends and network to lower your fuel consumption will provide awareness and encourage responsible use of the planet’s natural resources. Regardless of the car you drive, you can apply this knowledge to improve your driving habits and save both fuel and money. Take a look around, ask me a few questions, and get your own GreenRider by supporting this project. You'll help us all out in the end.Actual Screenshot How does it work? With your mobile phone and a simple OBD-II plug-in device (see below), GreenRider will make saving fuel a game. Your real time fuel consumption habits will be automatically shared and compared among users. In effect, GreenRider will nudge you toward both gasoline and financial savings. What I Need, and What You Get There are a bunch of nice rewards to select. Here is the quick description of the core perks:
You fund me $10: you pre-order to get the app. Find an OBD-II connector to connect with your car (required for the app to function) and you're golden. 
You fund me $30: you pre-order to get the app ... PLUS  get a tested OBD-II device (the Bronze ""Starter"" Package option on the right --->)
You fund me $60: you pre-order the app and OBD-II connector and I make you a core member of my beta testing team (Silver ""Beta"" Package --->)If you use the app and change your habits, the app can more than pay for itself over 12 months:Why Indiegogo?You might think, ""if you already have a prototype, why are you asking for more money?""  Last fall at the White House, I was really encouraged by an amazing set of folks I met in the Tech and Innovation division of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. When I finished my fellowship, I made the choice to focus all my energy on new ideas, came up with GreenRider, and assembled a team to build it. However, setting out on your own to create something innovative costs money and my funds are running dry. Your contributions to GreenRider will go towards:Upgrade ValueTo give you a better idea what value each Flex/Choice goal upgrade will provide to your GreenRider, here are some more detailed descriptions:What makes GreenRider different?I recognize there are several mobile apps and OBD-II devices for your car. To put it bluntly, this will be a ""lean"" tool built for ecofriendly, fuel-conscious car drivers - first and foremost.
No motor/engine check diagnostic function  
No route planning software
No extraneous features
No kitchen sink
Sure, I want lots of helpful features that will help you conserve, but I need your help to build them. Support the movement and get your own GreenRider!Pilot PlanningWhen I competed at the TEDxFulbright Social Innovation Challenge earlier in April, I discovered another entry that had some overlapping interests. Lawrence On-Board is a network of ""roadside ridesharers,"" and many of its drivers are naturally interested in minimizing their car fuel waste. I am currently in talks with its founder about piloting GreenRider in the Lawrence On-Board network.Concluding Thoughts There are many ways you can increase your car's MPG and save fuel... my purpose is to help you want to seek them.Braking less, more frequent tune-ups, and less-aggressive driving are just a few common sense ways you can save. Indeed, there are even groups of ""hypermilers"" out there who have perfected fuel efficient techniques for years. These folks have achieved stunning increases in MPG sometime beyond the car manufacturer's intent. So what does this mean? The answer: anyone can conserve, and you really aren't required to buy an expensive new car or own a hybrid to save fuel. GreenRider will help make it possible for you to be an ecofriendly driver regardless of your car class, make, or model. Other Ways You Can Help

to Make a Difference</span><br/></p>
<p>Our vision is to create a farm
sanctuary where people get a break from the everyday speed of
life to be able to relax, learn and reflect, leaving energized with new
insights to make better choices and decisions for the whole.<br/></p>
<p>The heart will be our charming old red, but very worn down barn, that we want to rebuild into a beautiful green demonstration and inspiration building with a spacious classroom, a farm to table
restaurant, a winter garden and of course great rooms to stay in, all built with
natural materials combined with cutting edge sustainable solutions.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To the Eco Barn you could come for a class in organic gardening or a conference where leading experts share perspectives on future proof sustainable farming. You can stay here with your children to experience an ecosystem full of exciting life. You can go on a corporate retreat to this very calm and creative environment, inspiring full </span>focus and new ideas<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Or you can spend a weekend for yourself attending yoga workshops as well as plant based cooking classes with inspiring chefs and all the ingredients coming fresh from the farm.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460661343/IMG_5480_taaktt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460631745/insida_lada_koda_webb_kopia_q3hfhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Believe</h2>
<p>The farm is
located in the beautiful Swedish countryside by lake, field and forest, at the end
of the road, a little bit more than an hour from Stockholm. It is run by us,
Julia and Carl, our gardener Sina and volunteers from all over the world.</p>
<p>The
inspiration to sell our comfortable new house and embark on a farm
transformation journey followed the birth of our son, Leopold. What would the
world look like when he turned thirty? We saw how too many social and environmental
development curves pointed in the wrong direction. We thought we as a society
needed to rethink and act much more holistically, and we realized that we could make a
positive contribution to this development.</p>
<p> In the
last four years we have worked hard to restore, renew and change an old
conventional farm into a much richer organic ecosystem. Now we are ready to
take the next step and create an impact way beyond the farm borders.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461666011/Framsida_qdxs1y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460661688/%C3%85ker_gfk9qw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">

<br/></span>Who We Are<br/>
</h2>
<p>Julia has a background in marketing and
communication. After studying in London she worked for MTV Networks
International. During this time she discovered yoga and trained as a yoga
teacher. Today Julia runs the farm guesthouse. She loves to connect with the
visitors and to make everyone feel welcome. Julia is a trained beekeeper and
permaculture designer. She is also a certified Iyengar yoga teacher. She looks
forward to develop high quality workshops at the farm, including yoga, organic and biodiverse gardening, and healthy and sustainable cooking in collaboration with some of the most inspiring chefs. </p>
<p>Carl has a Master of Science degree from
Stockholm School of Economics and started his career as management consultant
at McKinsey &amp; Co. Since 2004 he has been an independent trainer and
consultant focusing on inspiring purpose driven and sustainable leadership in
organizations. Carl is also a trained permaculture designer and applies a
system perspective on how we can make our soil more alive and fertile since
this is the foundation for everything at an organic farm. One of Carl’s
long-term aspirations is to be able to show how human systems and organizations can learn from
natural systems, and to arrange workshops and conferences on how we can build richer ecosystems for the future.</p><p>You can read more about us and our farm adventure at our website <a href=""http://www.lindeborgs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lindeborgs Gård</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461871736/Portr%C3%A4tt_lm98as.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span>Ready to Go<br/>
</h2>
<p>We cannot wait to push the go-button to realize the
Eco Barn Project, a unique 1100 square meter learning and inspiration center. We have worked hard during one and a half year together with White Arkitekter, our architects. Now all the drawings are complete, the building permit is in place, we have harvested
and sawed the wood needed and we have done loads of
research to make sure we integrate the most promising and innovative sustainable technologies (read more about them at the end of this page).</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We believe the Eco Barn is truly unique, as it will house a multitude of different functions all supporting each other. There will be carbon negative production of electricity, a processing chain for old Swedish heritage grains and other farm produce such as honey. As a guest you will be able to eat delicious organic food in our farm restaurant, and stay in rooms made out of the wood from our forest, all designed and furnished with natural organic materials. You will be </span>able<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to go to classes or have meetings in the the classroom overlooking the lake. And you will be able to recharge in the sauna, the winter garden or by the naturally clear pond. You will be able to experience all systems in action, connecting you with nature, a living soil and the origins of food. You will be in the middle of it all. </span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460661756/a1m4qlkrelvtd3ydavqi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span>What We Need to Get Going<br/>
</h2><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The challenge for us is that the scope of our holistic project is large and that innovative sustainable solutions are costly. We can finance part of the investment ourselves
through savings and loans, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency will support part of the investment in the energy solutions, but </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">we still need additional funding to get going. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
crowdfunding campaign plays a critical role here. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We would love to have you onboard this exciting journey</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and your support will help us bring the Eco Barn vision to life. Th</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e funds from the crowdfunding will go to four important parts of this project: </span></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>The Creative Farm Dojo</b> <b>(</b></span><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$1</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">00 000)<span><br/></span></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With a stunning view over the lake and the fields where the veggies for
today’s meals may just be harvested, the farm dojo will be a special place, the most
important one at the farm. Dojo means a place for studies and this is where
trainings, workshops and creative meetings will take place. Here people with different backgrounds and perspectives will meet to learn and to explore how we practically can build a better, more sustainable world. In the ceiling you
see the original wooden framework of the barn and the wooden floors will be made
with new timber from our forest. This will be a place for both stillness and
creativity, a place for big thoughts, deep insight and conversations that make a difference.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Winter Garden Learning Space (</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$</span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">100 000)</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/>To make the barn into a real living ecosystem itself, we will integrate
a combined winter garden and green house. Here people can get the benefits of green
plant presence also in winter and we can produce delicious green leaves and
vegetables for the farm to table kitchen, all year round. This space will be a
green room for learning and relaxation and also the perfect place to experience
delicious organic food from the </span>surrounding<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> farm ecosystem.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nature in the walls – wool and linen insulation (</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$</span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>30 000)<span><br/></span></b>A healthy and sustainable building is made by natural and renewable
materials. We will need 400 cubic meters of wonderful wool and linen insulation
to make the barn warm, cozy and energy efficient.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Releasing Plant Power – an innovative water cleaning system (</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$3</span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>0 000)<span><br/></span></b>The water cleaning system will be biological, using a new technology that
fulfills the strictest rules and regulations by using a mix of plants to clean
all the waste water from the building. The solution includes a unique phosphor trap to prevent leakage and to make it possible to reuse these nutrients.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If this project can attract more funds than the requested $260 000 we would be absolutely thrilled. This would help us fund:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>The Eco Barn Farm to Table Restaurant and Cooking Studio ($150 000)<span><br/></span></b></span>A creative restaurant where you see the chefs in action or participate yourself in the cooking experience is one of the best ways to help people connect to the origins of food and the quality of sustainable farming. Working with a skilled kitchen consultant and chef, we have planned for a wonderful, open restaurant kitchen in the Eco Barn designed for our guests to really get engaged in the processing, cooking and savoring of the farm's organic produce. A unique feature is the attached Winter Garden where green leaves and vegetables will be produced all year round. A wood stove used for cooking will also be integrated in the kitchen.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</li></ul><p><i><b>Our Sister Campaign - The
Carbon Negative Project</b><span><br/></span><span>The Eco Barn will be a demonstration site for a truly unique combination
of energy solutions, using solar power, biochar and sterling engines. These solutions
will make the carbon footprint of the building negative which means that the
more we use the building the less CO2 in the atmosphere and the more we help to
reverse global warming. We believe that these solutions, that we want to help to test, demonstrate and spread, make up a big part of the solution for the climate challenge that we
together face. To be able to share the whole story around these amazing technologies we created a separate crowd funding campaign called <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-carbon-negative-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-carbon-negative-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Carbon Negative Project.</a></span></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<span><br/></span>The Impact</h2>
<p>We cannot wait to get going! We wish to put all the planning
and preparations done so far into action as soon as possible, aiming to open the Eco Barn in 2017. Your support will help enable this project and the
surrounding ecosystems to make a significant positive impact in several areas:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">New ideas, perspectives and
inspiration that improves society<span><br/></span></b>The world needs more meeting places where human systems connect with natural systems, meeting places where different perspectives meet and new positive ideas arise to be spread and put into action. The Eco Barn is designed in every detail to enable this kind of meetings, courses and conversations.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Sustainable and
thriving people and organizations</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>The Eco Barn will be a unique farm sanctuary enabling people to get in contact with nature and themselves. To be able to thrive in our fast paced society we believe that people, teams and organizations need space to breathe every now and then. We all need space to lift the gaze, to renew ourselves, to recharge. We need to distance ourselves from the action every now and then to be able to see the whole picture, make better choices and come back with more and energy and stronger intent.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Spreading of brand new green
technologies for a sustainable future</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>We want the Eco Barn to be a unique building that tells stories of hope and possibility. One really important story will be around the green technologies, a story that we believe will spread and help make many more building much more green, benefitting both people and environment.</span></li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Climate change reversal by
creating one of the worlds first carbon negative buildings<span><br/></span></b>The building will be self sufficient when it comes to energy production based on technology that help us store carbon in the soil. The more we use  the building, the better for the climate and the generations to come.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><br/></span>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Read More About Our Green Solutions</h2>
<p>Part of the vision is that this will become a unique
demonstration building that contributes positively to surrounding ecosystems.
We believe it is possible to design systems in a way that the more a building
is used the better for the environment. The barn will become such a building.
We hope that the solutions and systems that we put in place also can inspire
many other to choose more green technologies and materials when building. Below
are some of the most important sustainable solutions.</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The barn
will be rebuilt using our own timber from the forest. The logs have been pulled
out by horse to avoid ground damage and converted into construction wood and
planks by a local saw mill. Using a lot of wood in the building makes the
building itself a carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide (CO</span><sub style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2</sub><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In
addition to wood we will use as much other renewable and natural materials as
possible. The insulation in the walls and in the ceiling will be made out of
sheep wool and linen and the insulation in the foundation will consist of
recycled glass that is puffed up with air.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
water cleaning system will be biological. We use a new technology that fulfills
the strictest rules and regulations while still using plants to clean all the
grey and black water from the building.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
organically certified farm to table restaurant will use absolutely fresh and
local products from the farm. We will have a big focus on high quality plant
based food. There will be a processing chain in the barn to make fresh flour
from the grains we produce and a green house attached to the kitchen so green
produce will always be available to the chefs, even in the wintertime.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The heating system will be carbon dioxide negative, which is quite unique in the world. This means that the more we heat the building, the less CO2 in the atmosphere. This is done through a process called pyrolysis, in which organic matter, such as oat shells from the fields and wood chippings from the forest, are decoupled into heat gas and biochar. Biochar is basically what you use in the grill in the summer. The heat gas heats water that will circulate through a radiator system warming up the whole building. The biochar contains all the CO2 from the wood. So instead of releasing it back to the atmosphere, which is normally what happens when you burn wood, we can now add it back to the soil. The soil then stores the CO2 for hundreds to thousands of years while new trees grow up in the forest absorbing more CO2 from the atmosphere.

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The barn will have its own electricity production, partly using solar power and partly using sterling engines. The sterling engines run on the heat gases from the pyrolysis process. They have a maximum effect of 10000 watt per engine and are able to power the whole farm operation. </span></li>

New ideas, perspectives and inspiration that improves society

More sustainable and thriving people and organizations.

The spreading of brand new green technologies for a sustainable future 

Climate change reversal by creating one of the worlds first carbon negative buildings
A Vision
to Make a Difference
Our vision is to create a farm
sanctuary where people get a break from the everyday speed of
life to be able to relax, learn and reflect, leaving energized with new
insights to make better choices and decisions for the whole.
The heart will be our charming old red, but very worn down barn, that we want to rebuild into a beautiful green demonstration and inspiration building with a spacious classroom, a farm to table
restaurant, a winter garden and of course great rooms to stay in, all built with
natural materials combined with cutting edge sustainable solutions.To the Eco Barn you could come for a class in organic gardening or a conference where leading experts share perspectives on future proof sustainable farming. You can stay here with your children to experience an ecosystem full of exciting life. You can go on a corporate retreat to this very calm and creative environment, inspiring full focus and new ideas. Or you can spend a weekend for yourself attending yoga workshops as well as plant based cooking classes with inspiring chefs and all the ingredients coming fresh from the farm.
What We Believe
The farm is
located in the beautiful Swedish countryside by lake, field and forest, at the end
of the road, a little bit more than an hour from Stockholm. It is run by us,
Julia and Carl, our gardener Sina and volunteers from all over the world.
The
inspiration to sell our comfortable new house and embark on a farm
transformation journey followed the birth of our son, Leopold. What would the
world look like when he turned thirty? We saw how too many social and environmental
development curves pointed in the wrong direction. We thought we as a society
needed to rethink and act much more holistically, and we realized that we could make a
positive contribution to this development.
 In the
last four years we have worked hard to restore, renew and change an old
conventional farm into a much richer organic ecosystem. Now we are ready to
take the next step and create an impact way beyond the farm borders.

Who We Are

Julia has a background in marketing and
communication. After studying in London she worked for MTV Networks
International. During this time she discovered yoga and trained as a yoga
teacher. Today Julia runs the farm guesthouse. She loves to connect with the
visitors and to make everyone feel welcome. Julia is a trained beekeeper and
permaculture designer. She is also a certified Iyengar yoga teacher. She looks
forward to develop high quality workshops at the farm, including yoga, organic and biodiverse gardening, and healthy and sustainable cooking in collaboration with some of the most inspiring chefs. 
Carl has a Master of Science degree from
Stockholm School of Economics and started his career as management consultant
at McKinsey & Co. Since 2004 he has been an independent trainer and
consultant focusing on inspiring purpose driven and sustainable leadership in
organizations. Carl is also a trained permaculture designer and applies a
system perspective on how we can make our soil more alive and fertile since
this is the foundation for everything at an organic farm. One of Carl’s
long-term aspirations is to be able to show how human systems and organizations can learn from
natural systems, and to arrange workshops and conferences on how we can build richer ecosystems for the future.You can read more about us and our farm adventure at our website Lindeborgs Gård.

Ready to Go

We cannot wait to push the go-button to realize the
Eco Barn Project, a unique 1100 square meter learning and inspiration center. We have worked hard during one and a half year together with White Arkitekter, our architects. Now all the drawings are complete, the building permit is in place, we have harvested
and sawed the wood needed and we have done loads of
research to make sure we integrate the most promising and innovative sustainable technologies (read more about them at the end of this page).We believe the Eco Barn is truly unique, as it will house a multitude of different functions all supporting each other. There will be carbon negative production of electricity, a processing chain for old Swedish heritage grains and other farm produce such as honey. As a guest you will be able to eat delicious organic food in our farm restaurant, and stay in rooms made out of the wood from our forest, all designed and furnished with natural organic materials. You will be able to go to classes or have meetings in the the classroom overlooking the lake. And you will be able to recharge in the sauna, the winter garden or by the naturally clear pond. You will be able to experience all systems in action, connecting you with nature, a living soil and the origins of food. You will be in the middle of it all. 

What We Need to Get Going
The challenge for us is that the scope of our holistic project is large and that innovative sustainable solutions are costly. We can finance part of the investment ourselves
through savings and loans, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency will support part of the investment in the energy solutions, but we still need additional funding to get going. The
crowdfunding campaign plays a critical role here. We would love to have you onboard this exciting journey and your support will help us bring the Eco Barn vision to life. The funds from the crowdfunding will go to four important parts of this project: 


The Creative Farm Dojo ($100 000)With a stunning view over the lake and the fields where the veggies for
today’s meals may just be harvested, the farm dojo will be a special place, the most
important one at the farm. Dojo means a place for studies and this is where
trainings, workshops and creative meetings will take place. Here people with different backgrounds and perspectives will meet to learn and to explore how we practically can build a better, more sustainable world. In the ceiling you
see the original wooden framework of the barn and the wooden floors will be made
with new timber from our forest. This will be a place for both stillness and
creativity, a place for big thoughts, deep insight and conversations that make a difference.


The Winter Garden Learning Space ($100 000)To make the barn into a real living ecosystem itself, we will integrate
a combined winter garden and green house. Here people can get the benefits of green
plant presence also in winter and we can produce delicious green leaves and
vegetables for the farm to table kitchen, all year round. This space will be a
green room for learning and relaxation and also the perfect place to experience
delicious organic food from the surrounding farm ecosystem.


Nature in the walls – wool and linen insulation ($30 000)A healthy and sustainable building is made by natural and renewable
materials. We will need 400 cubic meters of wonderful wool and linen insulation
to make the barn warm, cozy and energy efficient.


Releasing Plant Power – an innovative water cleaning system ($30 000)The water cleaning system will be biological, using a new technology that
fulfills the strictest rules and regulations by using a mix of plants to clean
all the waste water from the building. The solution includes a unique phosphor trap to prevent leakage and to make it possible to reuse these nutrients.


If this project can attract more funds than the requested $260 000 we would be absolutely thrilled. This would help us fund:
The Eco Barn Farm to Table Restaurant and Cooking Studio ($150 000)A creative restaurant where you see the chefs in action or participate yourself in the cooking experience is one of the best ways to help people connect to the origins of food and the quality of sustainable farming. Working with a skilled kitchen consultant and chef, we have planned for a wonderful, open restaurant kitchen in the Eco Barn designed for our guests to really get engaged in the processing, cooking and savoring of the farm's organic produce. A unique feature is the attached Winter Garden where green leaves and vegetables will be produced all year round. A wood stove used for cooking will also be integrated in the kitchen.
Our Sister Campaign - The
Carbon Negative ProjectThe Eco Barn will be a demonstration site for a truly unique combination
of energy solutions, using solar power, biochar and sterling engines. These solutions
will make the carbon footprint of the building negative which means that the
more we use the building the less CO2 in the atmosphere and the more we help to
reverse global warming. We believe that these solutions, that we want to help to test, demonstrate and spread, make up a big part of the solution for the climate challenge that we
together face. To be able to share the whole story around these amazing technologies we created a separate crowd funding campaign called The Carbon Negative Project.

Leaving a Legacy - Champions and Main SponsorsWe really believe the Eco Barn is a unique project that will make a significant positive contribution to the world beyond the farm borders. We we would love to long-term team up with a number of people and organizations that share our values and beliefs and that would like to get involved with financial support and potentially also with other forms of collaboration. You will be the Champions of the Eco Barn Project and our Main Sponsors. In the perks presentation to the right we describe the different roles and some ways we can give back in exchange for your very important and generous support. We are also very open to your own ideas on how we can create a long-term win-win collaboration centering around sustainability, learning and innovation.What happens with the contributions if the funding target is not met?If the crowdfunding target is not met fully, your contribution to this
campaign will still be used for the Eco Barn Project. Either we will be able to
realize the full vision by finding complementing sources of financing, or we
will kick in the persistant part of ourselves and start with part of the project, realizing the full vision step by step
over time.

The Impact
We cannot wait to get going! We wish to put all the planning
and preparations done so far into action as soon as possible, aiming to open the Eco Barn in 2017. Your support will help enable this project and the
surrounding ecosystems to make a significant positive impact in several areas:


New ideas, perspectives and
inspiration that improves societyThe world needs more meeting places where human systems connect with natural systems, meeting places where different perspectives meet and new positive ideas arise to be spread and put into action. The Eco Barn is designed in every detail to enable this kind of meetings, courses and conversations.
Sustainable and
thriving people and organizationsThe Eco Barn will be a unique farm sanctuary enabling people to get in contact with nature and themselves. To be able to thrive in our fast paced society we believe that people, teams and organizations need space to breathe every now and then. We all need space to lift the gaze, to renew ourselves, to recharge. We need to distance ourselves from the action every now and then to be able to see the whole picture, make better choices and come back with more and energy and stronger intent.
Spreading of brand new green
technologies for a sustainable futureWe want the Eco Barn to be a unique building that tells stories of hope and possibility. One really important story will be around the green technologies, a story that we believe will spread and help make many more building much more green, benefitting both people and environment.

Climate change reversal by
creating one of the worlds first carbon negative buildingsThe building will be self sufficient when it comes to energy production based on technology that help us store carbon in the soil. The more we use  the building, the better for the climate and the generations to come.

Part of the vision is that this will become a unique
demonstration building that contributes positively to surrounding ecosystems.
We believe it is possible to design systems in a way that the more a building
is used the better for the environment. The barn will become such a building.
We hope that the solutions and systems that we put in place also can inspire
many other to choose more green technologies and materials when building. Below
are some of the most important sustainable solutions.


The barn
will be rebuilt using our own timber from the forest. The logs have been pulled
out by horse to avoid ground damage and converted into construction wood and
planks by a local saw mill. Using a lot of wood in the building makes the
building itself a carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide (CO2).


In
addition to wood we will use as much other renewable and natural materials as
possible. The insulation in the walls and in the ceiling will be made out of
sheep wool and linen and the insulation in the foundation will consist of
recycled glass that is puffed up with air.


The
water cleaning system will be biological. We use a new technology that fulfills
the strictest rules and regulations while still using plants to clean all the
grey and black water from the building.


The
organically certified farm to table restaurant will use absolutely fresh and
local products from the farm. We will have a big focus on high quality plant
based food. There will be a processing chain in the barn to make fresh flour
from the grains we produce and a green house attached to the kitchen so green
produce will always be available to the chefs, even in the wintertime.

The heating system will be carbon dioxide negative, which is quite unique in the world. This means that the more we heat the building, the less CO2 in the atmosphere. This is done through a process called pyrolysis, in which organic matter, such as oat shells from the fields and wood chippings from the forest, are decoupled into heat gas and biochar.

The soil then stores the CO2 for hundreds to thousands of years while new trees grow up in the forest absorbing more CO2 from the atmosphere. Learn more at The Carbon Negative Project Campaign.
The barn will have its own electricity production, partly using solar power and partly using sterling engines. The sterling engines run on the heat gases from the pyrolysis process. They have a maximum effect of 10000 watt per engine and are able to power the whole farm operation.

<p><b><u>Uniqueness of the 'Aina (Land)</u></b><br/></p>
<p>When many think of Hawai'i, its likely they imagine mild, sub-tropical weather. In fact, the Hawaiian islands also host climates that rival the harshest places on earth! From Alpine snow to black sand beaches and spanning desert-like sand and deep, lush rainforests, Hawaii's ecosystems are unparalleled in both their beauty and uniqueness. They also require dedicated protection to preserve this distinction.</p>

Uniqueness of the 'Aina (Land)
When many think of Hawai'i, its likely they imagine mild, sub-tropical weather. In fact, the Hawaiian islands also host climates that rival the harshest places on earth! From Alpine snow to black sand beaches and spanning desert-like sand and deep, lush rainforests, Hawaii's ecosystems are unparalleled in both their beauty and uniqueness. They also require dedicated protection to preserve this distinction.


Who We Are- Hawai'i Forest Institute (HFI)
The mission of the Hawai'i Forest Institute (HFI) is to promote the health and productivity of Hawaii’s forests through forest restoration, educational programs, information dissemination, and support for scientific research. HFI is now launching 40 DAYS FOR HAWAII'S FORESTS to promote our new MAHALO 'AINA: Give Back to the Forest program, which seeks to expand our community partnerships in order to gain support for the protection and perpetuation of Hawaii’s forest resources.  




Proven Success in Forestry Stewardship
Over the past 11 years, HFI has served over 3,400 individuals annually through our various forest restoration and educational projects programs, engaging:
• 500-600 youth and 200 adults through native forest restoration and education at three dryland forest sites in West Hawaii 
• 600 attendees to outreach events, including Grow Hawaiian Festival, Dryland Forest Symposium, Kuhio Day Festival
• 800 students in online learning lessons, 100 educational workshop attendants
• 450 volunteers at the Pana'ewa Zoo Discovery Forest, Keauhou Bird Conservation Center Discovery Forest, and Aina Mauna Christmas Tree Demonstration Project 
• 15 partners and 10 volunteers through the Hawaii Island Native Seed Bank
• An estimated readership of 1,000 students, educators, woodworkers, foresters, scientists and others through the Hawaii Forest Journal and HFIA newsletters
• Visitors worldwide through HFI’s and partner Ka' Ahahui o ka Nahelehele’s websites, with dryland forest lesson plans and other resources
HFI has supported efforts to restore over 45 acres of forest habitat and outplant over 9,000 seedlings.  40 DAYS FOR HAWAII'S FORESTS helps continue this path.


Hawaii's 'Aina Needs Our Protection
Many of Hawaii’s ecosystems are among the most endangered in the world. Over 95% of Hawaii’s dry forests have disappeared and over 25% of the endangered species in the Hawaiian flora are from dry forests. To protect these rare and special places, HFI asks supporters to give during the 40 DAYS TO HAWAII'S FORESTS to help us raise $10,000 to support our forest restoration and education projects! 




Reforesting Hawai'i With Your Support
With your contribution, we can reach our goal for 2015! Your donation will help finance the planting of 4,000 seedlings, while engaging 1,800 volunteers in forest stewardship learning activities at our forest restoration and demonstration sites throughout the state.  We'd love to have you, if you'd like to become involved!

one van to help save the planet</b></p>
<p>Help save
the planet by attacking the problems of soil depletion and excessive waste
through supporting the cause of recycling organic waste by feeding Ed’s worms. </p>
<p>Ed needs a
van. </p>
<p>Actually,
his worms do. Nature’s Little Recyclers, based in Chicago, is on a mission to recycle
organic waste, such as coffee grounds and chaff, paper products, household
greens – and feed them to earthworms back at <a href=""http://www.plantchicago.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Plant</a> to
create high-quality fertilizer. </p>
<p>Ed makes
some of the world’s finest compost, and his suppliers include Chicago-area
businesses and coffee shops, such as Intelligentsia. Luckily, Chicago is
America’s largest sustainable community and plenty of people want to help! But,
in order to handle the increasing volume, Ed needs reliable transportation.
This is where the van comes in – and that’s where you come in!</p>
<p>The worms need
more food.</p>
<p>Our staff is
made up of earthworms, whose only goal in life is to eat and be happy while
creating world-saving products. The worms eat through organic waste to turn it
into vermicasts – excellent, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer – which Nature’s
Little Recyclers can produce products that feed plants, including fruits,
vegetables, lawns, and even trees throughout the Chicagoland area to support
urban farms, community gardens, among other health plants. </p>
<p>With your
help we will continue to expand, eliminating more waste and producing healthy
compost, as well as feeding large numbers of useful, happy earthworms. Now that
Nature’s Little Recyclers has grown to hundreds of pounds of earthworms, we
need more materials.</p>
<p>More food
for the worms means less waste for local businesses.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/369845/files/20140214065119-recycle_worm_mug.png?1392389479"" src="""" style=""""/>Nature’s
Little Recyclers helps coffee shops and roasters come closer to net-zero waste
by using coffee grounds and filters, which we collect from local coffee shops.
In Chicago alone, these coffee shops produce more than 40 tons a week of
grounds and potential waste that could be eliminated through our process. </p>
<p>Together, we
can lower the amount of waste headed to landfills and turn it into
nutrient-rich soil, leading to the growth of even more plants in Chicago for an ultimately greener future. </p>
<p>Help Ed help
the worms to help local businesses in Chicago save the planet.</p>
<p>Since its
founding in October 2012, Nature’s Little Recyclers has relied on friends,
volunteers and rentals to pick up materials. With more businesses willing to
donate organic material than ever, it has become difficult to depend solely on
our network of volunteers. We need a dedicated vehicle to be able to reliably
pick up materials, eliminating them from landfills, and getting them back to
our facilities.<span>  </span></p>
<p>In order to
be able to continue to grow, the only missing link is a dedicated vehicle. By
reaching our goal of $10,000 we can get a dedicated van which will allow us to
expand pickup to several more sites per day and meet our goals of taking
several tons of waste a week out of the waste stream and return it to the earth
as exceptional quality fertilizer. </p>
<p>Exceeding
our goal will allow us to also cover operating costs, and continue to expand
into additional locations. It costs us approximately $50 per location to
provide food-grade buckets and bins to store organic materials. </p>
<p>Help us make
a significant impact to a major problem.</p>

<p><b>The Impact of Your Help</b><br/>
Your help with providing us with a van, and support our collection efforts, we
will be able to reduce wastes, turn them into soil assets, and make our city
greener.<span>  We are focused on providing
products to as many gardens, farms, and growers as we can, and this will allow
us to move actively in that direction. </span></p></div>","NATURE’S LITTLE RECYCLERS: We need
one van to help save the planet
Help save
the planet by attacking the problems of soil depletion and excessive waste
through supporting the cause of recycling organic waste by feeding Ed’s worms. 
Ed needs a
van. 
Actually,
his worms do. Nature’s Little Recyclers, based in Chicago, is on a mission to recycle
organic waste, such as coffee grounds and chaff, paper products, household
greens – and feed them to earthworms back at The Plant to
create high-quality fertilizer. 
Ed makes
some of the world’s finest compost, and his suppliers include Chicago-area
businesses and coffee shops, such as Intelligentsia. Luckily, Chicago is
America’s largest sustainable community and plenty of people want to help! But,
in order to handle the increasing volume, Ed needs reliable transportation.
This is where the van comes in – and that’s where you come in!
The worms need
more food.
Our staff is
made up of earthworms, whose only goal in life is to eat and be happy while
creating world-saving products. The worms eat through organic waste to turn it
into vermicasts – excellent, nutrient-rich organic fertilizer – which Nature’s
Little Recyclers can produce products that feed plants, including fruits,
vegetables, lawns, and even trees throughout the Chicagoland area to support
urban farms, community gardens, among other health plants. 
With your
help we will continue to expand, eliminating more waste and producing healthy
compost, as well as feeding large numbers of useful, happy earthworms. Now that
Nature’s Little Recyclers has grown to hundreds of pounds of earthworms, we
need more materials.
More food
for the worms means less waste for local businesses.
Nature’s
Little Recyclers helps coffee shops and roasters come closer to net-zero waste
by using coffee grounds and filters, which we collect from local coffee shops.
In Chicago alone, these coffee shops produce more than 40 tons a week of
grounds and potential waste that could be eliminated through our process. 
Together, we
can lower the amount of waste headed to landfills and turn it into
nutrient-rich soil, leading to the growth of even more plants in Chicago for an ultimately greener future. 
Help Ed help
the worms to help local businesses in Chicago save the planet.
Since its
founding in October 2012, Nature’s Little Recyclers has relied on friends,
volunteers and rentals to pick up materials. With more businesses willing to
donate organic material than ever, it has become difficult to depend solely on
our network of volunteers. We need a dedicated vehicle to be able to reliably
pick up materials, eliminating them from landfills, and getting them back to
our facilities.  
In order to
be able to continue to grow, the only missing link is a dedicated vehicle. By
reaching our goal of $10,000 we can get a dedicated van which will allow us to
expand pickup to several more sites per day and meet our goals of taking
several tons of waste a week out of the waste stream and return it to the earth
as exceptional quality fertilizer. 
Exceeding
our goal will allow us to also cover operating costs, and continue to expand
into additional locations. It costs us approximately $50 per location to
provide food-grade buckets and bins to store organic materials. 
Help us make
a significant impact to a major problem.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div><i>Does pulling feathers hurt the birds?</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>The very last thing this project aims to do is put any of the birds at risk or inflict any pain upon them. All of the procedures involved with the capturing and handling of the birds were guided by the North American Banding Council Bander's Code of Ethics, in which the operation's priority is the safety of the birds. The pulling of the tail feathers occurred quickly and cautiously, and any pain associated with this was only experienced momentarily. Pulling tail feathers is harmless; similar to pulling out a hair. The Coyote Creek Field Station employs a series of protocols and training to ensure the handling of the birds is safe and injury free.    </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<i>What happens to the birds after you are finished sampling them? </i><br/>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>All of the birds are released into the wild at the site of capture so that they can continue their migration. The time it takes to capture the bird, band them, take measurements and pull tail feathers takes only about 5 minutes.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>What are your qualifications for conducting this type of research?</i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>
<p>I have been volunteering with the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory at the Coyote Creek Field Station Training to band birds since May, 2012. I hold a background and undergraduate degree in Animal/Pre-Veterinary Sciences where I have spent over seven years handling a variety of species of animals. I have handled approximately 500- 600 birds. I was trained to pull feathers from birds by professionally certified bird banders.  </p>
<p><i>What type of permits do you need for this project?</i><br/></p>
<p>I am required to have a University IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) protocol, a Federal Bird Banding permit, and a state Collections permit. I have all of the permits and approvals, in collaboration with the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory, required to undertake this research.   <br/></p>
<p><i>When will you get results?</i></p>
<p>Once I receive all of the funding to send my feather samples to the U.C. Davis Stable Isotope Facility the analysis process will take approximately 4-6 weeks. </p>
<p><i>What will you do with the results?</i></p>
<p>Once I receive the feather isotope results, a series of statistical correlations will be used to compare feather values to breeding origin values, based on the natural isotopes in precipitation. I will compare the feather isotopes of the pacific-slope flycatchers to the natural isotopes in precipitation and determine where each bird migrated from. </p>
<p>The results from this research will be provided to the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory for the Coyote Creek Field Station  biologists to create predictive models of migrating flycatcher populations in the future. The results will also be provided to the Bird Banding Laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey and to the Migratory Bird Center of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute to allow conservation biologists to implement proper management techniques to further protect pacific-slope flycatcher populations. Lastly, the results will be used for my Environmental Studies Master's thesis at San Jose State University and prepared for future publication. </p>

LIVELIHOOD.They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore (Isaiah 2:4).
Rabbis for Human Rights is a rabbinic organization rooted in the belief that, as all people are created in the image of God, we are obligated to protest against every injustice enacted against any other person. As part of our work, we fight against acts of vandalism, destruction and abuse towards Palestinians and Palestinian property by Jewish extremists. Palestinian agriculture, and specifically, olive trees, are a prime target of attacks by these extremists.

For the last ten years Rabbis for Human Rights has planted olive trees with our Palestinian partners in the Occupied Territories in what has become one of our most notable traditions.  As we witness new levels of vandalism against these ancient and precious trees, we see our mission as more urgent and valuable than ever. More than an international symbol of peace, our olive trees also represent the mending of  injustice and wrongs between Israeli Jews and Palestinians. Hope coming alive, these trees will one day bear beautiful olives that will benefit generations of Palestinians to come.



In Palestinian society, olive trees carry huge significance. So much that a Palestinian farmer describes them as “the foundation of the home.” Some farmers own trees that have been passed down through their family for generations, caring for the same trees they harvested with their parents and grandparents. 
You are buying more than an olive tree.  Every donation also promises:


 Palestinians and Israelis working together on a common goal 




 Jews, Muslims and Christians planting the seedlings of justice and hope

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Aaron and I was born on the organic blueberry farm I am now regenerating. Growing up, I spent a lot of my time with my Dad at the Earthcare, Richmond’s community garden, and travelling around NSW with him certifying organic farms. I am now passionately dedicated to providing a framework for a local food system that is beneficial for the environment and the community.</p>
<p>A CSA is a way for community members to directly shape the way they interact with their environment and the food they eat.  I think it’s important for people to have the opportunity to be more directly involved in the farm where their food is grown and to have access to good quality, seasonal, local and organic produce.</p>
<p>By investing in the farms, you can co-create, a community based, organic, local food system.  CSA projects are in the embryonic stage in Australia. They have been successfully running for decades around the world. For example in Japan it is called Food with The Farmers Face. By subscribing you become part of the global movement towards environmental restorative agriculture.</p>

<p>These funds will be used to take to farm to the next level of production so that we can provide 30-60 members with quality fortnightly boxes of produce that replace their normal fresh food shopping. The Bilpin farm is perfect for growing your delicious, household veggies while the Mt Tomah farm has well-established berries, figs and nut trees.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a CSA is an opportunity for you to be part of the farm and to get to know who is growing your food. Once the farms are up and running, I hope you will be part of the farm for years to come as we grow and improve together.</p>

<h3>AQEX Wastewater Index (WWI)</h3>
<p>AQEX is a new company devoted to bringing the true cost of nature's services to the financial services. While doing so, we stumbled on a fantastic find! Wastewater has all the potential to be the new extractive industry which is both environmentally friendly and financially lucrative!</p>
<p>Let me explain the business model around wastewater:</p>
<p>Wastewater is currently a liability (it costs people and businesses money in the form of deteriorating health, environment, and taxes, along with cleanup costs). However, after working in waste management for over 15 years (google our founder, Candace Chandra), we see that wastewater is actually the natural resource par excellence. Technology is now available (actually it has existed for over 30 years, but is now commercially viable at small sites, as well as large sites) which allows minerals, chemicals, and other pollutants to be extracted from wastewater, WHILE cleaning the water, so the water itself can be reused (or returned in a clean state to the local environment).</p>
<p><br/>Think how FANTASTIC this is:</p>
<p>wastewater actually produces multiple revenue streams:</p>
<p>-reusable cleaner (not always potable/drinking) water, plus</p>
<p>-chemicals (such as fertilizer) which can be resold and used, plus</p>
<p>-minerals used for industry, plus</p>
<p>-the relief of tax liabilities reduced or destroyed, plus</p>
<p>-the return of wildlife and fish to former dead zones (thus recreating related industries such as fishing, tourism, etc)!</p>
By contributing to the development of an index (which prices wastewater, similarly to the oil industry such as Brent Crude), you are helping to develop this nascent industry!</div>
<div>
<h3>Production Costs</h3>
In order to create a viable (accepted by financial institutions and other users) index, the following steps must happen:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>a) AQEX staff will travel to various sites around the US and verify water amounts, quality, types of contaminants, and feasibility of extraction;</div>
<div>b) AQEX staff (and you, if you are a BIG funder) will analyze types of water and conditions for consistency and produce categories for index. A survey of potential users will also take place;</div>
<div>c) pricing (using AQEX founder's patented algorithm) will be applied to wastewater locales and types;</div>
<div>d) information regarding pricing and water types will be shared globally via an Internet site listing the daily fluctuations (this step will be funded separatedly due to its gigantic cost relative to the rest of the project, unless you are all very generous and fund above and beyond the amount set!!).</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
LET THE ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMY BEGIN!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When this business model succeeds, it will show business people, students, and the world how to restructure their thinking to produce locally friendly businesses which are profitable. How better to help the world than that??</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are tired of talk and want to do something concrete today, contribute to us and put this business model on the map!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the scale of the polluted water problem is logarithmic (meaing that pollution has many add-on effects when left in water, creating a 2x, 3x, 5x and beyond negative effect on the environment and our health), we have used a logarithmic scale for funding levels too. We are serious about creating change, and wouldn't be soliciting outside funding if we had it ourselves!!</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you aren't able to contribute today, consider us again tomorrow or next month! In the meantime, we would be eternally grateful if you would share our link with your friends, family, and colleagues!</div>

<h2><strong>Disappearing bees!</strong></h2>
<p>Yikes. With 1/3 of our food existing thanks to pollinators, it’s no wonder we are alarmed – and with good reason. The numbers have been dropping since the 1940s despite the fact that the number of actual hives has grown.</p>
<p>Ontario alone experienced a 7% loss in honeybee populations 2012, which is low compared to reported losses as high as 70% in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The cause is not confirmed but fingers point at a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, widely used on corn, which is widely cultivated everywhere.</p>
<h2><strong>What can we do?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt=""Bees go here"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i42.tinypic.com/iedrmw.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bees go here""/></strong></p>
<p>Europe recently introduced a ban on neonicotinoids and Ontario beekeepers and environmentalists are calling for a similar ban here in Canada. We think it is just a matter of time until neonicotinoid use is restricted or banned, but in the meantime, we have to take care of our bees as best we can.</p>
<p>In Ontario, there are 4000 hobbyists and 250 professional beekeepers. Join us in strengthening our local environment, raising awareness and maintaining honeybee populations by installing two hives on our homestead in Vars near Ottawa, Ontario. We are well situated in a forested / agricultural area, far from cornfields.</p>
<h2><strong>What we need:</strong></h2>
<p>The initial cost of approximately $550 for a single hive includes</p>
<ul>
<li>the hive box</li>
<li>frames (for the bees to build comb to store honey)</li>
<li>a smoker</li>
<li>a hat and veil</li>
<li>a variety of tools necessary to maintaining the hive</li>
<li>the <strong>bees</strong>, of course!<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul><p>An additional $450 will go toward a second hive, further strengthening the bee population. Any additional funds raised will go toward honey harvesting supplies, additional layers for the hive (allows for a larger population), and supporting local advocacy groups and hobbyists.</p>
<h2><strong>Bonus:</strong></h2>
<p>You know what makes hard work and occasional stings a lot more bearable? <strong>Honey</strong>. Honey is amazing – as a sweetener, it is much better for you than refined sugar or no-calorie substitutes. It keeps forever. Slather it on a cut to stave off infection. Makes your skin and hair feel awesome when applied directly. Reduces sore throat and cough.</p>
<p>It may shock you to find out that the stuff you get in the grocery store may not, in fact, be pure, straight-up honey. It could be cut with as much as 49% high fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>So by supporting local beekeepers you are also supporting local honey. And if you support us, you may get some local honey of your own!</p>
<h2><strong>A note on perks:</strong></h2>
<p>Obviously, we can’t guarantee how much the bees will produce. We will do our best to fulfill the perks in 2013, but some of them may be pushed over in 2014.</p>
<p>There are currently only three sponsorship perks available. If we raise enough to start a second hive, <strong>three more sponsorship perks will be made available</strong> and they will be allotted to anyone who may have already invested the amounts in question before being made available to subsequent sponsors. So if you want a sponsorship slot but there isn't one currently available, please contribute anyway, because the contribution you hold back might be enough to push us into a second hive!</p></div>","Update - June 18, 2013

</ul><p>The concept: My friend recommended I explain the concept more clearly, so heres the science bit; the generating batterys use an outer spiral-wound copper cathode and a solid magnesium anode in a dry electrolyte housed in a flexible PVC tube, this creates low amperage power when resting that is stored in the embedded capacitors (in the dry alkaline electrolyte), also embedded in the sodium/alum mix are aligned peizoelectric potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystals (home grown) that give voltage pulses as vibrations and impacts are encountered riding which are smoothed and stored in the capacitors. A simple solar charge controller then uses this store to replenish the main batteries that are a hybridised copper/stainless mesh lightweight cell using pva gel alum electrolyte for safety and environmental security. Lithium is not safe for the user or the planet so we need solutions that benefit everybody, not just mining corporations and power companies; an off-grid e-bike.</p><p></p>

Hello, my name is Richard.
Me and my dog Bruce are on a mission to build a self-recharging electric bike using
recycled parts so that we can continue to enjoy cycling despite my ageing knees, and give something back too.


Stage 1 - is complete... I am now ready to build the proof of concept after
having done extensive research and planning


Stage 2 – I need donations of funds or materials to build the prototype


Stage 3 – I will then take the bike on a roadshow around the UK to educate
others at Eco events and festivals about how to build one for yourselves.


Benefits to me:


Saves my ageing
and injured knees by giving power assistance when needed


Allows me to
continue my love of cycling and exploring the country with my dog


Won't need to drive or waste planetary or monetary resources on a car


This isn't just about me:


It can aid
cycling for longer periods than the average 3 hours from current
electric bikes


The battery is self-charging whilst on the move, and trickle charges when stationary.

It uses road vibration piezoelectric hybrid batteries of my design, and supercapacitors built from low-toxicity materials
The technology
could be developed for other sustainable energy projects
What you'll get in return for helping me:


£5 - email updates
on progress of build


£25 -
E-postcards from Bruce on the first year of our travels

£50 -

The concept: My friend recommended I explain the concept more clearly, so heres the science bit; the generating batterys use an outer spiral-wound copper cathode and a solid magnesium anode in a dry electrolyte housed in a flexible PVC tube, this creates low amperage power when resting that is stored in the embedded capacitors (in the dry alkaline electrolyte), also embedded in the sodium/alum mix are aligned peizoelectric potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystals (home grown) that give voltage pulses as vibrations and impacts are encountered riding which are smoothed and stored in the capacitors. A simple solar charge controller then uses this store to replenish the main batteries that are a hybridised copper/stainless mesh lightweight cell using pva gel alum electrolyte for safety and environmental security. Lithium is not safe for the user or the planet so we need solutions that benefit everybody, not just mining corporations and power companies; an off-grid e-bike.
Together we can help save knees all over the planet, and give Bruce a tow!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul>
<br/><h2><b>Why It Matters</b></h2>
<p>Chilean Patagonia is a remote region of the world where nature, long left to its own devices grows wild, beautiful and largely untouched by man.  As South America’s last frontier, the region boasts incredible biodiversity, breathtaking landscapes, and a remote solitude that is increasingly rare in our burgeoning world.  Dappled with pristine lakes, jagged peaks, ancient glaciers, rushing rivers, coastal rainforests and dry grasslands, the area’s diversity is striking and its magnificence unmatched. The protection of this global treasure is an issue that transcends national boundaries, and as citizens of an increasingly globalized community we have a responsibility to show our support for the people of Chile in their fight to protect Patagonia The project proposed by HidroAysén would irrevocably damage this entire region. Chile is a country rich in natural resources, and renewable energy alternatives. This is an opportunity for Chile to stand as a global leader in responsible energy, if we help the people win the fight.</p>
<br/><h2><b>Why We Must Act NOW</b></h2>
<p>In the last few months there have been a lot of major updates surrounding the campaign. Chile’s current president, Sebastian Piñera, who is notorious for his support of the dams is nearing the end of his term. Although it seems Piñera has been distancing himself from HidroAysén, his administration has been trying to fast track two laws, coined ‘las leyes de HidroAysén' (laws of HidroAysén). These laws would provide a legal loophole to approve the construction of the world’s longest transmission line. The dams have already been approved, but the transmission line has not yet been approved. If these laws pass, the project would be able to move forward and the construction of the dams would begin. We must act now to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h2></h2>
<p>In 2014, we aim to broaden our international outreach by bringing our films on tour throughout Chile. The film tour will raise awareness and will serve as a platform to host thought-provoking, solution-based discussions that include local experts from each region we visit. We intend to empower people to take action by showing support for the existing Chilean effort and by helping people realize that Chile can act as a global leader in responsible energy development. We hope to demonstrate that they are not alone in the fight to protect these precious rivers.</p></span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition to the film tour,
we will be collaborating with Patagonia Inc-sponsored trail runners Krissy
Moehl and Luke Nelson to execute an ultra-run from source to sea along the
Baker River. The run, which will be completed by late February 2014, will serve
as means to document the audacious beauty of the Baker River, from its glacial
origins to the place where it meets the sea.</p>

 Three dams on the Rio Pascua, Chile’s third highest flowing river.


 Clear-cutting 1,600 km (1000 mi) of old-growth forest

 Building the longest transmission line in the world, over 2,450 km (1,500 mi)

Why It Matters
Chilean Patagonia is a remote region of the world where nature, long left to its own devices grows wild, beautiful and largely untouched by man.  As South America’s last frontier, the region boasts incredible biodiversity, breathtaking landscapes, and a remote solitude that is increasingly rare in our burgeoning world.  Dappled with pristine lakes, jagged peaks, ancient glaciers, rushing rivers, coastal rainforests and dry grasslands, the area’s diversity is striking and its magnificence unmatched. The protection of this global treasure is an issue that transcends national boundaries, and as citizens of an increasingly globalized community we have a responsibility to show our support for the people of Chile in their fight to protect Patagonia The project proposed by HidroAysén would irrevocably damage this entire region. Chile is a country rich in natural resources, and renewable energy alternatives. This is an opportunity for Chile to stand as a global leader in responsible energy, if we help the people win the fight.
Why We Must Act NOW
In the last few months there have been a lot of major updates surrounding the campaign. Chile’s current president, Sebastian Piñera, who is notorious for his support of the dams is nearing the end of his term. Although it seems Piñera has been distancing himself from HidroAysén, his administration has been trying to fast track two laws, coined ‘las leyes de HidroAysén' (laws of HidroAysén). These laws would provide a legal loophole to approve the construction of the world’s longest transmission line. The dams have already been approved, but the transmission line has not yet been approved. If these laws pass, the project would be able to move forward and the construction of the dams would begin. We must act now to prevent this from happening.

In 2014, we aim to broaden our international outreach by bringing our films on tour throughout Chile. The film tour will raise awareness and will serve as a platform to host thought-provoking, solution-based discussions that include local experts from each region we visit. We intend to empower people to take action by showing support for the existing Chilean effort and by helping people realize that Chile can act as a global leader in responsible energy development. We hope to demonstrate that they are not alone in the fight to protect these precious rivers.


In addition to the film tour,
we will be collaborating with Patagonia Inc-sponsored trail runners Krissy
Moehl and Luke Nelson to execute an ultra-run from source to sea along the
Baker River. The run, which will be completed by late February 2014, will serve
as means to document the audacious beauty of the Baker River, from its glacial
origins to the place where it meets the sea.
But we can’t do all of this
without your help!

<h3><b><u>THE CAMPAIGN</u></b></h3>
<p>We are a group of Ugandan and Israeli scientists and Ugandan community leaders committed to enhancing food security in the Putti Village region of Eastern Uganda.  </p>
<p>We would like to build a model farm together with local and Israeli agricultural scientists in order to support small holding farmers in the village and the surrounding areas and explore sustainable and efficient agricultural methods.</p>
<p><b><u>With your support, this is a very achievable goal!</u></b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current state of fields used for agriculture is insufficient to support both subsistence and commercial farming. Tragically, many children, pregnant women and other vulnerable community residents suffer from insufficient access to food during parts of the year. This is partly a function of the crops grown and the lack of proper irrigation systems to store water from the rainy season.</p>
<p><b>The pilot project will address one crucial challenge: how to improve irrigation systems so as to provide year round access to water to grow essential vegetables, so children and adults do not suffer from a lack of food security during the dry season.</b></p>
<p>The group has been put together by Tarphon, a Jewish community leader who recently came to Israel with the help of Rabbi Riskin (Chief Rabbi of Efrat and Chancellor of the Ohr Torah Stone Organization) to study and forge stronger connections with Israel and the Jewish World.  </p>
<p><b>We hope to share this knowledge and experience with communities in the Putti Village region, which includes Muslims and Christian communities.   We hope this project will become a model for Jewish, Christian, and Muslim inter-faith cooperation. </b><br/></p>

<h3><b><u>THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF UGANDA</u></b></h3>
<p>For nearly a century, a small group of Ugandans have been practising Judaism. These are the descendants and followers of Semei Kakungulu, a charismatic political leader, who broke from the Christian church and began adhering to the Old Testament.  The community is called Abaydaya, which means ‘People of Judah’.  </p>
<p>We encourage you to learn more about their inspiring history and read about how this isolated community suffered under Idi Amin’s forced conversions but ultimately found their way back to Judaism and rebuild the community following Amin’s devastating reign.</p>

<h3><b><u>OUR GOAL</u></b></h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is simple: we aim to raise the funds necessary to build a model farm to help local farmers improve their agricultural techniques and discover solutions to some local challenges.</p>
<p>Together we can achieve this goal - we are looking to raise the modest amount of<b> $10,000 </b>to start financing the pilot project.  The entire project will cost approximately $120,000 over the course of 4 years, but we need the $10,000 to get started by sending Myron Sofer to Uganda to see the reality on the ground and start on construction.  We hope to get the rest of the money through grants once we have kickstarted the project.</p>
<p>Farmers in the region face unique agricultural challenges and a program must be calibrated to fully and sensitively meet local needs and circumstances to ensure viability and sustainability of the project. Local and Israeli agricultural scientists will use funds from this campaign to teach the small holding farmers in the village and the surrounding areas more about sustainable and efficient agricultural methods suited to the region. Improved irrigation systems and techniques are key to this approach.</p>
<p><b>The pilot project will look to improve crop production and irrigation techniques so farmers will be able to store water from the rainy season and water vegetables during the dry seasons, improving their overall yields.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><u>THE IMPACT</u></b></h3>
<p>Working with international experts, we expect to raise the standard of living by lessening some of the economic hardships that farmers in the area currently face. We expect that enhanced food security for the community will be a direct benefit.</p>
<p><b>But it’s important to consider just how broad the impact of this campaign, and your contribution, can be. We anticipate that other areas of communal life will benefit as greater access to food leads to improved health and improved farming techniques lead to higher standards of living.</b> In particular, improved irrigation techniques will enable those particularly vulnerable, such as children and pregnant women, to eat healthy year round, and will significantly alleviate the suffering currently endured during dry seasons.</p>
<p>Moreover, this pilot project may have been formed with the direct involvement of Jewish community leadership, but the goal is to share the knowledge and experience with the surrounding communities as well. The communities around the Putti Village include Jews, Muslims, and Christians.  </p>
<p>This project has the potential to become a shining example of Jewish, Christian and Muslim cooperation. </p>
<h3><b><u>OTHER WAYS TO BE INVOLVED</u></b></h3>
<p>The $10,000 raised will be used to finance the pilot project and this is an important part of the support necessary to improve the health and wellbeing of the Putti Village Region.</p>
<p>But there are other ways to be involved as well! We look forward to hearing from people interested in sharing their knowledge, expertise and passion. Please get in touch. Some of the skill sets that could help make this project a success, include:  grant writing, agriculture, environment, Africa, Jewish studies, or fundraising!</p>

from Alberta to refineries in the US, just when—because of global warming—we
should be cutting back on carbon fuel consumption. Environmentalists want
to stop the project and slow use of the fossil fuels, especially more carbon-intensive ones like tar sands.  The local and regional effects of mining Alberta's tar sands deposits are less well

</div></div>","Truth About Tar Sands Oil 
and the Keystone XL Pipeline News Flash: On July 28 a Washington-based Journalism group offered to match the next $3,000 in donations. (Read press release.) By one week later, we'd earned the entire matching gift. Our ProjectWe are Alex MacLean, an aerial photographer and Dan Grossman,
a science journalist. We're experienced environmental journalists, teamed
up to offer images, descriptions and research on the pollution of rural Alberta
by big oil's tar-sands development.     You probably have heard that the
proposed Keystone XL pipeline would carry almost a million barrels a day of oil
from Alberta to refineries in the US, just when—because of global warming—we
should be cutting back on carbon fuel consumption. Environmentalists want
to stop the project and slow use of the fossil fuels, especially more carbon-intensive ones like tar sands.  The local and regional effects of mining Alberta's tar sands deposits are less well
known. 









     Mining companies are disturbing vast tracts of Alberta's virgin forests and peat bogs in their rush to turn a swamp of gooey subterranean oil into billions of petri dollars—never mind the thousands of tons of carbon waste they're putting in the atmosphere and millions of tons of toxic industrial waste they're leaving on the ground. Whether or not the XL Pipeline is approved, energy companies say they're determined to export  tar sands oil to the US and elsewhere on an incredible scale.  
     Help us tell the truth about tar sands oil. Help us tell the stories of stories of people like Kevin Marcel, a Native American in village of Fort Chipewayan. As an employee  in tar sands mines, Kevin digs up the forests and marshes where he once hunted and fished (see video below).
                   
     We spent a week in Alberta last
April, in collaboration with the Pulitzer Center
on Crisis Reporting, GlobalPost and
the GroundTruth Project. Our preliminary photos and writing have now come out
in GlobalPost,
the Huffington Post, Fast Company Co.Exist and the DeSmog Canada,
among other online publications. We've received tens of thousands of
""likes,"" and thousands of ""retweets""—many people are using
our materials to spread the word.
     Our
work is not complete and we need your help. We're doing further documentation
by reporting again and taking more photographs in Alberta, in September. Here's
why: What aerial photos reveal depends on the season. Spring snows on our prior
reporting trip helped us put on public display the astounding private network
of clear cuts made in advance of future mines. Stack gases stood out in
April's cool temperatures



     If we can photograph the same land with leaves on the trees and vegetation on the  ground, we'll have a powerful side-by side demonstration of intact as well as cleared  forest. We also will spend more time on the ground, reporting about ailing wildlife, broken indigenous communities. We'll meet more indigenous people, like Alice Rigney a Fort Chipewayan elder of the Dene band (see video below).

     We'll learn more about the scientific research now underway on tar sands impacts. We'll meet more people like Doctor John O'Connor, who discovered an unusual cluster of a rare cancer of the bile duct downstream of the tar sands mines (see video below).

     With your help, still
more people will learn the truth about how close to you is tar sand development
in far-off Alberta. You can help to preserve Alberta's forests and wildlife,
and the lifestyle of indigenous people under siege by mining companies. Our work
in Alberta documenting the local and regional effects of tar sands oil, could
slow fossil fuel production, which scientists say must be stopped to avoid
catastrophic climate change.


     It costs about
$250 an hour to rent a plane in Alberta. Accommodations in the tar sands
capital, Fort McMurray, are expensive. Your donation will help us go on with
our project. Hundreds of thousands of people have already seen our photos and
read our posts. With your help even more will learn about the destructiveness
of tar sands oil development, both locally and on the global scale.

also offer donors special online access to our reporting and, depending on the
size of the donation, physical products of our work.

How Will Alex and Dan Spend the Money They Raise?

The funds requested are for expenses only, including airfare to Canada, prop-plane rental, auto rental, food and accommodations. If they raise more money than they need to accomplish their mission in Alberta, they will apply the excess funds to a future trip to the Texas Gulf Coast, where they will report on refining of tar sands oil.
What if Alex and Dan Don't Reach Their Goal?


If Alex and Dan do not reach their
full goal, they seek supplemental funds from past supporters. If, they are not
far from the funding goal they will economize. If, after seeking supplemental
funds, they have reached less than half of their goal, they will return

<h3><b>Help us bring down-to-earth indigenous wisdom and unconditional love to the Parliament of The World's Religions</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Maori, Mayan, Ojibwe, and Hopi elders are coming together to
speak to thousands about the simple and necessary wisdom they share.  We link into a divine source and carry a sacred trust
with all of life on planet Earth.  With
the power of unconditional love, we can heal our one family.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Project</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Kia'ora te whanau ('Hello dear family' in Maori),</p>
<p>Aanii (Greetings, in Ojibwe),</p>
<p>We are medicine carriers, wisdom bearers, spiritual elders,
grandmothers from different indigenous tribes around Papatuanuku our Earth
Mother, and we come together now with your blessing in this time of our planet
and our humanity's big transition into a global family —
to pray, to make ceremony, to listen, to sing, and, throughout all of it, to
remind each other that we are one human family, all races, creeds, and ways included; that we are one with the Earth, with her waters, her winds, and her
mountains. We, humanity, are caretakers of this planet and its multitude of
flying, running, and swimming living creatures, all of whom are our kin. </p>
<p>We were all called to come speak out for future lifetimes across
the planet - just as you can yourself. 
All of our traditions - Maori, Ojibwe, Hopi, Mayan, Sufi, perhaps yours - express the
same sacred truth: that we are one world family.  All of us travel and teach in our own right,
but we stop now to come together for the need of us all.</p>
<p><b>We have been invited to the Parliament Of the World’s
Religions</b>, where we have been asked to speak to over ten thousand people of all faiths.  The Parliament has been meeting since
1893 and is the greatest interfaith forum we have to share this message with leaders from around the world.  As the world is now changing
rapidly, 2015 is a very auspicious year. 
</p>
<p>We have been invited to offer many sessions.  We will hold Healing Services and Ceremonies
for the Earth every day.  We will speak
in four plenary sessions (the entire Parliament Body) as well as three other scheduled programs, and we will
reach thousands.  They want us to present
our message.</p>
<p>We need your help.  Our
admissions are covered, and partial plane fares.  We need hotel rooms for one week, as we are not
young.  We need to eat.  The rest of our airfares need to be
covered.  And we need transportation to
and from the events.</p>
<p><b>Devi tells the story of how this journey came about:</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F0luh80URYf8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0luh80URYf8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0luh80URYf8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></p>
<h3><b>Why Are We Doing This?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our journey of coming together was instigated by Dr. Rangimarie Turuki Rose Pere, Maori Tuhuna (reincarnated spiritual elder), who asked Devi Tide to
travel amongst different indigenous tribes of the planet to reach out in oneness
for the sake of wisdom, and for the sake of encouraging our coming together in a time
when humanity needs all the wisdom it can get.</span></p>
<p>The Maori have a saying: ""Everyone included, no one
left behind.”  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And that's the
message, each of us having our rightful place in life, standing in our own
wisdom and power, and as Ojibwe Grandmother Mary Lyons likes to say: ""Living in harmony with the 'We'."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></p>
<h3><b>Here's The Point</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
In many indigenous
traditions, there are prophecies of a time of birthing, of a time of awakening
in the world. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will all make this transition.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Each person must believe that the small actions they make in harmony with the whole are really making a difference. </span></p>
<p><i> ""We have to do
everything that we possibly can to help people remember that they are both
celestial and terrestrial beings, and that we are actually one big family. We
link directly in with our mother, Earth Mother Papatuanuku, and
so for us we embrace all colors, ok? People of all colors and nations –we
do not separate anyone. And the other thing that we expect all people to do is
to care for all of Earth Mother’s progeny, the
best way we possibly can –our kin that swim, our kin that creep
and fly –all that."" </i></p>
<p>  -  Dr. Rangimarie Turuki Rose Pere, Maori Tohunga, Invited Major Speaker at the 2015 Parliament of World's Religions</p>
<p>Please help us share this message of remembering our covenant
with all of life. </p>

***With Deepest Of Gratitude for you and for all of life***
Devi Tide, Chris Akbar Miller, Mary Lyons, Jessica Bromby, Pershali Ami, Eila Paul, and all of us working on this project. 

Help us bring down-to-earth indigenous wisdom and unconditional love to the Parliament of The World's Religions

Maori, Mayan, Ojibwe, and Hopi elders are coming together to
speak to thousands about the simple and necessary wisdom they share.  We link into a divine source and carry a sacred trust
with all of life on planet Earth.  With
the power of unconditional love, we can heal our one family.


Our Project

Kia'ora te whanau ('Hello dear family' in Maori),
Aanii (Greetings, in Ojibwe),
We are medicine carriers, wisdom bearers, spiritual elders,
grandmothers from different indigenous tribes around Papatuanuku our Earth
Mother, and we come together now with your blessing in this time of our planet
and our humanity's big transition into a global family —
to pray, to make ceremony, to listen, to sing, and, throughout all of it, to
remind each other that we are one human family, all races, creeds, and ways included; that we are one with the Earth, with her waters, her winds, and her
mountains. We, humanity, are caretakers of this planet and its multitude of
flying, running, and swimming living creatures, all of whom are our kin. 
We were all called to come speak out for future lifetimes across
the planet - just as you can yourself. 
All of our traditions - Maori, Ojibwe, Hopi, Mayan, Sufi, perhaps yours - express the
same sacred truth: that we are one world family.  All of us travel and teach in our own right,
but we stop now to come together for the need of us all.
We have been invited to the Parliament Of the World’s
Religions, where we have been asked to speak to over ten thousand people of all faiths.  The Parliament has been meeting since
1893 and is the greatest interfaith forum we have to share this message with leaders from around the world.  As the world is now changing
rapidly, 2015 is a very auspicious year. 

We have been invited to offer many sessions.  We will hold Healing Services and Ceremonies
for the Earth every day.  We will speak
in four plenary sessions (the entire Parliament Body) as well as three other scheduled programs, and we will
reach thousands.  They want us to present
our message.
We need your help.  Our
admissions are covered, and partial plane fares.  We need hotel rooms for one week, as we are not
young.  We need to eat.  The rest of our airfares need to be
covered.  And we need transportation to
and from the events.
Devi tells the story of how this journey came about:


Why Are We Doing This?

Our journey of coming together was instigated by Dr. Rangimarie Turuki Rose Pere, Maori Tuhuna (reincarnated spiritual elder), who asked Devi Tide to
travel amongst different indigenous tribes of the planet to reach out in oneness
for the sake of wisdom, and for the sake of encouraging our coming together in a time
when humanity needs all the wisdom it can get.
The Maori have a saying: ""Everyone included, no one
left behind.”  And that's the
message, each of us having our rightful place in life, standing in our own
wisdom and power, and as Ojibwe Grandmother Mary Lyons likes to say: ""Living in harmony with the 'We'."" 

Here's The Point


In many indigenous
traditions, there are prophecies of a time of birthing, of a time of awakening
in the world. We will all make this transition.  Each person must believe that the small actions they make in harmony with the whole are really making a difference. 
 ""We have to do
everything that we possibly can to help people remember that they are both
celestial and terrestrial beings, and that we are actually one big family. We
link directly in with our mother, Earth Mother Papatuanuku, and
so for us we embrace all colors, ok? People of all colors and nations –we
do not separate anyone. And the other thing that we expect all people to do is
to care for all of Earth Mother’s progeny, the
best way we possibly can –our kin that swim, our kin that creep
and fly –all that."" 
  -  Dr. Rangimarie Turuki Rose Pere, Maori Tohunga, Invited Major Speaker at the 2015 Parliament of World's Religions
Please help us share this message of remembering our covenant
with all of life.

At WVG the WWOOFERs could also take relax from their hectic WWOOFING farm
schedule and expected only to work just 3-4 hours daily and are free for lot of
sight seeing and travel to places of tourist interest so that they become close
to experience the Indian historical and cultural background which they can take
back home . The project work for first such WGV has started recently and WWOOF </span><span style=""color: rgb(23, 54, 93); font-family: 'Arial Narrow', sans-serif;""> has donated 4.5 Acres of land for this

various clusters of villages in development of organic agriculture, education for
children, local handicrafts and other village developmental activities. People
will stay in the traditional family homes with the family and eat delicious traditional
food . The Ultimate goal of the WGV would be to regenerate soil, conserve
water, raise the water table, work along â€œNatural Farmingâ€ methods towards a
model of self-sufficiency on all fronts.</span><span style=""line-height: 115%; color: rgb(0, 112, 192);""></span></font></p><p></p><p></p>

have to start work for the nursery for vegetables for which we have to construct
shaded beds. We have plans for setting up a co-operative with organic farmers
from our area for exchanging knowledge, organic seeds and plan to sell and
transport produce together  creating a model
of an integrated sustainable farming community. We aim to structure and develop
our work so that it is accessible to a wider group of local people. The long term
goal is to become a recognized research center in sustainability practices by
providing workshops in alternative agricultural practices, food processing and
preparation, alternative energy, eco-building, community exploration, and

and community member do not have any other job, they purchase food from
local market at very high cost. The trees are been cut down for agricultural
purposes but the main threat is the use of wood as the primary fuel source for
local families. Village Surajpura  is a
fairly isolated settlement and as such there is need for skill development for local
craft expertise. The villagers can take up handicraft related activity as a
additional source of income which could be easily sold to large number of
tourist visiting Khajuraho every year. Local crafts in the areas are carpentry,
masonry, bamboo craft, pottery to name few</span></font></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","WWOOF INDIA  , GLOBAL
VILLAGE ( WGV) Project Khajuraho,  MP
state , .
 WWOOF 
has plans up in its sleeves to expand the scope and reach of its activities in
the days ahead. Even as it plans to expand the scope of its current
initiatives, we are proposing to set up WWOOF GLOBAL VILLAGES (WGVs).  WWOOF 
plans to set up 4 such WGV s across the country that would serve as meeting
point for WWOOFERS in .  The main objective of WGV is that the Indian
WOOFERS could meet each other here and share their WWOOFING experience in .
At WVG the WWOOFERs could also take relax from their hectic WWOOFING farm
schedule and expected only to work just 3-4 hours daily and are free for lot of
sight seeing and travel to places of tourist interest so that they become close
to experience the Indian historical and cultural background which they can take
back home . The project work for first such WGV has started recently and WWOOF  has donated 4.5 Acres of land for this
project at Village Surajpura near World famous Khajuraho temple town in MP
adjacent to the  and Panna Tiger Reserve.
The proposed WGV in long run would function, evolving into a
model of sustainability using traditional knowledge and cultural practices.  This would closely work with the farmers in
various clusters of villages in development of organic agriculture, education for
children, local handicrafts and other village developmental activities. People
will stay in the traditional family homes with the family and eat delicious traditional
food . The Ultimate goal of the WGV would be to regenerate soil, conserve
water, raise the water table, work along â€œNatural Farmingâ€ methods towards a
model of self-sufficiency on all fronts.

About WGV Khajuraho ( MP )  
WWOOF 
has already purchased the land needed for setting up WWOOF GLOBAL VILLAGE and fencing
around the land is completed . Now work is in progress for build mud huts for
volunteers , we are planning to plant 250 different types of fruit trees of. We
have to start work for the nursery for vegetables for which we have to construct
shaded beds. We have plans for setting up a co-operative with organic farmers
from our area for exchanging knowledge, organic seeds and plan to sell and
transport produce together  creating a model
of an integrated sustainable farming community. We aim to structure and develop
our work so that it is accessible to a wider group of local people. The long term
goal is to become a recognized research center in sustainability practices by
providing workshops in alternative agricultural practices, food processing and
preparation, alternative energy, eco-building, community exploration, and
personal development, as well as documenting our work in natural farming and
permaculture by involving  WWOOFers
coming to India.  
Present situation in the area : Due to continuous drought like situation for last 6 years due
to climate change , crops  are badly damaged
farmers have lost their crops severely , local families suffer badly 
and community member do not have any other job, they purchase food from
local market at very high cost. The trees are been cut down for agricultural
purposes but the main threat is the use of wood as the primary fuel source for
local families. Village Surajpura  is a
fairly isolated settlement and as such there is need for skill development for local
craft expertise. The villagers can take up handicraft related activity as a
additional source of income which could be easily sold to large number of
tourist visiting Khajuraho every year. Local crafts in the areas are carpentry,
masonry, bamboo craft, pottery to name few

Come and join us in building the WWOOF GLOBAL VILLAGE : 
Expectations from volunteers
â€“ To
complete the project , help is needed financial and physical both, The
volunteers staying here would be expected to work using local material,
alternative construction with low cost technology,  build mud huts, toilet construction, water
harvesting tanks, eco development, teaching English to children , help family
in cooking , house management. .Communicating with local villagers,
participating in local festivals, religious 
celebration, social events, school program, enjoy life with other  WWOOFERS , living tranquility  with the nature, building check dam for water
harvesting,  bunding and planting tree,
creating  the jungle garden,  working in the vegetable gardens, building a
composting structure etc 
Lodging & boarding: You can expect simple
& traditional but comfortable living as you stay at WGV Khajuraho project area. The WWOOFERS will stay with farm families
of the village till our basic infrastructure at the WGV becomes fully
functional.    We have kept in mind the
hygiene needs while planning for our guestsâ€™ requirements. As a guest you would
be provided with:
Food: Home cooked vegetarian food will be
served and it will be mostly from the ingredients grown locally .There is a
tradition of two main meals in Bundelkhand region of MP. One full meal late
morning around 9-10 am a followed by light evening tea around 4.00 & 5.00

village goes to sleep early. In other words you will share all the same
amenities as the family enjoy. Your only other expenses will be for personal
shopping when you go to the local market or on excursions on your own.
Cost: We would appreciate a little contribution towards food and stay
. Your 7 $  or 300 INR per day

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>We will build a cost effective solar water pump and system that will help improve the lives of 50 million people in developing countries. The solar pump is the key component of a complete water-to-crops irrigation system that is being designed by leading experts in the fields of irrigation, systems engineering, and solar energy. Using a method proven by Paul Polak, the system will be sold to farmers in some of the poorest regions in the world, enabling the farmers themselves to break their poverty cycles. We have the designs, the prototypes, and the motivation. Now we need your help as we work to build a production model we can take to field tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Background</h2>
<p>Did you know that there are a billion people in the world that make just $2 a day? Can you imagine what your life would be like if you made less than $20 a week? The vast majority of the families who live this reality are farmers in the developing world with small plots of land. They work together to grow the food they eat and hope to sell in the market. They make just enough to survive and have difficulty investing in labor-saving equipment.</p>
<p>To break out of the poverty cycle, poor farmers need to grow cash crops to increase their income. Cash crops are crops above and beyond the farmers' needs, but growing them is a challenge. Many farmers pump water by hand or carry it in buckets from a village pond to their crops. Not only is this a slow and physically grueling task, but often times the shallow wells and seasonal rains mean farmers can't grow crops in the dry season. Farmers need a reliable, low-cost water pumping system to grow the extra food they need to make a poverty-busting profit.</p>
<p>Diesel pumps are one option, but they use expensive diesel fuel, break down often, exhaust carbon into the atmosphere, and are relatively expensive. Diesel pumps cost $500 to buy and $700 a year for fuel and maintenance. Over a three year span the costs can reach $2,600, assuming diesel prices don’t increase. Electric pumps are another option. They’re cheap, but they use grid power that is unreliable in developing countries like India. In fact, grid power is so unreliable that most farmers who have an electric pump have a backup diesel pump too. Electric pumps can alternatively be powered with solar energy, but current systems can cost $5,000 or more, which is way out of the reach of poor farmers.</p>

<p><em>Solar powered systems are available, but they are currently far too expensive for poor farmers.</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Plan</strong></h2>
<p>Our big-picture goal is to create the entire water-to-crops system. We are creating a pressurized irrigation system that brings water to a one-hectare plot with a cost target of $2,900. This cost includes well drilling, water storage, tubing, installation, and the solar pump itself. Our whole system will be cheaper than buying just the panels and pump in the current solar-powered systems! In our quest to make our solution as affordable as possible we have worked in India with craftsmen to improve well efficiencies and with manufacturers to lower irrigation equipment costs.</p>
<p>The much lower cost means farmers will be able to pay off the loans they use to purchase one in less than two years. Plus, there’s no fuel to buy. This game-changing reduction in cost will enable farmers to transform their small plot agriculture, create water markets where they don’t currently exist, and significantly increase their earnings. </p>
<p>The plan is to first sell them to farmers who make $3 to $5 a day who will be more likely to secure financing. When two or more of these pumps are in the same vicinity it creates a micro-market for excess water, creating opportunity for the poorer farmers. Selling a large number of these pumps over the next few years will also yield production efficiencies that can be used to lower prices even further so that more farmers can afford them. We know this works since we've seen it happen with our<strong> <a href=""http://www.paulpolak.com/html/design.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">foot-powered treadle pumps</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>What We Need</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>It's not just the panels and the pump, we're out to improve everything from drilling the well to the tubes that carry the water to the crops. To make this kind of price leap we need to do end-to-end system testing and optimization. </p>
<p><strong>Quarter Scale Test ($25,000):</strong> A few things happen in parallel at this level.</p>
<ol>
<li>We will build a 500 Watt system that will be our testing platform for all the different components. We will build the whole system out including the panels, a concentrator, inverter, pump, and the irrigation tubing.  </li>
<li>We will buy all the testing equipment, support hardware, and extra widgets that we need to make sure we're building the best system possible.</li>
<li>We will fund all the perks out of the first several thousand dollars.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these things have to happen at the same time!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing Phase ($10,000): </strong>If we raise this much more money then we will build a full scale version after we learn as much as possible from the quarter scale testing. There will still be some tweaking as we perfect the system. We will also start getting supply chains ready for bulk purchases so we can reduce costs on the final version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Test Phase ($15,000):</strong> Raising an additional $15,000 will let us field test the system! We will ship our best system and test it in the fields. Getting the system into the real world is incredibly important. If we can raise this much money we're well on our way to success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Final Tweaks Phase ($5,000):</strong> An extra $5,000 will let the team make any major changes required from field testing.</p>

When farmers can buy their own solar-powered pump a whole new avenue for securing their own financial security is opened.</p>
<p>We have a need. We have a solution. Now we need your help as we build it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why solar powered pumps?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Solar powered pumps don’t use diesel fuel, they rarely break down, and when they do they can be repaired easily. This system has very low operating costs compared to a diesel pump. Plus, they don’t create carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why are you using mirrors?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The single biggest cost in the sysytem is the solar panels. One panel can be several hundred dollars or more. A mirror is a few dollars and is widely available. By using a mirror to shine extra sunlight onto the panel we are increasing the energy output for a tiny fraction of what it would cost to buy another panel. Calculations show we can get the energy we need to run the pump with a set of these mirrors, saving thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why don’t you give these away for free? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Charity is a wonderful, and often necessary, act of giving that will always have a place in the world. However, long term solutions to large problems need to scale up rapidly and be able to support themselves. That means a commercial enterprise. If the solution is profitable it can generate the resources needed to reach hundreds of millions of people. SunWater will help farmers make more money, which will drive interest in other farmers buying their own pump, enabling the benefits to be provided to more and more people.</p>
<p>Paul Polak and the team have also found that solutions are more successful if farmers own the pump. When a poor village receives a free water pump it almost always falls into disrepair and disuse because there’s no ownership of it, even when water is one of their key problems. But when a poor farmer buys his own pump the results are vastly different: it stays well maintained, is used as effectively as possible, and creative ways of extending the benefits to the farmer are found. If we want to solve long term problems in a long-term way the poor need cost-effective solutions they can own instead of handouts on a sporadic basis.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How effective do you really think the project will be?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This matters on a large scale - we think we can install 1 million of our pumps in India in the first 10 years. This will reach 50 million people, raising millions of them out of poverty. In addition, through future extensions of the core technology, there will be the potential to turn millions of farmers into energy entrepreneurs, bringing solar electricity, household lighting, and cell phone charging to millions of rural households that will never connect to the grid. All this, plus we’ll reduce carbon emissions by replacing the diesel pumps with clean solar pumps. Paul Polak, Jacob Mathew, and Jack Keller have been working directly with the farmers for decades and understand what will work in the long run. They feel this is the kind of game changing project that can make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I’d like a little more detail on what these pumps are for and how you plan on making this work. Can you share more information?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are two key components to this project: develop and field test cost-effective solar powered pressurized irrigation systems and establish a commercial enterprise to promote their adoption by farmers in India.</p>
<p>Pumping surface or groundwater for irrigation is energy intensive and traditional photovoltaic (solar) powered irrigation systems can’t compete with fossil fueled surface irrigation systems. To make it work we have to minimize the energy requirements of crop irrigation. We will accomplish this by applying a systems approach for optimizing the series of water flow components from the water supply to the irrigated crops. The critical design tasks include: </p>
<ul>
<li>The well filter and screen must be designed to reduce drawdown.</li>
<li>The solar panel array, mirror concentrators, and pump mechanism must be optimized to produce pressurized water using the sun's energy.</li>
<li>The water distribution system must be optimized to increase the crop production per unit of irrigation water applied.</li>
</ul><p>Giving away the system will be ineffective in the long run; farmers must invest in the pumps in order to create the motivation that ownership brings. To do this, a commercial company will be established first in India and then in Africa. The business model will integrate solar-powered pumping systems with a package of services including financing (lease to own or loan), support for design, installation and operation/maintenance training, and farm advisory services to enhance farming enterprise profitability.</p>
<p><img alt=""Paul Polak and his team have previously made drip irrigation more affordable for poor farmers.

<p><em>Paul Polak and his team have previously made drip irrigation more affordable for poor farmers. Drip irrigation is more effective than using sprinklers or flooding techniques.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How is the proposed technical solution sufficiently different from currently available technologies? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The pump will be much cheaper than available options, but it's not just the pump that will make this work. We're using our collective field experience with small plot irrigation in Asia to create an end-to-end system specifically designed to help poor farmers irrigate their crops. We are taking a zero-based design approach to the problem, improving the whole process of irrigating crops with no limiting preconceptions. </p>
<p>It’s worth noting that solar powered pumping systems with water delivery similar to five horsepower engine pumps are being promoted in India, but they require subsidies of up to 86% to make them attractive. Subsidies are costly and practically impossible for small plot farmers to obtain.</p>

The Goal
We will build a cost effective solar water pump and system that will help improve the lives of 50 million people in developing countries. The solar pump is the key component of a complete water-to-crops irrigation system that is being designed by leading experts in the fields of irrigation, systems engineering, and solar energy. Using a method proven by Paul Polak, the system will be sold to farmers in some of the poorest regions in the world, enabling the farmers themselves to break their poverty cycles. We have the designs, the prototypes, and the motivation. Now we need your help as we work to build a production model we can take to field tests.
 
The Background
Did you know that there are a billion people in the world that make just $2 a day? Can you imagine what your life would be like if you made less than $20 a week? The vast majority of the families who live this reality are farmers in the developing world with small plots of land. They work together to grow the food they eat and hope to sell in the market. They make just enough to survive and have difficulty investing in labor-saving equipment.
To break out of the poverty cycle, poor farmers need to grow cash crops to increase their income. Cash crops are crops above and beyond the farmers' needs, but growing them is a challenge. Many farmers pump water by hand or carry it in buckets from a village pond to their crops. Not only is this a slow and physically grueling task, but often times the shallow wells and seasonal rains mean farmers can't grow crops in the dry season.

<p>Every year, thousands of the most intelligent creatures that inhabit our oceans are savagely and needlessly killed in a small town in Japan named Taiji. If you’ve seen the 2009 documentary The Cove, you’re already familiar with this. What many of you may not know is that, in Taiji, the cove still runs red every year between the months of September and February. Hundreds of dolphins, porpoises, and whales have already lost their lives this season.</p>
<p>My name is Micah and I am a volunteer with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Here at home in Seattle, Washington, I’ve been educating the public about Taiji. On September 1<sup>st</sup>, we took the fight to the doors of the Japanese consulate in downtown Seattle. Now it’s time to bring the fight to the shores of Japan. </p>
<p>If you can find it in your ability to donate, know that it makes a difference.</p>
<p>Not everyone can go to Taiji, but everyone can help. The dolphins need your help, Sea Shepherd needs your help, I need your help.</p>
<p>My name is Micah Rowland and I will be a Cove Guardian.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Change at Taiji can only come from within Japan. What goes on in Taiji is not widely reported in Japan and the presence of Cove Guardians creates an awareness to the dolphin slaughter that the media and the Japanese people and the world cannot ignore. The more Cove Guardians we have, the more photos, videos, and information can come out of Taiji. The more Cove Guardians, the bigger the news story, the bigger the reach.</p>
<p>If your response is overwhelming and we raise more than what I personally require, any excesses will help defray the cost of other Sea Shepherd volunteers that join the effort at Taiji this year.</p>
<h2><strong>What I Need</strong></h2>
<p>Traveling to Taiji is not cheap. Between flight, lodging, transportation, and other expenses, a two week visit from Seattle costs an average of $5000. I’ve broken out my projected expenses so you can see where your money will go. Not a single dollar raised will go into the economy of the city of Taiji. </p>
<h2><strong>Funds Breakdown</strong></h2>
<p>A 14-day trip estimate breaks down as follows</p>
<p>Flight - Seattle to Osaka - $1117</p>
<p>Lodging - $1469</p>
<p>Car Rental - $1518</p>
<p>Food - $653</p>
<p>Misc - $243</p>
<p>I've also built in the IndieGoGo fees so that the funds after they take their cut are sufficient.</p>
<h2><strong>Donation Gifts</strong></h2>
<p>In appreciation for your donations, I've designed a collection of gifts available at specific donation levels. Gifts are cumulative up to the $50 level. That means if you donate $25. you'll get the button and wristband and at $50, you'll get the patch, button, and wristband!</p>

<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you can't donate, you can still help. Tell your friends about this fundraising site. Forward them the video so they can get involved.</p>
<p>Subscribe to the @SeaShepherd twitter feed to keep tabs on live happenings in Taiji. Talk to everyone you know about what is going on and especially to any acquaintances in Japan, as the Japanese people are the only ones with the power to persuade their government to end this senseless slaughter.</p>
<p>Also, support Sea Shepherd directly. Your donations help Sea Shepherd enforce conservation laws that governments of the world can not or will not enforce themselves.</p>
<h2><strong>Non-Tax-Deductible Donation Information</strong></h2>
<p>To keep operating costs at a minimum Sea Shepherd volunteers are not paid. Due to legal requirements governing non-profit organizations, Sea Shepherd is not allowed to directly raise funds for individual Cove Guardians and we are therefore responsible for all personal fundraising.

<h3>Our Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hi-my name is Maria and I am the group leader of the Citizens Climate Lobby -Santa Fe group. I've been a climate activist since I saw Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth back in 2006. Last year, I had the privilege of attending Gore's Climate Reality Leadership Training Conference and became a CRP Leader. At that conference, I met the people from Citizens Climate Lobby. Dedicated to creating the political will (no small feat) for a stable climate, CCL organizes through grassroots citizen advocacy groups. There are over 70 groups across the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Having been a climate activist since 2006, I agree with Marshal Saunders (CCL founder) that in order to get the change we need, we need to change the behavior of Congress and not just individuals. I eagerly jumped on board the CCL train and began the Santa Fe group.</p>
<p>CCL is an organization made up of amazing and optimistic people. Often citizens view their elected officials with cynicism and disdain. If we expect so little, that is exactly what we will get.  CCL believes that politicians don't create political will, they respond to it. We believe that if we articulate, we can be dangerous to ignorance and apathy.</p>
<p>While others have said it's not possible, we've been successful in elevating the discussion about a carbon fee on the fossil fuel industry and a return (rebate) of that money to the American people. Getting legislation at the Federal level is crucial in our fight to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Pricing carbon wil stimulate and energize the renewable energy sector, helping create a speedy transition to a strong economy based on clean energy.</p>
</div>
<div>In June we have an international CCL conference, <em>Creating a Climate for Change</em>, and lobbying event in DC. All attendees are responsible for paying their own way. Our Santa Fe group is short on funds to attend that meeting. We hope to raise at least $1000 to offset the cost (airfare, hotel, transportation)of getting a couple of our members there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We know that the relationships we form at this event, and the collaboration between groups across the US and Canada, all working on the same goal will be invaluable to help us grow as a group.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We can learn from our counterparts without reinventing the wheel, and with climate change is bearing down on us, we don't have time to waste.</div>

<h2><span><strong>What We Do</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>Show Me Green Coal has identified ways to transform waste material from urban and rural communities (or <em>biomass</em> for a more scientific term) into “torrefied” products, sometimes referred to as green coal. Green coal brings environmentally friendly solutions to a number of industries, useful in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>As a soil amendment — includes farming, lawn and garden and golf course management applications;  </span></li>
<li><span>In the plastics industry — for use as a low-cost filler but with additional product attributes such as the ability to repel water;  </span></li>
<li><span>As activated charcoal — it can be used to remove pollutants (e.g. sequestration of mercury) from the air (e.g. smoke stacks in coal plants) and/or from municipal water treatment facilities; and</span></li>
<li><span>As a sustainable source of energy — used in the form of pellets for wood stoves, as a substitute for coal in utility plants,  and/or as a way to power generators used on farms and in small commercial operations.</span></li>

<p><span>Joel has both a Bachelor of Science Degree in Agricultural Economics and a Master’s Degree in Horticulture and Forestry from Kansas State University.  His background includes numerous partnerships with real estate and land development companies in the Midwest — bringing together his expertise in both business operations and land management. Joel served as company commander in combat operations in the United States Marine Corps and was awarded the Bronze star and Purple Heart for his actions.</span></p>
<p><span>It takes a village to start a revolution. Here is a list of experts who are on their team to make this project work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>D.E. Shinn, PE, Overland Park, Kansas - Engineering</span></li>
<li><span>Polsinelli Shugart, Kansas City, Missouri - Legal</span></li>
<li><span>Bill Arthaud - Government Affairs</span></li>

<li><span>Bill Taylor, Taylor and Company LLC -  Business Advisor</span></li>
<li>Jay Lang, CFO, LifeLine Foods</li>
</ul>
<h2><span><strong>We Need You!</strong></span></h2>
<p>The company’s ultimate goal is to develop a biomass torrefaction production facility in the midwest (for starters)  that will employ more than 60 workers with an estimated payroll of $2.5 million dollars. Besides generating electrical and thermal power, the torrefied biomass and biochar products produced at the facility will be used in a variety of ways including as a soil amendment, in the plastics and polymer industries and as pellets to be used as a clean burning energy source.</p>
<p>We have invested our own personal funds and received one state grant.  Yet our start-up expenses continue to mount. We need to raise at least $15,000 to help with the legal, admin and research fees necessary to get us to the next level. </p>
<p><em>If we keep doing what we’re doing we’ll keep getting what we’ve got. Isn’t it time to try something new?</em></p>
<p><span>If you want to be a part of the green revolution and change the way America thinks about energy, you can!  No matter how much you contribute — a little or a lot — you become a catalyst for change. Thank you in advance for your help and support. We look forward to hearing from you.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>Other Ways to Make a Difference</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>There are other ways you can help. Here are two simple things you can do:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The old fashioned way — tell your like-minded friends about us! Give them this link; or</span></li>

Joel and Jim, the founders of Show Me Green Coal, were born and raised in Missouri and have extensive knowledge of land and land uses, connections in rural farming communities, business experience, and a passion for sustainable energy.
Founded in 2009, Show Me Green Coal has been doing research and feasibility studies to discover the best technology and the best site to launch their dream — a plant to manufacture and market torrefied biochar.
Jim Downey, Co-founder
Jim has a proven track record of business development and execution in both domestic and global environments. He is owner and manager of James Downy Appraisal, specializing in appraising agricultural properties. He has extensive knowledge of the land and the farming community in northwest Missouri. Jim received his Bachelor of Science degree from Missouri Western State College, and has served with the United States Marine Corps. 
Joel Brummel, Co-founder
Joel has both a Bachelor of Science Degree in Agricultural Economics and a Master’s Degree in Horticulture and Forestry from Kansas State University.  His background includes numerous partnerships with real estate and land development companies in the Midwest — bringing together his expertise in both business operations and land management. Joel served as company commander in combat operations in the United States Marine Corps and was awarded the Bronze star and Purple Heart for his actions.
It takes a village to start a revolution. Here is a list of experts who are on their team to make this project work:

D.E. Shinn, PE, Overland Park, Kansas - Engineering
Polsinelli Shugart, Kansas City, Missouri - Legal
Bill Arthaud - Government Affairs

Hagen & Partners, Leawood, Kansas - Marketing & Community Relations
Bill Taylor, Taylor and Company LLC -  Business Advisor
Jay Lang, CFO, LifeLine Foods

We Need You!
The company’s ultimate goal is to develop a biomass torrefaction production facility in the midwest (for starters)  that will employ more than 60 workers with an estimated payroll of $2.5 million dollars. Besides generating electrical and thermal power, the torrefied biomass and biochar products produced at the facility will be used in a variety of ways including as a soil amendment, in the plastics and polymer industries and as pellets to be used as a clean burning energy source.
We have invested our own personal funds and received one state grant.  Yet our start-up expenses continue to mount. We need to raise at least $15,000 to help with the legal, admin and research fees necessary to get us to the next level. 
If we keep doing what we’re doing we’ll keep getting what we’ve got. Isn’t it time to try something new?
If you want to be a part of the green revolution and change the way America thinks about energy, you can!  No matter how much you contribute — a little or a lot — you become a catalyst for change. Thank you in advance for your help and support. We look forward to hearing from you.

<p style="""">Sarah Wilson and Luca Budello created Shallow Waters in early 2011. Our backgrounds in conservation, environmental science, scuba diving and science communication came together in the development of this community focused coral reef conservation project. </p>

<p style=""""><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2 style=""""><strong>Our Method.</strong></h2>
<p style="""">Over the past five years we have personally experienced the massive decline in the availability of academic funding for independent science and conservation projects such as ours. Having directly benefitted from volunteer conservation work ourselves, and knowing the difference that practical experience makes to your personal development, skills sets (and your CV!), we decided the best possible method for everyone involved was to fund our research in the long term through volunteer research assistants. </p>
<p style=""""><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2 style=""""><strong>The Impact.</strong></h2>
<p style="""">The area around Koh Sdach is currently being developed as one of 'the next big' tourist destinations in Cambodia and already there are noticeable impacts from the mainland such as sediment run off from deforestation into the ocean. These fast growing tourist developments added to the ongoing problems of overfishing, illegal fishing methods and a lack of refuse disposal systems means the local coral reefs and fish stocks are under serious threat. </p>
<p style=""""> </p>
<p style="""">Both the local and national governments are aware and supportive of the need to develop in an environmentally and socially conscious way. However, the countries lack of funds and in-country NGO's focussed on the needs of marine management means that groups such as Shallow Waters are well placed to fill an important gap in this process.</p>

<h2><strong>The nitty gritty...</strong></h2>
<p style="""">We are looking to raise $10,000 to complete the second phase of our operations, these funds will be used to set up and develop our key project areas:</p>
<p style=""""> </p>
<p style="""">1. Community education and youth projects, this will include presentations at the local school, snorkelling lessons, beach clean ups and creative workshops.</p>

<p style=""""> </p>
<p style="""">3. Stakeholder workshops: in order to create a community fishery organisation, workshops that bring together the fishermen and other stakeholders of Koh Sdach to allow open discussion, awareness and cooperation are vital. This will create the foundation for submitting an application to the regional Fishery Cantonment for creating a recognised community fishery organisation.

He will be 13 this year, and has outgrown his Mario themed bedroom. This is so important to me and to him, because that stupid bed of his literally falls apart at the seams.

<b><span><strong>WHY THE REVOLUTION?</strong></span></b><br/>At the last Green Gathering lots of people asked<i>""Why is a Green festival still hiring plastic, chemical-flush loos?""  </i>and <i>""Please can we have more compost loos?"" </i><br/><br/>This year, the answer is YES, we can have more compost loos. We've made a commitment to increase the 
proportion of compost loos, but it's going to cost <br/>A WHOLE LOT MORE than if we
 hired all plastic chemi-loos, because of the regs around storage and 
transport of poo, and because we don't own the land so we can't build permanent structures and will have to hire in flatpack 
loos.<b><br/><br/>WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?<br/>
<a href=""http://naturalevent.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Natural Event</a> </b>has
 agreed to sponsor us, to supply loos that meet the regulations, and to take 
away and compost our poo, all at a reduced rate because we are sooo 
Green... However, that reduced rate is still a hefty chunk of our festival budget.
 <br/><br/>We'd rather not divert funds from other areas of the festival, so we're asking everyone
 who feels passionate about switching to compost loos to help us make 
the transition by contributing to the <b>compost loo fund</b>!<b><br/>
<br/>
</b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376527/files/20150412081156-LOO_TOO.jpg?1428851516"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<strong>We've set up this crowdfunder and are hoping to raise £1000. If you'd like 
to see loos like those above instead of banks of blue plastic, please 
contribute. <br/>If you're one of the people who wrote ""MORE COMPOST LOOS"" on your feedback form - you know who you are and we love you!  Let's do this together.</strong><br/><br/><b>WHOSE FOOLHARDY IDEA WAS THIS?</b><br/>It was me, Em Weirdigan, newest Green Gathering director and arch champion of compost loos! I've spent many, many hours over the last 12 months persuading everyone at GG HQ that switching to compost loos should be a Green Gathering priority. Poo or art? Poo or music? Poo or solar panels? See, it's tough.<br/><br/>I talked everyone round in the end - I went on about poo so much that I was given free rein to go ahead and take up Natural Event's offer of sponsorship. This sponsorship has reduced the cost of the toilets, but we're still looking at considerably more money than we'd be paying for portable plastic loos, so I was also given a budget.<br/><br/>Woohoo! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the budget isn't quite enough to meet the costs of the loos. Hence this appeal to Green Gatherers, Green Gathering supporters and any random fellow arch-compost-loo-champions to help me out.<br/><br/>Every £1 will
 help, every £10 will take a weight off my shoulders, if anyone can 
afford more than that - wonderful! I'll kickstart the campaign myself with what I can afford to put in, because I really, really want this to happen.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376528/files/20150412081221-LOO.jpg?1428851541"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b>SOME BACKGROUND</b><br/>The Green Gathering is trying to do something authentic and different. It's run by a staunchly non-commercial CIC (Community Interest Company) and combines eco-activism, holistic wellbeing and education for sustainability, as well as all the usual shenanigans and tomfoolery of a festival. The Gathering is an annual long weekend of temporary community, network building and fun, with repercussions that go well beyond that one weekend on that one Welsh hillside.<br/><br/>We struggle to challenge the current capitalist system while necessarily having to engage with it in order to hold the festival. We do our best to keep ticket prices relatively low while creating a magical and inspiring experience for participants... and of course jumping through all the legal and licensing hoops required to hold a 5000-person event.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376532/files/20150412081303-GG_eve_glow_SH.jpg?1428851583"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Lots of wonderful people put huge amounts of time and energy into The Green Gathering, all year round in the planning and then in a tremendous burst of creative energy on site. Some people provide expertise and kit and get paid for that, generally at well below the going market rate. Many others volunteer, for the fun of it and because we know that every year, people's eyes are opened and lives transformed by this very special event. <br/><br/>The Green Gathering is not run to make a profit; if the event makes a surplus, we've pledged to put that into the Green Gathering Charity, which has an 'education for sustainability' remit.

This year, the answer is YES, we can have more compost loos. We've made a commitment to increase the 
proportion of compost loos, but it's going to cost A WHOLE LOT MORE than if we
 hired all plastic chemi-loos, because of the regs around storage and 
transport of poo, and because we don't own the land so we can't build permanent structures and will have to hire in flatpack 
loos.WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?
Natural Event has
 agreed to sponsor us, to supply loos that meet the regulations, and to take 
away and compost our poo, all at a reduced rate because we are sooo 
Green... However, that reduced rate is still a hefty chunk of our festival budget.
 We'd rather not divert funds from other areas of the festival, so we're asking everyone
 who feels passionate about switching to compost loos to help us make 
the transition by contributing to the compost loo fund!



We've set up this crowdfunder and are hoping to raise £1000. If you'd like 
to see loos like those above instead of banks of blue plastic, please 
contribute. If you're one of the people who wrote ""MORE COMPOST LOOS"" on your feedback form - you know who you are and we love you!  Let's do this together.WHOSE FOOLHARDY IDEA WAS THIS?It was me, Em Weirdigan, newest Green Gathering director and arch champion of compost loos! I've spent many, many hours over the last 12 months persuading everyone at GG HQ that switching to compost loos should be a Green Gathering priority. Poo or art? Poo or music? Poo or solar panels? See, it's tough.I talked everyone round in the end - I went on about poo so much that I was given free rein to go ahead and take up Natural Event's offer of sponsorship. This sponsorship has reduced the cost of the toilets, but we're still looking at considerably more money than we'd be paying for portable plastic loos, so I was also given a budget.Woohoo! Unfortunately, the budget isn't quite enough to meet the costs of the loos. Hence this appeal to Green Gatherers, Green Gathering supporters and any random fellow arch-compost-loo-champions to help me out.Every £1 will
 help, every £10 will take a weight off my shoulders, if anyone can 
afford more than that - wonderful! I'll kickstart the campaign myself with what I can afford to put in, because I really, really want this to happen.
SOME BACKGROUNDThe Green Gathering is trying to do something authentic and different. It's run by a staunchly non-commercial CIC (Community Interest Company) and combines eco-activism, holistic wellbeing and education for sustainability, as well as all the usual shenanigans and tomfoolery of a festival. The Gathering is an annual long weekend of temporary community, network building and fun, with repercussions that go well beyond that one weekend on that one Welsh hillside.We struggle to challenge the current capitalist system while necessarily having to engage with it in order to hold the festival. We do our best to keep ticket prices relatively low while creating a magical and inspiring experience for participants... and of course jumping through all the legal and licensing hoops required to hold a 5000-person event.
Lots of wonderful people put huge amounts of time and energy into The Green Gathering, all year round in the planning and then in a tremendous burst of creative energy on site. Some people provide expertise and kit and get paid for that, generally at well below the going market rate. Many others volunteer, for the fun of it and because we know that every year, people's eyes are opened and lives transformed by this very special event. The Green Gathering is not run to make a profit; if the event makes a surplus, we've pledged to put that into the Green Gathering Charity, which has an 'education for sustainability' remit. To be honest, we're a way off making a surplus.Which is why I'm asking you to help us, and contribute to this crowdfund.
WHAT YOU GETAs well as knowing that your poo is going to a good home, you get perks!Thankyous and mugs and programmes and cider... all this can be yours :)WHAT IF WE DON'T MAKE THE TARGET?

<p>Drakes
Bay Oyster Farm is a historic family farm located in Point Reyes National
Seashore, about an hour north of San Francisco, California. The oyster farm has
been in operation for over 80 years. The current owners are the Lunnys, a
fourth-generation ranching family in Point Reyes, where they also raise
grass-fed and organic beef.</p>
<p>The
Lunnys purchased this historic oyster farm to revive a part of the community
and ensure the health of the estero. The oyster farm provides local jobs and a
sustainable food product that supports local businesses and comprises almost
<b>40% of California’s shellfish production</b>. The Lunny family’s stewardship of the
oyster farm has resulted in award-winning oysters, and has protected the
pristine waters of Drakes Estero and its abundant wildlife. The seals in Drakes Estero <a href=""http://savedrakesbay.com/core/2013/11/30/2013-harbor-seal-report-shows-park-service-claims-are-false/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">have never been more plentiful</a>.<br/></p>
<p>In
November 2012, the National Park Service issued a decision that would shut down
the business. The oyster farm is contesting that decision, and the case
is being appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Lunnys have won a
stay to remain in business while they petition for that hearing.</p>
<p>We
need funding to increase awareness of the injustice of this decision. Visible public support is crucial to our cause. As a start, we’ve created a <a href=""http://savedrakesbay.com/core/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>
as a central information resource, and we need to maintain and expand the site, ramp up our online presence, and increase our outreach. </p><p>Telling our story is particularly important in the face of the misinformation being spread by those who want to see the oyster farm shut down. The Park Service and its allies are actively misrepresenting the facts about our farming practices, about the legal and historical issues involved, and about the science of oyster farming. We need funding to successfully counter this misinformation. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>HELP THESE SKILLED WORKERS KEEP THEIR JOBS</b></p>

<p>The Lunnys
are one of the ranching and farming families in West Marin that keep this
beautiful land connected to its agrarian past and are creating a sustainable
future. The Lunny family began dairy ranching in Point Reyes in 1946 and is
known for its agricultural innovation.</p>
<p>The
Lunny ranch created the first certified organic and certified grass-fed beef
herd in Marin County, and was the first beef ranch in California to be
certified Salmon Safe for the management of its riparian areas, pastures, and
manure. The Lunnys received an Excellence in Rangeland Management award from
the Society of Rangeland Management in 2009, and were the first beef ranch in
California to receive the Animal Welfare Approved seal for humane treatment of
animals.</p>
<p>In
late 2004, the Lunnys purchased the historic oyster farm in Drakes Estero from
the Johnson family, its previous owners since 1957. The farm dates to the
1930s. The Lunnys named it Drakes Bay Oyster Company, its original name.</p>
<p>The
Lunnys are known as careful stewards of the land and water, not only through
their own sound farming practices but also with their philanthropic contributions
to conservation; donated Lunny oyster shells support both the <a href=""http://www.sfbbo.org/science/water_projects.php?proj=snpl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Snowy Plover habitat restoration efforts of the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory</a> and

Bay Oyster Farm uses environmentally friendly growing techniques, including an
off-bottom, Japanese-inspired, “hanging culture” method. Used by less than 5%
of U.S. oyster farmers, this method requires labor-intensive hand harvesting,
resulting in our uniquely flavored, ultra-clean oysters.</p>
<p><strong>3.
Unsurpassed Freshness:</strong>Drakes
Bay Oysters are grown in the pristine waters of Drakes Estero in Marin County.
Because they are harvested, shucked, and packed daily, these award-winning
oysters have no equal in freshness.</p>
<p><strong>4.
Exceptional Water Quality:</strong>Drakes
Bay is the only shellfish farm within the Point Reyes National Seashore.
Protected by a small, undeveloped watershed, our farm contains California’s
finest shellfish water quality—that’s why we are the only farm in California
allowed to harvest year- round. The waters of Drakes Estero give our oysters
the “taste of their place”!</p>
<p><strong>5.
Historical Significance:</strong>Drakes
Bay Oyster Farm is home to California’s last operating oyster cannery, where we
have been shucking and packing our oysters on-farm for over 70 years. By
helping to save Drakes Bay Oyster Farm, you are helping to preserve a precious
piece of California’s history.</p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>OYSTER FUN FACTS<br/></strong></p>
<p><b>1. 
Oyster farming is 17 times as productive as ranching</b> (in terms of protein per acre). Oyster farming is incredibly efficient,
requiring no feed, no fertilizers, no chemicals, no cultivation, and no
consumption of fresh water. Drakes Bay Oyster Farm produces 500,000 lbs of
shucked oyster meat each year on less than 150 acres of water bottom. It is
estimated that it would take more than 30,000 acres of pasture to produce the
equivalent amount of protein on a grass-based beef operation.  It takes
roughly 12,000 gallons of fresh water to produce one pound of feedlot beef.</p>
<p><b>2. 
Oysters are nature’s best source of the mineral zinc</b>, with
up to 100mg per gram (second on the list is ginger root at 7mg per gram). Zinc
is good for your skin, good for your immune system, and speeds up healing after
an injury.</p>
<p><b>3. 
All oysters are capable of creating pearls,</b> but pearls from edible oysters have no market value. The pearls used in jewelry are from the Feathered Oyster in the Pteriidae family. Over the
years, the workers in the Drakes Bay Oyster cannery have found quite a few
small pearls. Ask to see them when you visit the oyster farm!</p>
<p><b>4.
Oysters taste like the place they are grown.</b> Just as the same grapes grown in different places have site-specific
flavors called “terroir,” the same oysters grown in different places have
site-specific flavors, sometimes called “merroir.” The salinity of the water in
which they are grown and the specific nature of what the oysters eat contribute
to their flavor.  Oyster author Rowan Jacobson has a fun oyster guide at
his website:  What Kind of Oyster Eater Are You?  According to this
guide, Drakes Bay Oysters appeal to “The Clean Freak:  You prefer filter
feeders from pristine waters.” <a href=""http://www.oysterguide.com/book/what-kind-of-oyster-eater-are-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out the guide</a> to learn about the handful of other oysters grown in equally pristine
places—two of which are in Canadian national parks (Raspberry Points in Prince
Edward Island National Park and Imperial Eagle Channels in Pacific Rim National
Park).</p>
<p><b>5. 
Oysters clean the water; for this reason oyster restoration efforts are under
way.</b> Oysters
help waterways by eating algae, filtering out particulates and excess
nutrients, and creating habitat for other organisms to thrive. One oyster can
filter more than 50 gallons of water in 24 hours. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is actively promoting oyster restoration,
including <a href=""http://chesapeakebay.noaa.gov/oysters/oyster-restoration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">restoring native oysters</a> in the

Drakes
Bay Oyster Farm is a historic family farm located in Point Reyes National
Seashore, about an hour north of San Francisco, California. The oyster farm has
been in operation for over 80 years. The current owners are the Lunnys, a
fourth-generation ranching family in Point Reyes, where they also raise
grass-fed and organic beef.
The
Lunnys purchased this historic oyster farm to revive a part of the community
and ensure the health of the estero. The oyster farm provides local jobs and a
sustainable food product that supports local businesses and comprises almost
40% of California’s shellfish production. The Lunny family’s stewardship of the
oyster farm has resulted in award-winning oysters, and has protected the
pristine waters of Drakes Estero and its abundant wildlife. The seals in Drakes Estero have never been more plentiful.
In
November 2012, the National Park Service issued a decision that would shut down
the business. The oyster farm is contesting that decision, and the case
is being appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Lunnys have won a
stay to remain in business while they petition for that hearing.
We
need funding to increase awareness of the injustice of this decision. Visible public support is crucial to our cause. As a start, we’ve created a website
as a central information resource, and we need to maintain and expand the site, ramp up our online presence, and increase our outreach. Telling our story is particularly important in the face of the misinformation being spread by those who want to see the oyster farm shut down. The Park Service and its allies are actively misrepresenting the facts about our farming practices, about the legal and historical issues involved, and about the science of oyster farming. We need funding to successfully counter this misinformation. HELP THESE SKILLED WORKERS KEEP THEIR JOBS
Pictured Above: Isela Meza, our staff marine biologist, oversees the handling of microscopic oyster larvae, ensuring that they set and begin to grow properly at the beginning of the oyster-planting process. The photo above shows Isela with a baby oyster in the hatchery.Drakes Bay Oyster Farm employs 30 full-time workers and provides housing for some of them. Many of these employees have worked at the oyster farm for decades.The
historic oyster farm has traditionally been a source of work for the wives of
the ranch hands working in this agrarian community, and that continues to this
day. To learn more about these wonderful workers, please visit our Meet the Oyster Workers page on our advocacy site.

</div></div>","Your Impact - Every $1 You Donate Distributes $15-$25 Worth of Supplies



$25 ships one wheelchair from Minnesota to be donated to someone in Bolivia and will make a huge difference in their life. (Check out pictures of a recent distribution of wheelchairs in Bolivia HERE.)


$100 sends 2 large boxes (roughly $1,820 worth) of donated medical, school, and construction supplies from Minnesota to Bolivia, where they are distributed to Mano a Mano projects throughout the country.


$20,000 sponsors an entire container shipment of donated surplus supplies worth $300,000-$500,000 from the US to Bolivia - every dollar you give allows us to ship and distribute $15-$25 worth of supplies ($18 shipped per dollar donated has been the average value in recent shipments).




Why Your Donation Is So Important
Your donation helps reduce waste in the US and improve thousands of lives in Bolivia. We have the people and infrastructure in place to collect, ship, and distribute these supplies; what we need is YOUR HELP to help pay for the shipping costs.

Distributes Supplies to Mano a Mano's Network of Clinics and Other Projects in Rural Bolivia


Saving medical, education, and construction supplies from being thrown away in the US, your financial support allows us to ship these supplies to Bolivia where they can be put to good use. Upon their arrival these items are distributed to Mano a Mano's clinics, schools, and other infrastructure projects to provide quality healthcare and services that save lives. 
Distributes Supplies to other Bolivian Organizations and Individuals, Free-of-Charge
We also distribute a significant portion of supplies to other organizations (hospitals, nonprofits, jails) and individuals throughout Bolivia, free-of-charge.
We feel strongly that in order for the supplies we send to reach those people most in need - impoverished Bolivians, primary care clinics and organizations working in small rural communities - we cannot charge these organizations. They simply have no way to pay for these supplies; which is why we need your help. Your donation ensures that those in need have access to the supplies that they desperately need but cannot afford.
Stretches Funding to Have a Bigger Impact
Every item that we are able to ship means one less thing we have to buy or make in Bolivia, allowing us to stretch our funding, complete more projects, and improve more lives. It also reduces domestic waste by preventing thousands of pounds of supplies from being discarded in US landfills.  
Our Goal
Our goal is to ship two 40-foot containers of supplies, valued at a combined $600,000-$1,000,000, with each container costing $20,000 to ship. 
Help us reach this goal and have a hand in the lifesaving work of Mano a Mano!

Our Story
 Mano a Mano works with Bolivian communities to create sustainable infrastructure projects that improve health and increase economic well-being. 
In 1994 Mano a Mano was started with the goal of saving medical supplies in the US that were destined for the landfill and sending them to Bolivia, where co-founders Joan and Segundo Velasquez - and their friends and family in the US and Bolivia - knew they could be put to use and save lives. 
Twenty years later, with the help of hundreds of amazing volunteers and donors like YOU, Mano a Mano has shipped over 3.5 million pounds of supplies to Bolivia—supporting the hundreds of projects we have completed, including clinics, schools, roads, water projects, and providing emergency air rescues. 


Equipping Mano a Mano's Network of Clinics with SuppliesEnsuring that our network of clinics is well-supplied is extremely important. Without a consistent flow of medical supplies, it is impossible to provide adequate patient care. While the cost of shipping may sound high, many of the supplies we send to Bolivia are either of a higher quality than what is available or cannot even be purchased in Bolivia—making their shipment a necessity. It is this consistent flow of supplies (as part of of our ongoing clinic support) which has allowed 100% of our clinics to remain open to this day and provide high-quality care to rural Bolivians.
Shipping School Supplies
Additionally we send school supplies, which are in desperate need. 
In many communities, each student only has one notebook; when they fill it up they go back to the beginning and erase the pages to be able to reuse the notebook over and over. The donation of something as basic as a few pens & pencils and a notebook to each child in a classroom can be an extremely exciting gift. 




Shipping Construction Supplies, Office Furniture, and Other Needed Items
We also ship construction supplies, office furniture, and many other items that help support Mano a Mano's varied programs throughout Bolivia. 



    

Every Item Shipped is Put to UseEvery single item we ship to Bolivia is put to use and stretched as far as possible; our staff cut squares of gauze into quarters, unsterile supplies are used for training in their continuing health education workshops, and pieces of fabric are sewn together to make sheets and curtains. What Happens if We Raise More than Our Goal?Mano a Mano always has a huge backlog for all of our projects - including shipping supplies - and we are only limited by funding. 
Any additional money raised from this campaign would go towards another shipment of supplies later on this year, once we have enough money raised for our next shipment.What Happens if We Don't Meet Our Goal?All money raised through this campaign will go towards our next shipment; each container costs $20,000, so if we get near half of our goal then we can ship one container. If we raise less, then we have a base of funding in place for a shipment and will just have to wait a little longer to ship.We always have a lot of fundraising projects going on that can supplement what we raise on this Indiegogo campaign. Bottom line - your financial support during this campaign WILL help make a shipment possible!Perks

At the $50+ level get the opportunity to be present during a supply shipment and pack your own box of surplus supplies at our St. Paul, MN warehouse!

At the $100+ level receive a Nino a Nino Bolivian Coffee Package. 
All contributions are TAX-DEDUCTIBLE and contributors will receive a 501(c)(3) receipt upon completion of the campaign. 
All perks ship FREE-OF-CHARGE within the U.S. ONLY. All perks will ship out upon completion of the campaign.

To fund my one month expedition I have purchased a number of pieces of equipment using my savings, these include a life jacket, a portable solar panel and a number of other small items. I still have a further £150 saved of my own money and I require a boost of £1470 from the Indiegogo community. Costs will go principally towards chartering of a small canal boat, supplies and further equipment. My expenditure is as follows:

One month charter of a canal boat: This will be my main expenditure for the expedition and will be the focus of the funding, I have researched the costs and I have budgeted £800-1000 for the chartering of a small boat for one months travel and associated costs such as the fuel and insurance.
From my savings I have purchased the inflatable kayak in figure 3 below which I will take with me on board the canal boat. This kayak will allow me to get closer to wildlife to photograph and identify species when exploring.

A months supplies: I require approximately £5 a day for food which for a month’s travel I have budgeted £150. For safe drinking water in emergencies I will purchase a Lifesaver filtration water purifier bottle at £120.
Equipment: I have purchased most of the equipment I require for the trip, the one main item I still require is a waterproof action camera for photographing and filming under water and some waders for entering the water. I've budgeted £200 for this. 

Train Tickets: With my remaining £150 savings I'm going to purchase the return train tickets from Sussex to Norfolk and back. 
Perks 
All my recorded data will be freely available to access via the Ispot website so you can keep up with the species I have uploaded and identified. In supporting me to make this expedition, I will also bring you into the field through my photos and videos which I will be uploading onto youtube via my phone. For making a contribution there is also a series of perks in the form of clothing printed with ""I funded Toms expedition"" which I will send you once the campaign closes.
I would appreciate if you could help spread the word about my campaign. Share this link with your friends, families and networks! Feel free to contact me and ask any question you’d like about my canal biodiversity expedition and my goals.
Best Wishes
